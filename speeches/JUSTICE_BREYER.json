  "And while this suit is being brought, we can't do the simple thing, which is to take a case from an indigent who's raising it that we happen to have on our docket and face it directly because everybody is tied up in these knots on standing. I mean, what -­ what is it that -- that you -- led you to bring this case rather than just filing an amicus brief in a case brought by a real indigent who wants a lawyer?",
  "I see -- I see that. That's a good answer. And the -- the question I have is if I now, since we have real indigents, believe that there absolutely is a way for a real indigent to raise this claim that isn't even hard, you could file an amicus brief. Suppose I believed that, and I do believe it actually. If I believe it, then does your third party standing claim disappear?",
  "All right. Now, if it doesn't disappear and I hold in your favor, would I then be opening the door to any lawyer whose pocketbook is hurt by tort reform, by any change at all, you know, that means less money for him, and we'd be besieged with people? Instead of the clients, we'd have all the lawyers in complaining that they want to be richer. Now, that's what's worrying me. So on my assumption, how could I possibly decide in your favor without opening that door?",
  "That's the question I'd like answered.",
  "Because?",
  "No, no. I assumed there's --",
  "No. I'm sorry. I -- I -­ Justice Scalia and I were assuming the same thing. If I assume that there's no problem with the real person, the indigent, raising the claim himself -- and I'm saying on that assumption, which I believe, then if I were to decide in your favor, how would I not be opening the door that I wanted to keep firmly closed?",
  "Oh, okay. No. I agree with you. If in fact you think that there's a problem about a real indigent bringing a claim in Michigan, although we have two on the docket, if I accepted that premise, I would begin to think you were right. So then what I was trying to explore is whether the whole thing comes down to whether I accept that premise. And of course, that's what's everybody has been talking about, and I do see at the moment a couple of very good ways that indigents can bring it themselves, and indeed they have.",
  "But everything comes down to that. Right?",
  "I think I agree with you on that. I'm just -- the reason I think it's so easy is because we get indigents. We get thousands of them. And all you have to have is some indigent saying, hey, I want a lawyer. Okay? That's all. He has to be able to write those words. And at that point, you and the others come in with amicus briefs, if necessary, and support him.",
  "I've listed four categories of things that you think would be very difficult to prove to a jury at the trial, but not to a judge at sentencing. The first is the vast amount of information now and prior to guidelines that were contained in the presentence report. That information, most of which was used since history was begun, maybe a hundred years ago, is simply not available until the trial is over. The second happens to be the things that the Chief brought up, matters committed at trial, such as perjury. The third sort of thing are those things that just get too complicated when you try to list 15 in indictment, such as victim -- put them all together -- victim, brandishing the gun, et cetera. And the fourth kind of thing are the things that are too difficult to explain to a jury. Try explaining even \"brandishing\" to a jury, and if you can do that one, which may be easy, try the multiple-count rules. All right. So I have those four things. Now, are there others?",
  "All right, if I believe that that is just out of the question, it's so complicated, nobody could do it, it would be a radical change, Congress could never have intended that, what about a much simpler approach? What you would do is take 3553(b), and you say, \"Read the word 'shall' -- i.e. 'shall apply the guidelines' -- to 'may,'\" so that the guidelines become advisory, either because the \"shall\" becomes a \"may\" or because you give each judge the power to give any reasonable reason at all as to why the Commission's guideline, they didn't actively consider this factor. In other words, read 3553(b) as permissive. And now, assuming I've expressed myself on the underlying Apprendi questions, so I, but suppose Blakely does apply, would you -- is -­ what would be wrong with taking that approach?",
  "All right, I have thought of one thing that might be wrong.",
  "So I'll ask you about it, if you want.",
  "All right, well, I -- you see nothing wrong with that. That makes the guidelines advisory, and there are a number of objections -- maybe not, maybe big, maybe small. One objection I was worried about is -- I'm giving you my thought process, you know, and I -- because I'm trying to get a -- your response -- is that if we did take that approach, you'd leave the appellate section in place. That means every time the judge didn't use the guideline, the appeals courts would have to review for reasonableness. Now that would be in place. We would discover judges all over the country having different views on that. Courts of appeals would have different views about was or what was not reasonable. We would be here to review those differences, and we would become the sentencing commission. I thought I had escaped.",
  "Now, how, how serious an objection is that? Or do you recommend that, if you lose on this point, we take the approach of, in that way, making the guidelines advisory?",
  "Well, there are lots. There are lots, actually. If you -- if -- I ask, \"Is it right, that?\"",
  "But, I mean, if you take common law to mean England, as well as the United States, there weren't here, because the sentences weren't appealable, but in England, they were appealable, and they had a common law work out of what they called the \"tariff,\" which is what the range of reasonableness was or wasn't. And the prosecution, I believe, could appeal it of being too low; and the defense, being too high. And the question was, Was the sentence reasonable? The appellate court could set it. Now, if we had a system like that -- and this is my serious question -- is it unconstitutional under Apprendi if appeals court judges reviewing a sentence could say, \"This is the range of reason, this is arbitrary up here, or this is arbitrary down there\"?",
  "Suppose that the judge had simply sentenced the defendant, let's say, to ten years, but looked at these other crimes and said, \"In my practice, I go to 15.\" All right? That's the basic situation. Is that unconstitutional?",
  "No, no, there are no guidelines.",
  "All right. Now suppose the people who do exactly the same thing is the Court of Appeals applying the word \"reasonable,\" these officials of the judicial branch. See, they're reviewing the sentence for reasonableness. They say, \"In our practice when a person commits bank robbery, if it's just an ordinary case, we think it's reasonable five years; but if he has a gun, seven years.\" So if there's no gun, five years is the most that isn't arbitrary. But if there's a gun, you can go to seven years. In other words, an English-type tariff system. Is that unconstitutional?",
  "You would think it would be. So -­",
  "-- now suppose the people who do it are the parole commission -- as happen to be in the United States, executive branch officials. For the last hundred years, they get sentences, for example, that were indeterminate, or might have been for 30 years. And what they say, \"It is our practice, assuming good behavior, that if it was just an ordinary bank robbery we'll keep him in for five years, but if he had a gun, he's going to stay in for seven.\" Is that unconstitutional?",
  "No, what they have is an indeterminate sentence.",
  "California.",
  "And what they say is, \"In our practice, what we do is, we think it's reasonable, and we will keep a person in prison for five years in an ordinary bank robbery, but for seven years if he has a gun.\" I'm asking if that's constitutional. Because that's the practice that they follow under parole commission guidelines, and they've done it now for a decade, I make up.",
  "That's constitutional.",
  "What I'm trying to drive at -- and I'll be -- is that I can't imagine a court holding that a parole commission in the executive branch that has exactly this same system would be behaving unconstitutionally. It's difficult for me to imagine -- though you say I'm wrong on that -- a court holding it's unconstitutional when a court of appeals does the same thing reviewing for arbitrariness.",
  "You know, I -­",
  "I'm not phrasing the question well. I'm trying to imagine sentencing guidelines run by a parole commission, executive branch officials. I'm trying to imagine sentencing guidelines run under the word arbitrary by ordinary courts of appeals panels reviewing the sentences. And if those are both constitutional, then, I would ask, why is it unconstitutional to put the executive branch and judicial branch officials together in one group called the sentencing commission?",
  "I understand that. And ­ - well, maybe I'm just not going to get my question across. I am trying to imagine Apprendi. Would Apprendi apply to parole commission guidelines? I should think the answer, unless we're going to reverse a hundred years of history, is no. Would Apprendi apply to a court of appeals panel with the power to review sentences for arbitrariness?",
  "I would think the answer is no. And, therefore, I wonder why it applies if we take judicial officials and executive branch officials, and they do exactly the same thing under the heading Sentencing Commission.",
  "Look, we're trying to go to the same point, and I think you're actually given me a pretty good answer. The --",
  "I'm imagining my system being the system that Apprendi forbids. So I'm not doing increase/decreases. I'll think of the very kind of system. And I take it your answer is this -- and remember, I dissented in Apprendi.",
  "I didn't agree with it. Right. But there we are. And so I'm trying to see how far it goes. So I wonder, we take our Apprendi system and now it's being administered by a parole commission. We take our Apprendi system, and now it's being administered by a court of appeals using the legal standard arbitrariness. And I take it your answer is those are just as unconstitutional.",
  "Now you understand what I'm doing, because I'm saying you either have to follow the force of your logic and make those unconstitutional, too, or you have to say there's a difference. And, by definition, the only difference is who promulgated it. And then, of course, I'm going to ask you, if there's a difference right there, why doesn't this one, which is executive plus judicial, fall on my side of the difference?",
  "No, I -- in my imaginary parole commission --",
  "-- I will argue a different point.",
  "I mean, I will argue it another time. I've seen a lot of parole commission guidelines, and I would say they, a lot of them did fall within the Apprendi boundaries. But if we did take it and have the parole commission do it -- \"it,\" being the Apprendi forbidden system, in your view, is it unconstitutional?",
  "All right. Okay.",
  "And then the same thing is true of a -- of a court of appeals panel.",
  "It does exist under the guidelines? How does it?",
  "How?",
  "No, only, only, only if you have statutes that have mandatory minimums or that have lesser sentences. That's true.",
  "But compared to the status quo, if you have the guidelines alone, one of their basic objectives was to prevent that kind of manipulation. And, by and large, I thought they had succeeded on that point.",
  "Is that lawful under the guideline? Is the judge required to accept the facts as the -- as the prosecution and defense agree to present them?",
  "No.",
  "What is your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question? And I'd appreciate your focusing on what I thought were the two most important ones, which is, first, the -- I thought that sentencing for a hundred years had gone on primarily on the basis of the presentence report. And the idea was, the person is convicted and now we're going to decide what to do with this individual who's convicted, and we're going to read what the probation officer writes about it, and he'll go interview people after, as he does. And many, many, many, if not most, of the facts in that presentence report were not available at the time of trial. They're about the history of the individual, and they're more about the manner in which the crime was carried out. And the other main thing is the -- is the vast number of really complex operations, multiple-count rules, relevant conduct, all kinds of things that -- try even \"brandishing.\" I mean, that's the second thing, the complexity. So the presentence report -­",
  "-- and the complexity.",
  "Congress's basic -- that's a good answer. Congress's basic objective here is -- was uniformity. I think it was a noble objective, whether or not it's been achieved or, but are you saying to Congress, Sorry, the Constitution prohibits you, in Congress, from trying to create uniformity, or greater uniformity, of sentencing among district judges? There's just no way you can do it, because if you throw everything to a jury, you know, you throw it right into the hands of the prosecutor to determine what to charge, what not to charge, what facts to agree upon, et cetera, no way to do it? We're back to our two cellmates -- one day served, 50 years served -- though the real conduct was the same.",
  "As long as you're on the subject, I'm quite --- you're going to --- what is your reaction to what I've written, which you've, you're just going to say wrong, wrong, wrong, but I want to know why. And what I know why in particular is I speculated somewhat, that the reason that this might work, your side of it, if it works despite the, the complication, the bifurcated trials, etc., is that 97 percent of the cases are handled through plea bargaining, and this will give you a little bit of a leg up, which I speculated the defense bar likes. I'm not surprised. But then, I thought with in the long run, you just can't have a system of justice that depends for its workable nature upon plea bargaining, which in fact depends on the weapons you give to prosecutors. And so I ended up thinking, I just can't underwrite such a thing. And I'd like to get your, your, your reaction to that.",
  "So can I ask you the same question? Imagine that the statute says bank robbery is zero to twenty years. Case one, a separate statute says a guideline commission will make distinctions, and the guideline commission says, \"five years in the ordinary case, seven years with a gun.\" Case two, the same thing but a parole commission does it. Case three, the same thing, but a court of appeals panel does it, under the guise of what's arbitrary, what isn't. They're all, in your opinion, to be treated alike.",
  "Well, there is just what I said, just what I said.",
  "Okay.",
  "But the idea is that this works because most cases are plea bargained.",
  "So what you'll do if you're right, is all you would say is any time that the prosecutor wants to say that you committed the bank robbery or you committed the drug offense with more than a minimal amount of money or more than a minimal amount of drug, or there were guns, they get into a bargain, and they end up with a sentence once they bargain -- if that's the sentence, because they're not even going to contest it before the judge, both sides will come in and agree. But in those few cases where they do contest it, you would have to have the jury find the facts.",
  "Now, the only reason that I find it disturbing is to think that Congress could have wanted such a system is given other developments in Congress, mandatory minimums and all kinds of things, that seems to me to be a system that would really, might make non­ uniformity in reality, worse than it was before 1986. See, I mean, my goodness, every prosecutor's going to be doing something different, every defense attorney; everything will depend upon the bargains. The judges when they come in will think different things. I mean -­",
  "Should we uphold something like that in the face of a Congress that wanted uniformity?",
  "Did you find out anything in your research on this where anybody in the -­ this discussion on the guidelines began, I think, in the early 70's, it's been around for 30 years. The guidelines have been law for 17 years, and until recently with Apprendi, is there a history of anything being written on the guidelines being unconstitutional for the Sixth Amendment reason? Did any group of judges, or defense attorneys, or academics or anybody write anything that we could look at until quite recently in which they thought this was a possibility?",
  "Yeah, before we began with Apprendi? .",
  "Nothing.",
  "No. The question was what about the -­",
  "So is it right then that -­ let's imagine the special river master's name is Mr. Smith, and unlike me, he knows about this stuff. And he then -- you -- Kansas wants Mr. Smith to decide a certain number of issues. Call them issues on page 1, whatever they are. And as far as you're concerned, your client would say I'm happy to have Mr. Smith. Just don't call him a river master. Call him an arbitrator. So you're saying that when Kansas says they would do it except there's a problem of getting unanimity, you say the only problem is that you won't agree.",
  "Now, they're the obstacle to unanimity. So the keys are in their own pocket if they want Mr. Smith. That's your view.",
  "And -- and in that forum, you will agree to binding arbitration.",
  "Is that -- I'm -- and I'm mixed up. I thought that the issue is whether you, on your side, have to present evidence of no confusion.",
  "So as far as -­",
  "So as far as Justice O'Connor's question is concerned, I thought your answer would be, if they want to go and present evidence that there is confusion, to the point where it's so obviously unfair, it's ridiculous, they can do it. I mean, do you object to that?",
  "No. So your answer to her question is, of course it could be relevant. Let the other side come in and show that it's relevant. You don't have to show that there is no confusion.",
  "That's where we are, is that right?",
  "Okay.",
  "Now, I'm confused. I thought the question you're supposed to answer, which is in the blue brief, is whether they have to show an absence of confusion. And I guess now you agree the answer to that question is \"no.\" Is that right, you agree with that?",
  "Now, that's the end of this case, isn't it? That's what we took it to decide, and that's -- you agree with it and they agree with it, so everybody's happy. We don't even have to write an opinion, we can just--",
  "Now, suppose you establish it, maybe we can find some differences here, would you also agree that simply establishing confusion is not enough to overcome the fair-use defense, you'd have to also show that the confusion, along with possibly other things are such that it shows unfairness, or what's the other word, unfairness, or lack of good faith?",
  "You agree with that, or not?",
  "Good, so now we have something I can disagree with you about. Now, the question would be, why, it's the words are unfair, why, if you just show there's some confusion, which normally there would be, or quite often there would be, why is that enough to overcome their defense that they put here?",
  "All right, so now, if we're going to go back into what the Court did, I would say that I was a little disturbed reading this as to why you get protection at all, because I was thinking \"micro color,\" well, that describes very well what it is, it's a tiny, teeny, weenie, weenie bit of color. And when I think of \"micro pigment,\" I think of a farm animal, I think -- I don't know what I think, it's confusing me. So, for an average person, the word \"micro color,\" I thought, \"Gee, that's very descriptive of just what it is, a teeny weenie bit of color.\"",
  "But suppose IBM had used the word \"computers\" when they were the only company for ten or fifteen years to mark their product. Now, another company comes along and they produce the same thing, they want to use the word \"computer.\" You're saying that that would be the end of it, they couldn't do it?",
  "People would be confused. For a while they'll think that \"computer\" refers to IBM, there would be confusion, but it's the best word to describe the product, in fact, at least a very good one.",
  "Well, at the very beginning, IBM was the only one to do it, they didn't have to call it computer, they could have called it a word processor, they could have called it a \"think faster.\" I don't know what they could have called it, but I mean, you know, they chose the word computer.",
  "So what is this fair-use defense for, since you're normally going to show confusion to show the infringement, what's it for, in your opinion?",
  "I also -- it's very efficient to allow people to communicate, in English.",
  "Well, I guess that's the question, because sometimes people -- I have no doubt -",
  "Is there -- is there any on -­ on that? Is there any indication? I mean, I've never seen any either way, to tell you the truth, but -- that Madison or Jefferson or whoever, when they were writing the Constitution, would have thought what happened elsewhere, let's say, in Britain or in the British -- they were a British colony. They did think Blackstone was relevant. Did any -- that they would have thought it was totally irrelevant what happened elsewhere in the world to the word unusual. Is there any indication in any debate or any of the ratification conventions?",
  "So if Lincoln --",
  "-- Abraham Lincoln used to study Blackstone and I think he thought that the Founding Fathers studied Blackstone, and all that happened in England was relevant, is there some special reason why what happens abroad would not be relevant here? Relevant.",
  "I'm not saying controlling.",
  "Absolutely, and they, I guess, were looking at English practices, and would they have thought it was wrong to look abroad as a relevant feature?",
  "Before you go off on this, the one statistic that interested me -- and I'd like you to discuss its relevance really -- is if we look back 10 years, I have only three States executing a juvenile: Texas, 11; Virginia, 3; and Oklahoma, 2.",
  "And those three States account for about 11 percent of the population of the country, 11.3 percent. Now, if we go back a few more years to Stanford, we get three others in there: Louisiana, 1; Georgia, 1; and Missouri, 1.",
  "We have a very different number.",
  "So the reason that I thought arguably it's more relevant to look at the convictions is there are a lot of States. Say, New Hampshire, I think, for example -- when I was in the First Circuit, there were several States that on the books permitted the death penalty, but nobody ever had ever been executed. And -­ and that's true across the country. There are a number of States like that. So if we look at the States that actually execute people, it's 10 years, say, 11 percent of the population are in such States. You go back 15 years, and you get these three other States, which raises the percentage. How -- how should I understand that? I'm interested in both sides -­",
  "So that -- that's -- that last point was what I thought the scientific evidence was getting at, that it simply confirmed what common sense suggests, that when you execute a person 15 or sometimes 20 years later, a problem always is that that person isn't the same person who committed the trial in a meaningful sense. And it's specially true of 16- and 17­ year-olds who, observation would suggest, have a lot of changing to do because their personality is not fully formed. Now, I thought that the -- the scientific evidence simply corroborated something that every parent already knows, and if it's more than that, I would like to know what more.",
  "So are you -- are you arguing now that -- that (5)(A) -- (d)(5)(A), is the statute under which you are detaining him and that 1231(a)(6) has nothing to do with the case?",
  "So -- so you're arguing -- then you are. You're saying -- this is coming to me a little bit anew. I perhaps didn't read it carefully enough. But I thought -- let's assume you lose on 1231(a)(6), that I can't think of a way. Let's assume that I can't think of a way of applying the same words to your alien to mean something different than were applied to the alien who was in Zadvydas. Suppose you lose on that point. Now you're saying, well, independently of that, we have a different statute under which we can detain him, namely 1182(d)(5)(A). Is that -­",
  "Now -- now is that argument -­ I mean, I'm sorry that I -­",
  "-- and that -- and so is that made in the courts below and everything that they're doing in the cases -­",
  "Where does it say -- I mean, the reason I guess I missed it is because when I looked at your table of contents and elsewhere in the brief, it seems phrased totally in terms of 1231(a)(6). That's the heading. Each argument seems to support that. And then on page -- you know, when you refer to this, I guess on page 26, you're talking in a section about what 1231 must be because of the structure of it. And then you refer to other provisions such as the one you're now mentioning. I just didn't pick up that it was a totally independent basis.",
  "All right, but where does it say that? I'd like to just glance at it even now. Where does it say that in your brief, that it's a totally independent basis?",
  "That's what I read and it was in a structure called the statutory and -- text and structure support the Secretary's detention authority, which is under a bigger heading saying the text, structure, and history of section 1231(a)(6) confirm the executive branch's authority.",
  "So perhaps I could be forgiven for not understanding -­",
  "That's true. That's true. Absolutely we did. And also, I'll assume for argument's sake that you're completely right on the constitutional point. That's just for argument's sake. But assume you are. So there's all kinds of constitutional difference. Still, I don't see how to read the statute one way for one group of people and another way for another. The statutory words in Zadvydas, the words that the Attorney General may detain this individual beyond the removal period, are read in Zadvydas to mean beyond the removal period -- may detain beyond the removal period means for a reasonable time, presumably 6 months, presumptively, related -- reasonable time related to the purpose of the statute which is to find a country willing to accept them. Okay? Now, I haven't found a single case of this Court where you interpret these complicated words one way for one and another way for another. My law clerk found a couple of cases, Communications Work v. Bett and Machinists v. Street, where in Bett particularly the Court strongly implies the contrary. It says you can't read words differently just because we interpreted in one -­ you know, one statute, they were interpreted in light of constitutional considerations, and now we have -- those constitutional considerations aren't here, but it's the same words. You have to apply it the same.",
  "Yes, yes. That's right.",
  "Well -- well, yes, but what -­ what -- we put in the presumptively 6 months, but we said in our view the statute, read in light of the Constitution's demands, limits an alien's post-removal period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about that alien's removal from the United States. It does not permit indefinite detention interpreting it to avoid constitutional threat. We include that once removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable, continued detention is no longer authorized by statute. Now, I don't know what those sentences are doing unless they're interpreting the words I mentioned. And then later in the opinion, we say it's presumptively -­",
  "-- not always, but presumptively 6 months.",
  "Well, it interpreted the statute as doing it. Now, that brings me back to the original question.",
  "A person who runs in illegally, a person who crosses the border illegally, say, from Mexico is entitled to these rights when you catch him.",
  "But you -- you -- I thought there was a reg of the INS.",
  "Am I not right?",
  "Tell me if I'm right.",
  "Can I say what it is?",
  "I thought there was a reg -- to be sure we're talking about the same thing -- where the INS has said that Zadvydas applies to individuals who run into the United States illegally from Mexico. Am I right about that?",
  "But still, is this another -­ could -- could we do this? I noticed that -- that your -­ the petition for cert in Benitez has two questions, both of which are about interpreting 1231(a)(6). The Government's petition, though not its brief -- the Government's petition in Crawford says the question presented is whether 1231(a)(6) in Zadvydas compelled a release. So this other -- this other matter is a totally -- seen as a totally separate ground. Perhaps the thing to do is we send it back, and if they want to raise it, they can raise it, and it would be up to the circuit to decide whether they had preserved it or not preserved it. Is that -- is that a sensible thing?",
  "And that's your view of -- of what 1182 means, and they're going to have a different view. If they want to argue their different view, they could do it in the Ninth Circuit. If they've waived it, they've waived it, and that's up to them, not up to us.",
  "Does the -- Congress has passed a special statute with respect to terrorism, hasn't it, where it does authorize detention of any of these people who are engaged in terrorism. Now, I don't know how that's defined. Is that defined to relieve in a way that's broad enough to relieve some of the problem?",
  "Anyway, it's a little drastic. I -- I guess that before this happens, Congress might enact a statute like the terrorist statute.",
  "But it -- it's interesting. In -- in just my -- for my -- my own information, then Congress did respond. And there were two areas in Zadvydas that, you know, didn't warn Congress off. One is the one we're talking about now. The other is terrorism. And Congress responded in the terrorism matter. Is that right? But they didn't do anything on the -­",
  "So -- so what is -- I see the First Circuit as trying to grapple with the very question you're raising, which is I think difficult.",
  "Of course, it seems to me fine, let section 3 apply. No problem so far with me. But that is so broadly stated that if you read it literally, my garage door is a boat or a vessel because, after all, it's capable of being used in navigation, if worst came to worst. And now you're trying to narrow it to get out of that absurd result. Well, so did the First Circuit. That's what they were trying to do, and you got caught up in it. But that's -- so -- so what -- that's why I think we're struggling with the words, and -- and perhaps practically -- if you mean by practically that it is not practically capable of navigation, even though it really is, if it just hasn't been used for navigation for a long, long time and has connections to the land like Jimmy's Harborside probably or -- or -­",
  "What?",
  "Yes, yes, or one like that. But is -- are those the words? Do we need some other words as well? We say practically capable but practically capable has a technical meaning here that it means if there's a close to permanent connection to the land, it doesn't apply?",
  "Yes.",
  "So could we say -- could we say that, as well, it must be unlike my garage door? A, it must be a -- a structure that normally would have a crew or that -- a significant amount of the time. We would have a connection to the water. It would be capable of having a master or crew. What about that?",
  "Why -- why is this an easy case? Because, after all, the First Circuit is struggling with the same problem and they came to the conclusion, use section 3. That's fine. But you know that the garage door is not a vessel, and you also know that Jimmy's Harborside is not a vessel. And you also know that Justice Scalia's beached scow or something is not a vessel. And I take it nor is a vessel a scow that's tied up for 364 days of the year and acts as a picnic place and one day they take it out to sea and -- because they want to move it across the harbor. I guess that isn't a vessel. Is it? Or maybe it is. So why is this so easy? Because the First Circuit -­",
  "-- tries to make those distinctions.",
  "All right. Let's say it's wrong about that.",
  "Now let's take section 3.",
  "And taking section 3, it seems to me, we have the same problems.",
  "And I'd like to know your answer and you just said to Scalia what I thought -­ Justice Scalia that I thought what was an answer isn't because I thought that word practical, as co-counsel recommended, has a rather specialized meaning where we get rid of a lot of these. Now you're saying no, it doesn't.",
  "Your -- your view of the word in navigation does all the work here. And so a -- a concert ship, which exists, which say is docked at a dock for, let's say, 300 days of the year or maybe 360, and those other 5 days they -- they move it from one town to the next town where it stays for another 4 months, that is in navigation or not?",
  "All right. So then -­",
  "-- the concert master and the -- the -- all the orchestra players and everyone else are covered by the Jones Act even though, by the way, none of them has ever moved whatsoever.",
  "Well, if that's so, that's -­",
  "But now we have, in my concert ship, the concert master and the whole orchestra covered by the Jones Act even if none of them, by the way, has ever been even to sea on that day when -- they take the train.",
  "Because?",
  "Because?",
  "But it says -­",
  "-- in terms of both its duration and its nature, i.e., a connection to a vessel -­",
  "-- in navigation.",
  "Should we clarify that? Because I don't -- I didn't read the case saying what Justice Scalia just said or what you -- what it says is that a seaman must have a connection to a substantial -­ in terms of duration and nature connection to a vessel in navigation.",
  "Obviously, a croupier has such a connection.",
  "It doesn't say anything about being connected to the navigating part.",
  "So far.",
  "If -- if you go -- I thought vessel -- the word vessel appears in our cases. It doesn't appear in the Jones Act. Am I right or not about that?",
  "All right. So we have a degree of freedom on this. But -- but the -- the question then is, is it -- how -- I'm getting the impression from you and -- and from the SG that it's rather deeply embedded in the law, if we start reading the Fifth Circuit cases, that if we define X as a vessel, automatically it is a vessel in navigation, that the cases have said the word in navigation mean nothing, with one exception. The exception is if you actually have like a physical cemented connection to the land so they can't escape. Otherwise, if it's just tied up at a dock, even if it never goes to sea, those words, in navigation, have no meaning. If it's a vessel, it's a vessel in navigation. If it's my garage door, my garage door, which can float, is a vessel in navigation. Now, how accurate is that assumption I'm now making? What would I read in the law? Is that definition of in navigation as meaning virtually nothing really embedded in the law?",
  "I know it is but what is your view?",
  "Well, would it help? Suppose we were to say it was -- had to be capable, at least, of having a captain and crew?",
  "Then we better not do anything for the first time.",
  "I thought the class action distinction that the commissioner had was between opt in and opt out.",
  "So if you opt in, then you did exercise control. So all the money is yours. But if you opt out, you didn't have control over the suit because you didn't opt out. I mean, you just were lethargic.",
  "That's the basic thing. I mean, I'm trying to understand what the principle is for the reason that it's pretty hard for me to reconcile the commissioner's view in the class action case with the punitive damage case because there the person has control over the lawsuit. So why doesn't all the punitive damage, attorney's fees that come out of that, and so forth belong to -- in other words, it sounds to me, as I read this, something of a mess, and I'd like to know what the clear principle is.",
  "So you're -- you're -­",
  "But can -- can I ask you to go back for a minute? I guess the IRS -- you're seeing the lawsuit as the income-generating asset.",
  "And you're looking at the control of the plaintiff, for example, over the lawsuit as something that determines whether it's his income. And he, of course, can't give away his income. But on that theory, to go back to Justice O'Connor's original question, then the punitive damages also must be his income because he has equal control over them and they grow out of the income-producing asset. And that, of course, is what's bothering me because it seems to me that your theory, which is a well-established theory, coupled with a Congress that seems to be willing to take away deductions for expenses that lead to the income, could produce an income tax that in many cases, not just a few, exceeds the income that an individual has. And I would like to know what in the law is there to guard against that result.",
  "Is there any constitutional protection? The Sixteenth Amendment refers to an income tax, and perhaps that doesn't include a tax that grossly exceeds in many cases a person's income. That would be quite a far-out theory at the moment.",
  "But I -- that's why I ask you. Is there any protection in the law whatsoever? Or if Congress decides to tax a set of people who, let's see -­ say, earn $10,000 a year and because they're small business people, they happen to have $20,000 expenses. So it taxes them on $20,000, and the tax exceeds the income. There's no protection in your view against that result. And you just said, well, Congress decided to do it, it decided to do it.",
  "What about an assumption, for example, that when we read the code, we read it with a view towards thinking Congress did not want to produce such unfair results?",
  "And that isn't the question.",
  "The -- the problem is you're -- you're trying to get a theory in response to him that I think Justice Kennedy is asking about.",
  "And that theory, which is the problem for your side of the case -- that theory has all kinds of implications. I go out and I help the painter paint my office. We have a joint venture. I -- so there's no problem. I don't take it in -- you know, I get a -- this is great. And so that I think, if I'm right, was the thrust of Justice Kennedy's question.",
  "What's your third? I just don't want you to miss your third. You have the joint venture theory, an exception to an assignment in income, and you said you had a third.",
  "Well, if you took a settlement -- his theory, I take it, was seeing the lawsuit as a capital asset. Is that right?",
  "Well, then whenever you settled a lawsuit, it would be -- you'd have to pay capital gains instead of ordinary income.",
  "Like somebody stealing a check out of my mailbox from my employer. Right? Okay.",
  "So what is your theory, I mean, precisely? A, an assignment of income, what would otherwise count of A giving an assignment of income to B, and therefore still be A's income because the asset remains with A, the work, or whatever. Now, your theory is but not in the case that. Now fill in the blank for me.",
  "Precisely, please.",
  "Not in the case -- it is an assignment of income to B, but not in the case where the funds are not in -- when B -- when B get -- when B, the attorney, gets the funds, he controls them. What's -­ what do you mean? I don't get it.",
  "I want to know. You have three -- your problem on your side for me is that maybe all the equities are there, but I'd like to know the proposition of law that you want us to write in this opinion. And now we had three theories, and one, the one that you seem to be adopting, is this exception to the assignment of income doctrine. If that is what you're adopting, I'd like to know the precise form of words that create the exception. If that's not the theory you're adopting, I would like to know what the theory you're adopting is.",
  "But he did have control. He could have settled the lawsuit or not settled the lawsuit. He controlled when the income was generated, and moreover, he could have stopped it from being generated by settling the suit or dismissing it. Moreover, if he had not entered into this assignment of income, it would have been paid right into his bank account at the end. It sounds an awful lot like the Lucases or like the Horsts or whoever, Old Colony Trust. It sounds an awful lot like those cases.",
  "Your -- your -- you want to fill in the blank, in other words, and say where the assignment of income is such, such that B was in effect the person who really earned the income, unlike Mrs. Lucas' -- what Mr. Lucas' or maybe Mr. Earl -- I don't know -­",
  "-- husband -- the wife didn't earn the income.",
  "The husband did. So you want to say where the -- and then your answer, I guess -- don't say I'm right if I'm not right, please, because I'll just find out later.",
  "The -- the answer to the hypothetical about the agent and so forth is, well, so be it. If a person wants to go to the trouble of carving out some of his income and assigning that over to the agent, let him. Except for perhaps provisions of the code which we cannot now envisage -- I can't because I'm not an expert -- it doesn't matter since, after all, it would be deductible anyway. Is that -- is that what you're saying?",
  "Tell me if I'm wrong, please, on this.",
  "Okay, I see. You say double. Both the income is earned by the attorney, and at that stage the client does virtually nothing. So it's the reverse of the Earls or the Lucases where the husband was doing the work and the wife is getting the income. It would be as if the wife was doing all the work and the husband just sat there and clipped coupons or whatever.",

Of course, people's speech rights will be controlled and it won't hurt the rest of society. With racial discrimination, as you heard your opponents argue, it's a terrible symbol, a symbol that we would tolerate without the best of reasons discrimination, invidious discrimination, based on race, which is divisive to the whole society. Now, that they say is a very good reason for not applying the Turner standard but, rather, applying strict scrutiny, which gives you freedom to discriminate on this basis if you can prove you really have to.",

I'm not sure why it should rise above the level of consultation since you know, better than I, you can have some awfully difficult clients who are virtually incapable of understanding what's in their interests. And -- and that's why I'm awfully reluctant to go beyond saying you have to consult with your client. You start insisting on an answer, and you don't know what they're going to say.",
  "You put your finger on exactly what's the part of this case that's bothering me. Read through the language. As you read through the language, disparate impact does seem to be called for, and this particular provision, reasonable factors other than age, seems a defense to that, just as BFOQ is the defense to disparate treatment. And that all seems to work. But you read the definition of reasonable factor other than age to mean business necessity or even Justice O'Connor's opinion, which is pretty tough. It's hard for an employer to make that defense. And while making it hard to make that defense in the case of gender or race discrimination, in fact works in my opinion perfectly well. You start making it hard to make that defense here and you're going to have a nightmare because every effort by any employer to equalize to any degree pay or treatment of his or her employees is going to have a disparate impact in respect to age because the correlation with age runs into all kinds of things that it doesn't in the other cases. So I can't believe that Congress really would have wanted that, but the reason I can't believe it is because I can't believe the business necessity part of it. And so here I'm faced with a reg which, at one and the same time, pulls in disparate impact and business necessity, and now I don't know what to do.",
  "Easier -- easier is a matter of degree.",
  "And reasonable factor could be interpreted to say what the employer -- but the employer just doesn't like paying these executives so much money when these new younger janitors make so little. And so he says, I want to pay the new younger janitors more. Okay? There we've got it. Disparate impact.",
  "And now you say, what's the business necessity? And frankly, there wasn't one. It's just that I found it sort of bad. All right? So there we are. I've lost my case. Now, that's what is worrying me, and I thought perhaps this reg that seems to say -- and lower courts have accepted that I would lose my case -- that this reg is outside Congress' -- the agency's authority for that reason because Congress couldn't have intended that result.",
  "-- suppose I want -­",
  "Here you're saying you're not attacking reasonable factor other than age. It has to be based on reasonable factor other than age. And I take it here you're saying it's not based on what they advance as reasonable factors.",
  "Is that right?",
  "But if I -- I say my explanation for why I pay the newer people more is really I like to have that atmosphere. You make less money in my business, but it's more democratic and people are happier even though no one will invest in my company.",
  "But still, I'd like a commune. All right? That's how I want to do it. Now, that's not totally idiotic. It's plausible. So I just win. Right?",
  "Ah, I lose a treatment case. No, no. I'm not -- I'm just -- it's I'm not paying the younger workers more. I'm paying the newer workers more. All right? They happen to be much the same category, but I -- I don't want it. It's not age. Or, you know, I pay the lower paid workers more. How's that? Do I win?",
  "Yes. I paid the lower paid workers more? I want to bring them up to the executives. I -- I like it. It's more democratic and it makes a happier group. And -- and so, now, do I win or lose?",
  "I win. And I don't have to say any more than that.",
  "Well, it's not the number of cases either. I mean, you could have -- it wouldn't take much to have a single case that has a rule in it, say, that makes it very difficult for an employer to do things of type X or type Y, and that would have enormous impact even though you'd say, well, it was just one case.",
  "All that's true, but they -­ they did promulgate this guideline, as far as -- I looked it up. At that time, they said, look, it's going to be disparate impact, and they cited Griggs. And people have put comments, which I haven't read yet, but I imagine the comments went to disparate impact. And then when they rewrote it in this form, they have a little paragraph of explanation which makes pretty clear it's meant to be disparate impact.",
  "Well, all right. But I mean, they -- everybody knew what they were driving at at the time they promulgated this. So it seemed to me that if -­ if we're not governed by the reg, it must be because the reg is outside the statutory authority. And it might be outside the statutory authority if in fact it embodies too tough a test.",
  "But now we've heard it doesn't embody that much of a tough test, and you know, the EEOC isn't here to tell us -­",
  "-- what in fact it thinks.",
  "All right. So we don't know what the Government's position is. They're not here. So suppose I think, one, the language is against you, the language of the statute. I do think it's against you. Two, the EEOC reg does foresee a disparate impact test. Three, the practicalities are absolutely with you, and that has to go with the scope of the statute. And four, it might be possible for the EEOC to write a reg that deals with the problems you're worried about while advancing a disparate impact test. Suppose I think all those things -­",
  "-- which are at least consistent. What would I do with this case? That's my problem.",
  "Where the Government hasn't appeared and told us what they want to do or what they think should be done, et cetera.",
  "That would be a fairly easy burden -- a fairly easy burden to meet. And -- and to give you a fairly easy burden is consistent with the idea of trying to get employers to think about the problem. An employer who uses a different factor which is correlated with age but it's -- it's an unreasonable thing to do or it isn't the real basis hasn't thought about the harm that he's working.",
  "So we could give you an easy burden and still accomplish the objective.",
  "No how does that work? Because the -- the particular language, it shall be unlawful for an employer to classify his employees in any way that would adversely affect an individual's status -­ his status, it says -- as an employee because of such individual's age. Now, that sounds as if it's driving right at disparate impact. It's -- it's unlawful to classify an employee in any way that would adversely affect him because of his age. That's what it says. And then you turn to the defense and it says, but there's the defense with a differentiation, i.e., the classification is based on reasonable factors other than age. And therefore it would sound as if it says, look at the factor and ask is the factor reasonable. If so, the employer wins if it's really based on that factor.",
  "Yes.",
  "How do we get out of that language?",
  "No, no, but it says -- it says that would adversely affect him because of his age.",
  "Oh, no. It's not intent because to read it as part of classifying, which you'd have to do to get it because of intent, you'd have to say to classify his employees because of such individual's age. Now, that's a little tough because you're talking about employees, and then you go to such individual.",
  "It would be the natural way.",
  "The natural way -- wait. The natural way is to read it as modifying to deprive -­",
  "-- or otherwise adversely affect.",
  "That's the natural way to read it.",
  "Now -­",
  "-- suppose we read it that way. Then what do you say?",
  "Are there any such cases? I mean, I never heard actually -­",
  "-- when people -- no. I mean, are there any cases in which France or England has convicted people of an antitrust violation punishable by imprisonment for more than a year? I -- I didn't know that their antitrust laws had a criminal aspect, though I haven't looked it up.",
  "Fine. Well, I -- I've never heard if anyone in any foreign country, other than ours, though I gather my law clerk found that in Japan, in fact, Japan does have a criminal antitrust law. They may be the only ones outside the United States, and I don't know that anyone has ever been convicted under it because they're not too -- or they didn't used to be too fierce on antitrust enforcement.",
  "I'm just wondering how anomalous or your anomaly is.",
  "And are there such?",
  "I mean, maybe.",
  "I don't -- I don't -- but I just -- are we sure that there -- that, you know, that this anomaly exists?",
  "Are people really not allowed to come in if they've been convicted of any crime?",
  "Suppose it was a crime like not wearing a veil if you're a woman in a country that -­ suppose it was a crime like criticizing the government if you were in Soviet Russia. Suppose it was a crime like -­ you know, there are all kinds of crimes that we -- we would never consider crimes -­",
  "-- and in other countries there are -- we don't let anyone in if they've done any of those things?",
  "Suppose you put the question to Congress, which would you prefer? Would you prefer the occasional person who's been convicted of a foreign court, comes over here, that this statute doesn't apply to him, or would you prefer that all the refugees from Eastern Europe and people who come from Arab countries and people who come from countries that have quite different systems in places all over the world discover that suddenly they're felons because of things they never would have dreamt of because they were perhaps convicted of selling gasoline on the open market or perhaps they were convicted of any of these religious crimes we've talked about, selling a Bible? Suppose you put that question to Congress.",
  "How many times have you used this statute to go after people who were convicted in a foreign court?",
  "About, approximate.",
  "More like 100, more like 50, more like 10, more like 5? About how many?",
  "10 to a dozen over how long a period of time? 20 years, 18 years?",
  "'68. Now -- so 35-40 years. Now -- now, how many times do you think that people -- I mean, the -- the -- if you've used it only a dozen times or so in about 40 years, then it doesn't sound like a major threat. What I'm weighing against that is the possibility that people are really convicted abroad of selling Bibles. That really does happen, and there really were economic crimes in 1968 in all the Eastern European countries, and these aren't fanciful examples I've been giving you. And so if you were in Congress -- or -- or why do you think that Congress would have wanted to get the courts into the mess of trying to decide why wouldn't those crimes be covered and were the procedures fair? And we start distinguishing one country from another. And what are the procedures in the Ukraine or Kazakhstan anyway? I mean, my goodness, what a mess for the sake of a dozen cases in 40 years.",
  "You didn't really have a chance --",
  "Can I -- I want to get you. Now, I have a new question.",
  "Well, I have a new -­",
  "That's exactly what I wanted to know.",
  "And I -- can I -- that's exactly what I wanted to know. When a person comes in to get a gun -- because I hadn't focused on this, and it actually to me it's relevant. Suppose one of these people has been convicted in a foreign court and he doesn't have a clue, you know, that this means he can't buy a gun over here. So he comes over here. He goes into a -- a gun store. Now, does he get notice that that -- this conviction over in Japan or Lithuania or wherever it was means that he can't buy the gun?",
  "No. I'm asking -- I'm asking in general.",
  "Yes.",
  "So it just says any court.",
  "Well -­",
  "It'll work for -- yes. It'll -- it'll work for this one, but -- but what I'm worried about -- and really what led the Sentencing Commission to exclude all this stuff even though clearly recidivists should get a higher sentence, but we still excluded it because it's just a nightmare. There are notice problems. There are fairness problems. There are procedural problems. There are problems of crimes that aren't crimes here.",
  "And -- and all those come up, and that's what I'm worried about. So I see this as a possible out.",
  "The one -- the procedure you just talked about might help.",
  "That he knows about it.",
  "The -- the case, as far as I'm thinking of it at the moment, comes down to everybody is agreeing -- well, no. It's -- you go ahead because you want to reserve that probably.",
  "Why -- why is it exactly that a policeman who comes on a difficult scene, gun in one pocket, the guy has a knife in another, and he throws a punch? Now, the policeman might make a mistake about that. He -- he thought he threw a punch, but he made a mistake. Now -- now, why is a policeman less likely to make that kind of a mistake than make a mistake about what crime to label it?",
  "No, no. You said -- you -- you say everybody agrees in this case that if the policeman had reasonable cause objectively to arrest the person for A, but he arrested him for B instead, there are some circumstances in which that's okay. And on their view, it's -- as long as -- it was always okay, really, as long as objectively there was reasonable cause. On your view, you're going to add a little thing. You're going to add, and by the way, it's not okay unless that conduct that he looked at was in fact illegal. So you say -- because policemen could make mistakes about labels, but they're not likely to make mistakes about throwing a punch. So I just wondered why not. I mean, they got the wrong guy for throwing the punch. You know, so -- so what? Why is that so -- that -- that supposedly in your view is some terrible constitutional harm, but if he just mislabels it, it's not a terrible constitutional harm. And I'm just puzzled as to where that distinction comes from and why.",
  "-- that the circuits all agree with you. Now, my only problem is it's hard for me to see why they all agree with you.",
  "And -- and that's where I'm sort of stuck.",
  "I -- I don't understand your reading of Taylor. As I've read that case many times, it seemed to me that that was making a perfectly sensible point. At the end of the opinion, Justice Blackmun says, you know, there are some States like Massachusetts, for example, that instead of just saying burglary, they say burglary of a -- of a ship or a car or a building. And that leads us to answer a more general question. Well, in context, that more general question is whether you ought to go look into how a particular burglary was committed to see if there was really violence or not. And he says no. Just look to the definition of the crime. That's what he says. That will end it. Now, he says we agree, because I started here, that we have a couple of States with some weird statutes, and what you have to do in those States is you won't know if it's a boat or a car or -- so he says, for example, in a State like the one we have, if it shows it's charged us with a burglary and you have to find out, you know, here's what you do. It says you may have to go beyond the mere fact of conviction. So he says go look to the indictment or information and jury instructions. That isn't a limiting phrase. That's for example. He just thought that in those cases, that's what -- all you'll have to look to, for example. We happen to have an unusual case where there are no jury instructions because he pled guilty. So what's the harm of going looking to the documents that will show, in an uncontested way, just what the address on these pieces of paper show? There are no boats, you know, in Watertown. It's not a dock, I don't think, or at least not in that part of it. So -- so I mean, what's the problem here?",
  "Why is everyone so mixed up? I must be missing something.",
  "What's the problem? I grant you I could imagine a case that could be a problem. Maybe it was a houseboat. Okay?",
  "Or maybe it's like a trailer. So if we run into that case, we'll deal with it. You know, I'm perfectly capable of thinking that if this is a charge where there is a dispute on the contested point, fine, we won't take that dispute into account, maybe decide it in the favor of the defendant, maybe. But this is not that case. And by the way, if he's going to say, how do you know? I'd say, I know. I know Boston and I also know that breaking into a boat at least is unusual. So if he thinks it wasn't that, let him say so.",
  "No, of course, there wasn't. So all he has to do now is say, Judge, in my latest thing, you know, they say 30 Bremer Street. 30 Bremer Street sounds like the address of a building, but by the way, unusually enough, it's the license plate of a car. Now, if in fact that's the case, he can come in and say it. There's no Fifth Amendment problem. We're talking about sentencing and what a prior conviction was. He doesn't even have to say it. You as his lawyer could tell us. Now, you know why I think you don't say it? Because it isn't conceivably right.",
  "What do you mean it isn't right in fact? What is it?",
  "Yes.",
  "We look to facts about what the prior convictions were about. That's what Taylor says. That, of course, is a fact, but it's a legal fact, what was this conviction for.",
  "I understand your reading of it. What I want to know is what's wrong with my reading of it.",
  "Let me try the same question.",
  "But that's what I don't understand. We're now talking about that part of Taylor which deals with a narrow statute where our object is not to find out what he's guilty of or anything. We're just trying to find out what was the crime he was charged with. And there are two or three States which lump together in one statute crimes that are violent and nonviolent. Burglary of a structure is violent. Burglary of a car or a ship is not. So all we want to know is what was the charge at issue. Now, do you -- let me break the question into two parts. The key sentence here, I think, is for example, in a State whose burglary statutes include entry of an automobile, as well as a building, if the indictment or information and jury instructions show that the defendant was charged only with burglary of a building, then it's going to be violent. Now, would you -- would you agree with me or not that he could have written -- Justice Blackmun -- that same sentence to say if, for example, the indictment or information and jury instructions show? Would you be willing to add those two words, for example?",
  "If, for example. I want to know how -- how absolute you're making this. If, for example. And the next question I'd ask would be if you agree for example, what are the things you can look to and what are the things you can't?",
  "Yes, but do you want add the for example or do you want to take it just categorically?",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay. Then what kinds of things would you -­",
  "No, no, no. I will get that later. Let me deal with the charge. If he was charged with breaking into a boat, that's the end of this. Okay?",
  "So, fine. So I want to know what he was charged with. Let me do that one. Now, what will you let me look to to see what he was charged with?",
  "All right. So what happens in the case where -- Justice Blackmun let us go further than that. He says the indictment -- that's the charging document -- or information and jury instruction. He'll let us look to a jury instruction as if there's actually been a trial. So he'll let us go further than you will.",
  "And what's the difference between that and a police report that makes it quite clear that in the circumstances there was no possibility of a boat or a car being involved? What's the difference between that and the police report?",
  "No. What shows us that -- what shows us that is --",
  "-- is the check mark. No. The check mark on the form that says, for example, plea, admit sufficient facts. You know, that's a check mark or it's on the form. It says plea, guilty. I mean, you know, you could have different things checked. So that's what established the guilt. And then the police report establishes whether -- what kind of a thing was at issue. And I will agree with you that if it's at all contested, we shouldn't get into it. But if it's not contested, there's no question. There was no boat around there. It's a city street. Or there was no car. It's plain it was a building. Then that's just as good as the jury instruction. Why not? Tell me why not.",
  "I mean, but that's always true. You could have a -- you could have a -- a sheet that shows: admitted, assault, you know. And -- and what the sheet says, it says: charge, assault; plea, guilty. It's possible, for all we know, that when the actual colloquy took place, he was talking about some other thing. I don't know what he was talking about, but what you'd go upon is that there was a charge and he pleaded guilty to the charge.",
  "I -- I don't -- good. Are you going to explain this? Because I thought what we were supposed to do is just look to the sheet, charge; the plea, guilty. And that is what we do and it disposes of 98 percent of the cases.",
  "All right. So -- so are you talking about those 98 percent now?",
  "So what is your -- what rule would you have here? The question is, was he convicted of a crime of violence? 98 percent of the cases, all you have to do is look to the crime charged, burglary, and the fact that he was convicted. He pleaded guilty or didn't. But there are these two -- three States I guess that lump together in one code provision for breaking and entering into a ship or a car or a house. So now we've got to know which of the three it is. If they go to trial, it's easy. Just look to the jury instructions. If they plead guilty, I guess your opponents would say that's the end of it. You can't use it because we don't ever know from the charge itself which of the three it was that was at issue. Was a house at issue? Was a car at issue? Was a boat at issue? Now, you're going to say, but do a little investigating to find out what was at issue. Look at the police report. Is your view look at anything as long as it's uncontested and clear? Their argument is no matter what you look into, once you go beyond that charging document, you're going to find I think Justice Souter's point. It's going to be ambiguous sometimes. You get into facts of things happened years ago. It's just not worth it.",
  "Yes, but we're still going to have to write something.",
  "And what I want to know is what's your rule.",
  "Well, then -- but reading it that way, which is arguable, this case, but reading it that way, you'd say you can look -- what we're interested in is not what happened. We are interested in what kind of a crime was at issue. And where it's difficult to decide what crime is at issue, you can look to whatever official documents are there at the time, any court records, to make that determination, but there -- if there is any indication that they're -- they're contested, if there's any dispute as to what was at issue, then you can't count it. Then it doesn't count. What about that as a rule?",
  "So you'd say there's -- you can look to what Justice Stevens says. You can look to what is official in that record that seems to have indication of reliability, and if there is any indication at all that this was a matter in dispute, you can't count the conviction. That would be the rule.",
  "Can I ask you a basic question -­",
  "-- which maybe others understand, but I'm confused. Imagine that this has nothing to do with Indians. It is simply an ordinary contract. Now, my understanding is that ordinary contracts say subject to appropriations. So we have to decide was there an appropriation. In our imaginary department of Government, the appropriation is $1 billion. Nothing is earmarked for anything. They enter into contracts that amount to $999 million. Now, they pay out $990 million, and their -­ what the department says is, look, everybody knows we need at least $10 million to run our central bureaucracy. So there's no valid contract here. The appropriation wasn't made. Now, my understanding of ordinary Government contract law is to decide whether that $10 million was in principle available for the contracts. You look to something called the purpose-time-amount test. So was it during the same time? Yes. Is it in an appropriate amount? Yes. But is it available for this purpose? Ah, I'm not sure. All right. Now, I want -- if I have the -- the theory of it right, I want you to tell me what the money was in your case that is the equivalent of the $10 million in my example that you believe in principle was available to pay these -- for this Indian expenditure. Just pretend it's a regular contract. What is the equivalent of that $10 million?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, okay. And anything else?",
  "Well, forget this statute for a second because I'll stop you there. I want you to tell me why those sums -- I get the time. I get the amount.",
  "Explain to me why it is one of the purposes for which those appropriations were made, i.e., the equivalent of the $10 million, to go pay for this.",
  "It was one of the purposes.",
  "All right. So you think -- you and the Government agree then that were this an ordinary contract case, there is no doubt that a legally binding contract would have been entered into and the clause, subject to appropriations, would not work for the Government.",
  "Okay.",
  "No, no. Were it an ordinary -­",
  "-- were it an ordinary contract.",
  "So our issue as far as you're concerned -- and I'll ask the Government the same question -- is, is this contract different from an ordinary contract because of A, B, C, D Indian reservations, et cetera? And your claim is, I can't find any difference. And their claim is there will be some difference. Is that right?",
  "Well, they just did, the 2 percent. So my question to you is the same. I asked, let's imagine this had nothing to do with tribes, nothing to do with it. It was a typical, ordinary Government contract for pencils. All right? Or for soda water. Now, and everything were the same. Under those circumstances, just an ordinary contract -- and they point to that 2 percent and they say that is legally speaking -­ we didn't expect you to pay it. We just won a lawsuit in the Court of Claims. But -- but we have -- we have a contract here. Okay? That's what we're just saying. The -- the subject to appropriation clause doesn't nix the contract because that 2 percent is available, legally speaking, time, purpose, and -- and amount. Okay? Classic. Now, what's the Government's view there?",
  "Is it available or not were this an ordinary contract?",
  "I'm asking -- all right. Are -- is the Government's view then let's treat this just as an ordinary contract? Still it -- there was no money available.",
  "Legally speaking under the time-purpose-amount test.",
  "No.",
  "Now, I would like an answer to my question, yes or no. If this were an ordinary contract with a subject to appropriations clause, is -- would the Government be saying this is invalid because the appropriations were not there?",
  "There must be a yes or no answer to that.",
  "No. What it is is a contract for pencils. Can you not -- is it impossible -­",
  "-- to make -- you see what I'm driving -­",
  "Correct, and which are the funds that are -- that would be available here? Which are they?",
  "If this were under Blackhawk.",
  "Okay. Then let me do this then.",
  "You say if this were a classic, ordinary contract, the money would have been available legally speaking. Nobody says practically speaking, and they could have brought their lawsuit. Now, tell me specifically, if you can -- and this may take you the whole time. You want to make whatever argument you want. What is it that's special about this contract that brings it out of ordinary contracting principles?",
  "It doesn't say that. It doesn't say that. What it says is otherwise contractable. And they could certainly -- for a lay person like me in this, you'd think, well, we could have a provision that says $180,000 is hereby authorized to be spent only for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or Secretary of Interior. Well, if it said that, then that's not otherwise contractable because there's a statutory limit.",
  "So otherwise contractable sounds like a -- a statutory question.",
  "That -- that all may be true, of course. They're talking about don't contract out to the Indians something that should be done in Washington. But what has that got to do with the issue? We're talking, I thought, about -- about Government contracts. People who enter into Government contracts need certainty. They have to know whether that word, subject to appropriations, invalidates the contract or whether they have a valid contract. And a set of principles have come up that are used to decide that. And under that set of principles, money is available to pay for the contract if it's time, purpose, and amount. Okay? That's the principle. And --",
  "-- and I don't see anything contrary to that.",
  "No, he's not. But if -- if -­ where I'm really coming from, to be honest -- and I'd like -- you might as well reply to what I'm actually -- is why I'm asking these slightly hostile questions.",
  "I -- I read here -- look, the question really is was this money like the bureaucracy money. Is it legally speaking an appropriation available, not practically speaking but legally? And here it seems to me, in looking through this somewhat quickly, that you say no, but the Board of Contract Appeals say yes. And so I think in my mind, you know, one group of people who really know about this is the Board of Contract Appeals. So if they're saying that money from a contract point -- a point of normal contract law is legally available, I promise you I'm predisposed to think they're right. So I might as well expose that to you so you can tell me now why I'm wrong or they're wrong or whatever.",
  "Well, there is -- is -- the kind -- the money that's available to one tribe can't be taken for the other. But I thought the Board of Contract Appeals was saying taking that into account, there's still enough money left over. Am I wrong about that? I thought you should take money from one tribe to give it to another. What did they think?",
  "Well, I'm thinking the Board of Contract Appeals and the Federal Circuit.",
  "I think they disagree with you about the purpose in respect to the core Government function.",
  "Well, not just foreign policy. The White Russians come here because they don't want to pay Lenin's taxes designed to equalize all individuals, in terms of property. Country A has a tax law that makes everybody a criminal because nobody really ever pays all the taxes. Country C has a set of laws that tax bibles. Country D has a -- I mean, you know, we can spin out the examples endlessly, and they're not farfetched. So take all the arguments from last week, called \"any court arguments,\" cross- -- or two days ago -- just let's cross-reference them. The problem is complexity of tax law. The problem is many, many, many would be contrary to American policy. And the problem is, nobody really knows what they are; indeed, they don't even know what American tax law is, no single individual, I suspect. Let's put in Italy, France, Byelorussia, Belarus, Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, and 35,000 others. Everybody becomes a criminal. And then we say, \"Don't worry, we'll only prosecute the real bad ones.\" That's the argument, I think, on the other side, and I'd like to hear your response.",
  "No, only people who come over here because they don't want to pay taxes in those countries. Sometimes we would agree with them --",
  "Yes, they don't tell Lenin that they're coming - -",
  "-- and they write to each other. They have a cousin, in Brooklyn, who forwards them the money to get out.",
  "One reason for it -- I just - - you don't seem to know completely about Canadian law. How much do you know about the tax law of Vietnam? Because Los Angeles is filled with Vietnamese refugees, many communities of such people in the United States. Do we know how many of them perhaps might owe taxes under the law of Vietnam, and maybe are talking to each other about whether they really want to pay it?",
  "Well, what about the wealth tax in France?",
  "What about the other reasons underlying it, which is what I was trying to get at before? I see, literally, that the common law -- you know, the enforcement rule, this is not literally enforcement. But what I was driving at with my questions is, even though literally it's not, the problems of complexity, the problems of knowability, and the problems of there being so many, many foreign tax laws that we might think are basically unfair, that those considerations apply here, just as they do with the enforcement rule, and then add the fact that turning people into criminals under threat of prosecution by the Federal Government is really very much equivalent to enforcing the foreign rule in a court. I mean, that's the whole thing spelled out. And I meant it seriously, though I used foreign examples to, sort of, drive the point home. What is your response to that?",
  "What about -- what about a scheme - -",
  "Have countries also -- just - - here, I don't know, in respect to the principle -- would it have been viewed as contrary to the principle if a country were to pass a law -- say, England were to pass a law saying it is a crime in England not to pay French taxes? I'm not saying they couldn't do it; I'm just saying, would a law like that, saying it is a crime in England not to pay French taxes -- would it have been viewed as contrary to an abrogation of -- or a -- you know, whatever you call it -- a derogation from the common law revenue rule?",
  "But do you see why I want to characterize it? I mean, would you characterize -- my criminal statute's absolutely clear -- the clear is, it is a crime in England not to pay French taxes. Now, would you, or would scholars, or whoever, knew about the common law revenue rule, would they have said, \"There is a derogation from the common law revenue rule,\" or would they have said, \"It has nothing to do with it\"?",
  "No, what would you have said?",
  "Yeah.",
  "Nobody says they can't do it. That's why I asked you my question. My question is simply whether you would consider an absolutely clear law -- we will -- we -- it is a crime not to pay your French taxes. I'm asking whether you would consider that -- I'm not saying they can't do it; I just want to know -- would it be in derogation of the common law principle?",
  "That's what - -",
  "Not the - -",
  "That would be another one, too.",
  "Suppose they -- I -- that's why I want to know - -",
  "I got your point. I think it is that -- in my answer to my clear example, you would say no, that's not in derogation for the reason that there's an independent local reason for doing it. It's not being done to -- whether it has that effect or not, it's not being done in order to collect the foreign tax.",
  "That's been your response throughout.",
  "Okay, I - -",
  "See, he's saying it isn't, for the reason that, he says, that if England did it for independent reasons, it wasn't doing it because it wanted to help France get it's money, that then it wouldn't have been in derogation. Of course, it would have been legal, either way, but he says it wouldn't have been in derogation, for that reason.",
  "How long did the penalty phase take?",
  "Those don't sound as if they thought his conversion to Christianity made a difference.",
  "Yes.",
  "Actually that isn't really the issue. I think -- I find that easy. The harder issue is -- is whether the -- a person who thought about it differently than me, a judge, would have -- be objectively unreasonable. At least for me, that's the hard question. The question you're arguing is not hard.",
  "I mean, I would perhaps have come to a different conclusion than California Supreme Court on that question, but we can overturn them only if they're objectively unreasonable. And that's -- that's the hard thing because -- for me.",
  "Well, no, but I mean, that's - - that's really wrong what the judge did. But -- but the - - that -- that's tangential to the question. The question is, is it reasonably likely, if that hadn't occurred, that the jury would have considered the evidence that he was converted? But since it did occur, you know, they -- they didn't consider it. Is it reasonably likely they never considered it? That's -- that's the question. And then I can imagine, for what reason that Justice Ginsburg said, myself sitting in the California Supreme Court and saying, well, they heard the evidence for 2 days or a day, six witnesses, eight witnesses. They're not technicians, the jury. And -- and of course, they considered it. I can imagine that and that's why I'm having -- even though I don't agree with it.",
  "Doesn't it? I mean, it -- it says that -- what's -- what's the exact language of that statute? I just had it here. It's -- it's gravity. It's the --",
  "Of the crime. You could say it. Yes, his -- his later conversion extenuated the gravity of the crime, not the -- not the -- when I try to think of this person, who is not me, thinking of that, I say, well, plausible. Plausible, not perhaps the best, but plausible, isn't it?",
  "Is it relevant at all? This happened 24 years ago. We're sitting here trying to think of what a jury would have been thinking in a state of the law that's a quarter of a century old and facts -- I don't know what to think. I guess that's just irrelevant?",
  "So all this was at a time before Penry was decided.",
  "Yes.",
  "Which is the Texas -- the Texas -- you know, the ones - -",
  "Yes, one and two.",
  "Do -- do we have a transcript of that hearing here?",
  "Well, the penalty phase. I mean - -",
  "-- one way -- if I'm having trouble, I'll just read it.",
  "The whole thing.",
  "There's a footnote in Boyde that seems to draw that distinction.",
  "So what again in your view is the best distinction from Kyllo?",
  "What was -- and what was the second?",
  "Yes, but that isn't the - -",
  "All right. So once you say that, you realize that there are billions and billions of searches that go on every day that the police don't have to justify at all. They just look around.",
  "Okay? There are billions of them. So the real question is do they have to give a justification for this. And the argument that they don't is simply that it's not in the person's house. When you go out in a public place, even in your car, you might run into people or animals with sharp noses. And a lot of them can detect marijuana. And you know, maybe it's a Limburger cheese. I don't know.",
  "But people are sniffing things that they don't sniff through windows into your house, but they do get odors in your car on the street. So this is the kind of search. Yes, it's a search, but one that the police don't have to justify.",
  "Well, it's a specific investigative tool when I put on my glasses to look through a window.",
  "I don't see why it has to - - why that matters if in fact all -- if you go into a car, a police car, and you have -- drive through the neighborhood and look around, you are using a specific investigative tool, the police car, to look around and find out what's going on.",
  "What I'm trying to get to is in my own mind it's not a question of the tools. It's a question of the expectation of privacy.",
  "I still want to go back to my question because I think you may have an answer to it and I want to focus you - -",
  "I want to focus you on the question. I think what you're doing, which is a reasonable thing to do, but it isn't my approach, look to the English definition of search. I say forget that. Let's look to the Fourth Amendment because there are a whole range of searches that don't even fall within the Fourth Amendment in the sense that we don't need a justification. And I take Place as saying that dog sniffs is one of those, whether it does or doesn't use the word English search. So I want to know why it is that this dog search is one of the ones that's a Fourth Amendment search, i.e., one of the ones that requires a justification in terms of what the Fourth Amendment is about, privacy.",
  "Yes, but that isn't -- I take it you don't --",
  "Is there anything wrong with the policeman himself taking a sniff?",
  "It's the great Limburger cheese robbery.",
  "He stopped the car and he walks around. Anything wrong with that?",
  "All right.",
  "So plain - -",
  "All right. So -- so what you're saying is -- and this must tie back to reasonable expectation of privacy. All right? Because it's okay for the policeman to do it, and it's okay for dogs to do it in the bus station, and it's okay to use a dog not in the bus station with a car if in fact you actually are going to put him under arrest, although here you had probable cause to do so, I take it. And now you have to draw a pretty fine line. But it's not okay where it's not the bus station, but it is the car and in fact the dog is doing the sniffing -- and there are a lot of dogs around that can sniff -- and you did have probable cause but you didn't say it. And in face of Justice O'Connor's case which said that -- you see. Well, I mean, this is -- this is - -",
  "I mean, I'm not saying you couldn't draw that line, but I'm saying it's pretty tough I think.",
  "Well, I don't know.",
  "I'm right? Am I -- I mean, that - -",
  "And you're going to draw the - - well, I don't want you to repeat yourself necessarily.",
  "I mean, I don't understand. Is there any authority in the commerce cases for -- an X, which is there in the middle of a state, and it doesn't move one way or the other -- now, Congress' power does extend to the X if the state doesn't say something about the X. But if the state says something about the X, then Congress' power does not extend to it. That's hard for me to accept, because I don't see -- whether it's commerce or not commerce, whether it affects something or doesn't affect something, doesn't seem to me to have much to do with whether the state separately regulates it, and I can't find any support at all for that in any case.",
  "Well, here, they say -- look, I take it you're using this because I was going to ask you. You know, he grows heroin, cocaine, tomatoes that are going to have genomes in them that could, at some point, lead to tomato children that will eventually affect Boston. You know, we can -- oil that's never, in fact, being used, but we want an inventory of it, federally. You know, I can multiply the examples - -",
  "-- and you can, too. So you're going to get around all those examples by saying what?",
  "Yeah.",
  "So now what you're saying is, in a Commerce Clause case, what we're supposed to do is to start to look at the federal scheme and the state scheme and see, comparing the federal scheme and the state scheme, whether, given the state scheme, the federal scheme is really necessary to include this. That's a task, and I'm trying to make it as complicated as I can in my question.",
  "But I see it very well. Here is what they say. They say that, \"By the way, a hundred- thousand people using medical marijuana in California will lead to lower marijuana prices in the nation. Bad. And, second, when we see medical marijuana in California, we won't know what it is. Everybody'll say, 'Mine is medical.' Certificates will circulate on the black market. We face a mess. For both those reasons, it does have an impact,\" they say. Now, what's your response?",
  "No, no, we don't want more people - -",
  "-- in the illicit drug market.",
  "And we don't want low prices, either.",
  "So, normally I would have said, it's up to Congress to figure out how to -- the way that -- you have one going one way, one going the other way, and balancing those factors would be for Congress. That's what we'd normally say.",
  "And you say all that stuff is not for Congress; that's for us.",
  "Well, what it is, is, it's non - economic, and it affects the economic.",
  "This is a new framework, I take it, and it's very interesting. And one of the things that interests me -- I guess, on your framework, Lopez should have come out my way.",
  "It's essential to regulate guns in schools as part of a national gun-control regulatory scheme.",
  "I thought we didn't need to reach all that here, for the reason that the connection here, which is an enforcement-related connection and a market-related connection, is actually, I have to confess, a little more obvious and a little more close than what I had to -- what I had to say in Lopez to -- was the connection between guns, education, communities, and business. So I would have thought, given the -- and I believe that, you know -- but, I mean -- but that was far further than this, which is just direct.",
  "But what the Court said, I take it -- and I have quoted a lot of the language there -- it says that the wheat farmer's consumption of home-grown wheat, not the part that went in -- quote, \"though it may not be regarded as commerce\" - -",
  "-- end quote, still can be regulated, quote, \"whatever its nature,\" so long as, quote, \"it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.\" Now, that's the language, and I take it that Justice Scalia is exactly right, I thought, from that language, it's about the analysis, home-grown wheat, which is not economic, having an effect on something that is.",
  "Which is not commerce. Sorry, not commerce.",
  "Well, the Commerce Clause speaks in terms of commerce.",
  "I'd like to ask you one question about the activity - -",
  "-- which was brought up before, and I just -- I've never understood this. I'm not an expert. I don't honestly know, if I really think about it, despite all the papers and so forth, whether it's true that medical marijuana is helpful to people in ways that pills are not. I really don't know. So I would have thought that the people, like your clients, who have a strong view about it, would go to the FDA, and they would say to the FDA, \"FDA, take this off the list. You must take it off the list if it has an accepted medical use and it isn't lacking in safety.\" The FDA will say yes or it will say no. If it says yes, they win. If they say no, they can come right into court and say, \"That's an abuse of discretion.\" The Court says yes or no. If it says yes, they win. If it says no, it must be because it wasn't an abuse of discretion, in which case, I, as a judge, and probably as a person, would think it isn't true that marijuana has some kind of special use. So that would seem to me to be the obvious way to get what they want. That seems to me to be relevant to the correct characterization. And while the FDA can make mistakes, I guess medicine by regulation is better than medicine by referendum.",
  "So that's -- I just want to know why.",
  "That's all true, but as long as that hasn't been done, don't I have to take this case on the assumption that there is no such thing as medical marijuana that's special and necessary?",
  "If has been done, maybe I shouldn't make it.",
  "I mean, my goodness, all it requires -- look, the problem is not a technical problem. It's a human problem. A judge is a human being. He gets the petition. There are 28 different issues. That's a lot of work. He goes down one, two, three, four. He gets to this issue, which is somewhere hidden among the 28, and what it says is, there should have been a lesser-included offense instruction and it cites three Mississippi cases, which in turn cite one other case, and that -- that other case says that the Mississippi rule has constitutional implications and cites Beck. Well, I mean, if that's supposed to be sufficient, I as a judge would have to, in every one of these cases that's cited in these 28 different issues, start looking up the other cases in Mississippi to see if there's some other place they cite some other case that says something about a Federal case. I mean, you see it's impossible.",
  "But it isn't even because, after all, Beck talked about an instruction where the choice was either convict the person of murder, death penalty, or acquit him, and your case happens to involve an instruction which said to the jury, convict him or give him a life sentence or acquit him. So we don't even know if -- if Beck applies to your case. That's never been decided.",
  "I don't even know -- I am so ignorant I don't even know if Schad is a Federal case or a State case.",
  "So I guess if he had, he should have said Fed or U.S. or whatever it is so that I'll know.",
  "That doesn't seem like such a burden.",
  "Supreme Court? Yes, that's probably pretty clear it's Federal.",
  "Maybe he meant the State supreme court.",
  "All right. I'm saying you don't carry it to extremes. Don't be ridiculous about it, but that isn't an extreme case we have. We have which is the case we have, the State, and then three State cases, and then referring to one State case that says that Beck is -- is a constitutional implication citing Beck. I mean, I don't have to be extreme in order to say yours isn't that extreme example.",
  "No, no, but the question is suppose we have a different case, not this case. Everything is the same but for the fact we know for sure it wasn't a robbery. That's all. Now, in that different case, is it a crime under the law of Mississippi what happened?",
  "I've told you everything about the case. It's just like this one except we know it isn't a robbery. Now, is it a crime? The answer we think is absolutely it's a crime. And my next question is which crime.",
  "Okay?",
  "So which crime is it?",
  "Right.",
  "No. So it would be something. What would it be?",
  "All right. So then maybe there's a felony --",
  "Is anything else possible?",
  "Manslaughter?",
  "I mean, it's odd that in Mississippi people just go around shooting each other all the time and there's no statute that seems to cover it.",
  "All right. So there must be - -",
  "No, no, no. They just do it - - who knows why. All we know about them is they went and killed somebody. Now, I think it's still a crime to kill people in, I thought, all 50 States, but -- but --",
  "So I'm going to say which - -",
  "Okay. So what -- but -- but the line of reasoning is -- is -- now, there is a crime. Let's call it X. All right? And what you're -- what counsel says is it's the law of Mississippi that if there is a crime and it's X and it's lesser, you've got to charge it if somebody just says, please give me a lesser- included instruction, even if he's all mixed up as to what the right crime is. I don't know if that's the law of Mississippi. From reading the Mississippi Supreme Court opinion, I would say it wasn't the law of Mississippi because they say you're not supposed to charge people in ways that would mix them up. But, I mean, anyway -- but that's the argument. So what's the response?",
  "And don't take the one I just suggested because I'm not sure that's right. What is your response?",
  "Can I ask you a legal question, nothing to do with, you know, practicalities?",
  "But suppose you go back to the very old, bad days of the 1950's in the South, the '60's. They pass some civil rights legislation. A lot of legislation was passed in the '60's. Now, under that civil rights legislation, imagine an individual had been kept out of a restaurant or he'd been treated physically badly, not because of his race. He was white, but he was associating with people who were black. And they both go into the restaurant and they both are refused service. Maybe they're beaten up. I mean, both of them. Now, can the white individual bring a lawsuit under the -- the civil rights statute? I've always thought the answer to that question is, of course, he can. Would you -- do you think it's the contrary answer?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, of course.",
  "So therefore - -",
  "I'd -- I'd like to -- I'm thinking of various civil rights statutes which make it unlawful to describe -- to -- to discriminate. And now, I agree with you on that answer. The white person could bring a lawsuit on the basis of someone else's race because he's being discriminated against not because of his own race, but because he's being -- he's associated with people who are being discriminated against. I agree with your answer. And so my question is if that's so and if we have a long history here of the words, on the basis of sex, including retaliation not on the basis of my sex, but retaliation on the basis of someone else's sex -- that's what I've complained of -- why isn't this the same thing And to get out my whole question -- there are two parts -- why isn't this the same thing? And the second part is, because I think it is the same thing - - the second part is once it is included in 1981 -- in -- is it 1681(a)?",
  "Once we include this in 1681(a), that's the end of this case because Sandoval then supports the other side. It doesn't support you. All right. That's my question.",
  "Well, yes.",
  "So you -- you go ahead. I'm doing it purely as a matter of logic. I'm saying the old civil rights cases make clear it doesn't have to be on the basis of your own race. History makes clear that retaliation on the basis of someone else's race does fit within -- or gender does fit within 1681, and then that's the end of the case. So I would like your response to that logic.",
  "Well -- I mean, Sandoval is very clear. It's a very clear opinion in my view. Very clear. And the key language I thought is, the language statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer the private right. So they're looking at disparate impact and disparate impact, according to the majority -- I was in the dissent -- did not intend to protect the person discriminated against, but was a way of regulating people so they wouldn't intentionally discriminate. I can understand that. But I apply the same -- I didn't agree with it, but I can understand it. The -- the -- I apply the same reasoning here. The reasoning here is that this retaliation thing is not trying to protect university behavior one whit more than the whole underlying thing is trying to protect university behavior. This is about victims. Retaliation and being fired is about victims. And so given Sandoval, then we have the history, we have the language, and we have that sentence from Sandoval. And all that suggests -- it goes into 1681(a), in which case Sandoval says, a private right of action, given Cannon, would be inferred. Now, what's -- what's -- that's how -- I'm tracing out the logic of the thing. So I want to see what you say.",
  "All right. If they're not relevant, do you think that the regulation which provides -- do you think it's unlawful?",
  "Okay. If you don't contest the validity of it and you think it's lawful, do you think it's doing something other than interpreting 1681(a)?",
  "What -- what is it doing?",
  "What is the percentage amount of the payments that are taken out of all IRA plans before people are 59 and a half?",
  "And the -- the payment here - - it says -- the statute uses the word payment. So suppose you simply have an IRA plan but you don't take money out of it. Then is it exempt from bankruptcy?",
  "So -- so -- but I'm trying - - what I'm trying to figure out is if a person were to take -- just reading it in English, it sounds as if a person were to take the plan out before he's 59 and a half and pay the penalty, that that amount that he took out would not be a -- a payment because of age, but one that he took out after he's 59 and a half and didn't pay the penalty would be.",
  "It's -- I'm trying to figure out how -- how -- what the theory is. Is -- you say I have a right to receive payments because of age. And you say, well, here I have a body of money and 99 percent comes out of it after you're 60. 1 percent comes out before. So it's very tempting to say that that corpus there, of course, is a body of money that you're going to have a right to receive because of age because the practical effect of the 10 percent is -- is -- stops the -- the younger person getting the money. So does the case then turn on that? I mean, suppose -- suppose it were a 3 percent penalty and 40 percent of the people took out the money before they were 60 or a 1 percent penalty and 80 percent did it. Then should I reach the other result? I'm just trying to think of how does this analysis work. What's the right analysis?",
  "What percent?",
  "But as purely English -- as purely English, I read it as saying it's a right. What is that right? The right is a right to receive a payment on account of age. That's the -- a plan. That's the right. Now, your argument, I take it, was -- is that yes, it's true you also have a right under certain conditions to take it without respect to age. So what we have here is a plan that gives you both kind of rights.",
  "It's a kind that gives you a right to take it with a penalty and a right to take it because of age without a penalty. And thus, the question is, is that kind of plan which gives you both kind of rights covered? And the language doesn't answer it. So - -",
  "What -- what - -",
  "Now, why? Okay. Once you're down that road, you have conceded, as you must, that a plan that says you get the money because of age but you also can get the money without respect to age in certain circumstances can be a plan covered by the act. Now, that's the kind of a plan that's right in front of you. So, therefore, literally it falls just as much within the language as the other that you want to say even though that is literally true, this plan is very different from the others in terms of the purposes of the act. That's what I would like to hear because to me, I'm not so moved by holistic as I am by purposes, which is part of holistic. So -- so the -- the point that I would like to know is why, since ordinary people think of IRA's as pensions -- I do. I think of it that way. I don't know much about it. It's designed to help in the future, help when you're old and sick. But there is this extra thing in it which you point to. So why, in terms of purposes is this different from the others?",
  "I know that, but -- but -- and you do it with a penalty. We agree about the facts.",
  "But I want to know why that difference makes a difference in a world where only 1 or less 2 percent of the people do access it before they're 60, 59 and a half.",
  "No, no. I -- you've missed my point and I'm sorry. I put you on the wrong track with my following up. I shouldn't have.",
  "My question is we all agree that there can be plans where you can get the money not having to do with age, and they fall within the language of the act, and indeed, you say some are covered. But this one you say is worse than the others in terms of the purposes of the act, and that's what I want to hear why.",
  "But if that's the answer, excellent. So now we have --",
  "-- let's say - -",
  "Let's try -- let's try a million percent tax and nobody in history has ever withdrawn the money. Now, would -- that you would say would fall within this.",
  "Fine, yes.",
  "Okay. Now, if that would fall within this, going back to Justice Stevens, because that operates as a bar to prevent the bad world that Justice Scalia mentioned, why doesn't a tax that operates as a bar that's good enough to stop 98.5 percent of the people from withdrawing their money and having nothing left for old age -- why isn't that just as good as the million percent tax in a world that is imperfect?",
  "Should we put any weight on the title, on the name? I mean, I -- I can't but thinking it's an individual retirement account. Was Congress trying to fool people?",
  "Was the Federal Trade Commission? Should they investigate? What -- I mean, the -- the -- I think of it as an account that's basically aimed, at least Congress thought it was aimed, at retirement, which has usually to do with age.",
  "I'm reading the statute and if I were voting on it and put in the 408 reference and think of the word individual retirement account, is there any - - I would have thought, knowing not that much about it, that of course, they'd be included. Now, is there any indication, when people passed this, that they didn't think they would be? Any -- any reference in the terrible words, legislative history, that might shed light on it?",
  "They've held that in this case. We have a Massachusetts decision. It's their law and under their law in Massachusetts, the judge can revise it.",
  "Well, if it isn't their law, then I don't know how -- why they affirmed this conviction rather than reversing it.",
  "All right, but I mean, I -- I take it that it is their law, otherwise I'd see reversal, wouldn't I, and not affirmance?",
  "What?",
  "So -- so in other words, they're saying that in this case -- how could there not be prejudice? He had another trial. I mean -- how could - - I don't understand this from beginning to end then. But let me go back to my original question. What rule do you propose?",
  "What I'm saying is, for double jeopardy purposes - -",
  "-- an acquittal in your view is an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes when?",
  "No. I'm asking you for a - - I'd have to write -- if I agreed with you, I'd have to say we have here a judge who changed his mind. Under the clause of the Constitution, a judge cannot change his mind when. Now, go ahead. Now, fill in the blanks.",
  "According -- I know what their rule is. Their rule is a judge can change his mind up to the point that the jury is dismissed, something like that. I understand that. Now, I want to know what your rule - - is your rule a judge cannot change his mind once he writes the word acquittal on a piece of paper, even if he says, oh my God, I meant to say no acquittal? Too late. Too late. Okay, now, so I want to know what your rule is. Is that the rule?",
  "Okay. What is the rule?",
  "There is no further proceeding if he writes the word acquittal, I guess until he changes his mind. So 3 minutes later, he says I change my mind. Now there are further proceedings.",
  "I need to write a simple rule. All I'm trying to get from you is what is your rule. Is your rule that when a judge writes the word acquittal -- an acquittal, by the way, happens to mean there's nothing left for the jury to do on that charge. That's what it means. When he writes the word acquittal, he cannot change it. Is that your rule?",
  "Okay. And what is your rule?",
  "Sorry. I don't understand that.",
  "You're not understanding my question then. Imagine a case in which a judge writes the word acquittal. Now, half an hour later, he thinks, oh, my God, what have I done. The jury is still sitting there. Of course, they're sitting there because he hasn't had a chance to dismiss them yet. They happened to be having lunch or something. Is it final?",
  "It is not final.",
  "Say that again.",
  "But he wrote the word acquittal. There's nothing more for anybody to do until he changes the word.",
  "Let's try single-count. Okay?",
  "There he is. He writes the word acquittal and the jury says, oh, what do we do now? Go home, says the clerk. Now, before they can get out the door or anything else happens, before they get out the door, he says, oh, my God, I made a mistake. Can he do that under your rule?",
  "Okay. What I thought from reading your brief, which you're confirming, is your rule -- once the judge says acquittal, that's the end of it. If he decides 3 seconds later, he cannot change his mind. Now, that rule to me is inconsistent with most law.",
  "What I was thinking is -- I mean, here a judge -- I guess she was harried in the trial, she's thinking to herself, well, let's see, is there any evidence here that this was less than the shotgun -- this was not a shotgun. You know, it had to be a barrel less than 16 inches. So is there any evidence here of the shotgun? And she, I guess, forgot that there was a lot of evidence that it was a pistol. Now, there aren't many pistols that are 16 inches long. So she's thinking, something may be missing here. She's a little uncertain, but she writes acquittal, and then a few minutes later, she thinks, let's say, oh, my God, there was all that evidence about the pistol. So I shouldn't have done that. I mean, how -- how is a judge like that, a hypothetical -- what's she supposed to do? Is she supposed to say, I better not enter anything, because after all, I don't care if the defendant has to produce a case? Or is she supposed to enter something and think, well, I could change my mind before it's over? Or what is she supposed to do? She just thinks she made a mistake.",
  "I thought here there was evidence there was a pistol, but maybe I'm wrong.",
  "There was evidence it was a pistol. So I -- I would have thought, reading this, that there was evidence. That's beside the point, but I'm - - I'm just using it as an example where a judge might think she made a mistake. She thought there was no evidence that it wasn't a shotgun, and I guess she forgot that there was evidence it was a pistol and a pistol is not a shotgun.",
  "Well, I'm quite sure -- not quite sure then why she wrote down there was no evidence it wasn't a shotgun, but she had some reason. And now a few minutes later, she thinks, boy, whatever my reason is, it couldn't have been that good. Or maybe she thinks that that's a reason an hour from now or maybe a day from now. What's the line? Suppose she thinks of it a second from now. Suppose she thinks the instant she writes acquittal, she thought, oh, my God, a pistol is not a shotgun. Of course, it isn't. I know that. I better change it. Is it a second from now? Is it she can never change it no matter what once the pen leaves the paper? What's your rule?",
  "Whether it's single-count or double-count or triple-count. I want to know what -- how you see it, not how I see it.",
  "That's excellent.",
  "Excellent. That was an excellent answer.",
  "Now, I would like to know, given that answer, why is this final under State procedure because it seems as if the State courts of Massachusetts have said, no, it is not a constitutional error to go and look into this again. She can change her mind. And that's what I'd like you to focus on because I agree that that was a good explanation of the rule.",
  "I'm thinking of this case.",
  "Suppose I took Justice Scalia's rule and I said, that's the rule. Now, I would say that's the rule of a Federal law. Very well. That turns on your decision here being final as a matter of State law, but it seems to me we have State courts here saying, at least for double jeopardy purposes, it isn't final as a matter of State law. And therefore, I want to know how we reach your conclusion here.",
  "But is that necessary? I -- I mean, that's what I think is the difficult question here. Can you say that it's final for purposes of the decision- maker outside that courtroom, namely an appellate court, but it's not final in respect to the judge having a right to change his mind within the court? That -- that makes a lot of sense to me, but I don't know if it's possible to get there. Why not? I -- I think, well, the reason is that you want judges to be able to reconsider things and you don't have that problem when you're talking about an appeal.",
  "Or is there any -- is there any, in other words, to reconcile our case that you're talking about, Smalis?",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "What -- what about a judge who thinks -- should the judge -- should a judge in trial be able to change his mind as long as the jury is still there? Yes.",
  "Should you be able to take an appeal in the same circumstance while the jury is still there? No. Now, suppose a judge thinks both those things. Is that judge, like me, for example, hopelessly confused?",
  "Is the judge thinking contradictory things or is there a way of reconciling those two instincts?",
  "By the way, if it's constitutional, it's pretty easy to see a State might well say, let's do that, what a good idea. I mean, they might think it's a good idea. I don't know what people think is a good idea. We'll provide for interlocutory appeals right in the middle of cases because the prosecution can never appeal at the end of the case. That's really unfair. And we'll do this little thing here, and that way we give the prosecutor a chance.",
  "All right. You think it's - - I'm just inconsistent.",
  "What about --",
  "What is the reason you didn't want a fairly simple rule that I was thinking of? I'll tell you what it is and you'll tell me honestly why you don't. It's final. The word acquittal is -- is final if the jury has been discharged or the decision is sent to another body for review. One or the other.",
  "Now, so you haven't found something in your research that suggests that -- that - -",
  "There could be a problem that you have to have a fair chance to present evidence and so forth.",
  "I guess there are a lot of rules in Massachusetts that deal with that. They can't - - you have to be fair to the defendant in -- is that right?",
  "Here's -- here's the difficulty that I -- that I have. When I read your brief, I thought, well, he must be right because this is really about custody. It's really about custody. They want to get out eventually. But then when I -- I -- when I went back to Balisok, I thought, oh, here's the problem. The problem is that it's a damage remedy in Balisok. And normally you want the person to go into 1983 to get damages. But he's going to get mixed up. When do you send him to habeas? Well, we don't want to send him to habeas unless it's clear that habeas should have been brought. And so if he's just challenging, for example, introduction of Fourth Amendment violation evidence or something like that, don't got to habeas. Don't go to habeas. You didn't have to go to habeas unless you had to, unless you had -- unless it was necessary to upset the conviction. You see? That's why that language is there. Now, I got that far. Then I said, oh, I see what you do. We should have one rule for damages. Well, that makes sense. But there's no reason not to have a different rule when you have the injunctive action, and there maybe we could follow your rule. But the next thing I come across is a statement that says, no, no, the rule is the same whether you bring a damage action or whether you bring an injunctive or declaratory relief action. And I said, well, why did we write that? You know, we're the ones who caused all this trouble. But the -- the -- well, because we didn't want to make it too complicated and -- and not have all the questions coming, well, what kind of an action is it really, et cetera. Okay. So once I got that far, I said, oh, well, I'm going to have to change something for you to win. Either I have to change the thing that says the damages should be the same as the injunctive, or I have to change something else somewhere along the line, the word necessary. I don't want to change the word necessary. Maybe I could change the other, but why bother really? Because all that's important here is people know which way they should go. Now, that's where I am at the moment, thinking give him his 1983 action. It's simpler. It follows from Balisok. Why not?",
  "That's what I thought.",
  "Well, no, I've got that part. But the -- and -- and you're right about that part. But that -- you know, that doesn't get over the -- the hump here I think because of the -- what we've written. The -- I mean, where I'm coming out now, what you've just said, is well, you know, there's going to be exhaustion in both cases. And prison conditions, if we say that habeas doesn't -- that 1983 applies here I think probably -- I can't guarantee it -- but those where prison conditions would then cover it, and then there would be exhaustion, and there -- where it doesn't seem to make difference there. And now I'm back to asking the other half of this, which is, well, all right, suppose I say I see your point, I think you're right. Now, what -- what is your recommendation? What do we change? Do we change the word necessary in Balisok, which I'd be pretty reluctant to do? Or do we drive a wedge between the damage cases and the injunctive/declaratory relief cases?",
  "Oh, well.",
  "All right. No, but then what you're doing is taking the first half because what you're reading is you're reading that word necessary, whatever those words were in Balisok that we were just talking about, as your case satisfying that condition. And if your case satisfies that condition, then so does the case where a person wants to bring a damage action because of illegally seized evidence at his trial. Doesn't it? I mean, because all -- I mean -- and then we've swept - - then we've done -- we've really moved Balisok from what it was trying to do.",
  "Why is he bringing his damage action? He thinks he's bringing it because what they did at that trial hurt me. Now, how did it hurt me? It hurt me because I went right to prison.",
  "Well,",
  "Okay, fine.",
  "Then we take it as valid. Then we take it as valid. That's not a claim you're challenging. But I take it your claim is in the year 2009 he will have another hearing.",
  "2005? Okay, 2005 he'll have another hearing.",
  "And in the year 2005, I want not to have the -- what are they called? The 1998 guidelines. I don't want my 1998 guidelines applied in the 2005 hearing because you have some theory, maybe good, maybe bad, but it's a theory that that would violate the Constitution of the United States.",
  "So you're saying he's going to have this. I want an injunction or declaratory relief they can't do it.",
  "And he's saying it violates the Constitution in two respects: one, they won't listen to me; and two, they apply the 1998 guidelines.",
  "That's it. Okay. We're talking now about this 2005 hearing and he wants new procedures, and the question is, is this 1983 or is it habeas?",
  "Okay.",
  "My law clerk found two cases which we've just looked at briefly. One is called Wilwerding v. Swenson and the other Johnson v. Avery where she says that in those two cases people were using habeas to challenge prison conditions even. Now, so there are - - there are two cases that, if she's right -- and she's usually right -- that -- that -- where habeas was used to challenge prison conditions. So I've thought, well, if they can use it, they certainly could use it here.",
  "No. It was a different issue, but it said habeas could be brought.",
  "So habeas could be brought here?",
  "Why not?",
  "Yes, and they say sure -- sure I am. I'm saying I had terms. You know, I was going to be here under conditions A, B, C, and A, B, C in my opinion mean I will be released sooner, and instead, they gave me D, E, F, and D, E, F means I'm likely to be released later. I can't guarantee it. That's what he'll say. He says I can't guarantee it, but I wouldn't be bringing this case if I didn't think at least it was a shot.",
  "Suppose we wrote an opinion that said, whatever the reasoning -- I don't know what it would be right now -- that said in the future your client should go ahead in 1983. I'm putting you in a slightly awkward position, so don't answer if you don't want to. But I mean, for the future all these cases will be brought in habeas. Now, suppose that's what the opinion said. We're absolutely making it clear just what the -- would there be any harm done?",
  "Now, what would that harm be?",
  "And why would that be bad?",
  "Why would that be bad?",
  "No, no. But I mean, is -- I'm asking you a practical question as a practicing lawyer. Would it be bad?",
  "Because?",
  "Well, I mean, leaving aside - - Congress changed the statute. It says absolutely it's going to be habeas. Is there any bad consequence in the law?",
  "We'll catch them in habeas.",
  "Ah, so it comes down to that.",
  "Now -- now, as I understand it, this case was here before. We all read this and we went through it, and as a result of that, I -- if I read the opinion -- not the dissent, but the majority opinion - - and it might be in my interest if people followed dissents more, but I think the law is we follow the majority opinion. So when I read the majority opinion, I read, number one, there was history in this county, at least 7 years earlier though, where they actually had a booklet which said let's keep all the African Americans out, here's how you do it. Then you had jury shuffling, which were two instances. In one of them, there are like 40 people. In my mind, you know, we have rows. In row 1 there are four black jurors and six white; row 2, three black and seven white; row 3, two black and in the last row one black, and the prosecution says, hey, let's shuffle it. All right? And the other time he did it, the only other time -- it wasn't quite that bad -- the same idea. Then the third thing that comes up is you find instances here -- not everyone, absolutely right -- but instances where black people who seemed really for the death penalty, say, like Mr. Fields manages to get knocked off, but Mrs. Mazza who seems quite uncertain is kept on. And then we have this disparate questioning that you're about to mention where it just turns out that almost every black is given this really -- you know, bring them in a gurney, put -- put -- you know, real graphic description of the death penalty, and white people who also expressed hesitation aren't. Okay? So on the basis of that, the majority writes there is, indeed, a strong suspicion here that this was discrimination. So I want to ask you -- and if I were to write something like that -- I didn't write the words, but I would mean, well, I think that's what it is unless there's something later on that comes out to the contrary. So I'm asking you what was to the contrary. What came out in this Fifth Circuit that we didn't have in front of us the last time?",
  "I know that was the issue, but I'm saying if I read the opinion to say -- now, maybe you'll tell me I shouldn't. We should just go back and redo what we did. But I'm reading the opinion to say, well, unless something changes here, this is bad. It's discriminatory. Now, you can tell me, one, I'm wrong to read the opinion that way. I got that argument. But I want to be sure that that's what's in front of me. So I want to know is there something different in the Fifth Circuit that wasn't here the first time.",
  "Right. That's why I asked.",
  "So that must be a different question - -",
  "-- because that wasn't the one I asked. The one I wanted answered was the question of I understand that point, which we could say it was definitely not definite the last time. I'm asking you - - it's a serious question -- as whether there was something new or different that came up when the Fifth Circuit wrote this. Now, I gathered from your answer, it might be yes, and if the answer is yes, I want you to say what it is because I'm interested.",
  "You don't know. If you don't know, you -- there's an excellent way to know. Somebody says, you know, Mr. Prosecutor, you gave this terribly graphic script to all the black people and you really didn't give it to hardly any of the white people. Now, it's also possible -- possible -- that the reason he didn't was because from the answer to their questionnaires, which we've not seen, you didn't need to. That's possible. But if that were the case, wouldn't he have said to the judge, Judge, that's why I did it. I didn't ask them because I read the questionnaires. Wouldn't that be what you would do or any prosecutor would do if that were the reason?",
  "And did the prosecutor ever do that here?",
  "Did the prosecutor not -- was he there?",
  "No. And did -- was anyone there who had ever talked to the prosecutors?",
  "All right. So could then - -",
  "But couldn't you have asked the prosecutors if that was the reason?",
  "I mean, what are we supposed to do? I mean, what you've done is say -- of course, I could think of reasons that could have been their reason, but unless there's some reason for thinking that was their reason - -",
  "You think they're based, for example, on capital punishment. But now, let me give you two of them, and this is why -- this is actually why I get somewhat concerned about this. Here is the answer of the white woman who served on the jury about capital punishment. Could you put Miller-El to death? Mrs. Mazza: It's difficult. I've had 2 days to think about it, and given my religious upbringing, et cetera, going on for a few sentences, I think I could. She serves on the jury. Okay? Here's Mr. Fields who is black and whom they got off. What I think, according to the Old Testament, people were killed if they violated His law. In its extended service, the State represents Him. I feel the State is God's extended person. In other words, the State represents God in today's time. Therefore, if the State exacts death, that's what it should be. Okay? That's the man they feel has the qualm, and the woman I told you who was white they feel has no qualm. Now, I look at that, and I say, you know, I mean, my goodness, it's pretty hard to see how you get yourself in that frame of mind.",
  "No. I know. They then said that oh, you see, Mr. Fields was -- is it a woman or a man? I'm not sure. Yes, he's a man I think. He -- he's kept off, the black man, because of his views on rehabilitation. So I looked up what those views were, and that consists of his saying -- my -- my interpretation - - well, I think any person, if he really believes in God, really believes in God, could be rehabilitated. At which point the prosecutor says to him, well, suppose you came to the conclusion that Miller-El really was touched by God, could you put him to death? Answer: Yes. Why? Because, well, it seems to me my job here is to follow the law. That's the man whom they think they are -- they are kicking off because of his views of possibly not applying the death penalty, and the other woman, who is white, they keep on. Now, I think that's the whole story there. There was also the brother who was a drug -- who was the drug -- you know, he had had drug convictions, but that's scarcely mentioned. So -- so I look at those two people and I think, gee, put that in context. My goodness. What -- what's your response to that?",
  "And when you say there is no precedent -- I mean, I think a much more modest claim than you're making, the claim simply that a state cannot discriminate against out-of-state liquor -- i.e., the physical liquid -- which is really more modest and keeps the three-tier effect -- now, your -- that claim, that they couldn't do that, was really what was advanced in Young's Market. I read the briefs in that case. The briefs presented that Court -- you could have written those briefs. And the difficulty for you is, it articulated that more modest version very clearly, made a tremendously strong case, that was not forbidden by Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment. And this Court squarely rejected it.",
  "The result, I understand, you could put on the basis of there being no discrimination.",
  "Reading Justice Brandeis' opinion, I can't believe that that was the basis for his result.",
  "Well, I'm trying to think of what Brandeis could have been thinking.",
  "Yes, that's right. And this is a reconstruction, because I have no doubt, and you have no doubt, that Section 2 was meant to end that part of the dormant Commerce Clause that would come under the name of original package doctrine -­",
  "-- which meant that the foreign liquor has to be treated better than domestic liquor. Now, he's thinking, \"Why is that? What is that package doctrine?\" And the answer is, the dormant Commerce Clause -- it's part of the dormant Commerce Clause -- the dormant Commerce Clause is the implication from the existence of the commerce power in the Constitution. So if we have an amendment that says \"that aspect of the dormant Commerce Clause doesn't apply,\" that means the dormant Commerce Clause doesn't apply, because you can't divide the dormant Commerce Clause into six different parts, or even two.",
  "Now, maybe -- I think that's how he's reasoning.",
  "And if he is, and even if he isn't, why isn't that right?",
  "I know you do.",
  "I know you do, but the principle of Webb-Kenyon, which was enacted when the Wilson Act was already there -- very clear -- is to stop the original package doctrine, stop favoritism of the out­ of-state liquor shipment, which meant, in a dry state, you had to sell less. I mean, that's what it's there for. I didn't find a word, in other words, contrary to what I've just said; and if there are such words, now is the time to point them to me -- to point them out.",
  "But could Congress pass a law forbidding it?",
  "Yeah. All right. But I need an answer to it.",
  "Because, you see, what's going to come next is, if you say yes, I'm going to say, \"Well, didn't it pass that law with the Wilson Act?\"",
  "What did -­",
  "How do you count bottles? I would have thought the consumers have all the bottles.",
  "Now, why -- why do you say that?",
  "Would you elaborate for this reason? Because the briefs and you again today keep talking about that first document. You use the word report.",
  "Well, to me that's the whole conclusion of the case. I'm prepared to assume, at least for the moment, if you can convince me that that's the report they're talking about, you'd win. But that isn't what the Government says. The Government says that's a piece of paper, preliminary. We -- like my draft. I write drafts all the time. So -- so do trial judges. And he goes and brings the draft to the other two judges and says, let's sit down and talk about it. And they sit down and talk about it, and he changes his mind and writes a different document. And that different document, of course, is totally public. The whole opinion of the Tax Court. There is that document.",
  "How do we know that? Now - - now, what is the answer specifically in the statute? Let's call it document 1 and document 2. And it really didn't help me that much in the briefs to see document 1 continuously labeled with the word report when I thought that's the key question. Is it? Is it that report they're referring to? So now, go ahead.",
  "Which - -",
  "Which -- which brief - -",
  "What -- what page?",
  "All right. Now, what -- what was the page? Please. You're going quite -- and I want to -- because Justice Ginsburg referred to a statement in the Government's brief that you said yes - -",
  "What happens in cases in agencies, you know, where -- where -- suppose the agency itself or a member thereof is going to make a decision, and there might be other members who would hear the witnesses. And I was thinking of that analogy. It's possible. It happens in the Federal Communications Commission where the staff, you know, consults back and forth in ratemaking cases.",
  "It's hard to find precisely the analogy, but it seems likely.",
  "Yes, which gives and takes away.",
  "You have to have an opportunity to refute the information that's going to - -",
  "Yes.",
  "If you analogize the STJ to the administrative ALJ. But you might also analogize him to a member of the agency itself, and if you make that analogy, it doesn't become so far-fetched, particularly when you look at Morgan as also not allowing you to probe at what's going on.",
  "What -- what is -- can I ask you a really esoteric administrative law question, which I have never been able to figure out? It's probably relevant, but I -- this is an agency. That's what -- my great tax professor, Ernie Brown, used to say there is no Tax Court. He says, the Board of Tax Appeals shall be known as the Tax Court. What he meant by that is it's not -- it isn't the Tax Court, just known as. So -- so this is an agency, an administrative agency. So I look to the APA for guidance, and the APA, when you look at the section, says this initial decision can be made by a 556-qualified person. Now, a 556 - qualified person can include the agency itself or a member of the agency or an ALJ. Then when you to look at what happens in 557, after that presiding employee makes an initial decision, it says you have to give a chance to the party to respond to the initial decision, which you like, in the case where the presiding employee -- presiding person is a subordinate employee. And so, that's what I was just checking here. And so -- so what's supposed to happen where the presiding person under 556 for that initial or tentative decision is not a subordinate employee, but rather, quote, one or more members of the body which comprise the agency? I've never run into that before. Maybe you haven't. Maybe they didn't mean anything by it, but maybe they did.",
  "He was a subordinate employee?",
  "Rather than a member -- is - - is -- if he's a subordinate employee, that's easy. Then the case is easy I think.",
  "No. I'm just looking - -",
  "So where does it say that? Where does it say that?",
  "I don't know if I'm getting - - so that's his basic point. The rule doesn't require the disclosure because they've interpreted it differently within their -- within their discretion. Statute doesn't require it and the Constitution doesn't require it. We have to go to the Constitution, I don't see exactly the implications. So I'm nervous. And now, the reports -- he says, go read 7460(b). That's what they're talking about. And then - - and again, I don't know what I'm getting into once I read it more broadly than that. And what about all evidence received by the Tax Court, including a transcript. Of course, this isn't evidence but neither is a transcript. And -- and so maybe that word evidence can be read more broadly, given the fact that it's to include a transcript of the stenographic report.",
  "You think I'm right just suddenly for the for the first time? You have thought of this?",
  "Is it at all possible to do here what has been done in the union cases, where -- I mean, it's pretty hard for me to believe that there aren't -- that meat -- that cattle growers don't, by and large, like beef. I mean, maybe they have a ideological objection to people eating beef, but I doubt it. They probably object to some content. So can you segregate that? I mean, in the union cases, the bar cases, they try to segregate where there really is an ideological objection from the cases where really all that the objector wants is not to pay the money. And so they work out a system. You know, you pay so much for your dues anyway, you just don't pay that pro rata amount, where you really have an ideological objection.",
  "Is it possible to work that out?",
  "Yes, but, I mean, if you make it -­",
  "-- totally voluntary, what you're going to discover is, all of a sudden, the beef people, rather than write a check, will say, \"Oh, you know, I make -- I raise cattle, but I don't think people should eat beef.\"",
  "That saves them the money.",
  "And I tend to doubt that that's their view.",
  "Some may view -- object to certain content. So I'm asking if it's feasible to work out -­",
  "Well, what's the objection to, whenever you have an ad, you put a little thing in the corner, and it says, \"This advertisement is paid for by the beef industry under a regulation, X-23, of the Department of Agriculture\"?",
  "And it wouldn't -­",
  "-- tough, would it?",
  "All you'd have to do is have a little thing -- and it would just say, \"USDA requires this, under the program,\" and then the whole problem goes away.",
  "All right.",
  "Well, let's be honest about it. Let's be totally accurate. It's not going to say, \"The government believes this.\" The government may not believe it. What it says is, \"This message is brought to you by the Beef Association under the -- under a program requiring contributions to advertising of the Department of Agriculture.\"",
  "Nobody will even know what that means, but it has the -­",
  "-- it has --",
  "-- it has the virtue of being totally accurate.",
  "The important thing is, you have no objection to doing that.",
  "But would it -­",
  "-- seems to -­",
  "I understand that a person could have an ideological objection to the content of the ad. But the ad, itself, is an effort by government, in this area, to regulate a commercial matter, not a license plate that says, \"Free Speech, or Die,\" or \"Freedom\" -­",
  "Yes, I know. Right now I'm asking -­",
  "Well, my question is, does it make a difference for the point of distinguishing, or not distinguishing, \"Live Free, or Die,\" and similar ideological matters -- does it make a difference that the fundamental aim of the program, and 99 percent of the way it's carried out, has to do with simple advertising, commercial advertising, the regulation of a commercial matter, commerce --",
  "-- does that make a difference?",
  "But no legal difference.",
  "So, in other words -­",
  "-- in other words, a program that is a regulatory program regulating commerce, we should no longer think of that, though we tend to think of it as quite different in the way we approach the First Amendment -- we no longer, in your view, should?",
  "We regulate advertising. We regulate commercial advertising.",
  "The Federal Trade Commission -­",
  "Yes.",
  "I didn't say -­",
  "-- I didn't say they had a -­",
  "-- commercial objection.",
  "I am asking. In analyzing the program, there are some things for it, and there are some things against it. And in trying to make that weighing, I do think it's different, because the basis of the program is commercial regulation. And so I want to be certain, in your view, that's either correct or incorrect.",
  "If it's incorrect, I want to know why.",
  "Well, if it makes a difference, then the lens that I look at this through is called our -­ whatever the second-tier commercial speech lends.",
  "Have you looked at -­",
  "I know, but take all that out of it -- take all that out of it, and what is your answer to Justice Stevens and Justice Souter? That is, look, like this, you have an organization, the Federal Trade Commission, say, or that the FDA says, on the one hand, (a) broccoli industry, \"Fruits and vegetables are good for you; crib death device, \"Buy anti-crib-death devices; \"Buy car seats for your children\"; or, \"Don't smoke\"; or -­",
  "-- \"Don't buy a crib without a crib-death device\" -­",
  "-- \"or a car without a car seat.\"",

  "-- what's the difference?",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay, maybe it doesn't matter.",
  "But I'm not interested -- I got that point.",
  "I'm not dismissing it. I understand it.",
  "But I'm not sure -­",
  "Well, my question is, is it implied in what you're argued that it would be equally unconstitutional, in the same way, to tell the cigarette industry to advertise, \"Don't smoke,\" or to tell the automobile industry to advertise, \"Buy car seats for your children,\" or to tell the crib industry to advertise, \"Be sure you have an anti-crib-death device\"?",
  "And all that, assuming the financing is the same as here, everything else the same, is it implicit in your argument that they're all equally unlawful?",
  "In other words -­",
  "I think the question, or at least the version I have of it -­",
  "-- is, we have this case, exactly, and the only difference is, instead of getting these people to eat -- say, \"Eat beef,\" what they say do is, they get people together and say, \"Don't eat too much beef.\" I put -­",
  "-- \"too much,\" because that -­",
  "-- makes it more realistic. All right, now, does it suddenly become constitutional?",
  "How -- how --",
  "How do we do it? It goes right to the heart of this from you, the qualified immunity thing, for the reason that if you look at the facts and circumstances, it sounds to me like a somewhat close question as to whether the police did or did not exceed the reasonable bounds -- reasonable bounds. Now, if it's a close question, you have a jury verdict against you, and -- and then I think, well, yes, but I begin to come -- become disturbed if I think of qualified immunity. I mean, it isn't that clear. So -­ so having read through the thing, I -- I preliminarily start by thinking, well, it could have been excessive force, I mean, given -- you know, I'm using that in quotes.",
  "The jury said it was. Who am I to say it wasn't -­",
  "-- in that situation? But qualified immunity. So now, what do I do?",
  "Well, a lot of it may depend on the -­",
  "-- on the music as to handcuffing and what did they say and what was the atmosphere and what was the garage really like and how risky was it that there be gang members in the outhouses and -- and all kinds of stuff that you might sense from the testimony.",
  "But would you be happy then with a holding that says just what you said? We reaffirm Summers and -- but Summers said special circumstances or possibly a prolonged detention might lead to a different conclusion in an unusual case. And the only verdict part that I think we're concerned with here -- it was not about four people. It was one person, Iris Mena, and in respect to Iris Mena, the jury found that there was a violation of her -- of her Fourth Amendment rights. And as to her, you could have found -- you said -- I don't know if you misspoke. You said it could be more than 15 minutes. In looking at it, I was certain whether they kept her for 15 minutes more or more than 15 minutes more, maybe up to an hour more beyond the time that the search ended and kept her in handcuffs, both after the time they had secured the place and also after the time the search ended. Well, that would seem a basis for the jury's verdict and consistent with Summers.",
  "You might be able to keep your verdict, I -- I think. But I think the problem here is the Ninth Circuit -- you go to the Ninth Circuit and you say, you know, there was excessive force here on anybody's definition for reasons that you say. And -- and the Ninth Circuit says, oh, it was a clear violation of the Constitution and we'll tell you why, and then they give some reasons. And two of those reasons are, A, four and a half pages written the reason that this was unconstitutional is because they asked her questions about her immigration status, which you -- I don't think you even raised. Maybe you did. But anyway, that's -- that's the bulk of the -- of -- of -- that's the bulk of the analysis. And -- and these are the words that I think they're objecting to. And by any standard of reasonableness, Mena was -- the -- the officers should have released her from the handcuffs when it became clear that she posed no immediate threat. And that was long before the -- the -- because she wasn't a threat. And that was long before the end of the search. And what their point is on that is, you know, if that's the rule, that's going to interfere with our SWAT teams because they can't operate that way. They -- they can't evaluate the individual. They put the individual -­ if there are guns and gangs and danger that she'll grab a gun, they put her in handcuffs, and they hold her there for the search for a couple of hours, then they release her. Now, that's their argument. So they're objecting not so much to -- to the fact they have to pay $30,000 -- or they may object to that. But they're -- they're objecting to the holding of the Ninth Circuit, and if they're right on that, then I guess we have to send it back and say, do this over again, though I'll be sorry about that and maybe there is a way not to do it. But -- but I want to know your view of what I see as those two issues here, that the Ninth Circuit's analysis was wrong.",
  "Yes, but then we can't really reach the issue. That's a possibility. I see that.",
  "Well, but then suppose that the reason that this case is here is because of the implications -­",
  "-- of the Ninth Circuit's analysis --",
  "-- not necessarily the extra 30 minutes because I see your point on the extra 30 minutes.",
  "Well, we could say is their opinion -- that's their opinion. It's beside the point, et cetera.",
  "If that's true, is it routine in -- I mean, here what sort of pushes the other way on this is this is a dangerous gang. They have lots of weapons and they have previously gone to this house, which I gather -- sometimes when I read it, I think it's like a warren of little rooms. On the other hand, maybe it isn't. I haven't seen the house. There are a lot of buildings around, and they think a lot of people here -­ we don't know who's what, and we make a mistake in this and we're dead. You know, I mean, so that's painting it the other way. But where you have guns and -- and houses and gangs and so forth, now that's why they say that it's reasonable in those circumstances to say, when we find someone in the house, we handcuff them through the search. We might let them go earlier, but that's up to us and we don't want the courts second guessing us on that. Now, what's -- what's painting it their way, and I'd like you to respond.",
  "Did they search that room?",
  "So -- so do we have the tape here?",
  "Oh, not necessarily. It wouldn't be always either way. I would think that if in fact you have a product and the product causes harm in a subset of cases, which you could warn against, then a jury could decide whether the unreasonableness consists of not having designed the super-safe product or the unreasonableness consists of not having had a different label.",
  "And you're arguing that in this case you have the first.",
  "It seems implausible on -- you know, -­",
  "-- because all they'd have to do is don't use it in pH soil.",
  "In your view -- in your -- your opinion, if you were to follow that, would EPA -- suppose EPA does the following. EPA looks into this and they publish a reg that says in this case or in this subset of cases, or some kind of description that fits yours, we think that the labeling should be thus and so and we think that State tort suits will interfere with our ability to promote the uniform labeling and therefore they're preempted. Can the EPA do that on your theory?",
  "Well, that's their strong point. So what is the response to that? Because you can easily get two juries in different parts of the country to decide absolutely opposite things as to what the label should say, and in those circumstances, they say, well, they're in an impossible situation and that's why Congress passed this statute, to be sure it would be EPA and not two juries in different places.",
  "I'm speaking practically. And I don't have to go into all the argument.",
  "You know the argument. It's a very familiar argument.",
  "Let me ask one because I think you'll hear some variation of this, and you have a minute, which is the -- the statute sets up a perfectly good way of keeping this branded stuff off the market. All any complaining farmer has to do is to go to EPA and ask them to pull it, and pulling it is an unbelievable sanction. It's like the atomic bomb on the company. And so that's very strong. And the only thing that leaves out is the possibility of damage remedies, but if you want your damage remedy, just go to EPA and tell them to give it to you because they can write the rule the other way that I was suggesting.",
  "They would just say it doesn't preempt.",
  "So you quite clearly have both. I understand that. Let me ask you a question about the -- the preemption point because what I think they're saying is go read the red brief, your brief, pages 6 and 7, and there you see a statutory requirement and you see regulatory requirements, regulation. And I think one of their claims is we are arguing that that statutory requirement, without any change in the regulatory, that -- that it was violated. These are false. They're misbranded. So we are not imposing a requirement different from or in addition to the requirement of Federal law. We are enforcing a requirement that is the same as the requirement of Federal law, and if, by the way, the EPA were to think that tort suits in those circumstances in practice are too disuniform, let them promulgate a regulation to that effect. But they haven't. Now, what -- what is the answer to that argument?",
  "Where does it say that?",
  "Because you were just going to point out where it says that -­",
  "-- which I think is -­",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "So -- so if you have one administration thinking the one thing and the other thinking the other thing, why isn't the answer that the agency can promulgate the reg it wants? And therefore if the reg -- if the agency comes to that conclusion, let them promulgate that reg. And if a different one thinks it can work with the tort suits, let them promulgate that reg.",
  "Why do you say explicit? I -­ I thought it said you have to make it plain, which really might matter.",
  "What it says -- the language I think is -- or definitely declared or otherwise made very plain.",
  "Is that right? There's nothing that says explicit. Right?",
  "All right.",
  "If I'm correct, then -- if I'm correct, then I guess the main argument I thought is here we have a national park and we want to keep the national parks as the United States, which you'd expect. It's a national park. And of course, they want to keep the whole thing. I mean, it's obvious. You don't have to write everything that's obvious. They no more want to give all the water in the park to Alaska than they'd want to give the gamekeeper's part to Alaska. A house, or maybe there's a swimming pool somewhere they don't mention either, but it's just obvious that unless there's something very special about the water, that the water in the park is part of the park.",
  "I understand that. But I mean, it's like saying we're keeping Yellowstone, but we're giving you the geysers. I mean, that's water too. It's even underground water. But I mean, what the argument I think is -- would be is this like that, and the argument that it is like that is that, well, of course, you need this water in order to study the glaciers because there are forests that go down to the edge, because the flora and fauna can't be protected without it. And so though it isn't as strong a case as the geysers in Yellowstone, it's good enough. Now, what's your reply?",
  "I understand that. I'm using a funny example to -­",
  "Like in Yellowstone. There is a river I think. Who owns that?",
  "No. But I mean, does the State or the Feds own the -- the river that goes through it?",
  "What about in Yosemite? I think there's a river down there too. Is the river in Yosemite owned by California or by the -- the Feds?",
  "Right, but normally you assume, I guess, that Congress does what is -- tries to avoid things that are ridiculous. So if they say keep the park, I guess the question would be is that included. I mean -­",
  "-- can you read it this way? I -- I think it would be relevant, wouldn't it?",
  "Yes.",
  "But in -- in respect to Glacier Bay -­",
  "-- I -- I mean, is the only -­ you said, for example -- is the only dispute about the use of the water that's in the middle of the Glacier Bay park whether there should be more or less fishing, or are there other things that Alaska wants to do with that water in the park that they can't do if the United States owns it?",
  "How could they do that? You mean they would go into a boat in the middle of the water there, but they couldn't get off the boat?",
  "I see.",
  "All right. So if -- if the normal way of visiting the park is to go into a boat and to go up along the waterway and to look at the glaciers on the shore, then it surely is odd that the United States intended to give that waterway to Alaska, for under those circumstances, there would be nothing left of the park. I mean, it would be like -- you see, if it's essential to it.",
  "No. I understand that, but I mean, it's the way of visiting the park.",
  "Where is the language that says that the submerged land that fits the proviso is retained by the United States?",
  "What the proviso says is just what Justice Scalia said.",
  "No, no, but where is the implication in that?",
  "That's -- that's -- it -- I mean, in -- in -- I take it in the Alaska case we were considering a transfer that did fall within the main sentence of (e).",
  "Were we or weren't we?",
  "We weren't.",
  "Yes.",
  "All right. Then -­",
  "All right. Then at best Alaska is a neutral. Because we didn't think it, we're operating as a mistake. It's a neutral. Okay. Now, what's bothering me about the case is just what Justice Scalia said, that -- that why I -- if I sell you all my clothing and then I put, but not my camping gear, I mean, I can absolutely see you don't get my camping clothing, but you want to say that's a reservation of mess kits from some other transfer? I mean, it has nothing to do with mess kits.",
  "Fine, and then it doesn't go in that.",
  "But it doesn't mean that the next --",
  "Yes.",
  "All right. If it's an abundance of caution, where's the other language that almost reserves it so we need the caution?",
  "But 5 is subject to the Submerged Lands Act and the Submerged Lands Act brings you back to the reservation has to be explicit. And then -­ see, that's -­",
  "That's why I was talking about Yellowstone.",
  "I was looking for something that would be obvious that they wouldn't have meant to transfer. He comes back and says, well, very often States do control the water.",
  "Well, I thought -­",
  "All right. Given what you're saying -- and I -- you're not accepting this I think, and I -- well, there is language in this act which maintains in the United States title to the park.",
  "All right. Now, I would have thought when you get title to the park, you mean the park, and by the park, you mean those essential parts of the park.",
  "And therefore, if you have a part of the park which is the only part of the park where people look at the park, and it's the only part of the park that brings them into the park, and it's the only part of the park where you do the research, et cetera, that's the park. Just as if I were to sell my house and I list the rooms and forget the kitchen, well, the kitchen is an essential part of the house.",
  "Now -- now, once I made that argument, he said that's a very clever argument, but really, there are all kinds of instances where States have reserved submerged land inside national parks and it's worked fine.",
  "What's your response to all this?",
  "Should. Now, you're not -- how far are you prepared to go? You can't go more than your brief and your facts justify. Are you prepared to say that this water is an essential part of the park?",
  "Yes?",
  "Have you said that before this minute?",
  "I just want to ask one question. Don't they have a claim interpreted favorably to them that this has nothing to do with a contract, totally nothing? Okay? But there happen to be some rules over there in the CIA in their books somewhere, which we've never read, and they say when we use a foreign person as a spy, we'll pay him some money or we give him something. We have some procedures. Now, we don't have to do that as a matter of contract. We don't have to do it at all, but we do it. And so there's a claim here that we want to see that they're following their own rules. They say Totten doesn't apply to that because Totten is about contracts. Our claim isn't about contracts.",
  "But it doesn't extend to torts, does it?",
  "Oh, you go -­",
  "You go ahead. You go ahead.",
  "So -- so you're saying if in fact, when you look at those allegations, they're about regulations for handling secret contracts, it's about a contract, but if there were to be an allegation that it has nothing to do with the contract at all, it's just a way we handle retired foreign spies, Smiley for example, or someone like that. It has nothing to do with it, you see. Then could they -- what would be the rules then?",
  "What is a PL -­",
  "What is a PL-110 settlee?",
  "Okay. So you would say this -­",
  "Are -- are you claiming that your answer to Justice Souter's question is we will assume for purposes of this case -- we're not admitting whether it's true or not, but we're going to assume we're not spies -­",
  "-- because we win even if we're not spies because we are essential persons?",
  "All right, but my guess is -­ well, he's pushed you and it sounds like it to me -- that the only basis on which you could say you were an essential person is that you're a spy.",
  "He's -- he's not a scientist. He's not a -­",
  "Do we have to change Totten? Because, look, what I'm now thinking is, A, if you're suing on a contract, you win because you're a spy, if you win. If you're suing on promissory estoppel, you win because you're a spy, if you win. If you're suing on PL­ 110, you win because you're a spy, and if you're suing on due process, you win because you're a spy. So no matter what, you can't win unless you're a spy. Now, they -- they have Totten, and it -- it -­ that sounds to me as if you're there. And do we have to overturn Totten for you to win?",
  "Perry v. Sindermann. Is that -- that's the nontenured teacher?",
  "There's no property right there, I don't think. I've always taught that as a ground that it wasn't compared to Roth where there was. All right. So -- so -- but there was a First Amendment interest of some kind.",
  "You're probably right if they have -- I see what you're saying.",
  "Then it will be worse for them. I mean, they say, look, frankly we'd rather reveal the names of one or two spies than we would like to reveal our procedures for dealing with the spies we bring into the United States. It will take someone who reads those about 15 minutes with a computer to locate 400 resettled spies. That will be a terrible disaster.",
  "What's your answer? What is your response?",
  "Why does not having a possessory right mean that the city could tax them, or the State?",
  "No, I'm just thinking, that suppose you have a reservation but the tribe doesn't have a possessory right because in the middle of the reservation, there is some kind of long-term lease or a sale to a house that's owned by somebody else who is not a member of the tribe. I would think -- am I right that the city or the county in which that reservation sits can't tax it anyway?",
  "I know that, but I mean, then it seems to me if one thing that Oneida establishes is that the whole title doesn't just disappear if nothing else happens, simply because of the passage of time.",
  "Is what?",
  "Now we agree with that or I'll hypothetically agree with that. They can't come in and eject people. But then I'm back to my first question, because I take it that the refusal in Oneida to the suggestion that they can't go, say, to Buffalo, New York, or wherever, or some town and throw everybody out of the house, that that, of course, does reflect the passage of time. But for a city or State to tax the land, that doesn't involve the same kind of interference with people's expectation of living in the houses that they bought, that throwing someone out of his house would involve.",
  "I thought that perhaps the Treaty of Buffalo Creek is thinking of 50,000 acres where these particular Indian tribe members had their homes, or at least arguably. Just no one was thinking about the remaining 300,000 because they had long left those. It had nothing to do with them.",
  "What is the precise language that you think relinquished, changed the sovereignty that -- changed the sovereignty?",
  "What happens about -- suppose -- I just want to follow this. You don't evict the people who are there but it's 22 square miles in the center of New York State. That's a lot of land. And maybe that's worth a trillion dollars, I don't know. So does that mean that the Indian tribe would have -- would it mean that it had the right to, let's say, hundreds of billions of dollars, the value of that property, that it could sue someone for it, the State of New York or the Federal Government? I guess the State of New York?",
  "What was the acreage there?",
  "Well, that may not be worth as much. Maybe this includes several cities and towns? What do you think it is? I mean in other words, the answer to my question is in principle, yes. In principle, if the Indian tribe owns 22 square miles, even if they can't get possession, they're entitled to the value of it, in your opinion?",
  "No, no, of course the people who are there have it, but maybe it's not Buffalo. I don't know, maybe it's all of Buffalo, New York, or maybe it's a town. I'm not saying that that's the law but I just wanted your view of that. And then I wanted to know this, that on the legal part, I would like your response to the -- I take it your answer is yes, they're entitled to the value of it. I'm right about that, that is your answer?",
  "What do you say on the merits, then, to the claim that there were 300,000 of these acres in 1838 or with the Treaty of Buffalo Creek -- there were 300,000 acres that nobody was paying any attention to because there were no tribe members that lived there, so that when you have language in the treaty, under those circumstances, that says their home is now -- where was it? Illinois or - -",
  "Kansas. Their home is now in Kansas. That's the nation. That's the place. And that - - you've heard the language cited. And even though a person says, \"You can live here as long as you want,\" that just means they can live there as long as they want; that doesn't mean it's the reservation. The reservation's sovereignty may have gone to Kansas, though, of course, nobody had to move, unless he struck a fair bargain that he agreed to with the State of New York. I take it that's their argument. I just want to hear your response.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, that may be true, but that's why I wondered about the damage part of it. That is, I'm still thinking that a trespass action for trespasses that occurred in 1850 or 1700 is worth millions today, even if it's tiny, because of the interest, passage of time, et cetera. When you add that to the value of the land, I'm thinking of numbers that are astronomical. And yet that hasn't happened. And so, what actually, as a -- and that's why I'm thinking, isn't a damage action far more serious than simply taking property off the tax rolls?",
  "And that's why I want to know how, in practice, this works out. Does Congress have the power, for example, to deal with it? Is what we're considering in this case simply a negotiating position and strengthening people's hands, vis a vis legislation? What's going on?",
  "It's typical. I mean, what I have in the statistics is that about 36 percent of all the habeases are dismissed for failure to exhaust, and 93 percent of all of the habeas petitioners are pro se. Now, the conclusions I draw for that is it's probably these pro se people -- I mean, 93 percent are pro se -- that will get the procedural dismissals, and certainly a third or so, if we agree with you, of all of the habeas petitions filed in -- in Federal court are going to be finished, terminated. The door is closed because it takes a Federal court about nine months on average to process a habeas. Now, you just take that and you say, we've closed the door of the Federal court to a third of all the habeas petitioners. And if I had thought that Congress wanted that, then I might say fine. But I thought that Duncan -- and I know I was on the other side of the case, but I felt the majority had a pretty good point on the language, to tell you the truth. But what I didn't think they had such a -- I mean, I couldn't find much of a congressional purpose one way or the other there. I thought the purpose of the statute of limitations is really to get people to file their petitions. Once they file them, they have a year but it's tolled. You know, I mean, you understand the thing. I -- I'm really looking for you to tell me some tremendously strong congressional purpose that's served so strong that you want to knock a third of the petitioners out of Federal court forever.",
  "That's pretty simple.",
  "The door is closed forever. I mean -­",
  "They seem to have made a mistake here quite a lot. Why do these statistics come out the way they do? I mean, it is just as easy.",
  "I agree with you. Why -- why aren't they filing -- why -- why are they all filing so many, 36 percent filing in the wrong court? Why is that?",
  "But I don't agree with that you were saying or you do agree with that, I know. The -- but the -- the question that I would have is, is there anything the other way? I mean, in Duncan, you know, I was dissenting and the thing that sort of moved me is I couldn't imagine Congress really cared about this. I mean, what they do is they want to have you file within a year. And they say, well, but if you filed within a year and you're in State court, we don't care anymore. You're being -- if you file in the wrong State court, you're tolled. We don't really care once you're proceeding. And now, however, if you go in -- into Federal court by mistake instead of State court by mistake, well, you're out of luck on a random basis. Some judges will get you back in on time. Other judges won't. Is there anything in the history or anywhere -­ I -- I'm interested in the history from your point of view, as much as the other. Is there anything that suggests that Congress cared about that?",
  "Either way.",
  "Why is it difficult to figure out what the Ninth Circuit was thinking? I -- I found it -- am I right? I thought they said the -- the seller says we found gold. The stock sells for $60. They have loads of experts who say in the absence of that statement, which was a lie, we found gold, it would have sold for $10. The loss is $50. I mean, I take it that's their theory.",
  "All right. Now, what's wrong with that theory?",
  "It's clear. I mean, it's certainly clear.",
  "Yes. They say it caused the loss, $50.",
  "Is there any other problem? I'm trying to get a list of what the problems are with the simple theory. Now, I've heard one that you've ratified.",
  "And -- and is there any other?",
  "Now, can we -- can they prove this? $60. $50 is wrong, is inflated because of the gold. It turns out that gold never existed and they knew it. The stock is not selling for $60 anymore. It's selling for $200. They found platinum. No one expected it. All right. They want to prove maybe it is selling for $200, but if we had found gold as well, it would have sold for $250. Can they do it?",
  "It's a loss. $250 versus $200.",
  "If that's so then -- then on the platinum/gold theory, you can't really recover what would have happened if there had been gold because it might be that the stock would have been worth $400 if there had been gold even though 15 years earlier when he only paid $50 for it, he's only out of pocket, at most, $50. But if there had been gold, because of the gold market in the world, it would have been a lot more valuable. And you're saying he can't do that? I don't know. Maybe that question isn't in the case, but that strikes me as a difficult question.",
  "But surely they wanted to have a person be able to read a complaint and just understand what it's about in a securities fraud case. And I don't see how you could understand it unless you have in the complaint what your theory is. That's all. Nobody is asking for some facts. Is your theory that the loss took place at the time the person bought the stock because he overpaid $30? Is your theory that the stock went down and, because of that, he lost the money? Is your theory that the stock didn't go down but it would have gone up more? All they're asking is not for evidence, but a simple, clear explanation of the theory, and plead in the alternative if you want. But I mean, what's the problem? Why is that so hard to do?",
  "And this case doesn't seem to do it. I looked through the entire complaint. I found exactly two paragraphs. I didn't. My law clerk did, frankly.",
  "But I told him to underline it. In paragraph 179, he found the word, and it caused damage. Okay? And in paragraph 177, it says the same. That's all he could find. And they were harmed. That's what it says.",
  "But it sounds to me as if the things you're saying now are matters for proof, and I -- I think the wiggle room in the Government's position was it said it has to be disclosed to the market in some form or other. Well, if you're prepared to be broad and turn those over to the experts for the proof, you end up with your theory. The -- the inflation comes out and it comes out because they didn't get the earnings that they would have had or there may be many reasons.",
  "Well, you just have to say at the pleading stage what your theory is.",
  "All right. But then you're not saying what I think Justice Scalia and I actually thought you were going to say which is that the minute he pays $60 for a stock that should be worth $30 but is $60 because of the lie, at that instant he suffered a loss. After listening to you, I now think you're saying -- but I'm not sure because I've heard you say things that are -- both -­ I now think you're saying, no, he has not suffered a loss until later on when that $30 comes out of the price of the stock.",
  "It might come out in many different ways. It could come out because he announces I'm a liar.",
  "It could come out because he doesn't say anything but it sort of oozes out as earning reports come in, but it has to come out. Now, if you're saying that, then I find what you're saying consistent what I think Judge Posner said. And that's really what I'm interested in because I read what he said. It seemed to me right. Now -­",
  "When we have this happy agreement and if you'll agree, you at least have to prove what you -- you have to plead what you intend to do, that is, you have to plead and there was a loss and this is my theory. I would like to know -- maybe we won't get beyond this, but in looking at this, I wondered now suppose that the stock goes up in value because of extraneous things. Can you recover because it would have been still higher?",
  "What happens with the transaction causation? Because I think you'd probably say with your transaction causation in the -- in the case that the -- that the lie wasn't there, we wouldn't have bought the stock.",
  "All right. If you say that, they come along and say, okay, you wouldn't have bought the stock. I'll tell you, here's one bad thing happened. You lost your $30. But there were six good things that happened that you never thought of, and so the stocks were four times what it would have been and you'd never have those gains, just as you'd never have the losses. How does that factor?",
  "But that's a -­",
  "What's the problem here? He -­ I mean, well, you heard what he said. And it sounded to me that he agrees with you he has to prove that in fact the fraud not only led to the overpayment, but that also later on the client who bought the stock lost money because the market went down, and that default, which cost him the money, is caused by the fraud.",
  "When it comes out, it just comes out in subtle ways as well as direct ways. Now, do you agree with that? If they -- if you do, it seems to me there's no case here.",
  "Where do you disagree?",
  "And when it could have been discovered I guess if he had taken due diligence and gone and made the motion within a year, at least, of his having been convicted in the Federal court. I mean, I don't see how you can have it both ways. You want us to read that phrase very broadly to include under the word facts something like a vacatur, and then it sounds to me you're being very literal and linguistic when you say that due diligence to find the facts shouldn't mean what I would take it as ordinarily meaning, that -- that you have to, when you had a chance, go back and generate this fact.",
  "I don't see how you can do both, in other words.",
  "On the pure English language, it's not exactly a fact.",
  "I mean, it's a legal determination. We usually separate law from fact.",
  "It is right? Because I thought that Justice Souter provided that, but you don't because if you're relegated to (4) -- let's say it becomes final quickly. If you're relegated to (4), what you're saying is the date on which the facts supporting the claim could have been discovered, if this is a conviction that took place 10 years earlier, you are saying the date on which those facts could have been discovered was 9 years earlier or whenever he could have brought it -- brought the claim in the -- in the State court.",
  "So, therefore, it is not true that he always has that year.",
  "Yes.",
  "But if the date of judgment became final prior to the running of (4), then he would not have a year.",
  "All right. Now, my question actually is the -- aside from Justice Souter's practical point, it seemed to me that the language here is different from Daniels and different in the other cases. The language is the date on which facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered. And facts supporting the claim prior to there being a claim are not facts supporting the claim. And therefore, it seems as if it would run no later than the moment when he presents the Federal claim. No earlier than that could it run. So you have a year from the time that you present the Federal claim. At that point, all those facts that could have been discovered earlier, now he has a year to call them to the attention of the court. And of course, for reasons that you point out, this is certainly a fact that could have been discovered earlier. He could have brought his motion long before. So what's wrong with that? It combines the practical reason that Justice Souter mentioned with the language of the statute.",
  "I'm certainly not taking -­ advocating the -- the defendant's position. I'm advocating the position as follows. Suppose it were not a vacatur. Suppose it were a DNA test, and suppose it were a fact that the DNA test identified a different perpetrator of a long-gone State crime and it was definite. Now, if no one thought of running that DNA test, although they should have, until 4 years after the Federal conviction, he's out of luck. He has 1 year from the Federal conviction, and that 1 year he has to, during that year, do everything, including bringing facts into being, such as the result of the DNA test, that he had not previously done. And that's consistent with the language. It avoids Justice Souter's practical problem, and it does not impose an unreasonable burden on the Government, I wouldn't think, because he has just a year from conviction.",
  "You certainly -- wouldn't you be making the opposite argument if it were a DNA test? If it were a DNA test, you would certainly be arguing that even though the results didn't come into existence until 32 years after his Federal conviction, that he could have discovered it 38 years before because he could have asked that the test then be performed.",
  "All right. Then -- then once you admit that, you're going to have to find a difference between this and the DNA test, or your position here, if adopted, will catch you out there.",
  "Is this the document that's on the lodging at page 31-34?",
  "What about a rule that says you must consult the file of the case that's being used by the prosecutor to produce seriously aggravating circumstance, at least where that file is readily available, and you must follow up indications in that file that suggest a significant mitigating defense?",
  "All right.",
  "I understand that. You're repeating that point which -- so I might ask this question on this very point.",
  "My question is this, that I take it on page L31 is the record that existed in this horrendous rape '74 case with Jo, whatever, the woman, the bartender. And the prosecution was making an enormous amount out of that. We've just heard about it. That's true, isn't it? Am I right about the case? Have I got that right?",
  "Yes. This is -- I'm thinking of it correctly, that this is the record in the case that the prosecution made a lot out of.",
  "I'm -- I'm back with Justice Stevens then and I wonder how it's possible a lawyer wouldn't look at the record in that very case if only to see if the prosecutor is characterizing the situation accurately. And had he done so, he would have seen on the next page, alcohol problems. He would have seen a complete list of siblings, and he would have seen, four pages later, a one-page list of criminal behavior with identification of crimes that took place when he was a child. That's all true. Now, if he had then noticed these early criminal records when he was a 17-year-old and simply gotten the record in that one, he would have come across the document that is on page L44 and L45 which says, among other things, Ronald comes from the notorious Rompilla family. And then there is a list of why they are called the notorious Rompilla family which is fairly horrendous. Now, I do not understand how any person, getting the first record, wouldn't have been led to the second, and I do not understand how any person who read pages 44 and 45 of the second would not have thought what the siblings are telling me is wrong. I better go check on a few more siblings who happen to have their names and addresses here right in the pieces of paper he's looking at. And he would then have discovered this absolutely horrendous background that Judge Sloviter mentions. So I do not understand why that one incident, leaving aside all the other ones, but I do not understand why that one failure to consult the record that is being used by the prosecutor horrendously against him is not a failure.",
  "Do you agree with that?",
  "No. We don't -- you agree with that or not?",
  "You either agree with Justice Kennedy or not.",
  "You do agree. All right. Now, if you -­",
  "I mean, my question, obviously, is, is not the reason that you want to examine the criminal record in the case that is being used horrendously against your client is to find out both as to what happened at the time and also the background that would be relevant in respect to your client? For example, alcohol abuse, which happened to be checked.",
  "But a rap sheet and so forth will not have normally what this person is like. You're dealing with a client who has serious problems of some kind as the crimes themselves reveal. They're terrible.",
  "And -- and so I -- don't you think it's a reasonable -- or do you think it's a reasonable constitutional requirement to say that where cases of prior history of the client are being used by the prosecution to say what a terrible person he is -- and he may be -- that you -- the -- the lawyer in a capital case at least should look at the court records in that case to learn something about what this human being is like and why? Because court records, but not rap sheets do contain that kind of thing.",
  "Well, the serious question to me is -- is -- in many of these cases which we see, there are horrendous child abuse histories, and child abuse is a terribly difficult thing to get at and it's something that might not convince most juries of anything because they're all over the place. But nonetheless, counsel should have to make a reasonable decision about whether to take the child abuse route or to take some other route. And would it cause constitutional harm, that is, would it cause harm even from a prosecutorial point of view, if you just said, well, you should follow up and look at records of prior cases being used against you to see if you get a clue there?",
  "I'm not sure why that would be if you, in fact, see the statute as trying to impose an APA-like structure, saying to the States, you decide the substance, we'll give you minimum elements of form, which helps your position. Then if the minimum elements of form are not specifically stated in the statute, there's no reason to interfere with the States. Let them do what they want. Only those minimum elements are what you can't do. That works perfectly for you.",
  "It's strongly supported in the history. It may lose your client the money. I don't know.",
  "So then you're only -­",
  "Congress didn't care.",
  "Congress wanted to substitute a Federal judgment for the judgment of the States where it said so. And the reason you know that is because that is what is consistent with the purpose of the act and other things are either neutral or negative. Don't interfere with the State unless you have to.",
  "No. How could that be? Wouldn't it depend on whether -- when you look at the particular statute, the particular set of remedies that Congress has included in that statute could be absolutely independent of 1983 or dependent upon 1983 or leaning in favor or leaning against. It would depend on the particular statute. Why in general?",
  "Well, the other word is inconsistent, and is it -- sorry. Were you -- is it inconsistent if Congress didn't want it? And if that's insufficient to be inconsistent, then here, as I look at the statute, to get out my thinking, I think that it sounds like an administrative law statute. If I saw the maintenance and cure words, I'd think it was an admiralty statute.",
  "I see an administrative law statute. It sounds like that's the system they're imposing and therefore a system that is not consistent with the administrative law system fails and 1983 seems to fail.",
  "Well, that's --",
  "-- that's why I'm approaching it differently, and I -- I want to get your view on it. I'm taking the word inconsistent and I'm using that as a guide back into the purpose of the statute. And once I do that, I find Congress here anxious, I think, to engage in what I'd call cooperative federalism. They could have run the whole show, but they said we don't want the FCC. We want each city and town to do what they want, subject to a few minimal procedural requirements. If that's right, that means all these damages questions are open. All kinds of things are open, but -­ and we'll decide them in a variety of ways, maybe deferring to the State, but one thing is true: 1983 doesn't apply because that is a different set of remedies.",
  "That isn't the only -­",
  "The other -- the other harm is there any evidence of because it's -- it would also be harmful if local zoning boards, when faced with quite difficult decisions, because the -- the antenna -- they bristle up and you put them in the wrong place. They're environmentally harmful. They -- there are a lot of bad things, as well as good things about them. And of course, it would be a bad impact if we discovered that the zoning boards were erring too much on the side of granting everybody's application, as well as too much on the side of not granting them.",
  "And so I -- I don't know how -­ what the -- there won't be evidence. How can we get evidence on such a thing?",
  "I guess there's a difference here between the interest of a small party and a large one. A small party would like, if there is a deadline, to be as close to the election as possible so voters have a chance to get fed up with the two big parties.",
  "That's their chance. A big party would like it to be further away because then they can plan how their election campaign is going to be. Has any of this been litigated below?",
  "Why is that inconsistent? Because I mean, you're -- you're basically advocating that the Constitution requires Alaska's rule, and I thought that -- we got briefs on that, I think, in -- in the previous case and a lot of other parties thought Alaska's rule was not a wise rule, though that's up to Alaska. But to think that the Constitution requires that is surprising. The interest they assert is just the one you said -­",
  "-- that the Republicans, in order to have their party work, have to be able to plan a campaign for a stable group of voters. They have to know, roughly, who is in their party, let's say, a week before or 2 weeks before, some period of time before. And that's the interest that Oklahoma is asserting. It has nothing to do with you. It has do with -- and it has zero to do with you if you had a rule for minor parties, frankly. But if you can't get a rule for minor parties, special, then you have to take it seriously I think.",
  "What's your answer? What do you respond -­",
  "The States do but to say that the Constitution -- and I'm asking. You see, I'm not -­ but I -- if I could figure out how in the Constitution you had a special rule for minor parties, the interest that they're asserting has very little to do with it. But I don't see how you can have a constitutional rule that would forbid -- allow you to open and drain, but wouldn't allow the Dems to do the same as they've done in Alaska.",
  "Well, because they say -- what they're thinking, I take it -- I don't know what they're really thinking, but I imagine they could be thinking, no, we don't want to open our primary. We'll run the risk that our voters go over and vote for the Dems and like it there and stay. We'll run that risk, but we don't want them coming and raiding us. We think that's the bigger risk.",
  "And how can the Constitution tell them that they can't make that judgment? That's what's bothering me.",
  "Go back to my interest, the one I asserted -­",
  "-- which isn't that. It is the interest in the Republican Party in Alaska saying to itself we do not want our voters to go leave and vote for the Democrats because we want a stable body of people 3 or 4 weeks before the election for whom we can plan. We don't want to open ours because we don't want the raiding. We want to keep -­",
  "No, no. It's not an ownership, but you have a period of time. So you focus on the period of time. They're saying, of course, up to X period of time, they take their choice. Is this a fake thing, a fake reason, the need to have a stable group of people for whom you plan your campaigns? Now, is that a hoax or is it flimsy or is it serious? What do you think?",
  "Then -- then if you say that -­ I want you to just respond in detail to the questions that I think Justice Scalia and Justice Souter were asking, as I understand it, putting it dramatically, that if you win this case, Alaska's system becomes the Constitution of the United States. Now, that I know you think is not so, and I want to know why.",
  "Would there be a way -­ suppose, for hypothetical purposes, the Court were to say -- you got a ruling that said there is no rule in the Constitution that forbids a State, as a general matter, to forbid this cross registration, this jumping, for a reasonable time. But a reasonable time has to take into account the interests of minor as well as major parties. Now are you foreclosed because of the circumstances of this case from litigating whether 8 weeks is a reasonable time and whether the disjunct between the period where you become a party and that 8 weeks is unreasonable in the circumstances or other specific things that you say work to the disadvantage of the Libertarians?",
  "Justice Douglas says there that as long as it's an objective within Congress and legislature's legitimate grant of power, they can do it, I mean, as long as there's a -- so why does there have to be a limit within that broad limit?",
  "Of course, there can't, purely. But there is no taking for private use that you could imagine in reality that wouldn't also have a public benefit of some kind, whether it's increasing jobs or increasing taxes, et cetera. That's a fact of the world. And so given that fact of the world, that is law, why shouldn't the law say, okay, virtually every taking is all right, as long as there is some public benefit which there always is and it's up to the legislature.",
  "Because?",
  "No. It could only be taken if there is a public use and there almost always is. Now, do you agree with that, or do you not agree with my last empirical statement?",
  "Now, that's, of course, my question. The question is, if you agree with the empirical statement that there almost always is some public benefit attached, then my question is, why must there be a limit within that broad framework?",
  "What's the latter. I mean, I understand the former. That's a big retreat and it comes to me now you're getting to what I think is a possible realm of reason here. But the second part now you said and minimum standards. What minimum standards?",
  "No, I mean, are you advocating particular ones?",
  "The remaining test is the --",
  "Can I ask you about the standard. Go back for a second.",
  "I gather that the Iowa courts have a standard that includes whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the intended public use will take place. Now, is that the standard you're advocating?",
  "Is there a lot of disagreement about this?",
  "I mean, it seems to me you might -- whether there is a reasonable assurance that there will in fact be the public use which the state uses as the justification for taking the property. Is that going to help you that much?",
  "Well, I mean, I don't see how this Court could get into the business of saying you have to have this by a particular day or you have to have 14 witnesses. I mean, we couldn't impose that sort of thing, could we?",
  "There needs to be a reasonable assurance.",
  "Well, they might well need it here.",
  "But he doesn't -- he doesn't, his second test does not adopt that. The second test which he was arguing at the end is just that there has to be a reasonable assurance that the public use, and it could include all those things, will in fact take place.",
  "That may be, but what do you think of that test?",
  "Well, can't the courts at least -- can't the courts, could the courts -- do you object to this, and I'm not advocating it, I want your reaction.",
  "Could the courts, under this clause, at least review what you've just said for reasonableness? I mean, look at the reasonableness of a claim that this is for - - basically for a public use. Look at the reasonableness of the claim that we should do it this way, rather than excusing the people who don't want to sell their houses no matter what and doing it a little bit differently. Reasonableness is a concept that's already in the Constitution in terms of what the legislature can do, but I'm thinking of the stronger kind of reasonableness review that you might have in an administrative action. Now, is, Overton Park, if you want a case. Is that a possible kind of review that you might find appropriate here?",
  "Well, the reason that you would apply a somewhat higher standard is because the rational basis, with tremendous deference, applies to the power of Congress to act in an economic area in the absence of a particular constitutional provision designed to protect a minority from the actions of the majority. And if you read that public purpose doctrine, a section here as having that in mind, you might want a somewhat higher level of review. Now, that's the whole thing spelled out. I'm not advocating it. But I am putting it forward to get - - to get your reaction.",
  "Oh, and indeed with equal protection, we very often do have a somewhat higher standard of review.",
  "That may be. Now, that's why I'm back to reasonableness. You see, we are told in the briefs that the people who often might hold out, might be doing so to get more money, but it might also be because they are poor, they are not well connected politically, and their only hope is to go to a court and stop this thing. So you'd give them two weapons. Weapon one is you have to pay them. That's correct. Compensation. And weapon two is they can put you to a test of being reasonable. That might be quite a deferential test, so you might have every leg up. But they at least could catch the instances where this is really not reasonable to do to them what you're doing to them that they don't want.",
  "No, I'm accepting that you can't make that kind of a distinction. That's where I'm focusing on a test that would possibly apply only where you transfer property from one private person to another, but still wouldn't make those distinctions of blight or not blight.",
  "That's true. But now, put yourself in the position of the homeowner. I take it, if it's a forced sale, it's at the market value, the individual, let's say it's someone who has lived in his house his whole life. He bought the house for $50,000. It's worth half a million. He has 450,000 profit. He pays 30 percent to the Government and the state in taxes, and then he has to live somewhere. Well, I mean, what's he supposed to do? He now has probably 350,000 to pay for a house. He gets half a house because that's all he is going to do, all he is going to get for that money after he paid the taxes, or whatever. And I mean, there are a lot of -- and he has to move and so forth. So going back to Justice Kennedy's point, is there some way of assuring that the just compensation actually puts the person in the position he would be in if he didn't have to sell his house? Or is he inevitably worse off?",
  "What is the remedy? Let's repose the problem to which I want to remedy then. And maybe this isn't the right remedy. But the remedy that they are saying, and I'm really repeating it, is an individual has a house and they want to be really not made a lot worse off, at least not made a lot worse off just so some other people can get a lot more money. Now what, what is the right -- is there no constitutional protection? If this isn't the right case, what is?",
  "Suppose -- suppose a person has a piece of property, and they zone it suddenly, no building -- no building -- which destroys the value of the property pretty much. Now, should we just -- I think those might be the cases where this language began to appear, something like that. Should that be just a simple rational basis review too? Because I'm trying to put the case where it might be -- arguably you should have something stronger since the property value is -- is seriously hurt and --",
  "No. They're going to say, well, we can imagine a reason, but if you look at it realistically, you know there's no good reason.",
  "I mean, if you put your mind to it, you can make one up, which is sort of the test for rational basis in the economic context. But as soon as we become more realistic, there isn't much of a reason. It can't satisfy the stronger test, though it could satisfy the weaker.",
  "What are we supposed to do, to return to Justice Scalia's question, with the fact that this appears -- I counted about 12 cases, I mean, where it implicitly or explicitly appears, something like it. Are we supposed to just, oh, say all those cases were wrong and -- what are we supposed to do about that?",
  "What about Moore?",
  "What about Moore?",
  "Yes, City of East Cleveland where they had the grandmother and the -- the --",
  "So -- so we might still keep a -- a stronger test where a zoning ordinance affects the number of people that could live in a house or --",
  "Or who could live in the house.",
  "Grandparents --",
  "And then the question, of course, is let's imagine you're either right or you're wrong as to its being a regulatory taking. And maybe if it's -- they have no reason for it at all, they can't do it. Period. And if they have some reason for it, even a sort of bad one, they can do it. But if that's the context -- we're in the game where they can do it -- why should it matter, in respect to paying compensation, whether their reason is quite a good one or just barely good enough? And that's -- that's the puzzle, I think, that the other side is putting to you, and I must say I'm rather moved by their argument because it seems to me whether it's a very good reason or just a barely adequate reason has nothing to do with whether they should pay compensation.",
  "But the burden on --",
  "Maybe I'm not -- I thought -- are we in the world in which you agree the government can do it even though their reason -- or is your basic argument, no, they can't do this at all? In which case it's not a compensation question. It's a question of whether the Constitution of the United States forbids them from doing it. Period.",
  "It's a compensation issue.",
  "Well, the -- let me go back to my question because I haven't heard the answer. And I'm in a world, imaginative if you like, where Hawaii passes this statute, and what we're interested in is not whether they can do it, but whether they have to pay compensation. And my question is, what in heaven's name has the goodness or badness of their reason to do with that question? After all, I can imagine instances in which their reason for the regulation is pretty bad. It just barely survives, and they shouldn't have to pay. And I can imagine cases where their reason is wonderful and they should have to pay or maybe they shouldn't. It's neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition. It has nothing to do with whether you should have to pay. Now, that's their argument I think, or at least as I understand it, and I want you to explain to me why the goodness or badness of the reason, once it has passed the minimal point, has anything to do with whether you should have to pay compensation.",
  "Holmes said, though he didn't hold that -- what he said was you have to pay when the regulation, a legitimate regulation, goes too far. So I will repeat. Why does the goodness or badness of the reason, past the minimal point, have anything to do with whether a regulation goes too far?",
  "But he -- he didn't go into this question. Let me give you an example that will make it clear. Let's take a case where there's the best reason in the world, fabulous reason. We're taking this property to build a highway, which is absolutely necessary. Would you suggest that compensation doesn't have to be paid?",
  "Of course, it does. Now, let me suggest the other side of the coin, a really terrible reason. You cannot build your house without using metal pipes. That's our building reg in this State. Now, everybody knows -- I'm imagining anyway -- plastic pipes are just as good, but not quite, so they have a barely adequate reason. Do you think that they have to pay compensation to have a general building code saying you can't use plastic pipes?",
  "Well, it is an -- it does regulate the use of your property and it means added cost, in fact, several thousand dollars added cost, to the building of a house, and come up here and argue we agree there's a rational reason, but it isn't so you can do it, but it isn't a really good reason, not substantial. Now, do you think that has anything to do with paying compensation?",
  "Explain it -- explain your theory in terms of the example. That is, imagine that the benefits of the network of dealers of gasoline into the community are fabulous and obvious. So there's a great reason for doing this. Now, why is it that, on your theory, the government shouldn't have to pay compensation then, but it should have to pay compensation just because the benefits are not obvious, that they're bizarre, that they don't -- may not really exist? That's -- you see why I'm having a problem?",
  "Is it concurrent? I mean, the -- the statute I'm reading, the one you brought is consent is given to join the United States as a necessary party defendant. Is that what happened here? They were joined as a necessary party defendant?",
  "They were? I -- I think that's -- isn't that -- what rule of -- I thought there's a -- a Rule of Federal Procedure. I can't remember what -­ what's the -­",
  "Yes. Is that what they were joined under?",
  "No. Well, all right. Were they -- there's technical phrase well known in the law to be joined as a necessary party defendant. Given the normal meaning in the law of that technical phrase, is that what happened here?",
  "No, okay. If it did not happen, then how could you possibly sue in that court rather than the Court of Claims where the statute says you can sue on any implied, as well as express, contract?",
  "It doesn't mean in any suit in sentence 2 of the kind referred to in sentence 1? Does it mean any suit in the universe? Any suit in the world? Any tort suit? I would have thought that sentence 2 refers to sentence 1.",
  "But don't -- how can we, if we have -- if -- if I read this -- this as meaning technically what it says and it's a jurisdictional matter, how could I do anything other than say, go to the Court of Claims, you're in the wrong court?",
  "Yes. It says -­",
  "-- in any suit you can join the United States as a necessary party.",
  "Well, but it's a -- see, I want to know what I'm supposed to do. As I read the language, you're out. As I understand the purpose of the statute, it makes sense to me if you're out, and it doesn't make sense to me if you're in. And maybe there's some lower court precedent to the contrary, which I'd certainly read, but is there any Supreme Court precedent to the contrary that supports you?",
  "No, no. But that isn't the limiting part. The limiting part is in any suit of a certain kind.",
  "What they give consent to is joinder as a necessary party. And that is not what happened here.",
  "It's ordinary meaning, you're out because the ordinary meaning of joinder as a necessary party is you weren't joined as a -­",
  "How does that help you? Because it says any suit pursuant to this section, and of course, this section starts off by talking about addition of a person as a necessary party. So how does the last sentence help you?",
  "You -- you agree with that. I -- you're caught in between us here, and I understand.",
  "And I guess we have to figure out what is the right meaning of that initial phrase.",
  "So that -- so your view -- I mean, what -- what makes sense to me is that the section means what it says, that consent is given to join the United States. That means join them in an ongoing suit. And it makes sense because what the United States wants is anyone who sues them for money damages goes to the Court of Claims. But of course, where you have an ongoing suit between two other people, we'll make an exception because there it's already in another district and we'll let you bring the United States in as a necessary party. The other exception is when you don't sue for money damages. That's in section 702 of the APA. Now, that to me makes a lot of sense and it's consistent with the language. Is that your view or do you have a different view?",
  "I guess the reason that you would sue the district would be if you didn't have any enforceable promise from the United States that they didn't -- wouldn't do it.",
  "Now, you think you do. That's the issue in the case.",
  "And so therefore -- therefore, I'm looking for where that promise is. And you started out by citing a page, which wasn't a page of the contract. It was a page of some kind of settlement, and that page said that the district agrees that they entered into the contract with helping the farmers in mind. I'm sure they did. So what. I mean, I might buy a house with the idea of helping of my child. I'm going to give it to him. That doesn't mean he can enforce the contract.",
  "You mean my child can enforce a contract I enter into with another -- I buy a house and I say I intend to give it to my daughter.",
  "And then she can enforce the contract?",
  "Yes. If the contract says. Now, that's why I was interested that you didn't cite language in the contract.",
  "You -- well, I mean, you started out by referring me to page 110 or 111 -­",
  "-- which doesn't. Now, what is the language in the contract -­",
  "-- that helps you the most?",
  "So what -­",
  "So if they do, it's not finished.",
  "Yes, all right. I'll ask them that.",
  "Well, the problem that bothers me -- and I don't know that there's an answer to it -- is you have plaintiff. Plaintiff goes into State court. He brings a lawsuit, a tort suit, a contract suit. And then he decides he'd also like to go to Federal court. He brings exactly the same suit. And here we have two suits and exactly the same thing running along at the same time. Now, I know there are principles from this Court's case law that says, well, that's what's supposed to happen. They've always bothered me. But now let's take a special instance. The special instance is that in court one in the State, the plaintiff loses. Now, what he decides to do is to say to the Federal court, we want you to review what they did in the State court. Can't do that. Right?",
  "Okay. So he brilliantly figures out I will omit the word review from my -- from my motion. I will ask for precisely the same thing just not use that word review. I will ask them to go and make their decision which happens to be -- in my opinion should be -- 100 percent the opposite of what the State court did showing they're wrong. But I won't use the word review. Now, you say because he cut the word review out, he can do it.",
  "Well, but can you -- can you expand on this a little? I'm not taking a view on it. I'm trying to clear up what's a confusion in my mind. I see how you could do this on the parallel business with -­ with delaying it on the docket and using the doctrine of preclusion. I understand that. But we've still got this doctrine called Rooker­ Feldman out there, and as long as you have that doctrine, it strikes me as odd if -- say, it weren't a plaintiff. Say it was the losing party, you know, that was asking the Federal judge, Judge, you have this case on your docket. Let's move it up. Let's decide it now. He doesn't use the word review, but everything else is the same. He wants a decision out of that court that is going to be the opposite of what the State court did. And what's concerning me -- maybe I shouldn't be concerned, but what's concerning me is whether he can get it or not seems to turn completely on whether he uses the word review in the petition.",
  "Now, suppose you don't have the check. What's left?",
  "Why?",
  "You have a judgment.",
  "I never heard of a case that isn't over until you get the check. I thought the case is over when you have the judgment.",
  "And then if they don't give you the check, you have a different matter. We have to get it enforced.",
  "Well, you're still asking for cert.",
  "Well, then why is it moot? Because something could happen. We might get this case in theory, take it on cert, and discover a jurisdictional problem that somehow destroys the case without a decision, and should that happen, there luckily for them they have this other case going. So as long as -- you're prepared, I take it, to say you're going to ask for cert. If that's what you're going to say, I don't see how the case is over. It's up to you.",
  "All right. If for -- somehow you won on that, even though it sounds a little like a State law issue, but nonetheless, if you won on that and they reversed it as a statute of limitations, then what they're saying is, well, that's just why we filed in Federal court. We didn't want the Federal court to review the State court. We wanted our Federal court suit as an insurance policy in case something goes wrong with the State court suit. It has nothing whatsoever to do with Rooker-Feldman. It is parallel adjudication, just what he said. Now, what's your response?",
  "Well, that's -- you see, Justice Ginsburg answered that. I -- I mean, she wasn't answering my question, but she did say what was a perfectly satisfactory approach, that -- that the second person says, you know, Judge, there's another one pending and the judge says, okay, we'll let that go first except in some unusual instance.",
  "So why isn't it that the end? I mean, here it's not moot. They filed the other action. You point out that you not only think something could wreck the State claim, you would love it to wreck the State claim. And -- and therefore, they have this insurance policy in Federal court which they'll gear up if and when the State claim does get wrecked as you hope.",
  "Why is it moot? Or even on -­ why does claim preclusion apply? I mean, if you win, from what you've said -- somehow convince us that this refusal to apply the State statute of limitations properly violated some Federal law, let's say -- then that would show that the State statute of limitations applied and barred their claim. Would that be sufficient to knock out the Federal suit too?",
  "I mean, is -- does the State statute of limitations, if -- if it applied to the State's case, does it also apply in the Federal cases, the identical ground that everybody agrees that the State statute governs?",
  "I mean, if you -- if you win, then -- then -- if you win your State case, because of the argument you made, do you also automatically win the Federal case? Is it the same issue?",
  "So it may not be the same issue. Then -- then they say, okay, it's not going to be claim preclusion, and you'd have to say insofar as it's not the same issue, it's not claim preclusion. And therefore, they could proceed with their Federal case, which is what they want to do I guess.",
  "Yes. So we can't say it's moot in any -- and we can't say there's an alternative basis where they'd win, can we? I mean, I'm saying -- I'm thinking if we get into conference, we're discussing this case, and I say, well, I have to think this through, is it the case that if you're right and you end up winning in this Court, that their case in Federal court is over? I think no, it may not be. The answer is it may not be. Then this is not moot at all. This is not claim-precluded at all. They then might proceed with their Federal claim.",
  "Is that right or not?",
  "Because?",
  "Oh, well, but that -- that isn't fair to them because, for all I know, they filed the Federal case because there's a different statute of limitations, say, that governs it that will have expired if you don't let them file it by the time -- until this whole thing is over. They just wanted it as protection.",
  "That's explaining the unclear by the incredibly hard to understand.",
  "It's explaining the unclear by reference to the incomprehensible. But go ahead.",
  "What's -- what's the scope of what you're talking about here? I mean, are -- it says cruise ships. So I had assumed those are those big ships that carry people mostly around the Mediterranean from Florida. But based on what you're saying, now I think you're talking about something more. Are you talking, for example, about a merchant vessel that comes from, say, Saudi Arabia and has a few passengers? What's the - - what's the scope of the definition?",
  "Because? It -- what it does is it carries oil, but a certain number of people like to be on a ship with oil, I guess. And so every -- every month they take 12 people and they put them in a cabin somewhere and they love it.",
  "No, no. I -- but all right. Now, I'm -- I'm being facetious.",
  "But I am aware of -- of people who have certainly gone on cruises on what is a primarily merchant ship. Now that -- that I think is a common thing.",
  "Are you talking -- because I think that makes a difference for the reason that once you talk about those, you're talking about primarily foreign- flagged vessels that are rarely but sometimes in the United States where the costs would be very high probably to change the ship and the benefit to Americans would be tiny. All right. So I -- I want to know what you're talking about.",
  "But there's no way they can change the ship structurally when it's in New York and not have it changed structurally when it's in Europe. So the mystery to me at this moment is what is the universe of ships that I would not say fit the ordinary word cruise. What they are are ships that go between Asia and San Francisco, Los Angeles, or New York and Europe, or maybe through the Suez Canal. They're only here a little bit of the time. Their passengers are mostly not American. Now, is that something I should worry about? If that were your case, I would be very worried. If that's just a little bit of -- of added significance, then I want to know what to do about it.",
  "Well, that means - -",
  "No, go ahead.",
  "Then you're saying exactly what everybody is worried about. I take it there is no way really for a ship to -- they either have the right door or they don't have the right door. And we're interested in the set of cases in which they're going to have to change their doors. And what I came in here thinking was we're talking about ships that pick up people and sail in Florida and sail around the Caribbean. That's the -- now, I've heard nothing but we're not talking just about those. We are talking about ships like I'm the last human being alive that went on a Swiss ship to Europe. Okay?",
  "50 years ago. And -- and we're talking about those ships, or we're talking about merchant ships that also say to the public, come as a passenger. Now, I would like to -- not what you're arguing. You're going to say, yes, we are arguing it. I want to know -- say something to relieve my concern about that set, which was Justice Ginsburg's concern. We are trying to rule the world in respect to those ships that only come here occasionally or it isn't a big part of their business, but they want to come to pick up American passengers.",
  "One thing might be true, what you're not saying, is there really aren't very many of those ships, or another thing you might say, which you're not saying because maybe isn't true, is almost all of those ships that there are are already subject to tougher -- tougher rules, say, in Europe. But you don't say either of those.",
  "Since you don't you say either of those, I think neither may be true.",
  "Is there -- is there -- I mean, you're giving me the answer I thought the other side would give me. All right? And I appreciate it actually.",
  "You say that two-thirds of these people, the customers, are American. So we're dealing with a business that is primarily American, not a business like the Swiss ship except with the exceptional cases. Then you say, all right, still it's a problem because of structural changes we'll have to make. What changes? That is to say, I would have thought I could have read, but I haven't, that other countries like Europe also have discrimination laws against disabled people, and therefore, given that fact and given the document that Mr. Goldstein produced, it is highly unlikely that your clients will have to make any significant structural change that they wouldn't have had to make anyway.",
  "Now, what's the response to that?",
  "All right. If -- if that's so and if you look at the earlier cases -- but all I could get out it is that those earlier cases -- the Court tries to do what it really would have thought Congress would have intended in the circumstances. And if that's so, why wouldn't Congress really have intended that a business that's two-thirds American has to abide by American law?",
  "Does -- does Britain -- or does Britain or does the European Union, for example, forbid you to charge this double price?",
  "Does European law -- I'd be surprised if it doesn't forbid it, but do you know?",
  "Could they work that out? That is, if two-thirds of our universe really is American- based, in terms of customers, and we're now only talking about conflicts in -- real conflicts that -- that affect, say, one-third of the universe, that's also true in areas like antitrust or others where the enforcement authorities get together and they try to write memoranda that -- that work this out in a reasonable way. Could -- could the same thing happen here if such real conflicts did emerge?",
  "Because?",
  "The answer would be yes, you do. You do have to, and then if there's some other authority that wants to get involved in this, the two authorities would work it out.",
  "That's perfect because then the Government says that once it becomes a matter of binding international rule, anything that conflicts with that will be viewed as not reasonably achievable. So all you have to do is that and then there's no longer a problem with American law, according to them.",
  "This problem couldn't arise again in Pennsylvania, couldn't it, because they have a 1 - year statute of limitations? So there would be no way that you could be untimely filing within the 1 year that you have to go to Federal court.",
  "It can? How could it - -",
  "You do. I thought AEDPA you had to file within a year.",
  "And then if you miss the year, you're out of luck. Period.",
  "I see. So in other words, he -- his conviction is final.",
  "60 days runs after his final conviction and then between the 60th day and the 365th day, he has discovered his Brady claim and has not got into court within 60 days.",
  "And Justice Scalia's question -- I'm interested in this. It couldn't arise. That is, a person who files his State collateral petition more than 365 days after the finality of the State court direct review, that person is out of luck under anybody's interpretation because more than a year has passed since it became final, i.e., the State direct review. Am I right or wrong about that? That's what's puzzling me.",
  "The exemptions still could be the problem.",
  "Suppose you lost on that one. Suppose that you wanted some kind of a -- suppose that the majority wanted a standard that would prevent absolutely frivolous filings on the basis of -- of statute of limitations. Would you -- what standard would -- what - - what's our choice of standards there? Could we -- one, obviously, that the prisoner has to be in good faith. Another could be he has to be in good faith and there has to be a reasonable argument that it hasn't run. Maybe there are others that you've thought of.",
  "What about a -- a rule requiring good faith or reasonable argument in death cases? In all the other cases, there's no incentive to do this endless filing, and in death cases, there is. So in those death cases, we would insist that it is not properly filed if it's out of time unless the prisoner in good faith and with a plausible argument, a reasonable argument thought it was in time.",
  "Well, I don't think it actually -- I mean, in -- I think they're about equal, aren't they, in respect to language? And the argument against the other one is that prisoners are going to get mixed up about it. They -- they don't know exactly what they're supposed to put. The argument against the one I proposed is it adds complexity of decision-making. Sort of between the two, it's rather hard to see.",
  "They each have their problems.",
  "It -- it's my -- I still have a feeling that this is a limited universe. Now, my reason for thinking that is that the Federal statute says you have to file within a year of -- and then it lists four dates. And the middle two are special new cases, unusual probably. The first one and the fourth one are the important ones. The first one is final in the State courts, your first round, and the fourth one is newly discovered evidence. Now, my guess is most States also allow you for collateral -- to file collateral relief in those two circumstances. And in most States probably you get nearly a year from the same kind of event. So if you go after the year, you're out of luck in Federal court. If you're within the year, you're probably okay for the State. But there are a few States that have -- maybe Pennsylvania - - just 60 days from one of the events, newly discovered evidence, but a year for the Federal. So we're talking about people who file between 2 and 12 months. That - - that must be a pretty limited class.",
  "It's not?",
  "But have I got it right? Have I got this complicated thing right?",
  "Now, let's - -",
  "All right. Let's suppose to get away from it -- can I go -- are you finished with equitable tolling because I want to go back to - -",
  "I -- I have a general question which is not Pennsylvania. I've looked up or got a rough idea of the statute of limitations for a first petition in many States, and most of them are a year or more. So there's no problem. But 11 have less than a year, and in particular, Oklahoma has 3 months apparently. And Oklahoma is -- a lot of death cases come out of Oklahoma. So what rule would -- where I have to have -- I focus on Oklahoma for the reason that I think this has bite only in death cases because I don't see why anybody would want to abuse the system except in a death case. But there are a lot there. Now, am I supposed to say in Oklahoma which has the 90 days but exceptions, that where somebody has filed a petition in State court, let's say, on the 180th day, and he thinks an exception applies, is he supposed to also run to Federal court and file a protective petition which could well have been dismissed on exhaustion grounds? What's he supposed to do and how is he supposed to know what to do? And one system that might work is Justice Scalia's idea.",
  "Another that might work is - - is requiring in death cases that it be a -- a plausible ground or something like that. I want to know your opinion of how to deal with that circumstance.",
  "Actually most prisoners are not represented, I don't think, at this stage. They -- they haven't a clue about the word exhaustion, and they haven't a clue about the statute of limitations. So they file a -- a paper in -- in the State court, and they say this roughly is what my problem is. Is that what happens, or are they all quite educated?",
  "I'm trying to get from you what is your opinion of a practical approach to this problem in Oklahoma, say.",
  "Is -­",
  "Suppose the judge had said this defendant has just been convicted of killing two people. He convicted them -- as the jury knows, he was convicted of having killed them because he wanted to avoid being sent back to prison. The jury may sit there and think, well, if he killed two people to avoid being sent back to prison and we've just voted him guilty, maybe he's going to try to lunge out in the courtroom and get us. And therefore, I want him shackled. Now, suppose the judge had said that. Would that be an adequate reason?",
  "What about his motion? Is Mr. Leftwich -- is that defense counsel?",
  "All right, fine. He says I would ask that or like to move to strike the entire jury panel for cause because of the fact that Mr. Deck is shackled in front of the jury and makes them think that he is going to -- that he is violent today and going to do something in the courtroom. And I read that, he's saying, of course, they can see it.",
  "That doesn't say he can see it -- they can see it?",
  "All right. So has anybody said -- he said, Judge, I would like you to get rid of this jury which happens to be looking at the shackles. Okay. Now, at that point, you have to do -- then isn't it up to the prosecution to say, what do you mean looking at them? They can't see them. They're hidden.",
  "If -- if there are some factors that favor putting him in shackles and I guess others might not, what's the argument that the judge shouldn't at least have to make a finding?",
  "I mean, you know, I realize you want to save the conviction and the penalty, but if you look at the mine run of cases, it's pretty hard for me to see how the State could show special circumstances and they not get a finding from the judge that they're right.",
  "It's pretty hard to see an argument against it.",
  "I know that hurts your case, but I -- I still need to think of some argument or reason why the judge shouldn't have to at least make a finding.",
  "Well, it's not -- the weakness in your point, I think, as I -- as I understand it, which is a very optimistic assumption, given the complexity here -­",
  "-- is -- is that you want to read (a) as if it applies to arising-under jurisdiction and not to diversity jurisdiction. Very simple. Arising­ under jurisdiction, you do maintain jurisdiction over the original action. You can add a claim, but as long as there's one good claim arising under, there's original jurisdiction. Diversity, there isn't.",
  "If you add that plaintiff, you don't get the original -- that's not right?",
  "All right.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "So -- so, in -- in other words, in that situation, it's a third party claim by the defendant against another person.",
  "So that's then -- that does fall within (a).",
  "And then (b) knocks it out insofar as the plaintiff wants to assert a claim.",
  "But that person can assert a claim against a plaintiff.",
  "So that, you say, is the answer to what I was going to ask -­",
  "-- which is why didn't they just use the word 1331. And the reason they didn't just use the word 1331 is there is a subset of diversity claims that also have to fall within (a).",
  "All right.",
  "So the other thing, of course, is if these three professors who wrote this had -- had figured this out so well, why in heaven's name didn't they at least write an article about it so we'd know what we were doing?",
  "What -- what is the -- can you -- this is something I should know, but I don't know. All right. It's very elementary. If you have two parties from different States, diversity claim, they're in court perfectly properly. Now, if somebody intervenes under, say -- say, rule 24 or suppose it's rule 19, a necessary party, and that destroys the diversity, does the -- does the Federal court still have jurisdiction? It does, I gather, under rule 14 if the defendant impleads or brings his own lawsuit -­",
  "-- against a third party. What -- what happens under -- that doesn't destroy it, rule 14. Right?",
  "Yes.",
  "I understand that. What about 19 and 24?",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay. So you mean by allowed that plaintiff is -- one -- he's from the same State and destroys the diversity.",
  "He can do it, though.",
  "And what about under rule 19?",
  "You could not?",
  "And rule 20 you could not?",
  "And rule 24 you could.",
  "The difficulty, I guess, is that I'm having is let's imagine rule 19 or 24.",
  "Now, you're saying that is an instance where, if you bring the party in and he destroys diversity, you're out. That was true before this statute.",
  "Okay.",
  "So there -- before this statute, there never is going to be a circumstance in which you bring in a person under rule 19 and diversity is destroyed.",
  "Okay. Now -- now, this is one of the things that mixes me up here.",
  "Then -- then what's confuse -­ now, we look at 1367(b) and it says the district court shall not have supplemental jurisdiction over a claim by the plaintiff against a rule 19 person who is brought on the defense side.",
  "Where the inconsistent -- i.e., it would be nondiverse, but you said there couldn't be such a situation.",
  "Michigan plaintiff against Iowa defendant, necessary party, Michigan defendant, rule 19. Now we bring him in. And you're saying before this statute, not going to come in because it will wreck jurisdiction. Right?",
  "All right. Well, then I'm going to stop asking -­",
  "-- because it's very easy to me to reach the outer limit of my understanding.",
  "You could have before this statute.",
  "No. They could at least come in if the defendant --",
  "-- under rule 14 joined another person.",
  "And then person X wanted to join --",
  "-- that part of the action -­",
  "-- that could be a 19, 20, or 24.",
  "I imagine that if you filed a claim and the plaintiff was a class and the class contained a number of people who did not meet the jurisdictional minimum and they file a claim against a defendant in a diversity suit, I imagine the first thing the judge would say would be, I've read Zahn and we don't have jurisdiction over this action.",
  "Yes, that was prior to the statute. So -- so they say, well, that's what the judge would have said, and moreover, if you had not a class action and you had three plaintiffs and one of them was from a different State than the defendant and the other two were not, the first thing the judge would say is, I'm very sorry. There is not complete diversity. I do not have jurisdiction over this action. And so I take it their point is by coincidence or not, that's what this statute says.",
  "And since that's what the statute says, that's what it means.",
  "It means that this kind of a situation does not fall within 1367(a) because there was not jurisdiction over that action. So I agree with you that those words are what their claim depends upon, but what is the answer to that contention?",
  "No, no. Finley happened to be an arising-under case, and in an arising-under case, as long as there is one claim that arises under, there is jurisdiction over the action.",
  "All right. Well, if you agree -- and I'm -- when I'm saying these things in such a definite tone of voice, they reflect deep insecurity because I -­",
  "But -- but I -- I want to know what is the answer to that point.",
  "But I don't see -- where I'm starting from this -- because at some point I'd like you to get to the -- the virtue of their position in my mind at the moment is, one, it is consistent with the language, which says civil action, not claim. Two, it is consistent with the only instruction I read that any legislator gave to the people who were writing this, staff, namely, write something that's noncontroversial. And third, I can, on their interpretation at least, I believe at least late at night, make sense out of all the words in these three different sections.",
  "So at some point, I would appreciate your addressing that.",
  "They -- they didn't make a recommendation one way or another on it.",
  "When he did this thing -- when he was trying to write this statute, he seemed fixated on one thing, Kroger, and -- and (b) seems to reflect an effort to make -- put in statutory form Kroger.",
  "No, but they do say in no event should the enclosed materials be construed as having been adopted by the committee.",
  "Wait. On your last statement, I -- you -- something that I hadn't focused on.",
  "Can you just -- you said it doesn't make any difference. I thought it's the defendants who want to be in Federal court.",
  "But they can't remove the action unless it could have been there in the first place.",
  "And therefore, this interpretation, if you're overruling Zahn, would have made a big difference because it would have meant the defendants could have brought a lot of cases into Federal court by the removal, and you would have seen the plaintiffs bar up in arms if, in fact, this provision would have allowed for easier removal.",
  "Well, they're saying what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If it does in the amount, it does so in the -- if it's -- if -­ you're trying to drive a wedge between the geographical diversity and amount.",
  "And they say you can't do that under the statute. If you're prepared to say that bringing in a new plaintiff from the same State as the defendant does destroy diversity over the original action, you must also be prepared to say that bringing in a new plaintiff who only has $3 at issue destroys the original jurisdiction because there's no way, in terms of the original jurisdiction and the wording of 1332, to make that distinction.",
  "Now, you respond to that what?",
  "Exactly, but that's the reason for saying that -- look, as I understand it -- and this is -- the -- the thing that got me thinking they may have a point here is A, B, and C are dealing with three separate problems. The first problem is how to overrule Finley without affecting anything else like Zahn or any of the others.",
  "The second problem B is simply Kroger. B is how to make statutory Kroger. And C is United Mine Workers v. Pennington to make sure they have discretion to get rid of supplemental jurisdiction. Now, once you see it as three separate problems -- I know they wanted me to see it this way, but once you see it as three separate problems, the words fall into place as long as you do interpret that word, civil action, to mean, well, there is no jurisdiction over the civil action where what's happened is you've simply added as a defendant a nondiverse party or you've added as a plaintiff a nondiverse party or a party that doesn't meet the jurisdictional amount. Now, I spell all that out because I hope in the next 15 minutes you will tell me why that's wrong.",
  "See, that -- that's what I thought was their view of -- of (b). To go to (b), you understand (b), you have to go back before Kroger. And Kroger was worried about some clever plaintiff, as you say -­",
  "-- getting a defendant. He knows this defendant is going to bring a third party complaint against Smith from the same State, and he says, ha, I'll sue this defendant. And analogous things happen with rule 19 and 24, not really with 20 they said, but 19 and 24. And then Kroger says, hey, you can't do that.",
  "And so (b) was Judge Weis' effort to make sure that was codified. It wasn't really meant so much as some kind of exception from (a).",
  "It was meant to have an independent basis there. So I didn't see, if you give it an independent basis, how anything odd happens -­",
  "-- by giving it their reading.",
  "Is there any other -- I mean, you can continue if you want, but one difference which I've written down is you say that the difference between this and the prayer is that this is more profoundly religious. Is there any",
  "That's the difference? So if I happen to read these prayers in the Congress and I came to the conclusion that in terms of a religious message, I actually thought the prayers had the more religious message, then I should vote against you.",
  "That's an important point to me, but I don't see any way to get there in these difficult cases without making a practical judgment about whether that's really so. And the reason I say that, I start with Goldberg's opinion with Harlan in Schempp. And I know there are a lot of others, but I don't know if we've found a satisfactory test. And the point that they make is the government should be noninvolved with the religious, and it can't favor one over the other. nation, where most people do believe in God and most of our institutions flow from the religious nature of our people. The City on the Hill, proclaim liberty throughout the land. All of those are religious. So how can the government, without what they call the pervasive and brooding commitment to secularism, which they think would be wrong, become necessarily involved because of our traditions, but not go too far? Now, I come to the conclusion very tentatively, there is no way to do it other than look at the divisive quality of the individual display case by case. And when I do that, I don't find much divisiveness here. Now, I'm exposing the whole thing not because I'm accepting it, but I would love to hear what you think.",
  "I've got to get one question before you leave because you're the one who knows the record. And what I've had a hard time finding in the record is what I think there must be some material that the State or somebody in a tourist office or a guide or somebody tells people what the 17 different monuments are. And all I've found is the general brochure which doesn't tell them what they are. And I found something on the Internet. Well, which is in the in the record and that, is there anything else in this record that if somebody wanders around, they're on the State grounds, they say, what is this, what are these things anyway? There must be something that tells them. And where is it?",
  "And the brochure doesn't tell what they are. This thing, it says grounds?",
  "Suppose we go back to the first display. If all that was there was the Ten Commandments, now, in your opinion, was that constitutional?",
  "I don't know how much help I can get or not but I was thinking in terms of the involvement of the government, is the government involved in religion when it posts the Ten Commandments alone? Yes, of course it is. Now, there could be a purpose to it, that they want to just show the history of law but it's all by itself and there is a lot more history than that and context may matter a lot. Not everybody will go with the Ten Commandments just by itself there and say, well, gee, this seems to go too far. This is going too far. Why? Because it isn't really related to history, it's the only thing up there, it's involvement in religion, so forth. Now, suppose I go down that track because what I'm really looking for is a key as to what's too far and what's not. But for present purposes, let's assume it's too far. Now, once they've gone too far there, the next thing that happens is they keep changing it but they change it pursuant to the resolution and it seems as if in context, all they've tried to do is to surround what went too far with a number of other things that would somehow make it legal. Now, if it was wrong to begin with, is it wrong to end with?",
  "Why is it? It may be true. These pilgrims came for religious reasons. If all you have is a display of the origin of the law in the United States, what would be wrong with saying, this is a historical account? It's like teaching religion in the schools. Of course it stemmed from the religious beliefs of those who came to the United States. You don't mean it religiously. You mean it historically.",
  "Since you have a minute, give me your opinion to the right standard if hypothetically you start with the Goldberg-Schempp idea, that the government is not absolutely forbidden by the establishment clause to recognize the religious nature of the people nor the religious origins of much of our law and so forth but it's easy to go too far and it's easy in this area you are trading on eggs to become far more divisive than you hoped and really end up with something worse than if you stayed out in the first place. In other words, it's a very delicate matter and it's very easy to offend people. Now, suppose you start with that. You're trying to define what is too far constitutionally speaking. What's your test? Of the many that have been in our opinions, which do you think works the best for that purpose or some other?",
  "So maybe that's -­",
  "What is your argument in response to Justice Souter? You said it is not the following. It is not that the State has to list, along with these religious matters, the Second Amendment, the First Amendment, et cetera. It's not that. You then seem to say that the argument is that a person who files a piece of paper and claims to be religious, that they have to consider it, and it's impelled only by religion. I suppose the same thing is true of a church that applies for a tax exemption. So I don't think that you could say that automatically that fact that they're going to give the church a tax exemption or that they're going to give the religious person some special consideration, that that in and of itself violates the Establishment Clause. Very well. What does?",
  "No. But I just need to know where you're going -­",
  "-- generally. I don't need a bright line rule. I'm just trying to find out what it is about this that violates the clause if it isn't the first thing or the second thing that I mentioned.",
  "Fine. Now, in respect to that, we have two points. One was Justice O'Connor's I think, which is that Congress is not enlarging it, but for my second qualification, beyond what it would have been if Smith had never been decided. And the second is Justice Scalia's point, which is but there is one respect in which Congress did enlarge it, namely, that the right doesn't have -- the belief doesn't have to be central. It could be -- well, he just read that. So is your whole argument then pinned on that latter point? And if it is not, again, what is it?",
  "You're saying if Turner had come up prior to Smith, the Court would have said that Turner trumps pre-Smith law, and you don't have to follow pre-Smith law in the prison.",
  "I understand -­",
  "Now, I -- I understand the argument now, which has been helpful. Very well. From the prison's point of view, why is it so burdensome since you would have thought security is a compelling interest, prison administration is a compelling interest, so that really all we have to do is think about this and look to see whether there isn't some reasonable way of accommodating the request?",
  "This is true. Now there you're in the dilemma. I mean, you're putting yourself there in the same position that virtually every official is in in the United States but for judges who have -- who have to worry about the court of appeals. But anyway, the -­ the --",
  "You see -- now, the answer to that argument in your case, you're in a vice. They put you in a -- in a kind of pincers because where you have a good argument, they say, well, that doesn't violate the statute, and where your claim is weak, they say, well, it shouldn't be a -- it should violate the statute. And the difficulty with being in pincers like that is you can't win. And the virtue of it is you shouldn't win. All right. So -- so how do you get out of this -- of the -­ of that kind of an argument?",
  "No, but -- your point.",
  "What about the American Indian who didn't -- or was it -- I think it was an American Indian. But -- who didn't want to be known -- it was a woman and she didn't want to known as a number. She wanted a name. That was a religious basis. And Social Security -- I think the Court hold -- didn't have to give her that.",
  "So that to me stood for the proposition that administrative considerations play an important role in deciding whether you've hit upon the least restrictive alternative. And as long as that was the law, then you're okay. And that was a Supreme Court case I think. I may be misremembering.",
  "Suppose shall does mean shall. Fine. But you might have a statute that says the fire department shall respond to fires, the police department shall respond to crimes, the Army shall respond to attacks. Even the word shall doesn't necessarily mean that this is the kind of interest that, like property, the Duke of Rutland relied upon Blackacre, that welfare recipients rely upon continuing to receive money. What is it about this that makes it like property, even if shall does mean shall?",
  "Mr. Eastman, can I ask you this question? Supposing this case came to us through the Colorado State system instead of through the federal system, and the Colorado Supreme Court had written precisely the same opinion that the Tenth Circuit ruled. Would we have jurisdiction to overturn their holding that there was a property interest here?",
  "Yes. What did they hold in the Tenth Circuit? I mean, shall could be mandatory. You can have a mandatory duty, but that doesn't mean that the victim has a legal right to enforce that duty.",
  "So what did they hold in the Tenth Circuit in respect to that?",
  "They should reask the certified question?",
  "But a background rule is awfully tough. I mean, you could have lots of shalls in all kinds of statutes. If they said shall, the sanitation department shall inspect your home for tuberculosis, maybe that does give a right. If they say to the fire department, you shall put out fires, I wouldn't think they meant that every possible homeowner had a right to a lawyer and a full judicial hearing before they go and respond to an alarm. You know, I mean, it depends on the area. I don't know how to create a background rule.",
  "Well, does -­",
  "The basic problem that I have is you just put your finger on. I mean, on your view of the facts here, which I will accept, it's outrageous what happened and a terrible tragedy, but it wasn't that they didn't hear her. They heard her. That's the problem. They heard her and they didn't do anything. So if you proceed under state law, you will, if you're right, get a holding that the police behaved very badly, that would help your client, and it would help future people in the same position. If you proceed under federal law, the most you get is somebody at the desk saying, well, we think other things are more important. And at that point, your client may or may not be helped and other people won't be helped. So don't you have a misfit between the remedy that you're trying to get and the harm that was done?",
  "Suppose they just say, look, in our experience, children come home in two or three hours and, moreover, we have other things to do that are more important. Is that a sufficient answer? Both things, by the way, most people who look into this would say are completely wrong. But I mean, the police would say just what I said. Is that sufficient?",
  "So what you really want is what they should do, is they should respond?",
  "In this case, you would say they should respond?",
  "That's true, but Goss versus Lopez, to my knowledge -- you may know more about it. But to my knowledge, there are not a lot of federal cases which second guess the principal or the teacher, once the teacher or the principal gives a plausible reason for suspending the student. And of course my fear is that that is precisely what would occur here. There would be procedure, there would be a reason. The reason is we're too busy. All right? And courts won't second guess that. But if you take the other route, you get what you need, which is an instruction to the police department that when a child is missing, you don't wait. But I don't see how you can get that instruction on this procedural route.",
  "Exactly. And that seems to me to be the problem, because you have a case where the problem was the delay and that's apparently a common problem. And I don't see how this route that you take gets at that problem.",
  "Could you still bring a state tort suit?",
  "Why? Because it is willful and wanton, and you've made out a claim they didn't even give an answer, they didn't do anything, they have a practice of doing nothing.",
  "What about the willful and wanton -- suppose the facts were just as they say, long-standing practice, not responding, doing nothing, doing nothing here despite evidence of serious danger, and being told you shouldn't do anything, don't pay any attention he'll come home, would that show willful and wanton?",
  "All right. Now, if that's so -­",
  "All right. That -- that -­ what you've quoted many -- much of this I wouldn't repeat in polite company. You've reported one of the most mild, and in fact there are two findings. One, this is not just defamation. It was an action for defamation, as well as a tort of invasion of privacy. And there is a finding, first, that this was done intentionally to create a negatively charged and ominous environment, and this is not a matter of speech-related issues. It is simply the use of false and defamatory and privacy-invading communications, or worse, or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in tribute for -- for desisting from that type of activity. All right. Now, those are the findings against you. So suppose I agreed with you hypothetically that that, with all these findings, is nonetheless protected by the First Amendment. All right? Now, suppose, in other words, you convince me of that. Now, I want to know how to write my opinion on that assumption to protect what I was worried about yesterday, that a woman who has a boyfriend or a husband is being continuously harassed in -- with methods similar to this one. See, it's easy to transpose those two cases which are both on my mind. And I want to know if in your opinion that these restraining orders, which try to prevent this kind of thing, among others, are unconstitutional, if there's a way of distinguishing them, if you could possibly win on what theory. And what I'm trying to get you to do is to say is it absolute. Are there limits? If so, what?",
  "Always? Do you want to apply that to an harassment action too against a woman who has the restraining order? No restraining orders in divorce cases in case they're against speech because even if violence is threatened, even if -- et cetera. I mean, how -- how far do you want to push that principle?",
  "So -- so if -- before leaving that point, what the injunction prohibits is that Tory and those acting in concert, cooperation, or participation with him from, in a public forum, orally uttering statements about Cochran. All right. That's what it says. Now, do you think that if Tory or someone acting in cooperation with him says, I've had a change of heart, Johnnie Cochran is a marvelous person, and he says that on television -- do you think that individual at that time has violated this injunction?",
  "Absolutely not. Because? Because?",
  "It said the words. They violated the words. It was a statement, but he has not violated the injunction because?",
  "Oh, no, no. He does it in a public forum. In fact, he hires Disney Hall.",
  "And moreover, he gets on stage and announces it. Okay? There's no problem about a public forum. So, now, why doesn't it violate the injunction?",
  "No. I thought what you were going to say -- but you're not. So I'm very interested in that, and I'm glad I asked. I thought you were going to say when it says uttering statements, it means statements of the kind or identical to those we have identified earlier in this opinion.",
  "But, now, you haven't said that. I said it, and I think it's too late for you to say it.",
  "But it would be so easy. I mean, it's virtually no burden. I take it what you're saying is that this injunction in paragraph 2 at its heart is aimed at in public forums, keeping insults suggesting he was a crook against Johnnie Cochran unless you pay me $10,000. Then I'll stop. Okay? Now, at its heart, that's what it's aimed at.",
  "And you are saying if in fact it's ever enforced outside that heartland, you can have a defense. It would violate the First Amendment. But since it's so easy just to write those words we just said right in paragraph 2, why shouldn't the judge have to do it? It's so easy. Say this is aimed at the heartland just as I said it and you said it, and it doesn't apply outside of it.",
  "How does California work in that respect? Because what I've been thinking of in my mind is that maybe we shouldn't decide this in terms of State law boxes, that California seems to have an action. Let's call it a buzz action to get away from words. And what that action is it's a defamation but a certain kind. It's defamation accompanied by extortion. And when you have defamation accompanied by extortion -- call it whatever you want -- an injunction is proper in these circumstances. Now, can we decide it in such a way that we're not talking about all defamation actions? We are talking about this beast in California which uses the word defamation but also finds injunction and therefore issues -- also finds extortion and therefore issues an injunction.",
  "But then you run into the public figure. I mean, that's a much more dangerous kind of rule of law, isn't it? I mean, a pure defamation action against a public figure, which they want to say this is. You can write all kinds of things about public figures. People can and do, for better or for worse. Do -- is there any authority for issuing in a pure defamation action an injunction?",
  "So look at the trouble we get into when we take your interpretation. Suppose we take the Government's interpretation and think only of first habeas. Leave second habeas out of it for a moment. But if it were only first habeas and those were all the habeases in the world, wouldn't theirs be better? Every prisoner would know that when you get the right, you file. Okay, no problem. And you're going to win if, and only if, you get a court to say it was retroactive. So that's fine. We all know. All the prisoners know we've got to file within a year. It would cause no problem if there were only first habeases.",
  "No. They sometimes don't, but then if they don't, you appeal, just like anything else. And you might lose and you might not get your case taken in the Supreme Court. That's always true for every litigant.",
  "So -- so that's a problem. Is there any other problem?",
  "What?",
  "Well, but that's -- that's linguistic. I'm -- I'm looking for practical problems for prisoners, which was your initial argument. And in respect to a practical problem for a prisoner, I couldn't think of one, and that's why I'm asking. In respect to first habeases.",
  "All right. Then if your only problem is second habeas, there I'd agree with you. There's a big problem. But it says here the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized. Now, I guess a person who's filed a habeas doesn't have a right until the Supreme Court has made the -- the rule retroactive. And therefore, until the Supreme Court makes it retroactive, there was no right recognized for a second habeas person. And therefore, for that case it does begin to run when the Supreme Court says it's retroactive because prior to that he had no right -­",
  "-- given -- given paragraph 8.",
  "Well, it's all -- the word right in (3) quite plainly doesn't cover the last six words of the -- of the sentence. Well, whether the word right -- I'm trying to fix it up. I'm trying to figure out -­",
  "-- how do we get to that conclusion. Now, it seems to me what you've done is say either use my ad hoc mechanism, or let there be chaos, or we take your approach which produces the kind of chaos we've just been discussing.",
  "Actually Justice Souter's approach might work here because you -- you -- all the second habeases file immediately. Now, the Seventh Circuit, you say, well, gets to those second habeases right away, and it says dismissed. Very well. When they say dismissed, then they ask for cert. And when they ask for cert, we take or we don't. If we don't, then they're out of luck. And if we take it, people would hold all the other cases waiting to see what we decide. So they wouldn't lose out in any case where we really were going to make it collaterally -- applicable on collateral review.",
  "I mean, I'm sure my dissent was correct in that case, but the --",
  "The -- the -- still -- it still would work because the first case has come down. Okay? The first case has come down. Now all the prisoners read about these cases, and even if they've already filed a habeas, they go file another. And the Seventh Circuit, you say, then looks at that first one that they get to, and they say, dismissed. Oh, you're saying that then he comes he here and we say the reason you lose is not because you're wrong. The reason you lose is because you're not yet ripe.",
  "But we -- we still might be able to deal with it. That person files his petition for cert. He puts in the petition there are 4,000 prisoners who are trying to file second habeases, and if you decide retroactivity, collateral, all of them but me will be able to proceed. But you have to have enough sense, Supreme Court, to take my case to decide if you're going to decide retroactivity, that it is and give me the benefit of the decision.",
  "Yes, but there -- it's -- I'm now taken with this. I'm jumping from one thing to another here. But that does get rid of the problems that were initially plaguing your position because it's precise and definite. And it also gets rid of whatever problems were produced by Tyler because a person could easily get to the Supreme Court in that rare case without his petition, if it's a first petition, being improperly filed because he's not bound by paragraph 8.",
  "So it's a first position. So all that he does is he files a petition. He can file it before any court -- nothing says he can't file it before a court has decided it's retroactive. He files the petition. He seeks cert here. He gets us to say it's retroactive in that rare instance, and everyone else has a year from that moment. And as far as the -- the second people are concerned, they don't -- the second petition people don't have to file it until a year from that moment, and they have a good claim under paragraph 8. There's quite a lot -- now -- now, I'm jumping to that because it sounds like it might be good.",
  "Well, don't worry about it.",
  "It was very -­",
  "But if you don't -- aren't -- I mean, the language is open, and it's sort of like the virtue of this -- suddenly it's like tinkers to Everest chance. I mean, it seems to put everything together. What was worrying you most about their position was it produced uncertainty, a kind of a mess. You don't know which court you're talking about. People would be filing things all over the place. They'll be waiting. That -- it's a mess. This stops that. What's worrying them is that the second habeas person, given Tyler, could never file, not even in that -- you know, not even in that -- in that really unusual situation where we're going to make it a collateral review. And now, what this does is it produces the certainty, the definiteness of when your time clock begins to tick, and it eliminates all the uncertainty, et cetera, and confusion, difficulty from their position.",
  "The language -- the language is on your side, I think there's no doubt. But it's not unambiguous. Imagine a prison rule that says that the -­ after the prison board, the -- the prisoner has 2 weeks to appeal to the warden from the time of the decision of the board if the prisoner has been notified. The prisoner isn't notified for 3 weeks. I think we'd read that to say he has 2 weeks from the time of notification. You -- you can use can if in that way. It's not impossible. And once I begin to think it could be open, I think, well, let's look for the most practical approach.",
  "You -- you'd say, well the language is clear -- clear, but let's go -- let's go on equitable tolling.",
  "No, no. What you're saying is the language.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, could I bring you back to the -- the issue? I'm sorry. Yes. Can I bring you back to the issue of whether the Court that recognizes the right has to be the Supreme Court or not? You say there are three other instances in which it is specified that it be the Supreme Court, and it's not specified here. But does any of those other three instances involve language like this which -- which has the Supreme Court mentioned immediately previously? I mean, when I read that the first time, has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases, I mean, I think what it envisions is the -- the very decision of the Supreme Court that newly recognized it made it retroactively applicable. Is -- is any of the other ones phrased this way so that the word, the Supreme Court, is immediately preceding the and made retroactively applicable?",
  "What it would do -- let's take a case which I guess we -- Apprendi. I mean, you know, Apprendi, a big sort of an issue in the courts. And -­ and this would put tremendous pressure on us to decide it immediately, wouldn't it? We'd have to say immediately whether it was going to be retroactive or not retroactive because it's only likely to come along in some major, major matter like that, other than the kind Justice Kennedy said, which is another kind of problem. I mean, I don't see a way, if we take your approach, of getting out of this tremendous pressure. Maybe it would be a good thing. But I don't think there's a way of getting out of it.",
  "Well, what do you think about the -- it seems to me we've tried three approaches, each of which try to get us out of this problem of the pressure, call it. And we have Justice Stevens' and then -- but there were certain problems with Justice Souter's, which still I'm not certain might -- then I had started with one that I guess the objection to it would be it's laughable. But -- but is there -- is there any -- I mean, you see, it's -- it's reading -- it's reading the word right in 6 to encompass all of the paragraph in 8. Is there anything -- I mean, it's a pretty good objection that really that just goes too far.",
  "But is there any other objection?",
  "I thought it could be, if you want to play games, there is an imaginary right to which Blackstone has referred 48 times. Yet, for some odd reason, that right has never come to the Supreme Court of the United States. But one day it does. It is a right of constitutional dimensions embedded in the law of stoppage in transitu. And although it's well recognized, we've never had a case. Finally, we get one, and it is initially recognized here, but it is not newly recognized for every treatise on stoppage in transitu has long assumed that it was part of the law of the United States. I don't know. That's what I thought it was.",
  "I take it that what I've just said is of total irrelevance to everything. Is -- is that right?",
  "How -- how is -- how does that work? I mean, can you explain that a little?",
  "Suppose he did -- he hasn't violated the statute of limitations. He -- he filed it before a year ran from the time that we finally recognized it because we haven't even recognized it yet.",
  "But what is premature? What prevents a person from being premature? They just might lose on the merits of their claim is all, and he might anyway.",
  "No. I -- I was the one who's having a problem. I -- I didn't see how your client would be hurt if we adopted Justice Stevens' -­",
  "What -- what is the claim you want to make? That is, my reading of the California State court opinion says you came into their court and you said, look, this ordinance in San Francisco violates the Fifth Amendment, I guess, because it doesn't make any sense. The -- there's no good basis, no sound basis for requiring us to pay a fee in order to convert rooms. Anyway, the room isn't a house. Anyway, it makes no sense as applied to us. Anyway, they admit they just want to raise revenue. Anyway, we're going to give the tenant a place to live for the rest of his life. All right. Those were the claims. And in each case, the California Supreme Court said you're wrong. You're wrong because it does help preserve rooms, because it does have a reasonable purpose in a city that's crowded, because the tenant who's there for life might move out, and we want to keep the room even if he moves out because he dies. And anyway, it's not an issue of whether your case is special. This makes sense as a general rule. All right? They decided it. You raised it. They decided it. Now, what else is it you want to raise in Federal court?",
  "I don't know if you said it. I just said that that is what I read in the California Supreme Court opinion that Justice Werdegar wrote. And so what I'm asking you is whether they should have or whether they shouldn't have, they did seem to decide those five issues. And so my question to you is, what else do you want to raise?",
  "I thought it decided a different thing. I thought that it decided that in part that was the reason for their decision. But the reason they reached their decision is they thought on each of those five matters that the City of San Francisco had a reasonable legislative purpose for its ordinance.",
  "Just as, suppose, for example, they had decided that the hotel clerk or the temporary manager did speak English, and in fact, he was a scholar of English. And suppose that that had been the key matter for its decision of State law. I take it, if you came into Federal court, even if the issue were quite different, you would be bound by that factual determination. That's why I'm asking you. It seems to me here they have decided matters of whether there was a reasonable purpose or not for this particular ordinance and as applied to you. Now, what else do you want to raise in Federal court that was not encompassed by what I just described?",
  "But am I right? I'm just trying to narrow the issue in my mind. Am I right you want to raise one, two, three, four, or five of those issues that I just described and nothing more?",
  "Am I right about that?",
  "Thank you.",
  "My --",
  "Were you saying \"binding,\" or are you saying that we \"show deference to\" the President's own interpretation of the treaty, as applied to this 51-case set? In respect to that deference, I suppose, he interprets the treaty in such a way that the Avena decision, in his opinion, as applied to this 51-set -- -case set is what the treaty means.",
  "Is that right, or not?",
  "Well, if it is -- what I'm wondering is if this is similar to that insurance case out of California, where, in fact, we gave considerable deference to Mr. Eisenstat's interpretation of the relationship of the treaty to the insurance laws of California.",
  "We have to look beyond the President's interpretation of the treaty. It happens that the President is interpreting it, for reasons related to what the ICJ said. But that doesn't make us have to look beyond the reason for the President interpreting it the way he wants. I mean, do we have to defer to the ICJ, or do you -- is it not sufficient to defer to the President, who is operating within his foreign-affairs power for whatever set of reasons he deems sufficient?",
  "Before we -­",
  "-- before we -­",
  "But this is also a jurisdictional. They decided it on a jurisdictional ground. They decided that no COA lay, for the reason that they said. Now, I guess, though we wouldn't necessarily have to, we could simply say they're either right on that or they're wrong on that. And if they're wrong on it, send it back, and then you can argue whether there are other grounds; in which case, they could go into waiver, they could go into whether \"constitutional\" means to embrace \"treaty,\" and all those other interesting arguments that we could write law-review articles about that were not, in fact -­ they swirl around in this case, and you would not, in fact, be able to -- you wouldn't, in fact, have to pronounce on them now, here, when they really haven't been thoroughly gone into, below.",
  "But that -­",
  "Yeah, that's what I'm trying -- I'm trying to get to, which is, What is actually the practical thing to do now? Should we stay it, with a short per curiam, which says, \"Texas, go ahead,\" or should we do something else? Suppose we just dismiss this, as you say, on the alternative ground. Well, then what happens if Texas objects to the President's order and turns out to be right, legally? See, if that were true and then the review showed that it was true ­ - I don't know that it is true, but if it were, then we should turn to the Fifth Circuit claim, and there are 51 cases that depend on it. But if we've dismissed it, by that time it's gotten mixed up in the very issue you raise. The question is, Does \"constitutional\" embrace \"treaty\"? And I think there is one case that says it does, actually; or a treatise, anyway. So that's an issue. And then they might refuse a COA on that ground. And then there might -- and we'll never get this basic question decided. I'm trying out on you the argument for actually staying it, rather than digging it.",
  "What do you think? What do you -­",
  "Is the question -- how difficult is the question? The President of the United States has issued a document where he says, \"Exercising my foreign-affairs power, in my opinion the treaty, as I -- I accept the meaning of the treaty as set forth by the ICJ and apply it to these 51 cases.\" So he's deciding that. And why doesn't he have the authority to decide what that treaty means in these circumstances? That's his decision. And Texas is bound by the Constitution.",
  "So all those are -- there are a lot of reasons. Does that counsel in favor of our holding this? Here we have a case that went on a jurisdictional ground. And if we affirm or reverse that jurisdictional ground from the Court of Appeals, we'll decide a lot of issues that will create guidance. We might not have to decide it, because Texas may deal with it; or we may decide, if they come out the other way, they're wrong. But we might. And that's why I was thinking perhaps we should hold it rather than dig it, particularly because that other issue does have some authority the other way. I take it there's a treatise in the Fifth Circuit case which does say that the word \"constitutional\" here encompasses \"treaty.\"",
  "Because?",
  "Yeah, but suppose you lose -­ see, I'm thinking, suppose you lose in the Texas proceeding, it comes here, and, for whatever reason, suppose you lost again -- you might not, but you might -- in which case, then what do we do?",
  "No, no, but suppose we thought they were right? See, suppose you lost across the board? That would be the argument for holding it ­ - holding it because then you'd have another vehicle to get to these questions.",
  "What is the -- what is the data-processing part?",
  "So I guess, on that one, if, in fact, you had a telephone system, and, at the other end of the wire, Joe Smith, your friend, had recorded a message, and when you rang the call, the service simply picked up the message and played it to you, wouldn't it still be a telephone system?",
  "And how is this different?",
  "Information that other people have stored otherwise?",
  "Well, why isn't that even more telecommunications than my answering service?",
  "You know, I pick up my messages.",
  "Well, yes, of course it does, and so does my answering service.",
  "I got -- what about the next one? You were going to -- what I want to do is write down a list -­",
  "-- of those things that are not telecommunications.",
  "Well, the ability to engage or use my e-mail is an ability to access messages that other people, who don't work for you, have left for me. Now, again, I keep thinking of my answering machine -­",
  "-- and it doesn't seem very different.",
  "But, anyway, what's the third one?",
  "Yes, indeed.",
  "What it is, is a system where I pick up the phone, and what my phone does is -- let's say it had the ability to survey a number of possible people who wanted to talk to me. Would that suddenly change it from a phone to a computer or an information system?",
  "Because the other people are leaving the information; it's not the phone that's doing it.",
  "Rather like when I phone Europe, and they take the message and turn it into electronic packets, and they send it all over the world and on computers and so forth, and it comes back to me eventually, sounds a lot like my brother-in-law.",
  "Well, it does have this, that what -- if you look at the definition of \"telecommunications,\" it means \"transmitting information without change in the form or content of the information.\" Now, in respect to some of their services -- not, maybe, a lot, but in response to some -- they certainly change the content and the form. E-mail, for example, does. And there are a number of others that do. So the language, says the FCC -- I look to \"telecommunications service.\" They provide telecommunications service sometimes, and sometimes this other thing, as well, and it's all bundled. And we read the word \"offering\" to mean \"offering separately.\" And so, therefore, a person who offers only a bundled service is not a person who's offering a telecommunications service. That's how I read it, as trying to understand their argument. And it seemed to me that argument is logical, and it fits the language. Now, why is it -- are -- do you agree that it is logical and fits the language, and at least get them that far, or not?",
  "No.",
  "(Inaudible)",
  "No, but they say we have the authority, if they -- if there is a bundled service, by looking at the competitive necessity, market power, the need to protect consumers, to insist that an offeror of bundled service split the bundle and then be regulated.",
  "Yeah.",
  "No, but they're replying to your argument, and they're saying it's really not right that this means no regulation. And the reason it means no regulation is because they've long had the authority to do this, and then they cite some references where that is pretty much what the Commission said.",
  "Well, if you take them as having a broad -- if you take the statute as throwing this whole problem in the lap of the Commission -­",
  "-- and then you say they have authority, broadly, to interpret this term \"offer,\" they could give functional reasons, as in some circumstances, to interpret the word \"offer\" to mean \"offer telecommunications separately,\" and, in other circumstances, because they're functional differences, to take a different position. Now, either they do or they don't. If they don't, they're being inconsistent, and that's the subject of a different legal proceeding. If they do, so be it.",
  "Well, what about Congress thinking, quite honestly, if they -- people do think about it. I have no idea how broadband service will be provided 20 years from now. There may be a thousand competitors. There may be wireless. People may be broadcasting it through their teeth. I don't know -­",
  "-- what it's going to be. But since I don't know and have really no idea whether it should or should not be regulated, because I don't know the competitive situation, let's leave it up to the FCC.",
  "It sort of it did that in broadcasting, didn't it? I guess they could have written it to say that \"the FCC shall regulate common-carrier communications in the public interest, convenience, and necessity,\" which would put the FCC in the same situation with regard to this, as it's in with regard to broadcasting.",
  "You're not saying -- now you're using different tests. Your test is \"substantial.\" All right, on your test, are we sure, if you were the counsel to Mr. Carlson, that you recommend going ahead with the Xerox machine? Are you sure, if you were the counsel to the creator of the VCR, that you could recommend, given the use, copying movies, that we should ever have a VCR? Are you sure that you could recommend to the iPod inventor that he could go ahead and have an iPod, or, for that matter, Gutenberg, the press? I mean, you see the problem.",
  "What's the answer?",
  "Because in each case -- for all I know, the monks had a fit when Gutenberg made his press --",
  "-- but the problem, of course, is that it could well be, in each of those instances, that there will be vast numbers of infringing uses that are foreseeable.",
  "I thought it was just limited to music.",
  "I know, but I thought the study was about music.",
  "Well, I thought -- I mean, you know, we've had 90 briefs in this, and some briefs tear it apart, and others support it, but we also have briefs from the ACLU saying you could put whole libraries within this system.",
  "The question I wanted to ask you is, given that concern, that there are, conceptually anyway, really excellent uses of this thing, does deliberate -- what is the word?",
  "Yes. Because what you are worried about, it seemed to me that the actual inducement would take care of. And if you sent it back and said, \"Let's have a trial on actual inducement.\" If this really is the extreme case you're talking about, why wouldn't the Petitioners here be bound to win that trial?",
  "What is -- what is the answer to Justice Kennedy's question? I took it, whether -- for the last 21 years, industry throughout America has taken the standard as being approximately whether it is capable of substantial -- commercially significant substantial noninfringing uses.",
  "I -- and the country seems to have survived that standard. There is innovation. There are problems in the music industry, but it thrives, and so forth. So there is an argument for just following it, because it's what it is. But suppose it's totally open. Why should that be the right test, instead of some other test, like substantial use, et cetera?",
  "That, I think, was the question, and I'm very interested in your answer.",
  "Well, wait. In respect to that -- I mean, is it open? If you win on the question of the standard, is it open, or would we have to remand it for them to argue, in light of the history, in light of what they do now, they, your client, with knowledge of infringement, actively encouraged users to infringe copyright using their -- using the Grokster technology, and, indeed, knowingly would include willful blindness?",
  "Because -- as I had gotten that from one of these amicus briefs, you know, that's their standard -- they say a willful -- of willful, deliberate inducement. And that, it seems to me, important that they be able to argue that. Now, can they argue it, in your opinion, if we do nothing but affirm the Ninth Circuit?",
  "What about -- I mean, the person, if he reads the regulation, would see that it says that to classify him, the State has to show that through repetitive and seriously disruptive behavior, he has demonstrated a chronic inability to adjust as evidenced by repeated class 2 rule violations.",
  "So I guess he would like to know give me at least a vague idea of what behavior you're talking about and which class 2 rule violations you're talking about. Now, does the notice tell him those two things?",
  "So -- so this -- I mean, that's what I don't understand what this case is about because I -- I'm amazed that -- I think it is too detailed what they're requiring of you, by far. But the elements are I have to know. I'm an inmate. I want to know what is this about. Suppose I think they're wrong. I need to know how to tell them they're wrong. And the other thing I think I'd need to know is after the committee or the warden decides against me, what are his reasons. I'm not asking for a book. All I want to know are the basic reasons. Now, those things I can't work out from the briefs, quite honestly, whether the new policy gives him those new things, those two things, or doesn't.",
  "Now, already you say that, but I would think the basic information includes some idea of what my disruptive behavior was and some idea of what the class 2 violations that I was convicted of were. And now, I've heard you both say that he does get it and that he doesn't get it. I'm sure that's my fault, but I want to know, does he get this information before the hearing, or does he not?",
  "Now -- you heard what I said.",
  "Does he get what I just said?",
  "He does.",
  "Now, I don't care that he doesn't have evidence.",
  "I want to know that he thinks he's being sent to this prison because his roommate, Rat Fink, has made up a bunch of stories about him. All right? So he needs to know whether -- what it is that -­ that this board is considering before he can come in and explain what it isn't true. He doesn't have to have all the evidence. He has to know what the point is, what the charge is, what the claim is. And you're saying he gets it because he has the report. Is there an example in the record of a report?",
  "Then can you just explain that? Because the policy says that he shall get notice and attached to the notice will be a committee report. Then they have a copy of the form that the report is supposed to fill out on page 58 to about page 78 and it's about the most detailed thing I've ever seen. So -­",
  "Even though -- you mean even though it says that the policy says you should be noticed and you're -- it says, attached to the notice will be a copy of the -- I'm sorry. I'm looking -- am I looking at the wrong place?",
  "Here is the exact words I -- I think. It's -- tell me. This certainly seems to be right. The inmate shall be served with notice at least 48 hours prior to the commencement of a hearing. The notice shall include all of the reasons for the proposed placement -­",
  "-- and a summary of the evidence relied on. Now, I'm just reading that. What is it I'm reading?",
  "All right. Where is -- where is -­",
  "I'm sorry. You go ahead.",
  "So I think I've got your point. Tell me if I -- I mean, I've now looked at -- this is very confusing to me. I'm sure it's my fault. But I take it, if you look at page 22, that's the new policy.",
  "And what the new policy says is, committee, you must give the prisoner some information. Then it refers to form 2598. Form 2598 is the form on page 58.",
  "What that tells him is nothing about the facts. That tells him he's been charged. Period.",
  "Now, the new policy goes on to say, the classification committee shall document information presented by staff and the inmate which is form 2627 and 2628. And I don't know where 2698 fits in, but 2698 are all those pages with the information.",
  "And it just doesn't say anything about them at all.",
  "So your point is in the past, they didn't give them the information.",
  "Then they promulgated a new policy and the new policy says nothing about it.",
  "Well, what it says about -­",
  "But why can't you do that in an as-applied challenge? I mean, it may be that there was all this -- suppose we wrote an opinion hypothetically. Suppose -- and it said, look, I've read through this new policy. I assume it will be administered in accordance with the elements of due process, the basic elements being some kind of notice basically what -- what the factual part is, some kind of opportunity to present proofs in evidence that's a reasonable one, and some kind of decision by a neutral decision-maker. Certainly the language of the new policy permits such an interpretation. It doesn't -- and -- and suppose we were to say, well, we assume it will have the basic elements, and it's so complex, so detailed that -- that if they don't, then the individual who suffers could bring a claim and say it was administered unfairly in my case.",
  "No, I'm not disagreeing with you.",
  "But you see -- yes. I'm -- I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm saying I read their new policy, now having gotten to it the third time through all this detail, and it seems to me that they do give a notice, and Justice O'Connor just pointed out where there's a place for reasons. And as I read what happens after the committee decides, it says, it shall make a decision -- a recommendation accordingly -- according to this very long, detailed form.",
  "And it doesn't say they won't tell the prisoner. It doesn't say whether they'll tell the prisoner.",
  "So why can't I assume they will tell him so he'll know what's going on? And then if they don't, you'd have an as-applied challenge.",
  "That was before the new policy.",
  "What I'm now saying is I can understand exactly why you might feel the way you do. But our job is to not necessarily take that feeling. But shouldn't we presume that the State will administer words that comport with the basic elements, not every detail as you want, but they will administer this new policy in accord with those basic elements of fairness? Isn't that giving a -- sort of like a deference to the State, which maybe we should?",
  "Can you just give me 1 minute on the other issue?",
  "Well, maybe this needs -- I mean, if were to clarify - -",
  "Sorry.",
  "That's what I -- I wanted to follow up on this because I think it's a confusion that's embedded in my mind in some of the cases, exactly what Justice Scalia was asking you. And I'd like you to comment on whether the confusion, as I see it, that's involved here is the words -- arises out of the words, private right of action. Private right of action is where, A, one private person sues B, a non-Federal person, under a Federal statute. And the reason that can lead to confusion is because where you have a statute that governs the relation between the Federal Government and a private person, the words private right of action are out of place normally, because an action between the two parties takes place usually under the APA. Now, that's what it seems to me is at work here because the real question is not whether we have a private right of action or APA review. The question is whether Congress wanted to allow a private person to use this particular Federal provision as the basis for judicial review in a lawsuit. And if that's the right question, the answer here is obviously it did. It happens that we would have titled that normally administrative procedural review under the APA. But whether you call it private right of action or you call it APA review is beside the point. In Merrell Dow, Congress did not want actions to come into a court under the statute there at issue. In this case, Congress doesn't mind at all. In fact, it expects actions to come into court under this statute. I'd like you to comment on that thought.",
  "What happens in a title VII case if, in fact, we meet just what Justice Ginsburg said? Can you have a jury trial? Imagine a situation, jury. Okay?",
  "The plaintiff gets up and establishes the four points. Defense. The defense rests. Now, does the judge send it to the jury, or does the judge direct a verdict for the plaintiff?",
  "Unusual. I - -",
  "Then are you saying, look, judge -- imagine you had a jury on this question. If the defendant has made out enough of a case that you would send it to the jury, then go to step two and ask the questions as to why.",
  "That's it. Fine.",
  "Hicks does say that. I think you're right.",
  "All right. But suppose that -- but Wigmore says that the words, prima facie case, can be used either to describe the Hicks situation, which is the plaintiff produces the four elements. The defendant sits silent, and the judge says, directed verdict for plaintiff. That's what Hicks seems to say. And Wigmore says the words, prima facie case, can mean that. But then he says the words, prima facie case, can also mean a different thing, and the different thing is what the judge says then is, jury, you may find for the plaintiff, not you have to. And so I guess our question is which of the two meanings shall we take here. And my question to be -- to you is, why not the second? After all, the whole point of Batson is in suspicious circumstances to explore matters further, and once you get to the point where you're willing to tell a jury, jury, you may, you have suspicious circumstances.",
  "Well, if it's not a directed verdict, then a fortiori, then every analogy works against you.",
  "No. Assuming the four - -",
  "-- elements, directed verdict. If you're right - -",
  "-- about that, which is what Hicks says --",
  "-- we have a choice, a fork in the road. Take it. All right.",
  "Which fork? And I put the reason why. Your opponents will argue, it seems plausibly, take the second fork because we have the suspicious circumstance.",
  "But then - -",
  "I mean, what's bothering me about this case is, I don't know that the Government needs to argue that there is a different rule. As I read the lower-court decisions, what they've done is used the words \"core operative fact.\" Core operative facts in a tort case, where the engine of Train A runs into the caboose of Train B, is that collision. And the decision that the front -- the locomotive should have been lit, as well as the back of the caboose, seems, arguably at least, the same operative fact. Core operative facts. But to say that a witness, in the middle of the trial, was treated unconstitutionally seems, at least arguably, quite a different set of core operative facts from the fact that the Defendant was questioned before the trial. Now, that seems to me related to the nature of habeas, but it still seems to me that those words, \"core operative fact,\" the same words, work differently in the two situations. And to adopt your approach also strikes me as running around the one-year statute of limitations. Now, those are my concerns, and I would appreciate your addressing them.",
  "Could we go back? Because I'm still concerned with the fact that Claim 1, which is a claim on January 2 that police arrested the Defendant and didn't read him Miranda warnings properly; Claim 2 is a claim that, two and a half years later, the prosecutor, during the trial, made some prejudicial arguments. Now, I think, just common sense, Do those arise out of the same core operative facts? Absolutely not. The facts are totally different. The only thing that brings them together is that there was a single legal proceeding. And, at the same time, if I adopt this approach that doesn't seem to comport with the common sense, I'm running around Congress' effort with the one-year statute. So what is your response?",
  "No, but every lower court that has -- not every one; you know better than I -- but it seems like a commonly found expression when lower courts have interpreted the Rule 15 and have looked to Tiller. Is that true, or not true?",
  "No, of course not in the habeas context. I'm saying that if we're trying to apply, in the habeas context, the same test that's used elsewhere in the civil law, wouldn't we use the word \"core operative fact\"? Or would we? I'm not as familiar with this as you. What is the answer?",
  "No?",
  "But, of course, we're trying to decide what is the transaction.",
  "Right. So what about the injury? What about that? That the injury -- the trial's over, say, six weeks -- the injury takes place at the time of introduction? Or is the injury the whole time the - - the guilty verdict?",
  "Well, why doesn't the 1981 - - given -- maybe I don't -- haven't followed it correctly, but why doesn't the 1981 claim, then, relate back? I think the injury that took place from both violations took place at the time of trial.",
  "Okay, I - -",
  "Forget it.",
  "What about the other part of what's been bothering me? To be specific about it, it sounds like a very good system. The system is, \"Habeas Petitioner, you file, within a year, your petition with one claim, and we'll look it over,\" says the judge, \"and if it sounds like you need a lawyer, we'll give you a lawyer, and then he'll come in with a whole lot more.\" And that's quite protective. But suppose you said that to Congress. They passed this thing. And you say, \"You know, your year here, it doesn't really mean a year. It means a year for this initial filing, and then what's going to happen is, they'll give him a lawyer, and he'll come back and say the interest of justice, but, really, it always, almost always, favors the Petitioner, and the State isn't that fooled, and, really, it's not a problem for them, and\" - - what would that Congress have said? That's -- that is very much disturbing me.",
  "There's no doubt that they could have -- the trier of fact could have reached the same conclusion. But I guess the problem is that when you go back to reopen the evidence the second time and the judges are sitting there, someone might have thought, well, the husband didn't die, and we don't know if he actually pulled the trigger on the wife. And we're trying to guess what those judges would have done if they thought that. I don't know. It could be that people don't want to impose capital punishment without thinking I know that this person has killed somebody, and if that's so, they wouldn't have reached the same conclusion. Now, I guess that's the problem because at that time on reopening, the State told that panel of judges pretty clearly by implication that the State thought that the evidence did support Stumpf having pulled the trigger, even though at that point the State knew and indeed referred to the statement to -- you know, the confession and all the things in the second trial. Now, what do you think about that problem?",
  "They denied it, but as I read what the Ohio court said after the denial, I thought it did probably rest upon their determination that Stumpf had pulled the trigger.",
  "Did you think that?",
  "It's the Supreme Court of Ohio that then I think I got my impression from, and of course, they don't know either.",
  "The fact is we don't know what that original panel thought.",
  "Absolutely right. Of course, that's right. But we can't be sure what they would have done, and because we can't be sure what they would have done, I guess it might well have made a difference that the State told that panel we think Stumpf pulled the trigger.",
  "And that's what gives rise to the problem in the case.",
  "-- the State say when it comes to the panel, the reopening panel, we'll tell you something. We think, indeed, that's what we argued, that the State -- in the last case we argued that Stumpf didn't pull the trigger, that the balance of evidence is against that, but nonetheless, he should be sentenced to death. That would make your position absolutely consistent with what you argued in that second trial with Mr. - -",
  "Mr. Wesley.",
  "Can I ask you a procedural question here? When I read the -- the Ohio Supreme Court opinion, my impression of their due process part of it is that they found a violation because of the inconsistency between the Wesley trial and the Stumpf sentencing proceeding. When you started to talk to Justice Scalia, you agreed that couldn't be right. Rather, you said there is an inconsistency between what the prosecutor said at the Wesley trial and what the prosecutor said when Stumpf made his motion to vacate. Now, if that's so, I'm not sure that the Ohio Supreme Court or the lower courts have addressed that question to determine whether they really were inconsistent, and if so, what or why or what difference it made. But I haven't read the record thoroughly, and my impression might be wrong. So I'd appreciate your telling me what are the facts there.",
  "All right. Who is they?",
  "I'm not interested in what defense counsel did or did not say. I'm interested in what the Ohio courts did or did not say.",
  "And my point there is my -- do I repeat it or do you have it?",
  "All right. Let's go to the circuit court of appeals. When I read the decision of the circuit court of appeals in the due -- what -- what am I reading, which is -- this is in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.",
  "They went on both grounds, first the confession -- sorry -- the guilty plea, and second, the inconsistency. Now, there I thought that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals was -- now, I think I misspoke because I think that's where I see the problem.",
  "You understand what the problem is or shall I - -",
  "The Sixth Circuit seemed to be addressing the inconsistency between the sentencing proceeding of Stumpf and the Wesley trial. Well, you say the inconsistency we should focus upon is between the Wesley trial and the motion to vacate. And I think you're right about that because I can't imagine the other being a problem.",
  "It's relevant in terms of evidence, but I think you're asking us to say that there is a due process violation because of the inconsistency between what the prosecutor said at the Wesley trial and what the prosecutor said when Stumpf made his motion to vacate. Am I right?",
  "All right. I'm asking you if the Sixth Circuit or the Ohio courts has addressed that question.",
  "So I read this. You can't point to anything in which they have addressed that question. My quick reading of it -- I couldn't find anything in which they addressed that question. And if that's so, what should we do?",
  "What are the first few words of the sentence there that you quoted?",
  "Exactly. And so, they are saying that they're wrong on their ground for thinking that the language and context don't embrace it. Since they used the wrong standard, they never got to the question of whether the evidence warranted a directed verdict. So I don't see how we avoid looking at all of what you'd call the atmospherics.",
  "Because they interpreted the statute in a particular way. Isn't that right? I'm asking. I'm not - -",
  "No?",
  "Yes.",
  "That would answer that question?",
  "So they say that it does not - - the safe harbor does not reach, among other things, back down the chain of experimentation to embrace the development of new drugs that will be subject to FDA approval. In your opinion, is that statement, as I read it -- I left out the word \"identification\" -- as I read it, is that statement a correct statement of the law, or incorrect statement?",
  "That is a correct statement of the law. So then, I take it, the other thinks that it isn't, because, for example, you could have a situation where you are developing drugs, and, in developing drugs, you do some experiments and you get some information that would be useful to the FDA and the IND process, and, therefore, they are within the safe harbor.",
  "This very dialogue makes me able to ask a question that I think will reveal better to you what I need an answer to. Reading this, and listening to the discussion, and your use of the word \"atmospherics,\" suggests that the opinion below is pretty foggy. We have Merck, the Food and Drug Administration, the Government, the entire biotechnology industry, the drug industry of the United States, and everybody else telling us that they are wrong in the way they stated the standard. And you, yourself, urge us to look beyond the way they stated it. So, what's the harm, and why wouldn't we, given this and the unclarity, just try to do a better job at stating the standard, say, \"That's the standard,\" and then send it back, and then you can make all your arguments there about how it applies.",
  "That's important. They say they want to know the pharmacological action of the drug in relation to its proposed therapeutic indication. The reason, I take it, the word \"efficacy\" is not there directly is because that word has a history, the Kefauver hearings, and it was involving drugs that don't do anything. Safety is a different matter. But of course when you consider whether something is safe, you must know, since, for example, cancer drugs poison people, the extent to which that poisoning is outbalanced by its effect in curing people. So how could you possibly, particularly where cancer is at issue, know whether this is an appropriately safe drug, without knowing how effective it is, as well as knowing the side effects that are -- that are harmful? If I knew that there was any answer to that question at all, I might be tempted to agree with you, because it doesn't use the word. But what's the answer?",
  "Suppose that we concluded - - well, I don't want to cut you off. Go ahead, please. If I cut you off.",
  "Yes, but the reason you brought it up is because the particular certificate that is for a safety-certified lab is not applicable to the lab that used this stuff. That's why you brought it up, I think.",
  "And I understand that. And you'd have to conclude, for them to win -- but suppose I did conclude -- suppose, for hypothetical -- the sake of -- for -- as a hypothetical, suppose I thought, yes, this does include the safety part, looking at how effective drugs are, too. Suppose I concluded that the statute meant sometimes you could do that, in an ordinary laboratory that didn't have the special certificate? Suppose I concluded that, indeed, you could look well in advance of the clinical test period to get the information for the IND? And suppose I concluded that sometimes, where it was reasonably related, you could, in fact, look at other drugs, too, that are related to the ones you do. If I concluded that -- and I'm not saying I would -- then would you concede that a directed verdict would have been appropriate against you?",
  "Because? And what's your strongest argument that it wouldn't?",
  "All right. All that's true, but the question that I think Justice Ginsburg asked was you have on your side the whole National Defense Industrial Association. You have the Equal Employment Advisory Council that represents dozens and dozens, I take it, of businesses. We have your own client. We have you in the firm. Everybody. I imagine you all racked your brains to say has there ever been such an example, and I take the answer is no, never. Not all of you could even find one instance where this happened. Now, am I right? Because that's what I think unless you provide the example.",
  "Okay. So -- so what would be so unreasonable about a Member of Congress concluding the following? We want these things to end after 6 years, you know? And there's never been an example of this horrible that you think of, and so we are going to end them all after 6 years from the time the thing took place, the cheat took place. And that's it. And if there's some other problem of the kind you're worried about that comes up, we will worry about that later through amendment, tolling, et cetera. Why is that an -- we don't want 30 - day statutes of limitations or 90-day statute of limitations. We want 6 years. That helps most people. And if there's an odd case that doesn't, we'll worry about it. What's the answer to that?",
  "Yes, that's true, it would be. And the reason we're doing it is because there's a period of time when somebody lies to the Government and we don't want actions that are related to that. We'll have to go into that proof to take place more than 6 years later. Now, that would be the reason, and I agree it would be contrary. But the difficulty for me is the language seems to point to that reason.",
  "And I can't find that reason idiotic.",
  "But don't we have to do that anyway when -- when in fact a person brings an ordinary claim? I mean, Joe Smith brings a claim that XYZ company cheated the Government. Now, that doesn't mean it was committed. It just means he says it was committed. After all, he might lose.",
  "You mean if in fact the plaintiff loses because the jury finds for the defendant in the qui tam action, then it should have been dismissed on statute of limitations grounds.",
  "No, of course not because - - because the word is committed there refers to the claim of a plaintiff. Doesn't it?",
  "What about an action of ejectment, an action of ejectment that arises only after the adverse possession statute of limitations have run?",
  "I'm not sure it is right.",
  "I'm missing something on waiver, but I would have thought a person can waive a -- a right to have a counsel on appeal. He can waive a trial. He can waive a jury trial. But before he has to -- before he decides, he has to know that he has the constitutional right to a jury trial.",
  "And why wouldn't he also have to have the -- to know that he has the constitutional right to a lawyer to represent him?",
  "All right. That has nothing to do with equal protection. It has to do simply with a very common sense rule that we apply in every case, jury trial, et cetera. So all we'd have to say is, of course, he has a right to a lawyer. Now, if he wants to go back and waive that right, fine.",
  "That's all. That's the end of it.",
  "So what's all this complicated thing about?",
  "No, no. You'd have to say the statute is wrong in taking away the right.",
  "But he can waive it if he wants to, knowing that he has the right.",
  "I'm mixed up again. What is the answer to this? I -- I would have thought that even if those words that Justice O'Connor read referred directly to the kind of appeal that we have in front of us -- in other words, the one that's at issue -- that still he'd have to know he has a right to a lawyer on that appeal before he could waive it.",
  "And does anybody dispute that?",
  "Is that at issue here?",
  "Look, the -- imagine -- I'm just repeating what Justice Souter said. There must be - - it's so obvious that there must be an obvious answer, but I haven't heard the answer. He knows Michigan law or his lawyer does. The Michigan lawyer looks at the statute. It says a defendant who pleads guilty shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review with some exceptions, which they claim are inadequate. So he thinks the law is shall not. I have no right. So he doesn't not only -- not only is he not waiving a known right, there's nothing for him to waive. He has no such right. Now, obviously, when there's nothing for him to waive, how could he waive anything? And obviously, a person who's told, hey, you don't have a right to appeal no matter what and then he says, okay, I waive my right to appeal, I mean, really.",
  "Okay, that's the end of it. Right?",
  "Precisely.",
  "Precisely.",
  "And that's what we're deciding is - -",
  "That's exactly the issue in front of us. Is it constitutional or not constitutional? And waiver has nothing to do with it.",
  "Why -- sorry. Finish. I just had a -- I wanted to go back to something you said, but I want you to be finished.",
  "Look, this is what I'm -- I'm interested in. It seems like Michigan is unique here. Why not do, if you're worried about resources, what other States have done? You just say, okay, of course, you have a right to an appeal and, of course, you have a lawyer. We'll give it to you if you're poor. But, by the way, if you want to plead guilty, we're not entering into that deal unless you waive it.",
  "Now, I take it that the basic rule that we've followed -- and this is what people are arguing about -- could be a criminal trial or proceeding, plea, something in a trial court.",
  "It emerges with a judgment, and then there is going to be the first review. Call it a leave to appeal, call it an appeal, call it whatever you want, but it is the first review. And in those two instances, State, if the defendant is poor, give him a lawyer. That's simple. That's clear. Everybody could understand it. They may not even have a lot of legal arguments. Now, what significant -- what does that prevent a State from doing that it's reasonably important for a State to want to do?",
  "Is there any other State that's done it the way Michigan has?",
  "You're talking about a piece of paper, that first piece of paper saying to the appeals court, appeals court, please hear my appeal.",
  "And then it lists a whole lot of reasons like a cert petition.",
  "And those are likely to do with the merits of the case. I mean, they'll tell all the horrible things that went on. And the question is, is he going to have a lawyer to help him with that piece of paper or not?",
  "All right. Now -- now, it sounds to me just the kind of thing you'd write if you had an appeal on the merits too. No. It's even harder. Even harder. You've got to convince them to take it.",
  "So why draw that distinction? The piece of paper is the same, even harder to write, needs the lawyer as much, first chance he gets after the trial court. Why draw that distinction?",
  "All that is true, but I think that the court below and the other parties say -- almost everybody is on your side. However, they also note a problem, and the problem is that given the very rigid structure of AEDPA and the imagination of lawyers, that if 60(b) hasn't proved an escape hatch for getting around the AEDPA restriction, it will, and that what the lawyers will do is they will reconstruct what they'd like as a second habeas and put it in the form of a 60(b). And so I can accept everything you say, but if that in the back of my mind is a concern running around Congress in this way, what form of words could you put in to restrict 60(b) to its domain which is the domain in which it's been used so far? Now, the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation filed a brief in which they tried to do that. I thought that was a constructive effort. So what's your opinion - -",
  "-- about how best to do that?",
  "No, but that's - -",
  "You -- you had a question. Remember my -- you were giving me the three principles to prevent the end run.",
  "And the first was good cause. The second was potentially meritorious underlying issues, and the third is?",
  "Thank you.",
  "But the -- the Government, by the way, seems a broader rule than yours. The only thing it rules out is new legal claims or new evidence. I don't see anything in your -- tell me if I'm wrong, but I don't see anywhere where you say we should be able to bring a 60(b) motion based on new legal claims or new evidence.",
  "That's what I said. I don't see how the Government hurts you. I think -- I think if you the Government's, you're even better off.",
  "I mean, it's even -- but I want to know why -- why -- there's some reason you don't like the Government, and -- and -- other than fact that they must hurt you in some way. I don't see how it hurts you.",
  "-- make us - -",
  "And under their test too, you say it's applying the same rule of -- it's not a new claim. It's the same claim as -- as -- just that they - - shows that the district judge got it wrong.",
  "So that's the - -",
  "That's also true of (b)(3).",
  "And not even the Eleventh Circuit said (b)(3). And therefore, you want to say absolute, or are we really talking about which 60(b) motions escape the strictures of AEDPA?",
  "And you're prepared to defend the -- the Eleventh Circuit.",
  "Correct, though you're alone on that because even the Government doesn't and nor does the criminal justice. But if you're prepared to defend them, I guess you'd say why is it that they will allow (b)(3), fraud on the court by the adverse party, to escape, but should your own witness turn out to have been committing his own fraud for whatever set of reasons, you can't.",
  "Well, under I guess the Government, you can bring everything under 60(b). By the way, if they do bring a motion to reopen under 60(b) because of change of law, they're almost bound to lose. There are hardly any cases which find that an adequate ground under 60(b). But they let you do anything under 60(b), I take it, as long as the claims presented do not -- as long as they are not trying to obtain relief on the basis of new legal claims or new evidence. Now, I just noticed there's another one here. Do not support habeas relief. Maybe that's the problem.",
  "You explain. I -- I thought when I first read this, that this was quite broad, but I may not have read it perfectly.",
  "So is that also true if his own witness has committed the fraud?",
  "Yes.",
  "And all I'm saying is exactly whatever criteria is met, that it happens to be his own witness, and sometimes your own witnesses do have their little games, you know, with prisoners, and so it's the same thing.",
  "Does that not count too?",
  "On page 24, I read the or wrong.",
  "It's -- you meant the things on both sides of the or.",
  "And I was thinking the first side you'd allow, the second side you wouldn't. But if it's very, very strict, which now I understand it, because I read the or correctly when I went back.",
  "My question would be why.",
  "But now you're into -- I mean, you can use a tone of voice. You know, it sounds very strong. But I thought 60(b)(6) is weird things happen, and 60(b)(1) is there are all kinds of mistakes. You know, some of them can just be accidental. The lawyer was hit by a trolley. And in fact, all of 60(b) is meant to capture that kind of thing. So it sounds like what you're saying is, sure, follow 60(b), maybe not the evidentiary, maybe not the new evidence part, follow it, but be sure you do so strictly. Are you saying more than that?",
  "Well, suppose Artuz had been decided and it was in the mail and the judge forgot to open his advance sheets that day. And so he goes back to his office, says, oh, my God. You know, I mean, a weird thing like that. And of course, he says nobody has been hurt yet. I'll reopen it. Okay? Is that all right?",
  "Well, it's 10 days and a half.",
  "And the reason that it's happened is because all the lawyers were hit by four trolleys.",
  "I mean, you see what I'm doing? I'm simply trying to find cases that fit within the language, but they're very weird and justice cries out for a reopening. Now, that's what it seems to me one is about. Two is about. Three doesn't really. Three you agree applies. Two may not apply. Three you agree applies. Four I think you probably agree applies or not at all. Five doesn't apply at all, and six is anything under the sun.",
  "Can I ask a quick question? The -- there are three things. Were -- were you finished?",
  "Sorry.",
  "Okay.",
  "That's -- that's the problem.",
  "That's the problem because here we're dealing with the fee to be paid by the people who are plated in Michigan, and it looks like that $100 is the fee for them. Well, let me -- I have a question. I'm trying to test this. Suppose that I have a company in Maine. All right? And I have -- I decide all my -- I -- I have all Maine plates, by the way. And I decide I want my - - now, let's -- one word is license plates. I'm going to talk about plating. Another word is the ICC insurance. Let's call it a decal. And the third kind of a concept is whatever you refer to in your statute by a fee. All right? The $100.",
  "All right. Now, suppose in Maine what I do with my trucks is I say I want Michigan to be my home State for purposes of -- what do you call it? The SS?",
  "Yes. And so I go to Michigan, and now I pay all the registration fees here. Do I get a -- a certificate of some kind, a decal or something to show I did it?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, yes. So -- that's right.",
  "Do I get a decal after I go through all this procedure? You have a whole form. I pay $6 for Alabama. I pay $2 for Idaho, and -- but -- but I do it all in one shopping place which happens to be Michigan.",
  "Then do I get a little certificate to put on the truck to say I did it. I -- I registered my ICC decal everywhere.",
  "No, it's not.",
  "I know for Michigan. But I have to pay. But Michigan is my -- I can't ask the question until I get clear on this.",
  "Don't -- when I -- when I go under this -- this 49 U.S.C. 14504 and I choose a home State - -",
  "-- and I make all the relevant payments to that State, but they distribute, don't I get a piece of paper saying I did it?",
  "Fine. Now, I'm now plated in Michigan, and I make Michigan my home State for this. And I go and I make -- I say, Michigan, I'm going to give you this big check to distribute, but the amount I'm putting here for Michigan, by the way, is zero. And you say pay me $100. No. I'm not going to do it. So I haven't paid them the $100. I haven't paid Michigan everything, but I paid $2 for Idaho. Do I get the decal or don't I?",
  "Excellent. Now, if I don't get the decal, because I didn't pay the $100, then that $100 is a charge that falls within the SSI. It is a charge for a decal which shows that I registered the ICC and my insurance because otherwise, if it weren't, you'd give me the decal.",
  "I'm talking about a fee. I'm trying to -- oh, fine. If there's no fee charged and I didn't pay the $100 and I didn't pay anything else, you'd give me the decal. But you said you wouldn't.",
  "If you're -- if you're going to -- if you're going to consider something that wasn't a recall of a mandate as if it was, why don't you consider it as a rule 41(b) action?",
  "They didn't recall it, didn't -- did they? Did they recall it? They issued it and then recalled it?",
  "Fine.",
  "Correct. So we did -- they didn't recall it. So, of course, 41(b) does not have to do with recalls. 41(b) has to do with issuances, and 41(b) says the court may shorten or extend the time for issuing. Now, why wouldn't that be the obvious rule to apply to what occurred here?",
  "So -- so your view --",
  "Is that --",
  "But isn't that the reading of circuit?",
  "Have you surveyed the circuits? I know this -- what -- what you describe as the practice certainly wouldn't have been in the First Circuit. Maybe in the D.C. it was, but I mean, we would have thought that we have the power over our own mandate. And of course, if it hasn't issued and some extraordinary thing comes along requiring a revision, we would have revised it. So when you read the rules and you say that's what we argue, you're not arguing it about any court that I'm familiar with as an appeals court. So -- so have you looked up the appeals courts and found that in fact there is at least one court or two or maybe more that follow the interpretation that you're arguing for?",
  "Well, if you have not, then my experience would be you're arguing for a rule that no appeals court follows, that -- that all think they have power over the mandate, and that the question becomes one of whether or not there was a good reason for delaying the mandate.",
  "If there was a good reason, they could, and if there wasn't, maybe they couldn't. But Justice Ginsburg has set forth what sounds to me like an excellent reason, that the judge discovered he had made an error that could mean life or death or jail or innocence, and before that opinion issues, I want to be sure it's correct. Now -- now, that's how I'm thinking, that the general practice is contrary to what you say, that the question is a good reason, and that here there could hardly be a better one. So what is your response?",
  "And all the circuits have just been wrong in their interpretation.",
  "I don't either.",
  "But that's why I'm quite curious, but I only have experience in one circuit. And -- and I have an impression, but I need to know what is the general practice. I would have thought -- but this is highly impressionistic -- that probably the mandates didn't always issue within 7 days, that it wasn't totally uncommon to have them 10 days or 12, and it was fairly informal. Certainly there were no notice, but maybe other circuits do it differently. It's an area that's obscure to me, and I'd like to know how do people actually handle it. Is it something that is generally within the -- up to the individual court of appeals to provide notice or not or whatever as it wishes? Is it that some delays, 6 months, might be really much too late? Is it -- how does it work in the circuits?",
  "And they don't normally give notice or -- or something like that? They say, it will be here in 7 days, but we'll tell you we've delayed it. They just do it.",
  "I think they might have handled it that way, but I don't know if that's the right way.",
  "You used words --",
  "I know you know that the -- you've put your finger on a problem for me. You have said, Would it be the case that a person, before the proceeding begins, could simply tell somebody else to destroy the smoking gun? I understand that you fear that Andersen's approach would lead to that result. And it's bothering me. Therefore, I'd like you whether the word \"corruptly\" could include a person who knows three things: one, that the investigation, which has not yet started, almost certainly will want this document; two, there is no legal right to withhold it; and, three, that if I tell him to do it, it will be destroyed -- I mean, that it's important to the investigation. Important to the investigation, they want it, it's cover-up, and they will, in fact, have no legal right to take it back. Now, would that be \"corrupt\"?",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay. IF that's \"corrupt,\" then does that cover this case?",
  "How? Because it seems to me there was quite a lot of -- by the way, the person who's doing the persuading has to know this. They have to know that it will be wanted, that it's important, and there is no legal right to withhold it. So it seems to me that, on the one hand, that does cover your problem, and, on the other hand, it does not cover this case. Now, that's what I'd like you to reply to.",
  "No. The jury instruction left out the word \"corruptly,\" as far as I can see, in the part that was critical. They define \"corruptly\" as simply an intent to impede. And the word \"impede\" goes well beyond what I've said, both because it does not cover the three things, but, most particularly, because it does not say that it was dishonest or that the person who did the persuading knew that the jury or the grand jury or the investigation would have the legal right to get the material and there was no right to withhold it. The words that Arthur Andersen suggested, while they don't say precisely that, were at least a step in the right direction.",
  "Well, but it sounds like -- actually, I'll grant you that it appears in the statute, but that's, in a sense, my problem. The statute talks about \"corruptly persuading another person to destroy a paper with the intent to impair that paper's availability for use in an official proceeding.\" So, then we look at the instruction, and the instruction speaks of \"destroying the paper with the intent, at least in part, to impede.\" Fine. It sounds like it's just the same as the statute, but for one thing, the omission in the instruction of the word \"corruptly.\"",
  "All right. So to define \"corruptly\" as \"doing the same thing that the rest of the statute does\" seems a little strange. If I were a juror, I might think that there is missing here any dishonesty of purpose.",
  "It's not perfectly redundant. One can imagine driving a wedge between making something unavailable, which the jury would find relevant, or the investigator would find relevant, and impeding the fact- finding ability of the investigator. They're not logically identical, but they do strike me as so similar that it's hard to expect a juror to make much of a difference between those two phrases.",
  "No, the --- in general terms, when you speak of \"general interpretation,\" I suppose I think it possible to approach ambiguous criminal statutes with the following idea. Congress did not intend to try to make of the statute a highly general weapon for the Justice Department to pick and choose. That's a notification problem. It's also because we don't want one law, \"It is a crime to do wrong, in the opinion of the Attorney General.\" You know, I mean, we want to have narrow criminal statutes. Now, is it reasonable to start with that frame of mind? And if it is, doesn't that tend to cut against you in this case?",
  "What do you think about the possibility, \"it depends on the clothes and depends on the equipment,\" so that, in Steiner and here, it's a lot of protective gear, it's really quite part of the job and special and unusual. In Mt. Clemens, it's a kind of uniform. It's just washing your hands up, putting on an apron. So, where it's minor putting on clothes, as someone might in his house, doesn't come in substantial, doesn't come in integral and indispensable; but where it's quite a big deal, it does. And who decides? The agency.",
  "But \"in certain\" -­",
  "-- that footnote -- that's where I actually got the idea -- it says, \"We reserve, in certain situations.\" To me, that meant sometimes it can be a major big deal to don clothing -- protective gear; sometimes it isn't -- an apron. And whose job is it? Now I'm repeating myself.",
  "The Secretary's.",
  "Can I ask you about a -- the other part of the case? I mean, I think, as I've suggested, most of these things are up to the agency. They're minor things in law, so -- but it seems well established in the agency reg, as well as in Skidmore, the famous line about waiting being, \"Are you waiting to be engaged, or are you engaged to wait?\" So, assuming that this is just putting on and off clothes that are essential -- so, assume you win on that part -- when they wait to put on the clothes, you would think -- if it's like an airport, sometimes you wait; if you're lucky, you don't. Well, under those circumstances, you wouldn't be engaged to wait. You're waiting to put on the clothes, not -- you know, etcetera -- so, why would you win on that part?",

  "But suppose sometimes you have to wait? Sometimes it's a minute, sometimes it's nothing. Is it like an airport? Or does the employer here say, \"You must show up seven minutes early, because there'll be a wait\"?",

  "Now, what -- now you have the whole argument that I'm thinking of. What do you respond?",
  "What's strange about it? I mean, every upstream tax, as Mr. Olson said, raises the price of goods and services. And it's harder to retail them, because they cost more. So, that's true of every single good sold on the reservation. So I take it your claim must -- and, of course, it may or may not be true that the tribe can put a tax on that. It depends upon",
  "But suppose they can't?",
  "Well, my question is, If we hold for you here, and we don't take an absolute principle, well, I guess States are forbidden to put any upstream taxes on.",
  "Why isn't that so?",
  "Well, we ought to know, because they've been -- haven't they had this for a while? So, there must be a dealer somewhere who's not on the reservation -- he's a distributor -- somebody delivered to him a thousand gallons, and it's sitting there in his tank. Doe he have to pay the tax, or doesn't he?",
  "Well, if he would -­",
  "-- pay the tax, then it is not --",
  "-- on his -­",
  "-- redistribution.",
  "He is -- sorry -- if -- I'd like to ask the question.",
  "If -- and you can say why this is wrong -- if he gets a thousand gallons from whoever -- Exxon or somebody -- and he puts it in the tank, and he hasn't sold it, and he has to pay the tax, then it would seem to me to be a sale on the distribution to him, not the sale on his distribution to somebody else. Now, why is that wrong?",
  "So, now you're telling me something different from what I understood. I thought you said it probably has happened in the history of this tax --",
  "-- that a distributor picked up a gallon of fuel, held it, and has not yet redistributed it. So, you're saying that's never happened.",
  "If I'm certain about what the tax is on, what should we do? Dismiss the case or send it to the -- ask a question, or what?",
  "All right, suppose you're right. Can you answer my first question? Can you even remember it? I'll summarize. On your assumption. Look, the Indians, if there is a tax -- they have a retail shop or they have things on the reservation, they go buy them -- Kansas can't impose a tax on what goes on, on the reservation. We go through the balance. But they certainly could impose a tax on the department store in Kansas City, couldn't they?",
  "And so, the Indian then goes to the department store and buys it. He has to pay the tax, doesn't he?",
  "Okay. Now what he does, he says, \"Call up and\" -- he says, \"Please deliver it.\" Now he doesn't have to pay the tax?",
  "Is the commerce constitutionally -­",
  "All right. Well -­",
  "-- we're now talking Federal rules. Go ahead.",
  "All right. So, if balancing -­",
  "-- then how do you come out? Because what they're saying is, \"Okay, balance. Fine. You want to balance? Here's how you balance.\"",
  "On the one hand, the Indians have to pay the tax. Okay, that's true. And it's harder for them to impose their own tax. That's true of every upstream tax. And it goes for roads that they use all the time. And they just have a one-and-a-half mile -- and why shouldn't they be treated every -- like everybody else, when they're going to use the roads the tax pays for? So, the balancing works in their favor. Now, what's your response?",
  "Well, if that's a winning -- of course it is different, in the sense you say, but if, in fact, it's an interference -- look, every upstream tax raises the price of goods and services. Every upstream tax -- indeed, every tax in the world -- makes it harder to sell the product. So, every tax makes it harder for the tribe to tax that item which was taxed by somebody else. Now, if that's the basis for saying it's an interference, then every tax is an interference. And I don't see how that could be.",
  "But, so far, your theory is based on economics, as I've heard it.",
  "But if it isn't, I would like to know what it is.",
  "The incidence of the tax -­",
  "Oh.",
  "That's very surprising. When I read the statute, it doesn't have one word about the retailer being obliged to pay -­",
  "-- anything.",
  "All right, if that's -­",
  "-- the legal incidence of the tax, I would think their side would win, in my mind. Now suppose, actually, the legal incidence of the tax is not on that retailer, but, rather, is on the distributor.",
  "If that's so, and if we get into balancing, which I don't know, what is to be said in favor of the Indian side? It sounded to me as if it's harder for them to tax. So, I'm thinking, well, that's true of every tax. And then, put it on something else. Put it on the tires. Put it on anything else, if you can. It'll be harder for them to tax non-Indians. But I didn't know they had a Federal right to tax the non-Indians.",
  "Is the one other -- the interest other than the interest on being able to tax an item that an upstream tax prevents you from doing because of the economics?",
  "Is that the only one, or are there other ones?",
  "I've got the -- -­",
  "-- I want to hear you and know if there's an additional one. I'm not disputing that one. I just want to be sure I get them all. One is -- one is that one.",
  "What else?",
  "In your view, were it not for the statute, the Federal statute, your view of the Attorney General's authority is -- leaving that statute aside, if it weren't there -- the Attorney General, should we have an Attorney General who is opposed to the death penalty, could, in fact, regulate or stop Federal -- State death penalties, through this same mechanism, by saying that no physician can be registered insofar as he engages in that.",
  "Well, what we're getting -- at least what I'm getting at was this is, I would probably have read the statute to say that the drug statute, which is trying to stop drug addiction and heroin and -- has nothing to do with the death penalty. And I would think that the argument on the other side is that the statute has nothing to do with assisted suicide. Congress didn't think about the death penalty, and it didn't think about assisted suicide. It's rather like the tobacco case, except a fortiori. Now, what's your response to that?",
  "Why were -- you were going to say, at one point -- why was Congress concerned about overdoses of narcotics and so forth? Why?",
  "But, I mean, there was a reason, wasn't there, that they're worried about people taking narcotics?",
  "Right.",
  "Right. What was the main --",
  "I would have thought it was narcotics addiction.",
  "All right. Well, if it is narcotics addiction -­",
  "-- and I would have thought that was it -­",
  "All right. All right. Again, because you know I'm going to say, What has this got to do with that? So, why not solely?",
  "Not solely. You go ahead. What else?",
  "Right.",
  "Yes. Yes, but it's true addiction. And this seems to -­",
  "No?",
  "Yes, because, I mean, wouldn't -- suppose that some State said that, \"We think doctors can prescribe, for people who want to take it, morphine for recreational use.\"",
  "No matter what? I mean, they have cases and so forth that say, \"Of course a State could go too far. A State might decided it's\" -- just what I said. And you're going to say your case turns or falls -­ you win or lose, depending on whether I accept that a State could not stop a doctor from becoming, in effect, a conduit to a group of drug dealers by saying, \"I think recreational use is part of my medical practice\"? That would be up to the State?",
  "No.",
  "Suppose I disagreed with you about that, then would you lose the case?",
  "I'm asking, if I disagreed with you that I thought -- we take the facts of Moore, where he's a drug pusher, the doctor, and, for some unknown reason, the State says, \"That's fine, it doesn't violate State law,\" but the Attorney General says, \"Do what you want about State law. I think it violates the Federal law.\" Suppose I think the Attorney General does have the right to do that for -- assuming it -- assuming it -- then what do you say about this case?",
  "Would you spend a minute -­",
  "I'm sorry, on that, I didn't think that the reg was defining the word \"dispense.\" I thought the statute defines the word \"dispense.\" And it's -- persons registered by the AG to dispense controlled substances are exempt. And then you look at who is such a person. A person who does that is a practitioner. And who is a practitioner? A registered practitioner is one who prescribes, a physician registered by the United States to distribute or dispense a controlled substance in the course of professional practice. And I thought this reg is defining \"in the course of professional practice.\" Am I wrong about that? I thought it was a reg that says, \"In the course of professional practice, the prescription, to be effective, must be a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner.\" Now, I might be wrong. How does it work?",
  "On the matter of policy, I would -- since -- if you -- if you've said basically what you want to say in your argument, I would appreciate your devoting a minute to an assumption which you don't want to agree with. But suppose I were to assume that a State is not free, through the device of defining what's good medical practice, to gut the Act -- that is, to really make marijuana or something else, like morphine, legal -­ because they disagree with Congress's basic judgment that it should be illegal. That could happen.",
  "Now, suppose I think that the AG does have the power to stop Congress from gutting the Act. All right? Now, on that, do I have -- if I believe that, on that assumption, do I have to decide this case against you?",
  "And if not, why not?",
  "Suppose, on the commerce-clause question, I -- on assumption, I don't agree with you, either -- then do I have to decide?",
  "Far be it from me to suggest an argument that you don't want to make, but, I mean, I've found it different, in life and law, when you pass a rule in a State that guts an Act, from when you pass the rule in a State that doesn't seem to have much to do with the purpose of the Act.",
  "That's a well-established principle of administrative law. I've never seen a case in administrative law where a party -- a private party coming in and challenging a Government's action doesn't bear the burden of proof. And Alaska isn't contrary to that.

  "-- \"in equipoise\"?",
  "This is true.",
  "All right, that's true. That's -- I understand. I sympathize with that point. I'm worried, however, about the fact that this statute doesn't just cover the initial IEP. It covers a whole range of things, including, for example, you have a hyperactive child. The hyperactive child behaves badly in class. The hyperactive child receives discipline related, say, to how it's placed. Well, the parents might -- properly, perhaps -- think that was very unfair and wrong, and they might challenge that disciplinary mark. There can be thousands of different kinds of issues that come up. And, in all of these issues, is it supposed to be the burden of the school board, for example, to show that the teacher who had the child sit in the back of the class or received a bad discipline mark or something? Does the -- does the school board have to prove that the teacher was right?",
  "Wouldn't it, if it were related to the placement?",
  "No, no, I say that there are a number of -- what I'm thinking of is a lot of interim decisions that come up that are affecting how the child is placed -- whether in class, whether in that class, whether with a special teacher, whether without a special teacher, whether with somebody during the recess periods, whether not. I mean, they're -- these are very complicated matters, and there can be important overall matters, and there can be what I'd call interstitial matters.",
  "What I'm driving at is -- and I think it was well expressed in one of these cases, a New Jersey case, perhaps -- that is it the same burden of proof whether the matter is interstitial or whether it's an initial placement or a change of -­",
  "-- placement? Do we have the same burden of proof always on the school board, no matter what?",
  "Well, if I take -- if I accept your view of that, that would be a Federal rule written into the statute. And that would mean that, even if the Department of Education came to a different conclusion, or even if we have a bunch of States that come to a different conclusion, or even if it's in Minnesota, they want to have a rule that \"sometimes it's one way, sometimes the other way,\" we couldn't do that. But if I were a Member of Congress, and never thought about the issue, which I think this void in the statute suggests, I might think it would work out better if we left it up to each State to do it whatever way they wanted here, if we left it up to the Department of Education to promulgate whatever rules they wanted. Now, couldn't we hold that?",

So, I looked up that, and it was on, like, page 273 and, I think, 173 there. And they asked Mr. LeBeau, and he says, \"Lincoln operates through many different structures, and I don't know what they were using here.\" Am I right ­ -",

Now, I would like -- and, indeed, it was a partnership of which he was a partner. So, if a Virginia resident is a partner of the defendant, which is a partnership, then maybe you were right. So, I'm interested in: What is the evidence that Mr. Franzen was a partner of the defendant, which is a partnership?",
  "What page --",
  "-- is that? Is that a --",
  "Well, that's better than what is in the opinion. What is it? 181.",
  "But to get the real parties before the court, you have to sue them.",
  "And, apparently, you didn't sue the right people until you replied to me. Then I took your argument, because it seemed like seven arguments, mixed up, and I took that argument to be the following. I'm -- I, the plaintiff, sued a defendant, who is called the Lincoln Property Company. Now, I grant you, there is some evidence that that defendant, the one I sued, is a Texas corporation. One, they showed us the certificate of incorporation, or they got a sworn statement. Two, in my complaint, I said that's what he was. However, there is some evidence the other way. On page 179 and 181, we have a person named Mr. Franzen who says, \"I am the senior president, vice president, partner for defendant Lincoln Property Company,\" in which case, if that's your argument, you're telling us -- is that your argument, that there is some evidence the real defendant, whom I sued, is not a corporation, despite the apparent evidence to the contrary?",
  "Rather, it is a partner, and Mr. Franzen is a partner in it. Is that your argument?",
  "Do you want to make that argument here, or are you going to give up on that argument?",
  "No, I'd like the -- these are very expensive, this litigation. You're all the way in the Supreme Court. It's costing people a lot of money. And if there is a legal issue here, I'd like to find out what it is. I have exactly the same question Justice Stevens had, which is where I started. Do you agree that the company you sued, called Lincoln Property, is a Texas corporation, yes or no?",
  "All right.",
  "Then that's out -- fine, that's out of the case. The next question is -- of course you could sue a real company, called Lincoln Property or Jolly Fisherman, and it could turn out that that real company is a front, that it has no real existence, its -- all its papers and everything to do with it is signed by a totally separate corporation. Are you saying that's what happened here? And if that's what happened here, which is the real corporation and people in interest?",
  "I'm not talking about burden-of-proof failure.",
  "I'm asking you, Who is the real corporation or person in interest that Lincoln Property is a kind of sham or front for?",
  "Okay. Then you think --",
  "I'm getting there. I'm not arguing with you. I'm getting there. Then you think that whoever it is that they are the front for has -- is a Virginia resident. Is that what you think?",
  "Might be a Virginia resident.",
  "Might be.",
  "You think there is a real party there that might be a Virginia resident. And do you have any idea whatsoever of what that real party is called?",
  "And what's the evidence that there is a Virginia resident, in there?",
  "But I guess what he's saying -- I'm trying to put the -- as good a light on it as I can -- it's a -- that if, in fact -- if a big real-estate developer, which is a corporation -- what they do is, they organize a lot of deals, and their deals would take the form of hundreds and hundreds of limited partnerships, which are owned buildings in various States. And I think he's saying, \"Well, for diversity purposes, we should consider the citizenship of the parent corporation to be the citizenship of the limited partnership that happens to have control of the building that we're complaining about.\"",
  "No, he thinks --",
  "-- you are responsible, but he thinks you ought to have the citizenship of the intermediate entities that own, or manage directly, the building.",
  "See, I'm not -- this is a fairly complex area.",
  "And, as I understand, at this moment -- and I hope you'll correct me if I'm wrong -- in a \"weighing\" State, we look at the aggravating side, and there seem, let's say, to be three factors that you could take into account and weigh them against all the mitigation. I'm imagining that. And you might have thought, if factor one turns out to be invalid, the reason that that's a big mistake, because the jury would have weighed something against all that mitigating evidence that it shouldn't have. And what's something? There would be a lot of evidence on it, so it took it -- evidence into account it shouldn't have. So, I might have thought that was so. But when I read the cases, that isn't so, because I think it's -- in Clemons the evidence would have come in anyway. So, if that isn't so, what could be wrong with this problem in the \"weighing\" State? And the answer, I guess, has to be that the prosecutor or the State said, \"Jury, you look to these three things,\" with a tone of voice that really made them important. And the jury then weighed one and two and three. It didn't have anything to do with the evidence. Well, if that's the problem, California seems to have that problem, because one of the things it says to weigh is, \"Weigh circumstances of the crime.\" And that means that's not everything. That's not the history of this defendant. And so, the problem that existed in Clemons and in Stringer and in Zant that led to constitutional error seems to be there in California's case, too. Now, I probably have made five mistakes in my little recitation here, and I'd ask you to point them out.",
  "The word \"special circumstances\" is ambiguous, because it might refer to something in the world, in which case it's about evidence, or it might refer to something in the law, in which case it's a statement by a prosecutor to look at some of this evidence and give it some special weight. Now, that what's confusing me throughout. As I understood this area, to go back to what Justice Scalia was saying -- no, wait, just -- I'll back up to try to get you to correct my misunderstanding -- Zant is the key, because Zant says, \"Judge, if you have a 'non-weighing' State\" -- that is, everything's relevant but the kitchen sink -- \"the fact that the prosecutor made a mistake at the eligibility stage by including something he shouldn't is beside the point.\" Is that right?",
  "Fine. Then we look at Stringer and Clemons, and they're making exceptions to Zant. And they're making exceptions for \"weighing\" States. So, even if the evidence in all three cases is identical and it made no difference to the evidence -- that is, to what really happened in the world -- still, says Clemons and Stringer -- still, you're not home free yet, State. Rather, you have to back up and do harmless-error analysis. So, the answer, I think, to Justice Scalia, if I understand it, is, Justice Scalia, you may be right, maybe all this is harmless, but we don't have before us the product of harmless-error analysis, because you didn't grant cert on it, among other reasons. Now, if I'm right so far, and if we want to straighten all this out, why not go back and say all three cases are wrong? What you really ought to do is say, \"Court, always conduct harmless-error analysis. Conduct it whether you're in 'non-weighing,' conduct it whether you're in 'weighing.' We'll simplify.\" Now, what would be so terrible about that?",
  "Then we would not have this crossword puzzle, which probably only five people in the United States understand, and the worst thing that would happen would be, you'd always conduct harmless-error analysis, and thus, if Justice Scalia is right about it, you would lose, and if -- because it would be harmless -- and if he's wrong about it, you'd win.",
  "Yes, and I can imagine, in \"non-weighing\" State, a prosecutor banging on and on, at the eligibility stage, on factor X, and really fixing that in the mind of the jury, and it turns out that factor X is not an aggravator. Now, the jury might have been prejudiced. And I can imagine, in a \"weighing\" State that, because the evidence is the same, and because there were so many factors just like it, the fact that they used the wrong factor didn't really make any difference. So, it seems to me the lineup between harm -- real harm in a case, and weighing/non-weighing, it doesn't line up terribly well. But you have the experience. And that's why I'd like your reaction.",
  "Yes. Yes. I mean, a serious effort to go back and say, \"Look, harmless error throughout.\" I mean, I'm pushing the same thing I said before.",
  "Yes.",
  "Suppose that we have an instance where it is job related. He is not speaking as a private citizen, and it's also a public concern. Now, in such an instance, could we say that, at least if the matter of public concern rise to the level where it's related to an independent constitutional protection -- say, founded in the due-process clause -- under those circumstances, the employer cannot unreasonably -- though we give him an area of discretion, he cannot unreasonably retaliate.",
  "Why not?",
  "Why not? And here is an independent obligation.",
  "It's very unusual - -",
  "-- but it's there.",
  "You'd only lose -- the Government would lose, only where you can conclude that they could -- \"they,\" the Government -- could not -- could not reasonably conclude that he'd been insubordinate.",
  "So, we covered the case of the Democrat, Republican, et cetera. In other words, we'd give him -- should we give him total discretion? Can't we limit that discretion of the supervisor?",
  "I guess our law clerks would meet it every day.",
  "Yeah, maybe, maybe not. I don't - -",
  "-- anything that goes on in my chamber that isn't a matter of public concern, and I would think everything at OSHA and everything at -- look, I'll -- let me put my question to you, because you're going to make an argument that I don't think is too widely shared; namely, that Pickering decides this case. If that's your argument, I'd like to ask you a question based on the assumption Pickering does not decide this case. And it seems to me that Pickering involves a case in which it's both a matter of public concern and outside the scope of employment.",
  "And here we have a case that is a matter of public concern, but inside.",
  "So, in those circumstances, I want to know how you believe the first amendment requires us to decide this case. And as I read this case, in the record, we have one individual, your client, who looked at an affidavit. The affidavit said that the deputy sheriffs were trying to locate where a vehicle that was chocked up came from. They saw tire tracks. The tire tracks went back to a fence at the end of a long driveway. So, I looked in the record. I couldn't find the affidavit. So, I assume that's what it says. And I wanted to know what the deputy sheriff said. What they said is that your client agreed that there were tire tracks. There were tire tracks that did not go the whole length of the driveway, but, rather, tire tracks near the house, where they got the search warrant for. And, they added, that -- the deputies -- that there was rocks broken up. All right. So, we have two sides to this argument: the deputies, who might reasonably contend that they did nothing wrong; your client, who thinks they were lying. And we also have a letter that your client wrote, where he said that these deputies are grossly inaccurate and clearly misleading. Suppose his supervisor goes to him and says, \"I think that that letter is not the right tone. Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong; maybe they're in good faith, maybe they're not. And so, if you don't change that tone, I'm going to discipline you.\" All right? Now, that's my hypothetical, which seemed to me, perhaps, very much like this case. How, in your opinion, does the first amendment handle such a matter?",
  "Which is what I'm looking - -",
  "-- for. I'm looking for - -",
  "-- a standard.",
  "No, no there is --",
  "Look --",
  "I'm not making my question too clear. I imagine the district judge. I get just the facts I described to you. Your client, who's very upset, says, \"This is the most unreasonable thing that ever happened. They were trying to prevent me from communicating with the judge. I'm the one who saw the sheriffs. They didn't.\" The other side says, \"We think it's reasonable what we did.\" My question to you is, What standard does that judge apply under the first amendment? What does he do?",
  "We live in a world where people are leaking things all the time. And there are thousands of things that are in the public interest every day. But what's bothering me is, while I see the Government's rule as protecting the interests of the employer, it's very hard for me to believe that never is there an instance where the first amendment offers protection. But the only choice you've given me is a rule that says every dispute of the public interest is going to go right into constitutional litigation. And I don't like that either. So, am I hopelessly - -",
  "-- forced to choose which is the lesser of the evils, or is there some middle approach that gives discretion to the Government, but doesn't allow them to exceed that discretion in a certain category of cases? If so, what? And - -",
  "-- how would you phrase it?",
  "Is that your answer?",
  "All right - -",
  "-- I've got -- you've got me part of the way. Now, I'm not saying I -- I have to think this through, but you got part of the way. You say here, there's an independent constitutional basis for the speech being permitted. But, now, still within that, the Government agency has to have some authority to discipline a person, even there, because, after all, he might have been accusing these sheriffs of things that were really not justified by what they, in fact, did. Or maybe he was right. What about that part of the standard? Do you want to say that the Government wins, as long as it behaved reasonably? Do you want to say that the Government loses only if there was an abuse of ordinary employer discretion? Do you want to say the Government -- et cetera. What do you want to say?",
  "All right. Suppose - -",
  "-- we were to write this, hypothetically. Indeed, the employer has broad discretion to discipline the employee for the manner -- or whatever he does -- even in such an area, but that discretion can be abused. And, therefore, it is up to the judge to determine whether a jury could find such abuse of discretion here.",
  "Well, I mean, that might have -- you might have won if they had said, \"We're going to look to see what the law is in Arizona governing a private person who performs a similar kind of inspection. And we decide that it's the same.\" You would have won that, I guess. But you didn't, because they didn't. That isn't what they said.",
  "That is, we're not looking to the law governing private persons, we are just looking at law governing municipalities, and they're -- it seems to me they are pretty clearly wrong about that, unless you give me a reason why they're right.",
  "That's a good question. Suppose you really had a person who -- there's just no comparable private person in like circumstances. I can't even imagine what that could be. Maybe you could imagine. But I was trying to think of some secret research on turning people invisible or something for military purposes. I mean, I -- it's just hard -- I mean, hard here, obviously. There is such a person. There are private mine inspectors.",
  "Maybe there are not - -",
  "Yes, but Louie, according to the SG, says, \"We say here that this person is not liable -- the Government is not liable, because, in Washington, Washington would not make a municipality liable,\" while adding that the law of Washington is that a municipality is liable only if a private person in Washington is liable. So, I wouldn't think Louie is very good authority that the Ninth Circuit thought it was for the proposition that you look not to the private person, but you look to only the municipality.",
  "Well, I'm just - -",
  "-- reading from their brief. What they say is, the court stressed that the equivalence is important. The equivalence of what? Under Washington law, State and municipal government entities are liable only to the same extent as a private person. And they cite page 825. And they stress this equivalence, because a finding of immunity for State employees under State law does not determine the scope of the U.S. liability, etcetera.",
  "Well, anyway, if Louie helps something other than that, it's wrong, too, isn't it? Because what the statute says is, it's a question of looking to the - -",
  "-- private person.",
  "That's actually a rather interesting question I don't really know the answer to. The idea is that you can't find an analogous private person. We might have to write something about that. You could say -- you -- there always is an analogous private person. It's impossible to think of an example. The other extreme, you have the Ninth Circuit, which could -- which says as long as the Government was involved in regulation, there is no analogous private person, because private people don't regulate. I would think that was almost certainly wrong. But what is the right way to go about it? Are there such people, or aren't there?",
  "See, that's exactly what's concerning me, and I don't quite see my way to an answer. Suppose we do send it back because we think just what you said wasn't so is so, they have to now into this. They'll have to go into it. Should we suggest, \"Look, you try harder to find a private analogy, because there's almost always a private analogy.\" Every Government official has some similarities to private people, and some differences. So, we could emphasize that, or we could suggest, \"No, actually, there are quite a few differences.\" I don't have much of a feeling for which way to go on that.",
  "No, that's not -- that's not what I've been asking.",
  "And to expose everything I was -- perhaps the better thing is to say, \"There's always a private analogy,\" or try very hard, because if you really found an instance there was no private analogy to, maybe there would be no recovery, because the statute simply speaks about private party.",
  "And this is a statute designed to give people recovery - -",
  "-- when people commit torts.",
  "Yes, it does, but that -- would we end up there, because of the way the statute's written? You avoid the whole matter if you say, \"Look for the closest private person, no matter what.\" And maybe that's - -",
  "Tell me, if you're -- if you're right -- let's suppose you're right. I'm over here. That's --",
  "That's all right. So, it's hard to figure out, because the direction -- you can't tell by the sound. I don't know if there's a modern system that would help with that, but -- you're right. Suppose that the State -- suppose you're right. What I'd worry about -- and I'd like your response to this -- is that in bankruptcies, or weak firms -- a lot of firms are weak, and they owe a lot of money to the States. So, the States figure this out after a while. It takes a few years to seep through, but once they see what they can do, they say, \"Here's what we'll do. Settle your claims against the State, which happen to be pretty good, for 50 cents on the dollar. Give us the money. And you're -- we're out of it.\" So, they settle it. A month later, bankrupt. Now, two things have happened. The States got 50 cents on the dollar, every other creditor gets 5 cents on the dollar, because they were a month ahead of it. The second thing that happened is, the creditor -- the firm lost the chance to come in and be rehabilitated. So, the result of this is two bad things: bankruptcy's law's basic purpose, to treat creditors fairly, bankruptcy law's basic purpose, to give firms a chance to rehabilitate, are both seriously undermined. So, given the Bankruptcy Clause in the Constitution, how is it possible to say that Congress does not have the power to prevent those two very, very seriously harmful results -- harmful in terms of the basic purpose of the Bankruptcy Clause?",
  "But there is not a Tort Clause of the United States Constitution. There is not a Contract Clause. And there is a Bankruptcy Clause.",
  "I thought (b) and (c) -- tell if I'm right about this -- but suppose an individual bankruptcy, automobile accident and ran into a State building and wrecked it. All right? Now, I take it that, in a State that hasn't bankrupt, might not be able to bring a lawsuit for his damages caused by a claim that the wall was too high or something. Each they seem to have waived it in (a), whether the Constitution permits them to do what they did in (a).",
  "And if you win on that, you win. And if you lose on that, the whole section 106 would probably fall.",
  "I'm not sure, because if you lose on the whole thing -- suppose you were to say Congress doesn't have the power to do anything there. I just wonder if (b) and (c) would survive, because they may have had something else in mind. But maybe that's too complicated to go into now.",
  "No, no, no, he's -- so, I'm wrong. What I said is wrong. The answer has to be that -- we're only talking about (a) at the moment. And what Congress tried to do in (a) is abrogate sovereign immunity insofar as it is constitutional to do so. So, then, you say, if you lose on it, it's unconstitutional for it to do so here, but it could -- it is constitutional for it to do so insofar as there is this situation that the State brings a case against the estate, and you can do an offset, et cetera. But it would have nothing to do with (b) and (c). It would have to do with reading that into (a), I guess.",
  "All right.",
  "A light bulb went out.",
  "Which would not? I'm sorry.",
  "And you have some of those.",
  "Are you trying to get those in this case?",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "So, you go back to the language -­ are you finished with that answer? Go ahead and finish, if you want.",
  "All right.",
  "In respect to the language, how do you read it? I think it's ambiguous. \"To discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities.\" Do you read it -- \"different purchaser\" -- \"to discriminate in price in respect to that commodity that is purchased\"?

  "You're giving -­",
  "-- me a policy argument. I don't want a policy argument, for the moment. I want to know -- what you're saying is that the word \"purchaser\" means \"purchaser in respect to the particular commodity -- this one that is purchased, there has to be a discrimination in price.\"",
  "And what you're hearing, I think, is, well, this person, the dealer, bought other items in respect to which there was no discrimination in price. So, he is a purchaser of that commodity. You see, \"commodity\" could refer to the kind of thing -- Volvo trucks -- or it could refer to the particular thing -- this truck. And I want to know how you read the literal language.",

  "-- was conceded in this case, that there's the effect on the competition. There are two separate things. There is the truck that was purchased by the disfavored dealer. In respect to that, he wasn't hurt, in the sense of the statute, because, even though he got a lower profit margin, that doesn't count. I'm not focusing on that. I am focusing upon the truck that he did not purchase. The reason that the disfavored dealer did not purchase that truck is that he had a rival -- maybe there's only one case of it, but there's at least one -- he had a rival, the favored dealer, who got the purchase. He got the order from the customer, and then ordered the truck. Now, in that one, I take it, the problem is that there was no purchase by the disfavored dealer.",
  "All right. But what you're hearing is, \"So what? He was a dealer whose line of business was to purchase Volvo trucks, and, therefore, he is a purchaser of a commodity -- namely, Volvo trucks.\"",

  "So, I want the textual answer.",

Those judges, though, were -- must have been reading some language. And how did they interpret that language? That's all I'm asking you. A very literal question. It has nothing to do with policy or anything. And all I want you to do is take the statute and read the language so that it is possible for you to win this case.",
  "Okay.",
  "Why not?",
  "Why not? The -- Hiland -- is that the one?",
  "Hiland Dairy?",
  "In other words, a -- I mean, you could go in -- I see that. But what -- is there any authority for that, that just one -- a head-to-head competition, he bought the truck. Let's -- keep that out of it, so imagine they bought the truck, they resold it, and the market structure is such there probably is quite a lot of competition, in fact, with other dealers, and they lost at least one sale. That's not enough to prove an injury to competition?",
  "What's the authority for that?",
  "That's a different matter. That's a -- what -- I'm saying, What authority is there -- have there been cases in which that was not viewed? After all, let's suppose the dealers are located geographically in about the same place, and it's logical to think they'd go for the same customers. They overlap. Their territories are close. Logical to think people shop around for trucks. And we have in the record one item where they -- one instance in which they found the customer, and he said, \"Yeah, I did -- I did go and shop in both. I lost\" -- the disfavored dealer lost the sale.",
  "Any authority?",
  "Well, they say, \"This is our evidence that it is likely.\" Just what I said.",
  "This is the Robinson -­",
  "If it's not, the -- the reason -- I thought, for about 60 years, the words \"different purchasers of commodities,\" it forbids any person to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities. Now, you have to refer -- as soon as I ask the question, or start getting into the language, I forget the statute, and it's so complicated that I'm giving you time to think about it -­",
  "-- and to think of those words in your mind.",
  "It's a -- it's forbidden to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities.",
  "Now, I had always thought -- and I think the Courts' decisions bear that out, or the absence of decisions -- that the words \"discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities\" meant you can't discriminate in price between different purchasers of the item, or items, in respect to which the discrimination of price exists. That's what I thought it meant. And it seems to me that was the general understanding in the antitrust bar, that was the general understanding of the courts. And either it's not permissible to give such an interpretation -- I don't know why it wouldn't be; it's literal -- or there's a good policy reason for not doing it in respect to the policy. And in respect to the policy, what worries me about the broader interpretation is suddenly doing what Volvo -­ forbidding Volvo from doing what it probably wants to do here. If it wants to get rid of its dealers, it's because it wants to compete better with other brands. And that means lower prices for consumers, though individual dealers might be hurt. So, if I'm trying to read that law consistent with 60 years of history, and the basic purposes of the antitrust law, I guess I would -- might favor your opponents in this. I'm exposing my entire line of thought. I'm trying to protect interbrand competition, why -- while, at the same time, not being -- not being unfair to the purposes of Robinson-Patman; and, therefore, I'm reading this fairly literally, as it's been read. So, what's your response?",
  "No, I said -- I said they -- in -­ the problem for you is that, in respect to discrimination between the item, or items, the -- in respect to -- the purchase of the item, or items, in respect to which the discrimination existed. Insofar as there were items, or items, purchased, there is no discrimination. At least there is no discrimination that -- in terms of the injury of the statute, creates that kind of injury. In respect to instances where you have a strong case of the right kind of injury, there was no purchase, defined as I just defined it.",
  "No, let me deal -­",

  "If you want to go look at this, you know, you say, all right, here's -- we should be realistic about it. We're going to be realistic. Realistic, they -- we're only now looking at the cases where they undoubtedly bought the item, but the profit was lower. There's no purchaser problem.",
  "But they got a lower profit. And I think, there, the mine-run of cases is against you that that counts as an injury.",
  "Yes. Yes, but it's -- you know, it shows that they're going to be hurt, that they may be driven out of business.",
  "Indeed, the market in -- the dealership market, whatever -- if that's a separate market, which it might be -- becomes more concentrated, and the result of -- you know, I could make a -- tell a little story there that would be quite consistent with the purposes of the antitrust law. So we follow that approach in this case and say goodbye to Morton Salt, because Morton Salt, after all, was a case that was quite formalistic. It didn't really look to the injury to competition in a market. It had a formalistic slogan that would, in fact, be a proxy for that.",
  "So, what do you think of that? We follow your -- we follow your advice, we say, \"Okay, we're going to be very realistic in the future. Forget the presumptions.

You're saying the argument against that is, maybe it really isn't a compelling interest? Well, okay. Why not? I mean, it sounds to me as if it would be. They have a Treaty.

  "I don't know if there isn't a factual question here. I mean, I thought Justice Scalia, if it were to be up to him, did take into account official commentaries to treaties. But maybe he doesn't. Anyway, I take them into account. And I -- and in respect to that, I read this as saying, specifically, that the plants -- it doesn't include the substance if it is a substance clearly distinguished from the substance constituting its active principal -- and the example they give is mimosa root, which contains DMT.",
  "And then, that's also true of the bananas and pineapples, et cetera. And there's a court holding that hoasca's out of it, in France and one in the Netherlands, all of which I think was relevant to a Treaty. All right? Now, the Government has come in with a counterargument and said it clearly does cover, I guess, even mimosa roots, where they are imported solely for the purpose of extracting DMT. Now, what's the response to that?",
  "But, as -- I understand the Treaty. What the Treaty says is, you can't import substances listed in Schedule 1. Then you look at Schedule 1, and it doesn't say hoasca.",
  "It says \"DMT.\" And then it has another -- and, interpreting that, it says the fact, if you look at that list and it says \"DMT,\" means what it says: You can't import DMT. It's a drug importation statute, and it doesn't cover plants that contain the substance DMT. Otherwise, we'd have -- throw out bananas and -- or mimosa, anyway. And we're not looking to intent on that. Now, that's a possible interpretation that doesn't contradict anything. And -­",
  "You're in trouble. That's harder, then, if it's -­",
  "Yes, but -­",
  "-- I don't see -- I mean, I see I was not right. You do import drums of tea. And they say, in the Treaty, that a preparation is a solution or mixture containing a substance. And it would seem to be a solution or a mixture containing DMT. And the commentary that I thought helped you does concern plants, but you're not importing plants. So, now I'm rather troubled to see if there is any way that this Treaty is interpreted in a manner that allows you to win. What is it?",
  "Well, that's actually why I've been looking. I'm bothered by it, because it -- if the Treaty is absolute, we reserve for peyote, which would mean the religious use of peyote by the Native American tribes is exempt, but other people who have identical religions, use identical substances, they're stuck. And that, it seems to me, is a rather rough problem under the First Amendment.",
  "One religion singled out. And, therefore, I'm looking for some way in this Treaty not to reach that conclusion -­",
  "-- for the constitutional reason.",
  "All right, now suppose -- I don't understand all these legal terms here. Imagine.",
  "It may be close to the truth. Now, we have a case, a hypothetical. The defendant is sitting there, the police say, \"Question?\" And he says, \"I want to see my lawyer.\" And the policeman says the following, \"That's fine, go ahead, we'll get him. By the way, if you see him, we'll execute you. Are you sure you don't want to talk to us?\" That's plainly unlawful, isn't it?",
  "Fine.",
  "Now -­",
  "Now -­",
  "Now, the same thing happens, but what he says is, \"You'd better talk to us, or you'll be executed. Think about it.\" Equally unlawful, right?",
  "Okay.",
  "Now, a minute -­",
  "-- passes while he's thinking about it. Okay? Is it -- is it unlawful now, because a minute has passed before he says yes?",
  "I just -­",
  "I don't -- I don't want legalism. I just want the conclusion. A minute has passed before he says yes. Has that changed everything, and it becomes lawful?",
  "No. Now it's 15 minutes. Now it's 30 minutes. Okay? Now, a court says 30 minutes is the same as one minute, \"We don't think the passage of 29 extra minutes made a difference.\" And what's your reply? Not in legalism. You're going to say, \"Oh, no, the passage of 30 minutes, rather than 1 minute, makes all the difference.\" And I would like to know why.",
  "Yes, that's fine. I'm not -- I'm ­ - I want you to say that kind of thing. You're saying it's not just 30 minutes, it's \"also some other things happened.\" What?",
  "So, that's -­",
  "-- possible. That definitely cuts in your favor, unless, of course, it sounds like a good- cop/bad-cop routine. And -­",
  "-- people -­",
  "But that's -­",
  "-- subjectively true. And so, I'd simply wonder if the fact that it's subjectively true, and there is a finding that the defendant -- here, we have 30 minutes, and we have the fact that the other detective said, \"He said he can't talk to us. We can't do anything about it.\" We have that. Is there anything else?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "All right. Right. So -­",
  "-- we have a passage -­",
  "If you're going to the standard, which is, I think, the -- actually, the difficult question here, what's wrong -- should you say -- what's wrong with saying -- which is what I was pursuing -- that, where there is a question that's improper, as there was here, by the police, the only real question is, Is a later initiation \"the fruit\"?",
  "And you say the State has to show it wasn't the fruit. That would have the virtue of making the law quite consistent here, as it is with Fourth Amendment/Fifth Amendment cases. That's a well known concept.",
  "Why not?",
  "Why -- I understand that -­",
  "-- there's a lot of language -­",
  "Well -­",
  "-- what about just simple thing like this, that there is an implication in what Reese said, that he listens to in his cell, \"I guess you'd -- he'll want to talk to us now, huh?\" The implication is that he faces death, and he'll be better off by talking to them without a lawyer.",
  "So, suppose Johns had said to the defendant, \"Mr. Blake, I want to tell you something. My colleague here has implied that you will be better off, because of the death possibility, in talking to us without a lawyer. We want to tell you, that isn't true. There is no way that you'll be better off talking to us without a lawyer. You will be at least equally, from your point of view, as well off if you talk to a lawyer.\" Now, that might have cured it, I guess.",
  "Yes, but if you're looking -- if you're taking your standard seriously -­",
  "The reason that my -- I was able to give my hypothetical before -­",
  "-- the reason that you'd have to say, \"You will not be better off -- you will not be worse off in respect to the death penalty, by -- you know, we -- it won't\" -­",
  "-- \"make you any better off to talk to the lawyer\" -­ Sorry. Strike. The reason that the policeman, to cure, would have to say, \"Look, it's not going to help you, in respect to the death penalty, to talk without your lawyer,\" is because that was the implication of his question, that was the implication ­ -",
  "-- of the wrongful statement.",
  "The implication was, \"You're not going to get death if you talk to us without a lawyer.\"",
  "But if it had been some other questions, some questions, for example, about the crime, all you would have had to do was eliminate whatever negative implication came out of those questions, which might have been nothing.",
  "So timely -­",
  "Yes.",
  "All right, so -­",
  "-- maybe you should modify the standard. Maybe the standard ought to be that where you have an improper line of questioning, after the warning, that the police either have to negative the implication of those questions, the relevant implication, or the State has to show that some other series of independent events, such as Justice Kennedy mentioned, made the difference. That is, caused the later request to talk without a lawyer. And if they can't show the one or the other, then they lose.",
  "Is it fact, or is it not fact, law, in respect to the following? He's sitting there. And there is a question of what motivated him. Did it motivate him totally that his -- this thing about his codefendant, or was he moved, in significant part -- moved, motivated -- by the earlier, 30­ minute earlier, improper questioning? That sounds like a fact. Or do you think it's not a fact?",
  "So far, you're halfway into your argument. I thought the basic question here was, first, whether a Court of Appeals, or anybody, can grant a J- -- what used to be called a JNOV without your making its -- whatever it's called now -- and without somebody making it a motion. And from your not opposing that, I guess the answer to the question is, of course not. Of course you have to make a motion. You have to make a motion for everything. The judge is not a genius. He can't -- is not a mindreader. And if you don't make a motion, you lose. Okay? Now, is there any argument against that?",
  "No, I -- I mean, I thought -- there are two parts to this. Question one is, Can you possibly get a judgment -- what used to be called a JNOV or a JMOL or whatever -- from the Court of Appeals, when you didn't make a motion for it, after the jury came in, in the District Court?",
  "They say, \"Of course you have to make a motion.\" And, so far, I've heard no response whatsoever to what I'd think is a fairly basic question in this case. And I'm assuming: of course you have to make a motion.",
  "But even if there were, how could this kind of error ever be plain?",
  "Ever?",
  "If there's no evidence at all. You have a patent, and a patent is a monopoly. And so, what -- obviously, it monopolizes a market, it monopolizes the market of the patent. And you'd have to be a genius in antitrust law to know something's wrong with that argument. And so, how could it all be plain?",
  "That has nothing to do with my question.",
  "You were saying that the mistake was that there was not sufficient evidence that there was injury of an antitrust kind, and that there was a market. So, I'm saying a person who knows a little, but not a lot, of antitrust law would think, \"Obviously, there's a market here. There's the market covered by the patent.\"",
  "Obviously, there's injury, because a patent allows you to raise the price. End of the matter. Now, that's naive, but somebody who doesn't know antitrust law thoroughly couldn't possibly think that there is plain error here. What's the response to that?",
  "What I'm worried about, to put all my cards on the table -- if we were to say there is even a possibility of plain error in this case, the plain- error exception in the rules would become a monster, wherein complex cases, people who hadn't made the proper motions would all be arguing plain error just as if they had.",
  "It didn't contain the bar at the time that they said, \"You can collect it.\" In the later statute, which said, \"You now can collect out of Social Security,\" when they passed that, did it contain a 10-year bar?",
  "I thought the Higher Education Act said -- as of what year did the Higher Education Act say, \"No statute of limitations applies to us\"?",
  "Fine. In --",
  "-- 1991, it said, \"No statute of limitations applies to us.\" Then, in what year did the statute -- was passed which said, \"And you can collect money out of Social Security payments for higher education\"?",
  "All right. Why isn't that the end of it? So --",
  "-- so there was no -- there was no statute of limitations applying to the Social Security Act; and then, in 1996, they say, \"And now go get them.\"",
  "What can we do about that?",
  "What did they say?",
  "It has a 10-year bar. But the earlier 1991 Act says, \"That doesn't apply to us.\"",
  "So, in other words, you're saying that that provision of the later statute that says, \"Go get them on Social Security,\" implicitly reads into it the 10-year bar that's in a different part of the statute.",
  "So, it's as if it said, \"Go get them on Social Security, under 407, which is gone now, but only for 10 years.\"",
  "Is that what your -- I'm trying to understand this.",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay.",
  "The only problem is, it doesn't say that.",
  "All right, but that's --",
  "You can call it any purpose you want, but there is an earlier word in 9- -- 1091(a), just what Justice Kennedy said. The earlier word says limitations don't apply to the higher-education debt. And so, if this later statute, the words you're talking about, the words of \"10 years,\" the words that limit when you can do it, if those words, which are in subsection (e), are a \"limitation,\" then I guess the earlier statute says they don't apply to the higher-education debt. And so, I don't see how you get out of that. I mean -- I mean, this is a rather harsh result. I understand why you'd like to get out of it. But I don't understand how we do get out of it.",
  "No, it -- I mean, you -- it's -- it probably comes up a lot. You have -- you have the earlier act that imposes -- suppose you have some -- Endangered Species Act and -- at an earlier time -- and it says all provisions of a certain kind will have this effect in respect to endangered species. And then you have some laters act -- later acts. And, in those later acts, there are certain things about how to treat certain animals and so forth. And the question would be, \"Well, does that earlier thing, telling you how to treat an endangered species, apply now to the animals in this later act insofar as they're endangered?\" And the answer would be, \"Of course it does\" --",
  "-- unless there's some special reason --",
  "-- for thinking that it doesn't. And so, what's the special reason --",
  "-- here? You have an earlier act that says, when you see those words, \"10-year limitations,\" forget them where student loans in effect. Now we have a later act, and it has the word \"10-year limitations,\" and you're giving some reasons why --",
  "-- it is special and --",
  "-- so forth. And --",
  "-- I don't know --",
  "-- if they're --",
  "-- strong enough --",
  "Uh-huh. Yes, that is the nub.",
  "But, I mean, they don't have that big burden to show. They have to just --",
  "-- show it's normal.",
  "And you have to show it's special.",
  "So, is the statute -- I saw something here, that a person who's going to get this offset, and he has Social Security, you exempt $9,000 of the Social Security, and then you limit it to 15 percent of the remainder or whatever is reasonable, whichever is less.",
  "But -- yeah, I think he's -- one argument that they're emphasizing, anyway, is that -- you look at the Debt Collection Act, and suppose it had said the following, \"Section 207 is amended, or changed, as follows. We refer specially now -- we can collect, through offset, but only for 10 years. I mean, only to claims that are more than 10 years old. So, we are changing what 207 says for debts over 10 year -- under 10 years old, and we can offset those.\" Now, suppose it had said that.",
  "And you'd say it's the same.",
  "All right. If that's the same, let's imagine this statute. The statute says, \"We bestow upon the Social Security agency a very limited power.\" And it says, \"This is the limited power. The Social Security Agency may, despite 207, levy offsets on under­ 10-year-old debts.\" That's what they say, right in the Act.",
  "And then, indeed, the whole point of it -- it's entitled \"Limited Offset Ability,\" parenthesis -- \"Limited Offset Ability (Extending Only to Debts of Less than Ten Years),\" end parenthesis. That's the title of the Act, and then it says just what I say, repeating that.",
  "But you're not going to treat that --",
  "-- one the same. You see, what they're saying here is -- they want to say that what I've just said is what Congress wrote in this Act. And --",
  "-- I'm making it harder and harder for you to accept that saying --",
  "-- automatically.",
  "So, if, in fact, they -- the Post Office negligently delays the knowledge that would come to me in the letter, that I have 15 days to claim my billion-dollar inheritance --",
  "-- I guess I couldn't sue.",
  "All right. Well, suppose what they do is -- this is -- it seems to me this case is like a first-year law school hypothetical. But, I mean, the -- suppose that the -- what they do is, he puts the mail on the porch, my package, and he rips it open, negligently; and there for everyone to see is the toupee that I ordered.",
  "And I sue -- I sue for public humiliation. See? I mean, what about that one?",
  "I mean, what I -- to sort of my cards on the -- I was thinking, \"Well, that comes close,\" but maybe it -- maybe it is within the -- within the -- within the exception. I'm not sure. And then --",
  "-- I think --",
  "-- on the other --",
  "On the other -- no, they -- see, it -- he put it on the porch, which is transmitting it, in such a way that it fell open. But I'm just trying to think -- and then the -- on the other side of it, you have the automobile accident. And I guess he comes along the street, the postman, swinging my package around, and bops someone on the head with it. I guess that's covered. And then, this case is somewhere in the middle.",
  "But what's the principle according to which we're drawing it?",
  "But the --",
  "Well, ordinary tort doesn't quite work, because I guess my public humiliation case is -- could be an ordinary tort. Somebody could go up to the porch and rip it open, nothing to do with the mail. And, moreover, somebody could, in fact, delay the transmission of my inheritance. See? They could. So, all those things could be ordinary torts.",
  "Doesn't it have a -- in good condition. Therefore, when they put it -- therefore, I guess, ripping it open is, in fact, not in good condition, so maybe that is immune. And leaving it on the porch in a position where somebody would trip over it, you might say they didn't deliver it in good condition, because what they're supposed to do is place it somewhere where you don't trip over it. And that's good condition for the delivery.",
  "So, how does it hurt you, say, in the live alligator, et cetera, case? If the Court says -- well, anything that's special in respect to transmission of live alligators, because it's the mail, et cetera, delayed -- or I -- I don't know how else you'd get a tort out of it. But if it's simply the kind of thing that anyone could do, like driving a postal truck or leaving something on a porch that somebody trips over or walking along the street swinging the live alligator over your head, or whatever you do –-",
  "-- that kind of thing that doing it -- that kind of thing doesn't mean to fall within the \"transmission.\" Now, suppose that that was the holding. How would the Government be hurt?",
  "What we'd look to is, you'd look to the purpose of this. The purpose of it was, basically, I gather from the history, as recounted in Kosak -- in what the Court said in Kosak -- the purpose of this is to try to bring back into sovereign immunity, so you're not sued all the time, the very kind of common suit that a person could protect himself for the loss by registering the package, by taking out this ordinary transmission insurance, which is not that hard to do. So, they said, if we start opening it up to misdelivery claims, all that pack -- family of things, everybody'll say, \"Hey, you hurt my pet, you didn't give me the check.\" I mean, all kinds of things will be opened up. But the Government's already liable for what I'd call the \"swinging the package around,\" leaving it -- slip-and-fall, trucks. So that falls on the other side. Now, how does that hurt you, the Government, if that's how we'd come out?",
  "Well, you can't get too far --",
  "-- with the text. I think you have a great claim, and so does the other side; but if it's just the text, that's not my question.",
  "The question is, If I think the text is perfectly ambiguous on this, I look to the purpose, suppose I came out the way I just said. How would the Government be hurt? is what I want to know.",
  "So, if --",
  "-- in fact, you have a driver of the truck, the postal truck, and what he does is, he puts the mail in the truck, so my skis, which I have shipped by mail, happen to stick out the side, and, as he walk -- drives along, he just mows down the pedestrians.",
  "I take it, on your theory, that that -- there is no lawsuit.",
  "But are -- you got the -- well, that's exactly the point I'd like you to hone in on, because I don't see what's -- you say, \"Well, we're defenseless.\" Why are you more defenseless than any other business that leaves things on porches? That might be, you know, 482 million apple deliverers or Domino Pizza people. I don't know. Or they -- they ring the bell, probably, but some -- McDonald's hamburgers, lots of -- department stores. I mean, a lot of people leave things on porches. So, why are you more defenseless than they?",
  "All right. Well, that's --",
  "-- that's what people are likely to trip over. I mean, they're not likely to trip over a letter.",
  "What about -- but I'm surprised that there's no empirical examples of what -- well, I would think it would have happened, in 50 years and tens of millions of packages, that a package falls off a truck. You know, the next driver veers somewhere and gets into an accident, and they say it was the -- it wasn't packed properly. I think should have happened sometime in the Post Service over -- Postal Service over 50 year. My guess is, it did happen and you just paid.",
  "Really?",
  "Is there any --",
  "Do we actually know, either of us? I don't, I confess. Do you -- do you --",
  "All right. Well, I -- the words that keep going around in my mind -- it's her house, too, isn't it?",
  "Well, she wants the policeman in. So, why does he have more of a right to keep the policeman out than she has to have the policeman in?",
  "Right.",
  "Everybody makes some sacrifices.",
  "All right --",
  "-- let's think --",
  "-- of the need for this, because it's the other thing that's on my mind. The two words that came into my mind are \"spousal abuse.\" All right? I would say maybe there's a pretty good need for this. The husband's beating her up. And there isn't evidence of that, but she's sitting in the kitchen table, and the neighbors hear something odd, and they call the police. \"We'd better look into it.\" They come to the door. She says, \"Um, hmmm, oh, I'd like, Officer, for you to just come upstairs to my bedroom for a minute.\" Is there any neighbor, friend, or policeman, in those circumstances, who wouldn't go?",
  "Oh, no. It's the question of the rule. I haven't seen anything on your side that would advocate a rule that would not prevent the many, many, many, I believe -- I am not an expert -- ambiguous cases of domestic spousal abuse from being investigated by the policeman. And maybe you can tell me you've looked into it empirically and I'm wrong, and that's why I'm bringing it up.",
  "No, no, but -- no, I'm not getting your answer. Are you telling me that it is the law in Chicago, for example, that if a policeman responds to a call, a call of -- it's ambiguous -- what it says is, \"An anonymous caller said there's an odd situation next door. Will you check out 2355 Maple Street?\" He goes there. The wife looks a little oddly at him, but they're sitting at the table, and she says, \"Officer, I'd like you to come upstairs with me.\" The husband says no. Are you saying that the law is clear in Chicago that the policeman can't do it?",
  "All right. Where --",
  "-- is it clear that the policeman cannot do it?",
  "Fine.",
  "That's what --",
  "-- I thought it was not clear. And, therefore, what I'm asking you for is -- if your rule --",
  "-- is the law --",
  "-- there are 200,000 cases a year in Chicago, alone. I think that there might be many ambiguous cases. So, you relieve me of my concern that if you win this case, in those ambiguous situations, where the wife wants the policeman in, and she's afraid to tell him why, until she gets him up to the room -- she wants him in -- and he, now under your rule, as far as I can see, could not go in. And I'm telling you, quite frankly, that's what bothers me a lot.",
  "There aren't exigent circumstances. In the case I'm thinking of, I'm thinking of what I call \"ambiguity,\" and there are many such cases, I believe, of spousal abuse, where the wife is intimidated. Now, maybe I'm wrong on my facts, but those are the cases I'm worried about.",
  "An expectation of privacy. I have a lingering question here I'd like to get your view on. I don't know what the expectation is, is my problem. If I think of social -- I've never been in a situation, frankly, where one person said, \"Stay out,\" and the other said, \"Come in.\" So, I don't know what I'd do. If I imagine myself in a normal social situation, I think probably, if I am the typical person, which may or may not be, I --",
  "-- I think I'd say, \"Well, you know, I don't want to have anything to do with this.\" If it's a dinner party, forget it. But if I'm in a situation such as the police might be involved in, where I think there is some danger, there is something wrong in the house, there's something odd about it, I don't think the average person would just say, \"I'm going away.\" I think the average person either would come in, or he'd say, \"I'll come in for a while. I'm going to call the police,\" or they're -- you just wouldn't have that reaction, \"I want nothing to do with it.\" That's the reaction, you know -- that's a bad reaction, when you want nothing to do with a dangerous situation. So, I think, in that situation, the normal reaction would be, \"I'm going in,\" or, \"I'm going to get some help,\" or, \"I'm going to get a friend,\" or, \"I'm going to call the police.\" So, I don't know you do have expectations of that kind, in those situations, though you might with a dinner party.",
  "But I want you to address the question of how the legal category of \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" fits in with what I just said, where I'm assuming, in some social situations, you do think you'd be left alone; but, in the typical situation, stretching well beyond, but certainly including, situations of danger where the police might be involved, you wouldn't have an expectation that you will be left alone. I want to know how those facts, if they are facts -- and you can say they were not -- fit within the category called \"reasonable expectation of privacy.\"",
  "Was there anybody in that case who -- since I wrote it, I guess I'm supposed to know it in detail, but I don't --",
  "-- and I thought, was -- there was no one -- no consent there. There was nobody giving consent, was there?",
  "Was there?",
  "I'll go back and read it.",
  "I'll reread it.",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "I want to know what it is you're arguing for. That is, I -- when I get through all these words in the attorneys-fees cases, I've got it in my mind that, like the civil rights statute, they say, \"You normally get fees, unless you shouldn't.\" All right? That means you're normally gonna to get them.",
  "The plaintiff, anyway. All right? Then we have a case with a copyright. The copyright says it's all the way up to the district court, really, which means a grab-bag, and what the particular judge thinks is fair in the instance. And I guess you could have a rule saying, \"You hardly ever get fees.\" So, in my mind, I got it, \"Well, who knows?\" and, \"No, you almost always do,\" or, \"No, you almost always don't.\" Now, is that a good characterization? And what -- which one of those three are you arguing for?",
  "I know you're not arguing for \"You always don't.\"",
  "All right. Then, which one do you want? Do you want the thing --",
  "Yes.",
  "All right. Now, if you want \"you always get them,\" in the civil liberties cases there is a good policy reason, according to the court, underlying that judgment of how Congress wanted to give this to people to vindicate civil liberties. I've never heard of a policy of closing the Federal court door, because if, in fact, you were to have that rule in this case, it would simply discourage people from removing it in cases where they think they have a good claim to remove it, because they'd have to pay huge costs if they were wrong. So, I'm not aware of any closing doors of Federal court policy.",
  "Now I --",
  "-- unfortunately, I guess, from your position, I don't know what Congress meant here.",
  "Therefore, I'm trying to figure it out in terms of the policy --",
  "-- as well as the language. Okay, in terms of the policy, I'm simply saying that I don't know why you have a better claim than a copyright plaintiff, and I can think of why you don't have as good a claim as a civil rights plaintiff, the reason I said. So, what is your response to that?",
  "It's hard to have three different kinds of standards with attorneys-fees statutes. I mean, there are quite a few of them, and -- I can understand saying some of those statutes mean you almost always should get it, because of special policies reflected in the history of the statute, et cetera. That's Christianson. And I can imagine Fogerty, where you say, \"As to an ordinary one, it's ordinary.\" \"Ordinary\" means it's up to the discretion of the district judge. And there may be many reasons. Do we want a third one, where --",
  "-- let's say they pass this -- and it's \"unusual\"? I mean, we're going to get several categorizations and shadings of statutes. I don't have an answer. I'm not suggesting a point of view on this. I'm curious what you think.",
  "Is this relevant to the -- I just saw these as -- I -- just by chance, it ­ - one of the cases in the SG's brief involved Georgia juvenile facilities, where mentally ill patients were restrained, hit, shackled, put in restraint chairs for hours, sprayed with pepper spray.",
  "And that seemed to be one instance coming out of Georgia.",

  "Well, was there any problem of that in Tennessee versus Lane? I thought the courthouse officials there said, \"There'll be a trial. No problem there, just whether you have to walk up the steps or don't, and we'll give you a trial down below.\" Was there -- it's the right of access to courthouse, specially?",
  "In your point of view, would it help if the Court said -- I guess it would, but I -- in order to get rid of this problem, if the Court said, \"Look, it says 'reasonable.' Of course prison has special problems,\" and, referring, say, to Turner versus Safley, said that, \"These things about television remote controls are not really, normally, a matter of unreasonableness.\" So, in other words, we hit -- we -- you'd give considerable discretion to the -- to the warden, and the Act would have bite in cases where there is really a serious problem, like this one. It's alleged to be a really serious problem.",
  "I thought it said \"reasonableness.\"",
  "Well, that's --",
  "This is true. This is exactly the point I had asked about before. This is a better point. Because I thought that bridge was -- that -- was crossed in Lane. That is, I don't see how you can say that Lane was not giving -- saying it's constitutional to have prophylactic rules. And that's why I raised the reporter. I've never heard of a First Amendment right of a paper to send a particular reporter. I mean, if there's a disabled reporter who couldn't get into the courtroom, I guess they could send a different reporter. Maybe that's a First Amendment right, but I have not heard of it. So, I thought that, really, Lane is saying, \"You can sweep, within the prophylactic rules, a lot of things that are not, in fact, constitutional violations, but simply discrimination against disabled people.\"",
  "I think there is a First Amendment right for a newspaper, for example, to send a particular reporter to the courtroom. That's an interesting question. I never thought of that one. I --",
  "-- you don't think Lane stands for the proposition of their prophylactic rules being perfectly legitimate under the Eleventh Amendment, where you have a set of constitutional violations?",
  "No, I was asking --",
  "I'm --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, why isn't all that true of Lane? Everything you've said is also true of the prophylactic part of Lane. I mean, I've never heard that people took seriously -- though maybe they should have -- but, before the ADA, I have never heard there was a constitutional right of a disabled person to go to a courthouse on the second floor. There were second-floor courthouses all over the country. I don't know that was true of the bathrooms. I don't know it was true of a lot of things in courthouses. So, I think your argument could be made in schools, courthouses, all over the place. And I take it that Lane said, \"Prophylaxis\" -- whatever the word is -- \"of that sort\" --",
  "-- \"is fine under Title II, given a core of constitutional violations.\" So, how do you distinguish them that?",
  "You mean --",
  "-- beyond a --",
  "-- the average public, you had a constitutional right? I mean, you might have. I might be surprised. But, interesting.",
  "The average person could have brought a lawsuit, a person in a wheelchair, and said, \"All the courthouses in this country, or in this county, are on the second floor, and moreover the bathrooms -- I need a special bathroom,\" and they would have won without the ADA. Why did we need the ADA, then?",
  "Ah. Ah, you're saying -- I -- what I just heard was, it's -- the reporter just was a stand-in for the average person, that the average person had these constitutional rights, which may have been a --",
  "I don't know how this came about. I mean -- I mean, I'm asking both sides the same question. It'll sound very favorable to you, but if you answer it just yes, because it's favorable to you, I might learn, later, I was wrong, and you won't have had a chance to answer. So, I want your honest opinion on this. I don't know how this happened. And I don't know -- did you ask for en banc?",
  "No. I don't know how the California Court could have read the opinion -- which, of course, I wrote for the Court, so maybe I am reading things into it that weren't there -- but I don't know how any judge could read that opinion we wrote and come to this conclusion. I thought that it said, you know, on -- that there are three issues -- what's the word \"pending\"? Does the word \"pending\" apply to the time period between when the lower court decides a case and you appeal? That's typically 20 days or 30 days.",
  "Are those 20 days or 30 days counted in the tolling period? I thought part one clearly said the answer is yes. Then we looked at California, and they don't have the words \"20 days\" or \"30 days.\" They say \"reasonable time.\" And then we said, \"Still applies, because 'reasonable time' is probably 20 or 30 days.\" They don't have a radically different rule; it's a similar rule. Then we come to part three, and it says, \"This is 45 days.\" There's -- no 4 and a half months, wasn't it?",
  "This isn't just 20 or 30 days.",
  "So, is it timely?",
  "And, there, I thought the Court said -- I mean, I was reading it -- say, \"Well, it's hard to say, because there might have been excuses for the delay.\" What about the words that were written there, \"on the merits\"?",
  "On --",
  "But that had nothing to --",
  "-- do with the case. The lack of diligence had nothing to do with this aspect of the case. But, what about the words \"on the merits\"? And there, what I think the court wrote is that the fact that it says \"on the merits\" doesn't prove it -- what -- it doesn't prove that it was timely. Why? And then I listed a bunch of reasons. There are reasons. Sometimes courts say \"on the merits,\" even though it's delayed. All right? They say \"on the merits.\" Or because they want to tell the prisoner or -- there are a lot of reasons why, all of which are listed. So, we send it back to see whether this 4-and-a-half-month delay, given the excuses, was still timely. We -- all right?",
  "Now --",
  "-- we now get a case where it's 3 years.",
  "And the court says, \"It's timely, because they used the word 'on the merits.'\" But I thought -- I said, in the opinion, I thought the court adopted that the words \"on the merits\" do not decide the matter.",
  "Now, what do you --",
  "-- do in those circumstances?",
  "No, but did --",
  "-- you ask for rehearing en banc? Because any judge, including me, can make a mistake. What did you do?",
  "And you didn't ask for a hearing en banc.",
  "Well, why, when you --",
  "-- get a fair -- because any judge can make a mistake --",
  "-- why don't you just go and ask the Ninth Circuit to say, \"Look, this is not -- read the opinion, read what they said. Correct it.\"",
  "It's worse.",
  "You're representing the attorney general of California, and you have a lot of litigation in the Ninth Circuit. It's -- I mean, the other side's going to answer on the merits, if they can. And they're in an awkward position here, I understand. But I need to know what to -- what do you think we should do? I mean, here, we write an opinion, and they --",
  "-- it seems to perhaps, inadvertently or not -- and the reason I turn to you is, judges are busy, they have huge dockets --",
  "And, often, unless it's very clearly pointed out by the lawyers, or the lawyers take action, you get -- waste everybody's time and money.",
  "So, in other words, he delays, after he gets the library access, for an extra year.",
  "Now, is there any excuse they're making for that? Because if you don't tell me, they're --",
  "-- going to tell me.",
  "Yes.",
  "It would? I thought --",
  "-- that was --",
  "-- an open --",
  "-- question, frankly. I mean, I can't imagine California would do this, but I guess if California did say that, \"The period of time between the time you lost in the District Court and the time you filed, in every other State, is 30 days, but, in California, it's a reasonable time. And what we mean by a 'reasonable time' is 3 years, without any excuses\" -- I guess, then, maybe the dissent in Carey v. Saffold would have been right in respect to that.",
  "It would have said that that isn't pending under Federal law, whether California says it or not. So, the role of the Federal law versus the State law, I thought we left open.",
  "But you can't --",
  "-- defer to something --",
  "-- under this statute, where Congress wrote the word \"pending.\" And I wouldn't have thought they did have in mind a --",
  "-- State that says, \"It's pending, even though you have no excuse and didn't file anything for 3 years, your appeal.\" Now, I haven't heard that fully briefed and so forth, so I hesitate to express a final conclusion on it. But it --",
  "-- since it's never going to come up, I don't think, I don't know I have to have a final conclusion.",
  "All right --",
  "-- that's a --",
  "-- that's --",
  "How many cases are there on habeas in California every year, about?",
  "No, I mean about. Just give me the rough ballpark.",
  "All right. So, the -- in the Supreme Court.",
  "So, there are 25- -- so there are several thousand cases every year.",
  "All right. Thousands.",
  "Okay. So, I don't know what I'm doing with California procedure when I pass a -- pass a law, is what it would be. Write a rule, write a presumption. I have no idea what I'm doing there. They've worked out a system. But I don't -- why doesn't it work just to say to the lower courts, \"Do your job\"? What we said -- and maybe it wasn't expressed clearly -- maybe -- \"Courts, look, it says 'reasonable time.' All right? Now, reasonable time, in every other State is 30 days, sometimes 20 days.\"",
  "\"Sometimes the most, 60 days. So, look and see if it was filed within a reasonable time. That's all. And if California passes -- some specific thing says something special about it, of course, pay attention to that.\" What's wrong with that? They just would do it like they do any other thing of deciding what happens in --",
  "Yes, that is the problem.",
  "But, now, maybe I'm --",
  "So, the difficulty of looking to that, which may be a good difficulty -- I mean, that is a serious problem, but I thought what we wrote in the case -- see, there are two problems here. First, which was bothering me, had to do with our Court's relation to the Ninth Circuit, which may be simple and -- as far as legally is concerned -- but I'm not sure about it. The other, which is much more interesting, is what you're talking about. All right, now, on the first one, I read the words. It says the words \"on the merits.\" The Ninth Circuit thought those three words meant that the California Supreme Court could not have considered the petition too late, for, after all, it decided it on the merits, just as with the cite. Now, whether these words are right or wrong that follow, that's what we wrote. The next words were, \"There are many plausible answers to this question.\" Sometimes, a court addresses the merits of a claim that it thought was presented in an untimely way. Why? Because they don't present any difficulty, and the timeliness issue does, or because it wants to give the reviewing court alternative grounds for decision, or maybe it just wants to show the prisoner we thought about the claim on the merits. He, after all, doesn't have a lawyer. He gets a postcard. That helps him. So, there are a lot of reasons. And it says, \"Conclusion.\" Given the variety of reasons why they might have put the words \"on the merits,\" the fact that they are there, those words cannot, by themselves, show that the petition was timely. So, then I read what they wrote. What they wrote is, \"When the California Court denies a habeas petition without comment or citation, we have long treated the denial as a decision on the merits.\" Okay? And then it cites a pre-Carey case. \"Therefore, the summary denial was on the merits, and the petition was not dismissed as untimely,\" citing two pre-Carey cases. Now, I don't see how, since I just said the words \"on the merits do not end the issue\" -- here, the words weren't even there, but they say, \"We're treating it as if they were, and that ends the issue.\" So, what do we do about that? Then the next question, once I figure that one out, is, What do we do about the issue you're raising, which is quite important and interesting and so forth?",
  "Well, we could work with that. Now, that's, sort of, helpful, because if they say \"most are timely filed,\" then the next question would be, \"All right, what period of time is it?\"",
  "You'd have to get some professor to go through these cases, and they could -- they could figure out how long it is. What do you think it is, from your experience?",
  "But, I mean, is it more like a month, or is it more like 3 years?",
  "Because?",
  "So, there's a special reason. In your case, is there really a year that isn't explained at all?",
  "Because?",
  "No, forget that. The library, I'll give you. What's the rest?",
  "But -- well, did your -- did your client file an affidavit or something saying he didn't have access to the library during the whole period of 3 years?",
  "Well --",
  "-- is there anything in the record that says, during the year after they said, \"We'll change your job so you can get access to the library,\" that he didn't have access to the library?",
  "Well, all right, so what's his reason for saying that, \"Last year, I was not able to file a petition in California Supreme Court\"?",
  "So, what does it say? What does he say? Go ahead.",
  "Now, the --",
  "-- the next thing, what he actually says here, is that the C facility where he was confined was put into lockdown clearly into February 1997. And this is all after he got access. Then it remained quiet and lockdown free until August 11th, 1997. So, that seems six months, on the most generous interpretation --",
  "-- where he's not in lockdown, and he has access to the library.",
  "About six months.",
  "So, here we have 180 days -- 180 days, twice 90 -- with no excuse at all presented.",
  "What about this? You might lose under this, but it -- see, so you say -- look, in every other State, the time for appealing from an appeals court to the State Supreme Court, asking them, is 20 days, normally, or sometimes 30. So, if the Ninth Circuit gets a case in which it was longer than 30 days, then, irrespective of whether they say \"on the merits,\" whether they cite a case, whether they don't say anything and just have a postcard, what the Ninth Circuit should assume that they've done is consider it untimely, in the absence of the kind of excuse that the California Courts might accept as an excuse. So, then they'll look into that. And if California, in the future, wants something different -- which I'd be surprised -- they will say that their system means that a 3-year delay, or whatever it is, is actually timely. But, in the absence of some reason to think that, why not use the words, which would give you a chance to go back, and you could say, \"This is not a case of total lack of excuse. There is excuse of the kind that California would accept.\"",
  "But we decided -- I'd like you to suggest something to -- from putting yourself in the -- in an imaginary position. Carey versus Saffold did have a dissent. And four Justices joined it. And let's imagine that, when I read the dissent, I see the -- and then I look at this case -- I see imaginary words on the top of the dissent, which are, \"We told you so.\"",
  "And -- now, therefore, think not of if you were arguing Carey v. Saffold afresh, but think of the words that are actually written there. And now think of what happened here. And now propose something, please, that will, in fact, deal with the problem that this case seems to present.",
  "Well, 180 days from what?",
  "Well, I mean, you file --",
  "-- the reply brief in the lower court. Maybe the judge will take 4 months to decide it. What's the relation? I don't understand that. Or maybe it'll take --",
  "-- 2 days --",
  "-- to decide.",
  "Why? What would the theory be? I don't understand that.",
  "So, a judge -- you file it. On day -- what -- you file it on April 1st, and then the judge decides it in August. Or September. And now it's only 3 days before the 6-months -- you have to file your appeal, like, in 3 days. That wouldn't make sense. And the converse would not --",
  "You can't --",
  "-- file an --",
  "-- appeal before -- oh, maybe you can in California. You're going to file the appeal before the lower court decides it?",
  "Even -- or even before they get a lower court decision.",
  "They don't, at all.",
  "In other --",
  "-- they don't, at all.",
  "Oh.",
  "How often --",
  "Do you, as the Attorney General, what period of time after the District Courts made a decision, and now -- they've now filed their claim in the Court of Appeals -- how long is it before you say it's untimely?",
  "What -- what about if we go back to 1880 or whatever and they had a messenger? You know, they only had one office, but they had depositors in different States, and this messenger went from State to State handing out the cash and collecting a fee. Would Congress at that time have considered that bank to be located in all the States where the messenger showed up?",
  "Couldn't have a messenger? He just delivered some mail. The post office was slow.",
  "The Pony Express.",
  "I guess it's true, is it -- I'm testing my own understanding of this -- that if, in fact, shall not apply meant anything in that chapter, if you had a State and that State gave a State law remedy for, say, detaining property or for loss of mail or something, then that State law remedy would continue in existence because the thing in the law that sets aside that State court remedy is a different part of the same chapter --",
  "-- in 2679(b)?",
  "But the whole point of the Westfall Act is to get rid of those State causes of action.",
  "But the language does seem to say it.",
  "All right. Well, then -- then to get to the main point here, if we are going to get to that, the question that I would have for you is -- is the following. If we accept your interpretation, it's pretty anomalous. I mean, someone who brings his Bivens action first, of course, can sue the individual employee, and you agree to that. But if he brings his Bivens action second, because he made a mistake and went into the wrong court or he brought the wrong action or it was a borderline case, frankly, and he didn't know how it would end up, that person is out of luck. Now, there's nothing in this statute that says that the Government -- that the Congress wanted to achieve that result. What order you bring the suit in shouldn't really make any difference here. The Bivens action is totally different from all the other tort actions in that respect, and it's listed separately in 2679 to make clear that it isn't -- it is different. So why? I mean, why read it your way? The burden that reading it their way would impose on the Government is minuscule. The number of such suits is tiny, I would imagine. All right. Now, what is wrong with my question?",
  "A lot of things.",
  "But you left out one word that I think is important there. To test it to see if I'm right about this is I thought 2679(b) was focusing in large part upon State tort suits. Is that right?",
  "They wanted to get rid of the State tort suits --",
  "-- in part. Am I right about that or not?",
  "All right. So, therefore, if in fact we had words mean what they seem to mean, Congress would have both removed the State lawsuits in 2679(b) and reinstated them or set them in the exceptions. But that would have the statute defeat itself, and therefore, that case that you're citing came to a correct result.",
  "That's right?",
  "Okay. Don't tell me it's right if it's not right is all I want --",
  "Okay.",
  "Yes, but that -- that -- see, that's what's -- I'm not at all certain about this, whether they have an appeal, whether they don't have an appeal. I'm testing it out. But it seems to me if we take your position, we're going to make things awfully complicated. That is, the -- the basic idea here is in the vast mine run of employee suits, go sue the Government, and you can't sue the employee at all. That's true of the State actions. That's true of ordinary tort actions. And so ordinarily, if you sued the -- the employee, whether you sued him first, second, or third, you're not supposed to and he ought to have an appeal right away to get you out of court. Now, there is an exception there with the Bivens because you can bring your suit first and then there's no problem. But if we make an exception in the appealability rule for that, people are going to get mixed up. It's a kind of curlicue, and even in the Bivens case, it has a basic objective of trying to prevent people from harassing the employee because the instances in which you bring a Bivens suit first, as a practical matter, are probably small. Now, what's the response to that? I'm just nervous about making these collateral rules so complicated as to whether -- you'd have to do it whether it's a Bivens suit or some other kind of suit under this, and nobody is going to understand it.",
  "So put in --",
  "-- put them in the whole bag. Say give the employee his appeal because most of the time it's totally to help him from being harassed. Now, what's the answer to that? And I'm not -- I'm putting it because I want to get your answer.",
  "Your rule would be this. It's such a complicated area. I'm sorry. But if a plaintiff brings a lawsuit, tort suit, against a Government employee and the Westfall Act bars the lawsuit, period, you can't sue him at all because of -- of (b). He gets an immediate appeal if the district court doesn't agree.",
  "But if under the Westfall Act you could sue him, depending on the order, he doesn't get an appeal.",
  "I don't -- I don't understand. If we were to take that, wouldn't we have to overturn Smith? You think not. You just said not. But as I -- then as I understand Smith, we look to (b) and (b) says, plaintiff, you cannot bring an action under anything. Okay? You can't bring a State tort law action. You can't bring an action under Federal law against the employee, with certain exceptions where you can like Bivens and where there's a specific statute. Then we have over here the exceptions section. And over here in the exceptions section, it says there is no Federal action for, among other things, the case in front of us and, among other things, actions in a foreign country. And so the court says, one, this is in a foreign country, so you can't bring it under Federal Tort Claims Act, and now we'll go look to see whether this bar that you can't bring it, period, applies. They say it does apply. Now, Justice Stevens dissented, but he didn't dissent on that ground. And -- and so -- so I don't see how we could reach the result with this other exception without overturning Smith because Smith said (b) does apply. And so if the fact that it falls within an exception means the whole thing doesn't apply, then they would have held (b) doesn't apply. But they said (b) does apply. So how do we get there given Smith?",
  "I mean, that -- that would be to overturn the reasoning of Smith. It would say --",
  "Yes.",
  "So, in effect, they didn't -- the Court didn't consider this argument in Smith.",
  "No, no. I mean, the question is, I take it, in most of the arbitration associations, once you have arbitration, you will get paid even though -- the arbitrator will be paid, won’t he, whether --",
  "-- he decides one way or the other?",
  "So he has no particular interest in getting paid in upholding the contract or not.",
  "When I was working on the first options in those cases, I thought there was from Southland a pretty clear distinction between whether the person is attacking the arbitration clause itself. If he says that’s not valid, that probably goes to the court, unless there’s some other special thing. But if what he’s doing is attacking the rest of the contract as illegal, that doesn’t. That goes to the arbitrator. Now, I really did think that was the law. And even if I was wrong in thinking that was the law, it seems to me the whole community, the whole business community in the United States thinks it’s the law. Everybody else thinks it’s the law, and the briefs on your side don’t even say that it isn’t the law, except for yours. They say go and overrule the cases that make it the law.",
  "I mean, logically you’re right. I accept all that you’re saying logically. You could make those distinctions, but you also could come out the other way logically. And so to expose to you what’s really bothering me about the case are two things. One, I think you’re worried about consumer contracts, and there are a lot of good arguments on your side. But this rule also applies to business contracts, and there what’s bothering me is that -- that the whole business community seems to have developed an arbitration system throughout the world that depends upon the distinction I just made. And if we decide for you, we’re going to throw a large section of those contracts back into the laws of the 50 States and arbitration will be seriously injured as the commercial community has come to rely on it. Now, that’s what’s worrying me because I wouldn’t want to reach a decision, in the absence of it being clear anyway, that would make a significant negative difference to the gross national product of the United States, for example.",
  "I’m putting it dramatically because I want to get your --",
  "Well, what about --",
  "It’s not -- the workability of it depends on how many challenges you get to people saying this contract is void, you know. And if there are a lot of them, then that takes a whole wide set of cases out of arbitration and puts them into the courts, just where they’re trying to escape. And -- and so I don’t know the answer to how many, to be truthful, and I suspect no one does. So I’m wondering if there isn’t another route to the problem you’re getting at, which is, as I think in other countries, you say there’s a doctrine of kompetenz-kompetenz. You know that? You know what I’m thinking of?",
  "It’s arbitration generally. They don’t even look to see whether people agreed about the arbitration clause. It says arbitration. It goes to arbitration regardless. Now, the safeguard is, A, maybe the arbitrator will get it right or, B, if the arbitrator doesn’t get it right, they have to come to court to enforce it. And at that point, you could say, you know, this arbitrator is out to lunch. Our cases say he has to be really out to lunch, but you could make some distinctions there, you see. And -- and if this is really a problem that arbitrators are upholding illegal contracts, that might be the place to begin to make the distinctions. Say, Judge, look at this a little more closely where it’s illegal, the whole contract, et cetera. What do you think?",
  "I had thought that the interstate commerce question was like Crowell v. Benson. You know, it’s like a constitutional fact. And in fact, if you can’t -- if there’s not the constitutional -- if there’s not the connection with interstate commerce, Congress, at least arguably, would lack the constitutional power to tell the State court what to do in this case. So it’s not as surprising if there is a difference between that kind of fact and the kind of fact that goes to whether the -- the contract is void ab initio.",
  "Yes, it is. It’s both.",
  "They can logically because they say the arbitration clause, when embedded in a contract that is voidable -- i.e., A and B enter into a contract. B says it’s voidable. I void it. I void it. And there they say, fine, there was a contract and therefore this arbitration clause, which is separable -- you go to arbitration. But if it’s void, where B doesn’t have to say I void it, I void it, you never had a contract in the first place. Now, that is a logical position.",
  "Well, why would the person want if he thought that? I mean, why would a person want a patent if, in fact, he didn't think that it gave him the power to raise price above what the price would be in its absence?",
  "Now, you see, you're talking about the wide -- you -- you say there are a lot of failed patents. The person got it because he thought it would, but he shouldn't have because it actually made no difference.",
  "There might be. I don't know.",
  "Well, there might be. There's a set of valueless patents.",
  "And in respect to there being a valueless patent, the owner would not be able to raise the price over what it otherwise would be. And why not then make that a defense, that a person could say, I have a valueless patent, and he could introduce evidence to prove it?",
  "Suppose it's the other one that's the critical one.",
  "And the other one being that -- the attack on the problem is there happens to be instances where tying is justified for procompetitive reasons, risk-sharing, maintaining product quality, probably Jerrold Electronics. There are a number of them. And the real problem is that the law hasn't admitted a defense. But where the attack should be is on the tied product, not the tying product. What do you think of that?",
  "And market power -- you mean price -- ability to charge a price higher than otherwise would be the case?",
  "As you're defining it. As you're defining.",
  "Fine. Then you're talking about patents where the person who paid for the attorney went to the Patent Office and so forth. That was just a mistake.",
  "But then are you relying on that, the existence of valueless patents?",
  "If you're going beyond that, which patents are you talking about?",
  "No, I see.",
  "But that --",
  "-- that, I would think, would be one of the strongest cases for not having a per se rule because if, in fact, you have a justification, in terms of sharing risk with a new product, that would be one of the cases where you would expect to find a tie. And -- and so I'm not really very persuaded by the effort to draw a wedge between requirements and other things. But what I do find very difficult about this case is -- you can see from what I'm saying -- that at the bottom, I think there are cases where tying is justified. But the way to attack that would be to say here, here, and here it's justified and that would have to do with the tied product. It would abolish the per se rule, making it into a semi-per se rule. But here, we're attacking a different thing. We're attacking the screen, which is a -- the tying product. Now there, that's just a screen. And -- and so I'm -- I'm not certain whether attacking the screen and insisting on a higher standard of proof is better than nothing or whether you should say, well, leave the screen alone and let's deal with the tied product on the merits. That I think is what Justice Stevens was getting at too. And -- and I'm -- I'm not being too clear. You understand where I'm coming from, and I -- I want you to say what you want about that. But that's what's bothering me here.",
  "All right. This case isn't what's bothering me.",
  "Well, that isn't so. I mean, you could have a patent that was valueless or didn't itself confer very much, but the person is trying to establish the market for the product. It's a component, and he attaches this tied product as a counting device knowing that if it's successful, everybody makes money, and if it's not successful, he and everybody else lose. That's -- that's the kind of justification. And that could happen with --",
  "Let me be more specific. A person has a patent on an item in a machine. This is a great machine. It's fabulous. We've all had friends who have tried to get us to invest in such machines. We don't know what it does, nor does anyone.",
  "To tie something to the great machine.",
  "Correct, if it takes off.",
  "If it takes off, everybody will be rich, and if it doesn't take off, who cares. Now --",
  "-- that could happen.",
  "And there often does, I guess.",
  "I'll put this machine in your store for a penny. A penny.",
  "By the way, a penny and you have to buy marvelous component. And by the way, if it takes off, you'll buy a lot of marvelous component, and if not, not.",
  "Let me try this again, and I'm thinking of a way of saying this more clearly. This is my actual dilemma. If I decide this case against you in my view -- and suppose it came out that way -- I would be concerned lest there be a lot of big companies in the technology area that have real market power in tying products and get people -- and they extend that power through a tie into a second market and thereby insulate themselves from attack. I would be afraid of that really happening, and everything gets mixed up in a war of experts in a technology area about do we have the power, don't we have the power, and who knows. If I decide this case in your favor, I would then be afraid that particularly in the patent area, there will be lots of instances where new technology, uncertain technology, uncertain new technology, does not get off the ground because a very easy way to finance the risk through a requirements contract, for example, so that we make the money if the product succeeds, because people buy the required product at a higher price. That will never happen. And patents is an area where new technology is particularly at risk. So I see a problem both ways, and I'm really not certain what to do.",
  "Well, I mean, once you start that, then you're saying that -- which I thought was the -- I would have agreed with the dissent -- the concurrence in -- in Jefferson Parish, but that's not the law. And so now what you're saying is, well, we have to go and really make that the law.",
  "If you're going to give me -- if you're going -- well.",
  "There are no -- I thought we were just talking about several.",
  "Price discrimination, I gather, sometimes good, sometimes not. If it pushes out sales --",
  "-- on the low side, it's good. If it just extracts profits on the high side, it's bad.",
  "And so I think most economists -- in fact, everyone I've ever read agrees with that.",
  "Let's just imagine a real circumstance. A 15 year-old walks in 2:00 in the morning on Saturday into the emergency room and the doctor looks at her, she's pregnant, she has this very high blood pressure, whatever. And the doctor thinks to himself, he thinks, well, immediate abortion, no question, immediately deliver the child. If I don't, I don't think she's going to die but she'll never have children. And he's thinking that. What's supposed to happen? He calls up Pam Pevagoglio or Pam Livingston and there is no answer. It's 2:00 in the morning and there is one of those things, leave a message, okay? Should I call your parents? No. They don't know I'm pregnant. Now, what's supposed to happen?",
  "It doesn't say that in the statute. It suggests the contrary. So what is the particular provision of New Hampshire law that tells that -- I mean, the doctor -- all these things are, you know, questions of probability. And he doesn't want to risk being prosecuted and he doesn't want to risk losing his license. And so what particular provision -- he happens to have his lawyer with him.",
  "What does the lawyer say? Okay? What's the provision that saves him? There is no health exemption in this statute.",
  "How do we know? I mean, what you're saying is fine, but how do we know that that's actually the law? I mean, there are a lot of people who absolutely in very good faith would say that it isn't competing harm. They would say that the competing right that the life of the fetus is more important than the possibility of the mother having children in the future herself. See, there are people in good faith on both sides of this argument. And so how do we know that the New Hampshire statute is going to do -- not the statute, but your competing harms defense is going to do for this particular woman what a health exception would do?",
  "Now, that's exactly -- I'm leaving aside your fraction test, your 100 percent test, because I don't think they capture all the considerations that are relevant. Focus on what you just said. What you've done is you've tried to create an injunction that will separate out the sheep from the goats, all right? The goats are only 1 percent and the sheep -- But what does it say? I don't think you can say enjoin the bypass procedure, because if you enjoin the bypass procedure, there goes down the drain your whole parental notification because you can't have parental notification without a bypass procedure. I don't think you can say enjoin emergencies because to do that, you're going to have to get into the greatest difficult issue there is in this area, which is what does that health exception mean. And we've said throughout that that health exception has to be defined first by a legislature. So if you tell me how to write that injunction, then I'll be able to decide whether it's possible for a court just to say, okay, we only enjoin the goats as opposed to saying, legislature, this is basically up to you, the whole area.",
  "Well, but that's -­ And if I could just say, it's no different than Steffel against Thompson. There is a case where there is a challenge against a broad criminal trespass statute. The theory in Steffel was not that the whole criminal trespass statute was unconstitutional. It was it's unconstitutional if you apply it to leafletting. And Justice Brennan for a unanimous Court said, yes, that's exactly the kind of challenge you can bring. And you can get declaratory judgment that says you can't do that, you can't apply the statute as to leafletting. But you don't strike down the entirety of the criminal trespassing statute.",
  "The word leafletting is not as fuzzy around the edges as health exception, given the fact that lots of people think health exception is a way of getting abortion on demand.",
  "Well, suppose it were from your point of view. I don't know from the other side's point of view, I guess it would satisfy you to say that this statute can not be enforced in any circumstance in which a physician certifies in good faith that he believes an immediate abortion is necessary for the health of the mother. All you're looking to is the state of mind of the physician. Now, the problem that I think we would see with that is you would then be writing into the law the broadest possible definition of what that health exception means. So I'm not sure the New Hampshire legislator would have wanted to do it and I'm not sure the other side would like to do it. But looking at it from your point of view, do you have any objection to it?",
  "I don't want you to agree to this unless you've focused on it and think it really is your position. I take it, as I'm listening, that you would not object to an injunction that says that this statute cannot be applied in any circumstance where a doctor, in good faith, himself or herself, believes that there is a health emergency, period. Now, I take it as soon as we get more narrow than that, you might object on the ground that that will leave ambiguous cases where there really is a health emergency, but the doctor doesn't know what to do and would have to go to court, by which time it will be too late.",
  "Have I stated it correctly? You've focused on it, thought about it, stated it?",
  "Okay. Thank you.",
  "Is it -- you just -- on your list, I had the impression, but tell me if I'm right or wrong, that there's a specific statute dealing with abortion clinics now, though there wasn't when this case began.",
  "So that if --",
  "-- Operation Rescue did the same kind of thing now that they did then, the Petitioners in -- the plaintiffs in this case would be able to get relief under that statute. Is that right or wrong?",
  "I'd like you to get to the meaning of the Hobbs Act.",
  "And I'll try to focus my own thoughts on this by saying two objections to what you're arguing, related, that when they passed the Hobbs Act, it had a section 2, and section 2 said that, \"This is an Act that forbids robbery and extortion, all involving interstate commerce. And robbery/extortion involve property.\" Then it had a section 5. And section 5 said, \"This Act forbids physical violence or threats of violence related to section 2.\" Now, all that happened since then is, there was a recodification. And the recodification wasn't meant to change anything substantive. Second and related point: Enmons. For 35 years, working people in this country have thought they had a right to strike, free of the Hobbs Act. And your interpretation, as the AFL-CIO points out, will gut the right to strike. Now, those are two strong arguments against you, and I'd like to hear your response.",
  "But that's a jurisdictional hook, isn't it?",
  "When you see something in a criminal statute that forbids \"affecting commerce by,\" that means that Congress wants to prevent the conduct that will follow the words \"by,\" and it needs a jurisdictional hook, so it puts in \"affecting commerce.\" That's how I've always understood the Federal criminal code. Am I --",
  "-- wrong in that?",
  "Well, I -- I mean, one is -- I'm attempted to say, \"Well, tell Congress that.\" If they want to create a separate offense, they can do it.",
  "But isn't the reasonable reading of that, \"violence in the course of achieving -- for the purpose of achieving the object in question,\" as opposed to, in effect, a \"by-blow against a bystander\"?",
  "Mr. --",
  "-- I want to give you a chance, because you're quite right in thinking that I'm moved, in large part -- or worried, in large part -- not about this language, but about the change in Federal criminal law. And the change in Federal criminal law, if you're right, way beyond this case, would transform virtually every threat of violence made anywhere in the United States into a serious Federal crime. At the least, it would -- and make a major change in threats of violence on the picket line. And those are two aspects of the same thing. And I'm worried about the upsetting of expectations way outside the context of this case and making a major change in Federal labor law, for example.",
  "What does it -- 1951(c) says what?",
  "Yeah, but I -- then perhaps I -- that's an old statute, 1951(c), isn't it? Is it something brand new?",
  "Yeah.",
  "All right. What is it --",
  "Well, the case that interpreted the Hobbs Act, which is Enmons --",
  "-- seems to rely, for the labor-union exemption, on the fact that a threat of violence in an effort to obtain legitimate wages is not within the Act. But if we read \"legitimate wages\" out of the Act, then I guess we would be left with \"the threat of violence.\"",
  "No, the -- it's not a -- that's wrong. It says \"affect commerce.\"",
  "And, therefore, we have the instance of any threat of violence that affects commerce becomes a Federal crime subject to 20 years of imprisonment. And, of course, in today's world, as you know, I believe almost everything affects commerce. And if I'm even close to being right, this is a major incursion of Federal law, serious criminal Federal law, into what could be fairly minor matters of State criminal law.",
  "Well, somebody will be if it’s random. If you have thousands of people, somebody will be if it is random. If there were nobody who was picked seven times, that would show it wasn’t random. So, you know --",
  "-- whether he has a good constitutional claim here I guess is rather doubtful --",
  "What are they? How many people are there? How many people are tested if you try to calculate it? How many --",
  "No. It’s -- it’s not hard to do.",
  "But it’s not hard to do. You just ask someone at Stanford. They’ll do it for you.",
  "But the -- the --",
  "All right. Regardless, this is beside the point. I -- all right. Can I -- I just want you at some point to get to not just the constitutional question. Maybe he can go in and raise his claim. I don’t know if he should have exhausted or not, et",
  "But I find it hard, in worker, I mean, normally you have a collective bargaining agreement, and the union takes up your minor thing. And here, what you’re saying is although if it’s a major thing, like a personnel action, there’s a special thing where you get in -- you know, you -- you get into court way down the road. It’s very complicated. This individual, even though he classifies it as a grievance where the union is supposed to take it up and the union tells him we’re not going to take it up, we don’t believe in your claim, that then he can run in to a Federal judge. Now, that -- that I find surprising, and I’d like you to explain how in your theory that works.",
  "Well, why isn’t the thing to do here -- I -- I see that you are raising a significant question in respect to -- at least in my view, in respect to the -- an action that violates a regulation that violates a statute. Leave the Constitution aside, but it might violate a number of practices, good practices, et cetera. But why isn’t focusing on that the thing for the plaintiff here to do and 7 of your brief -- and he says, I would like you to invoke arbitration? And they might do it. Now, if he then -- they might file exceptions and they might win. But what you’re worried about is if they don’t win or if they don’t do it, they can go to court only if it involved an unfair labor practice or a major adverse personnel action. That’s what’s worrying you, I take it.",
  "Well, why isn’t it, at that stage if he doesn’t get into court, you then say that that isn’t true? They should be able to come to court in other instances as well, making the same kinds of arguments that you’re making now.",
  "You -- you -- I -- I believe that there are millions of instances, perhaps. Now, often wrong. But I thought that the reason that exhaustion is required is not always because statutes require it. It’s partly because of the word final in the APA, which applies here as well, and it’s also because of the common law of administrative law that requires people to exhaust their remedies.",
  "All right. So I guess you’re saying, as to the constitutional claim, it’s obvious they have to exhaust. There’s no reason why they don’t have to exhaust in respect to the 12th test, which has already occurred, and in respect to the 15th, which might be threatened, if it does come about that it’s threatened, they can go in, I guess, under 705 of the APA and ask for an injunction. Any reason they couldn’t do that? get into court first. They would first --",
  "No, no. What they do is action has taken place. I think it’s unconstitutional or you do. We exhaust our remedies and then get to court at the end of the day and make our claim. An agency action is threatened. I am threatened with irreparable injury. I can go to court, I think, at the time it’s threatened, and say I want a protective order. I think 705 provides for that specifically. And -- and, therefore, I’m protected. I can’t imagine why they couldn’t do that if they have a -- not just a plausible, but a -- a good claim that it does violate the Constitution and they need the protection. Is there any reason they couldn’t?",
  "No, they wouldn’t. Their point is that the very -- availing myself of the administrative remedy will work irreparable harm of -- in violation of my constitutional right. Now, maybe that’s not true, but let’s imagine it’s true. Then couldn’t they go in and ask for a protective order? I",
  "Yes. And is there any reason that they shouldn’t be able to do that here? Because they are going to say that -- I don’t know they ever can make it out in this case, but they are going to say that my having to go ahead with the number -- test number 15, which, by the way, may never be threatened, but if it is, it will, the very fact that I have to do it, violate an important constitutional right that I need to have protected before undergoing the text -- the test.",
  "Yes.",
  "You think they could not do that under 705. So there is a difference between you on that. As to the statutory claim, I mean, I find -- view that the notion of private right of action in this area simply mixes things up. It’s apples and oranges. in fact, is adversely affected or aggrieved by a Government action, he usually, almost always, indeed, can get judicial review eventually. But what you’re saying there I take it is that may be so, but this impliedly says no.",
  "Now, my question is do we have to decide that. Because, after all, this individual may get relief through the statutory procedures that you admit are provided by asking for grievance arbitration. He may, the first time he asks for it, be given a piece of paper that shows him he wasn’t hurt. Or he may have been hurt, and they’ll say we don’t it again. There are a lot of things that can happen. Do we have to decide the issue today of whether if he goes to the union, the union says we won’t arbitrate, or they say we will and they lose and it isn’t as an unfair labor practice -- do we have to decide that issue as to whether a person in those circumstances can then subsequently go into court? certainly decide the case on the ground that an individual who has made no effort to utilize the collective bargaining agreement, can’t bypass those procedures entirely by filing suit into -- in Federal district court. And it wouldn’t be necessary for the Court to resolve --",
  "So we have to say the easier matter is it’s clear that as to such matters, you must exhaust. It’s so clear that there is no reason for us to decide whether there is an implied repeal of the right at the end of some days to -- to judicial review, a matter which is disfavored in the law.",
  "I might. My -- so I don’t know why it wouldn’t be.",
  "What their brief says is that they can go on a personnel, as opposed to major personnel, to the OSC if, and only if, the complaint has to do with whistleblowing.",
  "And this doesn’t have to do with whistleblowing.",
  "And therefore, even if this were a personnel action, that route to the OSC is not open to them.",
  "Is that true? What do you think?",
  "But it’s not rewriting. I mean -- I mean, it’s perhaps.",
  "All right. You think -- fine. The -- the -- but the -- the issue it seems that could be dispositive of this, in respect to the get your response -- is simply that it is a fair implication from Congress having set up on non- require your client to go through that system before seeking to get review of the non-constitutional matters in a Federal district court. Now, that’s the normal rule in administrative law. What is the argument that it wouldn’t apply in your case?",
  "Now you want us to hold you don’t have judicial review --",
  "-- under the statute.",
  "No, but the answer -- please, I didn’t mean to cut off your answer.",
  "-- as an implication from the statute?",
  "All right. Now, is there any other claim -- any other answer to the argument other than they waived it?",
  "What? amended 7121(a) in 1994, they amended it to make clear that it had no effect on judicial causes of action that word administrative there was done. It was not done in order to create an exhaustion regime, but rather, to eliminate a preclusion regime. And we set this out quite carefully in our brief, as do the two union amici, as to what the purpose of the grievance procedure is here. It is not to create an exhaustion regime and certainly not to create an exhaustion regime with what the Government, at least, concedes under the statute, as now written, is not a personnel action. That is, the CSRA is quite comprehensive with regard to personnel actions, but it leaves to traditional sources of judicial enforcement things that are not personnel actions. And as this Court’s opinion in Bush against Lucas makes absolutely clear, a warrantless search of the kind to which our client was subjected is not a personnel action and, therefore, is not within the comprehensive scheme of the CSRA for dealing with personnel actions. Thank you.",
  "Did I -- could you give -- give the same answer --",
  "-- in respect to your constitutional claim? Why, given the presence of",
  "-- one’s -- forget it.",
  "Your time is up. That’s --",
  "What -- what is the -- where -- where is the place in what the judge -- when did this eye-rolling take place? I can’t figure it out.",
  "Yes, I have that in front of me.",
  "What was the statement that the judge made in respect to which the juror is supposed to have rolled her eyes?",
  "Which question?",
  "So the reason I can’t find it out is none of us know.",
  "And it actually says it wasn’t a question. It was a statement, and that’s why I can’t figure it out.",
  "Which was a question you said --",
  "I see.",
  "If you have a minute, you might -- I don’t know if you -- if this is very useful. But I’ve taken this point of view that -- that there’s no way to get to the bottom of the use of stereotypes in cases like this, a perfect example. And therefore, the only thing to do, consistent with the Constitution, is no peremptories.",
  "You have 30 seconds. You want to say how irresponsible that is, right?",
  "So what is the point? The judge says, I’ll give the prosecution the benefit of the doubt. Well, he -- he knows the prosecutor and he believes the prosecutor. I didn’t see it, but I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt. He told me that’s what she did. What’s -- I mean, I really don’t see why that isn’t, given the present law, sufficient.",
  "You mean benefit of the doubt just refers to youth. I -- I read that as referring to the whole story.",
  "I mean, I -- it’s pretty hard to read that as saying, I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt in respect to the youth. It sounds as if I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt in respect to the reasons he gave for challenging her. There are two other African American jurors on the jury. She is useful -- youthful. He -- she saw him -- he saw her rolling her eyes when -- what do you think about the drugs or some other relevant question. And he says, I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt. I mean, I don’t see how to read that in a way that -- that comes out the way you want it to come out.",
  "So tell me.",
  "So what is the remedy -- the remedy if we say and hold with you that prosecutors can’t give reasons like they gave here? How is a -- what’s a prosecutor supposed to do? I mean, the prosecutor might be moved by stereotype. Young African American women -- of course, she tolerates drugs. Well, not quite of course. Well -- well -- well, she rolled her eyes. Well, at least she looked in this direction. Well, I sort of -- maybe I’m seeing eye- rolling here. I mean, we all understand that. But that’s why I guess I am where I am. I -- I don’t see what the -- I don’t see what we’re telling prosecutors if we hold in your favor, and I don’t see how we deal with the problem if we hold against you.",
  "But I’m asking for your experience. You have a lot of experience as a defense lawyer. How is this thing supposed to work?",
  "The constitutional argument, I guess, is, \"Does the Constitution require access -- is -- does it permit a statute which says you have to give access to the military, when you wouldn't give access to any other employer?\"",
  "All right. Now --",
  "So, then what you're saying, it --",
  "-- and then what's the answer to that question, \"Does the Constitution\" -- how does the -- what's the answer?",
  "Yes, but it is an important question, because the -- there is an amicus brief that says, \"Go read the statute.\" And, really, the statute was not about homosexuals in the military, it was a statute about universities in Vietnam not letting military people on campus. So, in the -- at the heart of the statute was a matter which was unique to the military. Now, this is a matter that isn't unique to the military. So, why not interpret the statute in the way that the amicus brief suggests in order to avoid a difficult constitutional question?",
  "But that isn't --",
  "-- that isn't relevant.",
  "Oh, there are --",
  "-- students --",
  "So, why isn't --",
  "So, in fact, to be clear, you also think schools that are angry at the military because they're too favorable to gays in the military, they have the same right.",
  "Okay.",
  "And also the same right Bob Jones University, because they disapprove of social mixing of the races?",
  "All right, so --",
  "-- so, what -- and there are a lot of people in the country, they may -- there's few, anyway -- may not believe in either affirmative action, they may not believe in -- they may not believe in diversity, they may not -- they may even believe in racial segregation, for all I know. I hope there are not too many --",
  "-- but there might, and those people all have the same right.",
  "Yes, okay. So, if that --",
  "-- if that's the case, then of course it's going to be pretty tough --",
  "-- for the military to get people on campus. And I just wonder, if that's an important need, why you don't have here what I'd say is normal in the first-amendment area, that the remedy for speech you don't like, is not less speech, it is more speech.",
  "But I would --",
  "-- I would like the answer to my question, because I'm thinking, as you correctly say, if you have that right, so do all the worse segregationists you can imagine, et cetera.",
  "And here -- yes, and here there is a need of some kind to get the military in. And what the Government in this statute asks you -- because I, personally, couldn't find anything in the record that finds that student who thinks, by letting the military person in, that that school, which basically is completely against the military in this area, suddenly becomes for it. And I haven't even found in the record an instance where there was a recruiter who told people that they couldn't join the military if they were gay.",
  "So, we have not a tremendous demonstration there of a need on the university side. And my question was, What's wrong with the Government saying, \"University, you disapprove of what we do. The remedy for such a situation is not less speech, it is more speech.\"",
  "Go and explain it.",
  "Do you agree with the Government, that the statute, as fairly interpreted, is violated when a school which uniformly applies to all employers the rule, \"You can't come in if you have the discrimination against hiring gay people\"?",
  "Well, the speech is on their side. The Government just says, \"Let our recruiters in.\" So, why isn't it sort of like, \"Pay the property tax\"? \"I don't want to. I hate the government.\"",
  "-- \"I'm withholding the money because I want to express my message.\"",
  "The message is, \"Join the Army.\" The --",
  "-- message of the property tax is, \"Pay the -- pay for the\" --",
  "-- \"Government's expenses.\"",
  "There are two separate arguments here, and I'm trying to separate them. I guess that many States have a doctrine in two areas of law. Third party beneficiaries can sometimes recover; sometimes they can't. Victims of efforts to interfere with a contract sometimes recover; sometimes they can't. And one question is whether this particular individual fits within those doctrines. And you have to be an expert on contract law to know. But in respect to the civil rights law, I guess your position is -- and this is what I want to know -- that whatever those doctrines are, they have to be the same for white people as for black people.",
  "Right. So -- so it might apply. And one thing you couldn't do if you're a State is have a different rule for black people that treated them worse than white people.",
  "All right. And has there ever been a case in respect, whether it's affirmative action or some other thing, that interprets that -- that -- this particular civil rights statute to say that for whatever historical reasons, et cetera, black people are entitled to more protection under contract law than white?",
  "So how do we deal with this? That is to say, do I have to become an expert on contract law, or do I say to the Ninth Circuit or the circuit, look, the -- the question here is not what the contract law is except insofar as it's relevant to whether there's a differential in treatment?",
  "Well, but that's exactly what I'm asking. If -- if you win, this case is reversed, sent back. I mean, what do -- would I tell them? And why not tell them, instead of having to delve into this, is, look, it's plausible here that third party beneficiary doctrine might cover this person? It's also plausible not. We're not experts. We don't know. You figure out what the normal rule is and apply that normal rule.",
  "Well, what about the other part of it, which is the -- the interference with the contract? Could we say the same thing there? We send it back, say, look, we're not experts on this, it's a matter of State law typically, and be absolutely sure, please, that whatever doctrine you normally apply is applied to this case too because it's plausible. He's the sole shareholder. He's the sole beneficiary.",
  "Is targeted enough? I mean, I'm thinking here not necessarily your case, but in general. Is a claim of discrimination -- I don't know the state of the law, but maybe if a minority shareholder -- a minority person is the sole shareholder of a corporation, maybe that corporation could assert protection, or maybe it couldn't. But here, I take it that the corporation JWM brought an action and won or settled for $45,000. So they're out of it. Now we're just thinking about the sole shareholder, and the sole shareholder says there's another action here. And as to the two most plausible ones that I would like to assert an action as a third party beneficiary, we've heard the other side say that you've conceded you have no right there. And as to the other one, which might be protected in many cases, that the -- knowing that what was going to happen, they deliberately interfered with the contractual relation between me and the corporation. That's what we're asking about now. And you say, well, I didn't raise that. Now, is there a reason you should be given an opportunity to raise it?",
  "You conceded that out.",
  "Because?",
  "That might --",
  "Then the argument for sending it back, if I understand it, is this, that when you look at the question presented, no one could possibly file a lawsuit -- and you didn't -- on the theory, well, I'm hurt, so somebody should pay me. That isn't a legal theory.",
  "Rather, the legal theory here was that this contract-related section of the law is violated. And you want to say the simple fact that the contract wasn't between McDonald and JWM, that's a separate matter. That doesn't bar you from bringing your claim. So, on the one hand, you argue that I can bring my claim as long as I'm a target and the motive as to why they breached some other contract, the one between the two corporations. And we seem to have it conceded that even if that's too broad, there are at least some circumstances where you could bring your claim. One is if you were a third party beneficiary. That's not present here. And the second is if you are a target such that their action violates and interferes with a contract between you and your own corporation. At least you have that going for you. So you say, well, if I was wrong about the broader theory, give me a chance to allege the narrower.",
  "Is that right?",
  "I'm trying to be helpful in this respect.",
  "No. You have to say there's certain kind of target. The kind of target is that they --",
  "-- were discriminatory, aiming at me, et cetera.",
  "Do you have an action --",
  "-- on that in California? Wouldn't you have an action in the State if somebody goes and deliberately interferes with your credit and so forth?",
  "And can -- can you go back to Justice Souter's question for a minute? Because the way I'm thinking about this, I'm making two assumptions that I'd like you to make: first, that there could be such a case, which I very much doubt, but -- but this is a lawyer's hypothetical, this whole thing, in a sense. But I'll make the assumption there could be such a case. Second, I will assume that our case law leaves this open, a matter that can be argued. But suppose that we do make that assumption for the moment. Then what I'm thinking of is this made-up case is the case of the following. We have aggravating factors and break them down into molecules on a scale, and for every molecule of aggravation here, there is a molecule of mitigation there, so that the juror who is very conscientious ends up with the same number of molecules of equal weight on this scale. And in our made-up instance, Kansas says, if that's the situation, you must say death. Now, if that's the case, how would you reconcile that with a view of the eighth amendment that says if you're going to sentence someone to death, there has to be something special about his case that means it's somewhat worse than the ordinary case because, after all, for every molecule of specialness that warranted death, we have a molecule of mitigation that doesn't? So that's where I am, trying to get the cases out of it and trying to take very seriously the hypothetical that is before us.",
  "Well, you see, my hypothetical is designed to cut free of the language of the cases. I have no doubt you can go through the language and show that. And it's designed to say, but the very point of those cases is you do not send someone to death unless the jury decides that the circumstances here make him somewhat worse, at least one molecule worth of worse, than the typical person. And given the evenness of the balance, I don't see how we can say that, though I grant you, when you go back to those words in the cases, you're right.",
  "No, no. They're -- they're saying it is appropriate. They're saying it is appropriate. We have the people put in the box. The box is are they in a situation that is different from the average murderer. Yes. And they're making the determination that although they're in that box, that morally they're no different. Morally they're the same --",
  "-- because for every factor that makes them morally one way, there's a factor that makes them morally the other way. So they're different, but they're not morally different. Now, that's -- that's what I think this case presents. And I -- I mean, I imagine a juror who's thinking just what I said. I don't know if there ever was such a juror, but if there was such a juror, the statute in this instant tells him what to do.",
  "It says where you think there is an equivalent, but not a moral difference, death.",
  "That's different from saying not decided. I thought the Kansas Supreme Court didn't speak of not decided. I thought it didn't speak in Kleypas about a jury who -- a juror who can't make up its -- his mind. I thought it said the jury has made -- it assumed the juror has made up his mind. That's why I think it's artificial. It says where the jury finds. It finds equipoise as to the mitigating and aggravating circumstance, then death, that the jury has to find that.",
  "That's true I -- I think, isn't it? And then the question is, does a State have a right not to do with burden of proof, not to do with anything else, but to have perhaps the artificial situation where the jury finds that the evidence is in equipoise whoever has the burden of proof. Put it all on you, whoever had it. That was their final conclusion. I find it is in equipoise. Next question: what happens?",
  "Oh, I agree with you. That's not the problem.",
  "No, do it. Do it. Make the reasoned moral choice. And the facts are that we have, because of the balancing, molecules or not -- we have by the balancing made a determination that anything for the bad that distinguishes this person from the ordinary is -- is equally balanced by the good. Now, make the moral choice.",
  "What is the reason?",
  "Can you --",
  "Can you --",
  "Well, can't you under -- look, first imagine that they don't want to introduce one word from the mother's mouth that isn't already in that transcript. Imagine that's the circumstance. If that's the circumstance, then I should think there is no doubt, under Oregon law, that those words in the transcript are admissible. And I believe that under Oregon law -- and I'm not certain -- that, an ordinary case, a death-eligible person does have the right to argue in the sentencing proceeding. Think back over that trial jury and you will see that there are doubts as to whether this man is guilty or not. Am I right -- am I right on the first part? Am I right on the second part?",
  "All right. In other words, prior to this case, in the State of Oregon, where there was a death case -- maybe there weren't very many, but where there was one, under Oregon law -- we have the trial; immediately thereafter, the sentencing, and the lawyer had no right to argue, under Oregon law. Think back about your certainty as to whether this individual is guilty.",
  "Yes, all right.",
  "And did the court say, here -- the Oregon court, in this case -- one, You can introduce evidence, which it seems to have been mistaken about, about not being there, but that, second, the Federal Constitution gives you the right to argue the residual doubt?",
  "Ah. \"Consider the evidence\" is different from \"making an argument about the evidence.\" And what I didn't see in the -- Oregon's majority opinion, is a statement that not only can this evidence be introduced -- because, after all, in a normal case, the jury's heard it --",
  "It's the same jury. But I didn't see, anywhere, where they addressed the question about what kind of argument the defense had the right to make at the sentencing trial in respect to the residual doubt that they might have from what they just heard. Can you point, in that opinion, to where they made that statement that you just said they made about the argument?",
  "Well, that isn't the thrust of my question, of course. The thrust of my question is that if, in fact, this evidence from the mother comes in under State law, it comes in under State law, because -- I have the cite; you know the --",
  "-- section I'm referring to. If it comes in under State law, and they're not trying to prove anything else, and the holding of the Oregon Supreme Court is about what evidence is admissible, and not about what arguments to be made, I don't see what reason we would have to reach an issue that isn't in the case.",
  "Well, why is --",
  "What about Oregon revised stat 163.150? It says, \"In a capital sentencing proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that all evidence previously offered and received may be considered for purposes of the sentencing hearing.\" Now, that's Oregon law. It's long been there. What possible reason could Oregon have for having that provision, which is, \"Jury, you shall consider all the evidence you just heard at the guilt phase of the trial\"? What reason could that be? How is it supposed to be relevant, \"all evidence,\" unless it's relevant to the question of whether there is doubt?",
  "But that's a different provision. I'm now thinking of the \"normal case,\" where you hear the guilt phase, and now we're in the sentencing phase, and it says here, under Oregon law, \"Judge, tell the jury that everything they previously heard at the guilt phase they may consider for purposes of what sentence they should impose.\" I just wonder what that sentence is doing there in Oregon law, unless the jury is supposed to think about whether this guy's really -- \"I'm completely certain he's guilty.\"",
  "But under --",
  "-- Oregon law, what is not clear is -- you want to put the mother on the stand.",
  "Now, do you want to go into anything at all that wasn't raised at the trial?",
  "I mean, that --",
  "That's right. So --",
  "-- that's why I want to know that. That's what's ambiguous.",
  "Look, you only get to go into something if it was not otherwise -- if it is otherwise relevant; and, therefore, if you want to. The reason they think it is relevant is because of a constitutional holding of the Oregon Supreme Court. So, if you want to go into something, we have to decide whether it is, or is not, otherwise relevant. If you want to ask the same thing, that's just a question of whether you have to have a transcript or a live witness. And I don't know that that's a question that depends on their constitutional holding. So, I want to know, Do you want to go into things that are not there in the original trial, yes or no?",
  "Okay.",
  "All right. No, I'm not saying that. I -- look, until this minute, you might have been equivocal. You're quite right, I was leading you.",
  "Now, that doesn't mean you can't say yes or no. You can decide right now. So, decide. And I'm -- I will be bound by the answer, as I think we all are. And if your answer is, \"Yes, I want to go into otherwise relevant things,\" I'd like to know that. And if the answer is no, I want to know that, too.",
  "No, if you pass -- if you pass, I will think you do. And as long as you do, I think we have to decide whether it is, or is not, otherwise relevant. I'm being totally open and honest with you.",
  "Now, I'm not being tricky about it. I want to know if we have to go to the words \"otherwise relevant\" in the Oregon statute -- \"otherwise relevant,\" particularly in respect to this question of residual doubt.",
  "I really would like an answer, if possible.",
  "Right. And they said that relevance is -- of residual doubt is relevant. And the reason that it's relevant is because the Constitution of the United States requires the jury to hear it.",
  "That is what I am focusing on, and I want to know if you want to go into \"otherwise relevant,\" for that reason.",
  "Okay. So, let's go to the constitutional --",
  "-- issue. Now, let's imagine we have a trial. And at the trial, we have a lot of evidence about the alibi.",
  "And what the State Court says, \"This is our law. When a person is\" -- now go to the sentencing phase, the jury has heard it --",
  "Okay? So, they take it into account. And, moreover, we tell them they have to consider it.",
  "Okay? That's a State law. Now, what happens when there's an appeal in the middle, and now we go back just to the sentencing? Here's what we do. We introduce the transcript. And, moreover, we introduce some live witnesses to say what they said before, but nothing else. Now, you're saying there is a constitutional right to present an additional witness on the matter that has already been litigated to go into things that were not there in the trial before.",
  "Now, my goodness, if you had real evidence of an alibi, why didn't you put it in the first time? And if, in fact, you -- it's not such good evidence, and so forth, why does the State have to waste its time to hear some more about the alibi that you didn't put in the first time? I mean, you know, that's what you're saying the Constitution protects. I'm being a little skeptical. I want to know what your answer is.",
  "No, I'm agreeing with you --",
  "-- insofar as you have a right to put in what you've put in the first time.",
  "I agree with you on that one. But you said you wanted to do something else. You wouldn't say, \"We don't want to do something else.\" You --",
  "-- want to do more.",
  "And, in the \"more\" part, where does the Constitution protect you? I'm willing to, at least hypothetically, go with you on the protection for what they already heard.",
  "What about -- what about -- for example, the single most important feature leading juries to recommend against death, apparently, from the studies, is their residual doubt. Every juror who hears sentencing matters directly after a trial automatically takes that into account. Therefore, those who are resentenced and have a new jury should have the same kind of right. Otherwise, it's cruel and unusual. Now, I made that argument. You didn't make it. But it seems to me that there are several arguments that you might make in favor of the Oregon Supreme Court's approach if, at least, you concede that it is up to Oregon to control, through its evidentiary rules, whether a matter is relevant, what form it comes in, et cetera.",
  "Is the 2:16 a.m. alarm clock in the original trial, or not?",
  "Yes.",
  "But that's -- that's actually what's disturbing me about this, because I thought the knock-and-announce rule was a rule that would allow a policeman to go in without knocking and announcing when he has reasonable grounds for thinking he might get shot if he didn't. So, I -- as I read the briefs, I thought maybe that's not how it's being implemented, that the policemen are supposed to run the risk of being shot. I didn't think that was the situation. So, I'd appreciate your explaining that to me.",
  "Would it be sufficient if the officer says, \"One, this is a drug gang; two, they don't let people into the house whom they don't know; and, three, they have guns\"?",
  "Well, how is that different from saying the entry is lawful, its only problem is, it was done without a warrant? I mean, you know, he's --",
  "-- inside the building; just, unfortunately, the means wasn't right. No warrant.",
  "The means wasn't right. No knock-and-announce.",
  "So, in fact --",
  "-- if they had a bazooka ­ -",
  "And the same would be true if what they had was a bazooka, and blew the house up.",
  "Yes, okay.",
  "Oh, I see your argument now. I think your argument is, most of the fourth amendment rules are really designed to prevent warrantless entries. But this one isn't.",
  "This one is designed to prevent damage to property --",
  "-- et cetera. So, let's not have the exclusionary rule and rely on the damage remedy where that kind of thing actually occurs, which isn't often.",
  "And if we buy that principle, suppose we were to apply it in the Miranda area -- purpose of a Miranda warning is really to make certain he can have a lawyer, if he wants one, for example. So, now we prove this guy wouldn't have asked for a lawyer anyway. All the evidence comes in. I mean, it's an interesting principle. I see the logic. But it seems to me to have a lot of implications that this Court has never bought.",
  "I can't think of any other area, fifth or fourth, where we've bought it. And I've tried to explain, in the question, why we haven't bought it. Now, you go ahead.",
  "It depends, of course, on whether you -- what you're doing. Now I see what you're doing. You're applying a kind of Palsgraf causation analysis within the risk -- I think that's what you're doing -- to saying it's outside, it's not a cause. You're saying -- you don't say it's not a necessary condition of his being there. It is. You do say, \"Well, the being-in-the-room-there is not within the risk, the reason for which we have a knock-and-announce rule.\" But, of course, that's a matter of judgment. I mean, you could say the purpose of the cause -- of the knock-and-announce rule is to keep people out of there without knocking and announcing. And if that's the purpose of it, it's right within the risk, right cause.",
  "You just are looking at the harms that his being there in that room without announcing might bring about. That doesn't mean that's why we don't have the rule. We have the rule to keep him out of there without announcing.",
  "So, you do --",
  "No, no --",
  "-- the difference is --",
  "All right, look, this -- you know, I'd appreciate your explaining this -- this seems to me what you're saying in your brief was the inevitable discovery. The inevitable-discovery rule, in my -- the way -- the way I've thought of it, and I'd like you to correct me if I haven't thought of it correctly -- to use a kind of analogy, it's like a primitive tribe that beats a tom-tom every morning so the sun comes up. Hey, the sun's going to come up anyway, and the bodies are going to be discovered anyway, in those cases. And, in Segura, the warrant is going to be issued anyway. So, it isn't a question of whether it would have been issued if they had behaved properly, it's a question of what will really happen in the absence of the illegality.",
  "Now, that's what I thought inevitable discovery here was, and, in the absence of these people entering the apartment illegally, they wouldn't have found a thing, because --",
  "-- there was nothing else in motion.",
  "Now, which --",
  "-- case is contrary to what I said?",
  "Segura?",
  "You have just said --",
  "-- that, in Segura, they would have gotten in, anyway, under a legal warrant that had nothing whatsoever to do with the illegal entry.",
  "The sun rose, anyway.",
  "Right.",
  "Exact --",
  "No. Well --",
  "-- not \"would have.\" Did.",
  "But you really want three things. You say we want the protection, number one, of there -- if you're -- if there's probable cause, that's the end of it. Number two, if you're trying to show there wasn't probable cause, you have to bear clear and convincing evidence, and number three, we also have qualified immunity. And I guess, number four, you have to prove the whole thing by clear and convincing evidence.",
  "It sounds a little bit like the person who has the overcoat, turns up the heat, you know, five or -- what about one?",
  "What about this one? And I want to know -- you simply say you need clear and convincing evidence that that was the motive and it wouldn't have been brought otherwise. And the existence of probable cause is a strong factor, maybe even a presumption, that suggests to the contrary. Now, have States and other places tried things like that without the world collapsing?",
  "So as far as you know, every State and every jurisdiction where -- and investigators if they don't have absolutely immunity, whatever -- in all those jurisdictions, nobody has ever said that even a constitutional violation, if there's probable cause, that's the end of it.",
  "Oh, I'm not focusing.",
  "I want to know --",
  "-- if --",
  "We have no experience. We don't know. Okay. As your -- as far as you can tell. The other question I have, which you might want to be brief about, is in looking through this record, as far as I could see from the briefs, they went ahead and prosecuted this man with only two pieces of evidence. The first evidence was that he tore some pages out of his notebook. But he introduced lots of notebooks to show he always tore pages out when he gave them to his secretary. And the second was that he told some witnesses be very careful and answer the question. Now, you know, he said a few other things, but they all seemed like the kind of things that people would always say to witnesses. Now, if that's the only evidence, except for the fact he owns the company, how is there probable cause here?",
  "Well, I didn't see any in the brief.",
  "I saw a lot about other people in the brief, but not about him.",
  "There are all kinds of things about other people.",
  "I didn't --",
  "I would like you to limit yourself to what I didn't concede. I concede it's his company. I concede that he tore some pages out of his notebook, and I concede that he told -- which he did a lot of times. And I concede that he told witnesses answer the question, et cetera. Now, is there anything else connecting him, not his company?",
  "If it is applied here, I -- I thought we just granted question one. There were two in the cert petition. I -- my notes say we just granted question one. And that means what they have is the screen. We're going to screen out absolutely any such claim as yours if there is probable cause. Now, the reason they advance for doing that is that in the -- a reason is in the absence of a screen like that, here's what's going to happen. Every single case -- not every one, but millions of cases or thousands, anyway -- involving companies -- well, companies are going to Congress all the time. They have ads all the time. They run into agency hostility all the time. The Hell's Angels? That's a pretty unpopular defendant. They say things all the time that investigators disagree with. And what will happen is in a vast number of cases the defendant will decide to bring a Bivens action, particularly if he gets off, and then we'll have discovery and we'll look into every statement that the -- the investigator made to the prosecutor, and before you know it, we have a nightmare of tort cases. And they say that's unfortunate to cut off a claim like yours, but after all, the prosecutors totally cut them off because they have absolute immunity. Now, we're saying at least let's restrict them, where investigators are involved, to cases where it turned out there was no probable cause, otherwise the criminal process itself will be seriously injured. Now, I take it that's the argument. I'd like to hear your reply.",
  "No, but are you going to -- I mean, is there any light you could shed? And that's why I asked in my question initially. I thought maybe there were some jurisdictions somewhere that -- that survive without the rule they want, but maybe I'm wrong. And -- and how do I judge this? I would be concerned. I don't -- the -- after all, these other cases you mentioned are civil tort cases and -- and they don't involve the criminal process. And when we get into criminal prosecutions, we have rules on selective prosecution that are designed to screen out all but the very worst.",
  "And that's what he's arguing for here.",
  "Leaving -- is there anything you can say before I give up on this? And maybe the answer is no. Is there anything you can say that would relieve my concern, which is completely practical at the moment, that if I decide in your favor, there suddenly are going to be large numbers of criminal cases where defendants will say the reason I was prosecuted was because of something I said? I was advocating motorcycles. I was advocating beating people up. I was advocating a congressional change of something. Many, many such cases. They'll all get at least discovery, and the prosecutor's door will become open to the world. Now, that's what's concerning. Can you say anything to relieve that concern?",
  "So he's a witness. Suppose his testimony --",
  "Suppose that the person is convicted.",
  "Yes. Can you bring your Bivens claim anyway?",
  "Really? So that's a -- but it's not a civil case.",
  "So you say that if he's convicted, after all, he may have been convicted but it may be because of the retaliatory motive.",
  "Yes.",
  "All right. So you -- so you say --",
  "-- if he's convicted, that's the end of it --",
  "-- whether there was a retaliatory motive or not.",
  "Oh, that's 1983.",
  "All right. So what he does is he --",
  "-- he brings his action and he says here I am 20 years in prison and I agree I'm guilty, but they never would have prosecuted me without the fact that they hate the Hell's Angels and they, in fact, criticize everything that we say.",
  "Because?",
  "No, no. He's saying I was -- I was guilty, but the -- all right. Anyway --",
  "I won't force you into that.",
  "I'll take basically virtually never if he's convicted. They concede that you could bring this kind of action if there's no probable cause. So we're talking about that range where there was probable cause but acquittal. That's what we're talking about here.",
  "Now, you're -- you're in the cases, but I'm -- I'm trying to pursue this. You've given me another idea --",
  "-- which is I would like to say one word about this. I'm sorry to interrupt your train of thought here, but look. I'm looking for other screens. Is there -- is there -- the particular point that they're worried about is you say we want to establish the retaliatory motive. That's what's worrying them because they see, in that establishment of the retaliatory motive, discovery, and discovery means you not only talk to the investigators, but you're also talking to, as a witness, the prosecutors to find out who said what to whom in order to see if you could establish that they didn't like the speech of the defendant. Now, can you give me any screen, not your case, but any kind of a screen that will help --",
  "-- weed out the sheep from the lambs --",
  "-- the goats from the sheep or whatever --",
  "-- in that area?",
  "But that -- that's true. I now think we're making some progress. I don't think it is quite a qualified immunity. I think it's possible and don't -- I'm putting words in your mouth and deny them if I am. One, he's convicted, no case. Two, no probable cause, everybody agrees there's a case. Three, now there is probable cause, but he's acquitted. Okay?",
  "In that circumstance, suppose you say we cannot even allow discovery. You don't even get to discovery on your retaliatory motive unless you show clearly, question mark, or unless you show likely, question mark, that the investigator not only retaliated, but he retaliated under conditions where any reasonable person would have known that what he was doing was contrary to the Constitution.",
  "And if you don't show that as a -- as a threshold, you don't even get discovery.",
  "I'd like to ask you one other question. Suppose you win on this on the grounds we've been discussing. What happens in the middle of the trial when a defendant wants to say the same thing? Can he avoid conviction by showing the same thing?",
  "What happens when the same claim is made in the middle of a trial that I -- whether I'm guilty or innocent? I haven't been convicted yet, and I want to show that this prosecution wouldn't have been brought in the absence of the retaliatory motive. Can he make that claim in the middle of trial or not?",
  "Well, no, he believes it.",
  "No, no. He's not acquitted.",
  "He's in the middle of trial and he wants to say --",
  "It's a criminal trial.",
  "He's in a criminal trial, and what he wants --",
  "No.",
  "They read our opinion which holds in your favor. Then the next thing is in -- in the criminal cases the defense lawyers say, hey, I -- I think my client wouldn't be here today were it not that the FBI had a retaliatory motive.",
  "Because?",
  "No, no, no. They're going to show exactly the elements that we write in our opinion.",
  "Well, it would depend. That's why -- really it's a question for Mr. Alioto, but I want to know chapter and verse citations. Pan Am and Grace meet before they set up Panagra. Of course, they talk about price. But what do they say? Suppose what they say is you, Panagra, have the power to set price. Normal. You, Panagra, have the power to set price but never below $14 a ticket. That wouldn't be normal. What are they trying to do there? They're trying to protect Grace. So I think a lot would depend on what they said in the preliminary meeting, and of course, what I want to know is this is a summary judgment motion where, as the other side pointed to particular conversations that they made which would say it's more like the second than the first.",
  "It may be, but still at some point they discussed it and I would like to know what they said.",
  "I mean, that's a surprising concession to me. We -- we found a -- a joint marketing company. All right? And the whole point of this is to set single prices. And you're saying when they -- and the venture, let's say, is approved by the FTC, the joint selling agency. The purpose of it is to set a single price to sell in France or something.",
  "And you're saying now we're going to go look at their prices that they set and decide if they're reasonable?",
  "Maybe there is.",
  "That's exactly right. I would have thought there's no competition because there are not two independent decision-makers.",
  "It has nothing to do with the prices that end up.",
  "Maybe you could explain to me how this did work. The -- the -- my understanding, which might be not correct, is we have some facilities that refine gasoline and there are some people who take the gasoline that is refined and they sell it to gas stations. Now, those facilities and those people now work for one hierarchy of officials called Equilon. Is that right?",
  "All right. So somebody has to say what price it's being sold at. Equilon's gas. Who decides it?",
  "All right. What is it?",
  "No. I imagine there are some human beings in Equilon called marketers, and those human beings in Equilon who work for Equilon would say Equilon will sell the refined gasoline to gas stations at such-and-such prices. That's normally how a company works. Is there something different about this?",
  "What is their view of it?",
  "The Texaco product being a product that comes out of refineries that previously belonged to Texaco or the Texaco product being gasoline that comes out of either refinery but is sold to stations labeled Texaco, or both? Which?",
  "All right. I could see how that could be a violation because it's possible that Equilon, if left on its own, would decide that its best marketing strategy was sometimes to set a differential. But now they can't do that because the two parents have agreed that they can't.",
  "Is that what happened?",
  "That would be rather like Pan American and Grace saying that, Panagra, charge whatever price you want, but above all, don't go below $50 because remember, we, Grace, have some ships out there and we want people to take the ships.",
  "Yes, that's right.",
  "Let me go back for a second. I'm just trying to get it clear. My -- my belief -- I've always thought that Citizens Publishing was a case where the district court said that the formation of the joint operating venture -- the basic formation, which involved a stock acquisition -- violated section 7. And then they created a decree. And the question was -- for the Supreme Court was whether the district court was right in holding there was a section 7 violation. Now -- now, maybe I'm wrong on that. I'll go back and look at it.",
  "If so, if I'm right on it, then what we're lacking from your point of view here is a claim that this whole joint venture is unlawful. And I agree with you. If you make that claim, I don't think the FTC can insulate it, I guess, unless there's something I don't know about, but you're not making the claim anyway. So here, unlike Citizens Publishing, we're -- we have to deal with this on the assumption that the joint venture is lawful.",
  "I don't see how to get out of that, but maybe you can tell me I can. But wait. Now, what I'm trying to get at is what precisely is your claim, given the lawfulness of the joint venture? One part I see. One part I see is that the people who are setting the prices are the board of directors of a venture company who represent Shell and Texaco. Now, that might run up against Justice Scalia's objection. But I want to sure -- sure I have all of them. That is, I want to know if there's some other claim you're making here in respect to an agreement between Shell and Texaco as to Equilon's prices. And if so, what is it and where is the reference in the record?",
  "That -- that might be. But I don't want you to forget the last part of my question, which for me was the most important, because I can read Citizens Publishing, but it's going to be tough for me to find in the record any claims that you make that the two companies have agreed as to price, like the Panagra example. That's why I gave it, to put it in your mind. So if there's anything like this that you're claiming, I'd like to know, or is your total claim that the activity of Shell and Texaco in setting the price of Equilon is to have their representatives on the Equilon board of directors tell Equilon what price to sell? Or is there something else? I just need to know. Is it just that, or is there something else in this case?",
  "Was it the board of directors that did that, or was it something else?",
  "Well, but that -- that sounds like the complaint that you're making. We have a problem, say, with -- with the newspapers or whatever it is. It's awfully dicey as to whether they should form this joint venture. It's going to eliminate a lot of competition. But now what you're saying is, look, at the very least, they should structure it in a way that the independent pricing decision is made by Equilon. Don't structure the pricing decision so that bit by bit, day by day it's made out by six people, half of whom represent Shell, half of whom represent Texaco. I can see that as an argument. This is more restrictive than necessary.",
  "Now, you get me that far, and now I -- I -- but I say why isn't that a rule of reason because you're really fighting the structure of the venture they come up with.",
  "Really? Suppose we walk into a department store. In the department store, we see three perfume counters, and there are three salesmen, one behind each. Do they compete in price? The answer is obvious. Of course, not. Of course --",
  "Yes. Three counters. They sell perfume.",
  "Of course, they don't compete. But do we know the department store has to be run that way? I mean, maybe some places it isn't. We can't prove it has to be run that way.",
  "Think of a -- think of a mall. Think of a bunch of shops. Maybe it doesn't. Maybe they could compete. The reason that -- the law says they don't have to compete is because the law thinks in general it's a reasonable way to run a department store without forcing your sales people to compete. And similarly, a joint venture. You can't prove they have to have the price set at a central place, but the reason they set it at a central place, because it's a joint venture. And that's seems to me what the cases are consistent with. You tell me which one is it.",
  "Oh, the answer is no. You're right.",
  "If that were a real rule of reason argument, did you waive the rule of reason here?",
  "Well, just as long as you have a minute --",
  "-- I take it that their point was, what you sort of said there, that -- that they had agreed -- sorry. Forget it.",
  "What did it rest on? What -- what is the district court's conclusion? The court concludes that the spillage occurred after the FBI crime lab received and tested the evidence. What does that rest on?",
  "Any reasonable juror would have had to have a reasonable doubt.",
  "All right. And you're saying yes, any reasonable juror would have had to have a reasonable doubt irrespective of what the trial judge found.",
  "You've mentioned -- in response to Justice Ginsburg, you didn't mention -- and perhaps it was inadvertent. If not, I want to know why not. I thought if you get through the gate, what you're going to say is the State should have given us evidence that they had that showed that Mr. Muncey had sexual relations with his wife the morning of the killing, and therefore, the semen that they found didn't necessarily belong to your client, but rather belonged to him. As it turned out, it didn't.",
  "So you're going to make that Brady claim.",
  "Any reasonable juror would have to have a reasonable doubt.",
  "How was -- how was that? I thought you'd go on to say how that -- how was it? I -- I read that Dr. Blake said this. He said, look, I -- there -- there are tiny little specks of blood on the jeans and we test them. They were tested. And they show that a certain enzyme deteriorated to degree X, and that's true of the test tube blood as well. Both deteriorated to degree X. But if you take fresh blood and splatter it, there will be no deterioration. So conclusion: the blood on the jeans came from the test tube. Now, you say that was discredited, but I didn't read anywhere anything that discredited it. What was the discrediting of that?",
  "Who said?",
  "Right.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Which meant what?",
  "Was incomplete, and what did the FBI man say it was?",
  "He -- he says it meant incomplete. And what do you -- what did -- what did Dr. Bigbee say it --",
  "Now -- I -- Dr. Blake, you just said, said that the word inc meant incomplete.",
  "And you say Dr. Bigbee discredited that by saying, no, it didn't mean that.",
  "It meant something else. What is the something else?",
  "Means.",
  "Fine. Now, all right --",
  "Fine, okay.",
  "They don't know how much. Now, I have on page 119, which they cite, of the transcript Mr. Pruden is talking to Mr. -- Dr. Blake. Would your opinion change, doctor, if the, quote, inc notation meant inconclusive rather than incomplete penetration? Answer: same difference. Question: so your opinion would not change? Answer: that is correct.",
  "But it would have been the easiest thing in the world for you if, in fact, you think that this is not true that enzyme GL706BX, contrary to what Dr. Blake said, had not deteriorated in the blood spot, do a test. Find out if it's deteriorated or not. Can't -- can't that be done? I mean, Dr. Blake in this part is reading his own report. His own report says the enzyme deteriorated in the spots on the jeans, and I see nothing here that says to the contrary. But if that weren't true, the blood is right there, and if it weren't true that it had deteriorated, I would have expected testimony, at the least, saying no, Dr. Blake, you are wrong.",
  "The blood did not deteriorate. The enzyme did not deteriorate. But there is no such testimony. Instead, you seem to be relying on the difference between the word incomplete and inconclusive, a difference that Dr. Blake says is inconclusive or incomplete.",
  "What -- what is the answer to my question? Because I do think it turns on this. A lot does. The trial judge sat there and said this is very important. Dr. Blake is quoting from something called part 5, which I thought was his report. And then the trial judge says, where did you get that idea? Where did you get that idea, that the -- that the enzyme wasn't there in -- in the jeans' blood? Where did you get it? And he says I got it from the FBI report, I think. He's not certain because he's remembering his own conclusion. He isn't quite sure where he got it from. And now it turns out that the inc when they -- it said inc, which he thought meant there isn't much enzyme there. And then they say, well, maybe it meant inconclusive. And he says, that wouldn't matter because I guess I took it to mean that too would show there wasn't much enzyme there. Both would come to the same thing. And now, if I'm sitting there and thinking, I'm thinking, well, either there is or there isn't this enzyme in the -- in the blood that's right there. Easiest thing in the world to prove. And if somebody is going to dispute it, the State will come back and say, no, no, the enzyme is there. But they didn't. So I read the testimony and I read the fact that you didn't dispute it with any evidence that's saying, yes, the enzyme is not there.",
  "He did? Where is that?",
  "Let's --",
  "It doesn't mean it isn't present isn't quite the same thing, is it?",
  "Another blood question because I -- the -- you make a point of the -- the sheriff having said, well, I -- I saw blood on the jeans. So I looked at the pictures and the pictures seem to have little tiny bits of blood, while a lot of mud. So I came to the conclusion that no reasonable person could think that that testimony really shows that the -- that there was -- there was blood from the -- from the victim on his jeans. Now, am I right about that? You're going to think I'm wrong, and I want to hear why.",
  "How could you have? It's so tiny.",
  "So overall, if -- looking at this -- and that's why I think the question about the weight to give to the fact finding is important. You think -- you have a theory under which he could have done it, and it's certainly possible in my opinion. But also you think, my goodness, if he did it, going and this luring of the woman to the creek -- you know, there's nothing else in the record that suggests he would plot in that way to do this. Nothing. The husband is away at the time from the dance. He could have done it. They are fighting. They could have done it. And if the luring theory correct, the motive was sexual, but the sexual physical evidence is from the husband, not from him. So the jury is brought into this on a theory that there is a sexual attack and the one -- by the defendant, and the one thing that seems disproved pretty much is that. And now we have two experts, Dr. Blake and Dr. Bigbee. And reading a page, which I hadn't read thoroughly until you pointed it out, I'd say they might disagree. They might disagree. And it's just not conclusive. So if you're sitting there, do you have to have a reasonable doubt when there's such strong evidence for both people? And -- and the part that's bothering me -- I -- I see what that district judge said on that one point, which he may have thought was peripheral but it turns out to be quite important about when the blood spilled. But if you look to the underlying thing and I think, well, maybe you're right, but maybe you're not right. And so how do -- how do I -- how do I do this? What's the -- what's the weighing? I sit there and think, my goodness, I don't know who committed this crime if I'd been on that jury. And could -- could a person sitting there reasonably come to a conclusion, my goodness, I know?",
  "Was there an allegation that the company, petitioner, or whatever it was -- that they violated the act?",
  "All right -- I guess that -- they must have thought that there were 15 or more employees because otherwise you wouldn't have.",
  "Was that denied?",
  "You denied it. Then they presented evidence, and their evidence was A, B, C, D, E. And I guess then you presented some contrary evidence, and you didn't present any evidence that he wasn't an employer. So I guess the odds are he was.",
  "And if the odds are he was, they win in the absence of any evidence.",
  "Then I guess maybe you could have appealed on that point. So did you?",
  "Then I guess it's waived unless it's jurisdictional. So we're back to the jurisdictional question.",
  "I never heard of a point on the merits that if you -- you think you're right. It's right on the merits, the element of the offense. You don't think they proved it, but unfortunately, you don't raise that in the appeal.",
  "And did you win or lose on that?",
  "How did they find him, by the way?",
  "-- how in your opinion?",
  "How did they find him?",
  "No. I'm not saying how did they? How in your opinion should the Post Office Department or the government have found him?",
  "So they find 13 people called Gary Jones or G. Jones in Little Rock. Now, what do they do?",
  "His wife is living in the house?",
  "Were they divorced?",
  "All right. So he owns the house. She doesn't. She must not pay any taxes, and she sees these letters coming from him registered and says, oh, they're his problem. That's basically what could have happened.",
  "If you have that kind of relationship with your wife, doesn't he have an obligation to watch what's going on?",
  "Did they leave a notice?",
  "Maybe this day -- in today's world, a registered letter is worse than ordinary mail. That is, I don't think -- my understanding is that the post office, unlike FedEx and unlike UPS, if you're not home, they leave a -- a notice, you know, and you check a box, and if you check the box, they'll leave it off the next day. We don't live in a -- my wife isn't home. My wife works. And -- and most wives no longer stay home to get the mail, and we don't all have butlers at the door. And you call up the post office. They say, oh -- if you get through to a human being, which takes 15 minutes, after you go through the menu, they say, phone the post office branch. And they say go get in the car, find a parking place, get in the line, and there's half a morning gone. Now, why is that a reasonable way? Why can't they do what FedEx does? This is a world -- husband works, wife works, two children are screaming. We've got to get them to the doctor. We have to have them at school. They have appointments all morning, and there's nobody home. So whatever they did with Mullane and said registered mail is fine, why isn't it unreasonable to use that system rather than use FedEx's system?",
  "Well, why not? It says calculated. It may be. Now, you tell me why it's so remarkable because I think I could take judicial notice of what life is like for most families in the world today, that they don't have butlers, et cetera.",
  "Wait. Let -- let them do that. Fine. Just have a little box and the person signs and says, tomorrow leave it at the house, just like FedEx does.",
  "See what you think of this. If in fact the letter --",
  "No, but skip that. What about -- you know, I was thinking precisely the same, but just with slight -- if you get the letter back and you don't have the FedEx rule, you either have to have the FedEx rule or send a letter.",
  "No, because the purpose is to get reasonably calculated to get notice, and in the world today, there are an awful lot of houses where nobody is home, you know, and there's no convenient way for them to go to the post office without giving up a certain amount of work. And so they say, forget it. If it comes from the lands division or something, who cares? Now, that -- I don't know how you'd know how many there are like that, but it's a question of reasonable calculation now to get the mail through.",
  "Is it a tiny minority --",
  "Yes, but redeliver -- you have to be there to sign for it again.",
  "All right. Well, then -- then the problem --",
  "-- I'm thinking -- what I'm thinking is that where -- where you're trying to reach a person, the means has to be reasonably calculated. I'm simply saying a means today is not reasonably calculated to reach the average person unless it gives him the choice of getting it when he's not home. All right? Now, there are two ways that could happen. One, you could modify that form or, second, the simple rule would be if it comes back undelivered, mail them a letter.",
  "I didn't say all that.",
  "I said do either. What I -- what I was thinking of, which isn't clearly I think coming across, is send it certified mail, by all means. Fine. He either has to sign and say, leave it off tomorrow, I'm not home, or if the post office doesn't make that available, then if the letter comes back undelivered, the person who's trying to send him notice has to send him an ordinary letter.",
  "If -- if it's the fact that you go to the Web site and that's what's supposed to make this what it was in McConnell which, by the way, we said was illegal, what they -- the first thing they're going to see when they get to the Web site, which I agree with you -- four times in 3 of the 12 sentences of this ad -- in 3 of the 12 -- it says, befair.org, visit befair.org, go to befair.org. And the first thing that they're going to see when they get to befair.org is a big headline in bold -- gold -- bold letters which says, Feingold and Kohl continue to support unprecedented filibusters of judicial nominees. So, in fact, if befair.org is brought into the picture, that makes this ad look much more like an effort to -- to defeat Senator Feingold than the ad that we considered in our previous case.",
  "Doesn't it?",
  "But the basic question I think is this. All of us -- or almost all of us who are here -- spent an entire summer reading through one of the longest set of opinions I've ever seen from the lower courts and going through a record that they had compiled over months reflecting 6 years of congressional effort. And what that record showed with dozens, hundreds I think, of examples was the basis for Congress' conclusion that there's simply no way to know whether an ad like yours is a genuine issue ad or isn't. And the only way that we have a hope of stopping rich people or corporations or labor unions from simply trying to defeat candidates by writing sham ads is to have the rule that we had. Now, you have a very good argument, but it's an argument that I heard right in that case. And we considered right in that case issues like yours, just ads like yours, ads that were even less sham-like than yours, if you want to call yours a sham -- I don't mean to be pejorative. But we considered all that, and then we used them as an example. And of course, it was close. 5 to 4 this Court said ads that are even more apparently neutral on their face than yours, Congress can impose this requirement. Now, what's different about your ad than the ads we put right in that opinion as examples of what we'd allow Congress to control? What's different now or are you asking us to go back only a year later and undo what we did?",
  "All right. So what is the test? Because I -- my vague recollection from a year and a half ago is that there was in that testimony political consultants who said if you really want to defeat a Senator, here's how you do it.",
  "Run an ad that just speaks about a group of Senators. It's plain that they're bad, and then put in some words that mention his name and everybody will get the point. They said that's even better than saying, vote against. And then our opinion said there is little difference between an ad that urges voters to vote against Jane Doe and one that condemns Jane Doe's record on a particular issue while exhorting viewers to call Jane Doe and tell her what you think. That was the opinion. So, now, what's your test to decide whether that's what's going on or whether this is a genuine issue ad?",
  "All right. If you can do this, can a labor union do it?",
  "And a corporation?",
  "All right. Well, then -- then we're back to -- I mean, I've heard this. This is very familiar music to me and I think you raise a tough issue. I just thought we perhaps had decided it. But the -- the reason that this was so tough was then these very, very wealthy individuals -- and since I once read through the list, I know who they are. And they -- they say, I'm going to give $15 million. You know, I'm going to give $15 million. So they hire this genius political consultant that's there in the record. And what happens is ads that look an awful like this, and this consultant says, hey, we have $15 million to pay for it from this one person. And they run them all over the country. And Senator after Senator is boom, boom, boom, boom.",
  "It becomes a question of motive and how do we know what the motive is?",
  "What is the difference with this? I mean, in my mind are possible as-applied challenges. Bread for the City. Never supported the candidate, worried about the hurricane in Louisiana. Vote for relief for New Orleans. Write your Senator, Senator X. Organization two. Never supported a candidate one way or the other, but has an issue they're always interested in, and they run ads cycle after cycle after cycle and they don't want to pull them just because October has come along. All right? Now, think of those organizations where I think maybe, sure, maybe they'd win their as- applied challenge. And here, you're not arguing it -- he doesn't have a right to bring it. You're arguing, of course, he can bring an as-applied challenge. He's just going to lose given our rationale. All right? Why?",
  "But --",
  "That's what I want to know exactly. I didn't think -- I thought Congress considered this impossible question. I thought that 7 percent figure was from a study, in fact, dozens of studies, where these people who were experts, quote, decided that about 7 percent of the ads like this one distinguishing between really interested in issues or interested in issues but, in significant part, defeating the Senator. In the latter, of course, it's campaign and it's part of the regulation of campaign funds. But they didn't think we could do it. They thought first they could do it, and then they told the FEC to go and produce a set of regs that would, in fact, try to screen out that legitimate 7 percent. Am I wrong about how the statute was supposed to work?",
  "Well, why haven't they done it? And I had thought also that they were supposed to control 527's by having regs or individual cases that would decide whether there was a mix of personnel between the campaign and the 527, whether they talked to people and planned their strategy. Have there been those regs written?",
  "In that --",
  "-- in -- suppose a person bought the stock at price 30 before any fraud took place, and then he holds it, and then the fraud, and then, subsequently, the word of the fraud gets out, the price falls a lot, and he sells it. Does he have a claim, under Federal -- ordinary -- you know, does he -- can he go into Federal court?",
  "No.",
  "Okay.",
  "Yes.",
  "All right, then - -",
  "-- then -- I see that -- then what's worrying me is this, that -- one thing worrying me is that -- let's take an ordinary buyer case. All right? And what happened is that the -- some buyers would like to bring a fraud suit in Federal court. They have to go to Federal court now. They can't go into State court. But they have a little brainstorm, or the lawyers do, and they say, \"Well, in any case where a buyer would have a claim, and we don't want to go into Federal court, there surely are going to be a class of holders that would also have the kind of claim you say.\" So, there we are, same actions, all in the State court, just happens to have found a different class of claimant. And there always will be such a class.",
  "Well, that's fine. And I - -",
  "-- and what I'm not facing, in the antitrust area, is what, it seems to me, on your interpretation now, would be, Congress passes a law, which becomes a futile act, because what they're anxious is - - to do is to get the cases in the class actions -- not all the cases -- but the class actions in the Federal court. And then, in every single case, or 99.999 percent, where we've kept this action out of Federal court, there's going to be a comparable action, with holders as the plaintiff, in a State court.",
  "Now, what -- that's a -- my concern. What do you - -",
  "Can you -- can you ease my concern there? Is there anything you can say that could ease my concern that we'll have the same set, that they'll just be in State court with a different class?",
  "And, by the way, my concern is not that it's a \"bad thing,\" in quotes. My concern is that it's hard for me to think Congress would have done something that wouldn't have had much effect.",
  "Right. That's just - -",
  "But why, in your theory - - suppose you're right. You're right. I assume that. You can have these holder claims. But why couldn't any buyer, who's -- has to go to Federal court because he has a buyer claim, just say, \"I'll bring the holder claim\"?",
  "Because?",
  "I know. But what I'm asking is, What's the logic of that? I mean, you're either right or you're wrong. If Congress didn't want to cut off the holder claim, they didn't. So, what's to show that they wanted to cut it off for some people, but not other people?",
  "Not in this suit.",
  "Not - -",
  "-- in this suit.",
  "So, if I'm both - -",
  "-- I bought it in May, in reliance on this ridiculous thing. \"Buggy whips make gold.\" I believed it. I bought buggy whips. Now - - we're now in December. And every month, they kept repeating it. And my claim is, \"Yes, I know, I bought it in May, in reliance, but I kept it in July, because I kept seeing it repeated and repeated.\" Do I - -",
  "-- have a claim?",
  "In the Second Circuit, I do not. But I want to know why not.",
  "I agree with you. But that's the trouble. Because, in order to make the Second Circuit's argument, you have to say the following, \"Congress couldn't have intended to allow people who have a buyer claim to make a totally separate holder claim, because that would gut the statute, and they wouldn't want to engage in a futile act.\" But now you're asking us to do about the same thing, when you talk about a person who doesn't have the buyer claim and you're trying to get us to say, \"Congress thought -- Congress thought an individual action there, their own separate action in the State court, wasn't good enough; it would have wanted to preserve the holder claim for them.\" Now, that's possible, but it requires me to think Congress is going through quite a few hoops here.",
  "I don't see --",
  "All right. I -- I have a question that you could just clarify a confusion. You want to bring into this case the question of whether or not anticipatory warrants are ever valid. I had a case in the First Circuit where I explained my view on that. I thought they would be reasonably described. So I don't know if that issue should be brought up here. Maybe. I can't figure out what issue should be brought up here. There's a Van Treska case that says we ought to read these things in a common sense fashion. All right? I read it. My common sense says I have a warrant here. It says nothing about anticipatory anything. It says you can go and search for any of 16 items, 14 of which are in his house well before the delivery. After all, he's had all this correspondence with these people about child pornography. They have terrific reason for thinking he might have some. And that's all it says. And then it says, is there probable cause for a warrant that says go in any time now and search for any of these items, including what will be delivered, if that's when you do it? I say I look at the probable cause. His probable cause is he thinks that another package is being delivered, and he's right to think it. Now, whether it is delivered or not doesn't add anything really to the issuance of the warrant. It might add to his personal confidence. But that's my common sense opinion. The common sense is the only question here is do they have probable cause to issue a warrant that allows them to search now, because that's what it says. So now how -- how, given that -- I grant you the Ninth Circuit went into all kinds of other things, but you explain to me, please, how I'm supposed to reach those other things and what I'm supposed to do, and why I'm wrong.",
  "Oh, no, it's not supported. It's specific. It says go to Jeffrey Grubbs' residence and then it has an attachment A which describes it with great specificity. And go and search for and seize the records and materials described in attachment B, and then we have 16 different kinds of items with great specificity. That's it. That's the end of this warrant, and that's what it says to do, and that's what he did. And then he has a different affidavit which gives him the probable cause for issuing the warrant I just described.",
  "Where does it say that?",
  "No, no. I'm reading the warrant. I'm not reading the affidavit. It happens to say that the affidavit is -- that that affidavit is -- it's in appendix A, appendix B, but it doesn't say anything about going in on -- where does it say that?",
  "It says -- mine says, you may command to search on or before April 27th for 10 days the person/place named and make the search in the daytime between 6:00 and 10:00. That's what mine says.",
  "Then there's an affidavit about probable cause. That's true. So --",
  "What's not stated?",
  "Where is there a limit?",
  "It is?",
  "What is it that tells us that? I just happened to read an affidavit where the -- the person says that he won't enter until this package is there, but there are a lot of cause I would think --",
  "Well -- well, he says in his affidavit he's not going to execute it until this package is delivered, but that -- if I read it in a common sense way, say, of course, he isn't going to because he wants to get everything at once. But after all, he's in the place. I would say there's a lot of probable cause for him to looking for 12 of these items which are there whether this package is there or not. Of course, he's not going to execute it till later.",
  "Maybe that's the answer.",
  "Will you -- will you just help me with this? Justice Stevens answered my question. The word anticipatory. The word anticipatory does suggest it isn't valid for a while. Nothing else in the warrant does. What am I supposed to do if I think there's adequate probable cause for issuing that warrant right now in respect to 12 of the things? And it's really pretty hard for me to try to understand what this warrant is about if I'm supposed to understand it, by reading through about 15 or 20 pages of small print and there discovering somewhere in the back of it some -- the post office says I'm not going to execute this until this other package gets there too. Now, that does make me nervous. That -- that supports you.",
  "I understand that, but it's not going to support you enough unless you connect this anxiety I'm having now about this being buried in page 28 of an affidavit when it's an important condition of the warrant, the only clue to that fact being the word anticipatory. And there we are. Now, you tell me why this anxiety, which is going to help you, is connected to something in the law.",
  "No, please don't. I start with an assumption that an anticipatory warrant is constitutionally valid. I start with that assumption. I'm assuming that the conditions have to reasonably describe. My anxiety is resting only on the fact that this warrant doesn't seem to be an anticipatory warrant but for one word, and to know what it's about, you have to look through 28 pages of fine print. Now, you connect that anxiety to something in the law.",
  "So you just want us to say, look, the Ninth Circuit is wrong. They're okay to have conditional warrants like this and there is no absolute rule you always have to have the triggering condition in. As to whether this is too confusing or not too confusing, send them back and let them figure it out.",
  "Could you just say a word about the -- the ditch -- sorry -- the word about the wetland next to a tributary that's separated by a man- made object like a ditch? Are there many such instances? It sounds to me like a scientific question. Are there many such instances where there is no transfer of water? And in those instances, is the presence of water in the wetland anything more than a coincidence?",
  "Insofar as it seeks to serve a purpose of the statute to regulate this.",
  "And where do I look to verify that scientific matter?",
  "No. I can't find any quantitative assessment.",
  "Fine. Now suppose we take a set, which you think exists as not the null set, of instances where there is no such transfer, which your opponents say is this case. Now what's the justification for regulating those? If it's simply flood control because water flows over the top and sits there, I guess you could say the same thing is true of any low depression, and therefore, the presence of water would be just a coincidence. Now, what's your -- the fact that they're wet doesn't have anything to do with it. It's the fact that they're next to a place that floods that has to do with it. Now, what's wrong with what I just said?",
  "Okay, I understand that. Now, what specifically, since I think this is scientific, do I look at to verify what you just said, namely that a wet depression, even if there's no interchange, has a lot to do with flood control that a dry depression wouldn't have? That's a scientific statement. Where do I verify it?",
  "I read them, and I -- I just perhaps wasn't reading them closely enough, but I just can't find the verification directly there.",
  "Well, what am I supposed to do with the case? I read them quickly. I don't necessarily pick up everything. I'll read them again. But if I don't find empirical verification for that statement, what am I supposed to do with this case?",
  "Fine. And where did the agency, in its many, many proceedings over the course of 35 years, say what you just said, namely that a wetland acts as a sponge? It's very plausible to me. It's just that there may be a need to drop a citation somewhere.",
  "Well, that's true, but -- so, you said it's conceded in this case? I thought, in answer to Justice Kennedy, you said something that -- I was surprised, if it's conceded. I thought it wasn't conceded -- tell me if I'm wrong -- that the States have water quality standards. Those water quality standards may or may not have something to do with point source discharges. They don't have to. They want water to be good enough for recreation. They want water without algae so there are more fish. They have a lot of things. And this statute seems to say the F- -- what used to be the FPC. I -- is it now FERC?",
  "Yes, okay -- used to be the Federal Power Commission -- tells them, \"You have to get approval to build your dam. And we're not going to give you approval unless you comply with State water quality standards.\" This seems to me to go back into ancient history, like 1920. And of course you have to comply. And so, isn't the purpose of -- is there agreement that it only concerns point discharges, or does it concern water quality standards?",
  "Really?",
  "In other words -- discharge from a point source, what is -- well, then EPA concedes you win?",
  "Well, fine.",
  "So, what's --",
  "-- the problem? So, they're saying, as I thought was true since 1920, that you're going to get your dam only if you comply with State standards, including standards about fish, algae, junk in the water, all kinds of things that might be put there by the dam.",
  "Right. And they're saying, \"Of course there is a discharge. The discharge is a discharge of water.\" Okay? The water runs into it. Now, that's enough for you to have to comply with the State standards before the F- -- FERC is going to give you a license.",
  "Now, have you got anything - - I've heard you argue about the word \"discharge\"; and you say \"discharge\" doesn't mean \"discharge of water,\" it means something else. And I think that's a very logical argument. Is there any other argument that you'd have, related to the purpose of the statute for the objective?",
  "No, no, but it doesn't -- it doesn't say -- it says they have to comply with State water quality standards, doesn't it?",
  "No, I thought -- it says that you have to get your permit. You have to be compliant with State water quality standards. Now, suppose a State has a nutty water quality standard. Doesn't EPA have some authority there to make sure that a water quality standard of a State, under the Clean Water Act, is -- makes sense?",
  "In other words, if a State were to say, \"Our water quality standard is the following. We never build a dam in our State, no matter what.\" Okay? Now, there's no authority in the EPA to set that aside as it not being a proper Clean Water Act standard.",
  "It has to be just a Clean Water Act standard.",
  "I'm not an expert on the Clean Water Act. Is that a proper Clean Water Act standard?",
  "No, this decision -- I'm not asking you about this decision. I'm asking you if a State, under the Clean Water Act, were to say, \"We have the following Clean\" -- now you understand what I'm --",
  "Does EPA, or anyone else, have authority to say, \"That isn't a proper Clean Water Act standard, however good you may think it is\"?",
  "Yes, I --",
  "-- I think the question -- maybe it just -- I don't understand, totally, how the Clean Water Act works, but I thought that what we're talking in this statute is a State rule that's called the State Clean Water Act rule. It's a creature of the Clean Water Act, isn't it? A water quality standard?",
  "All right. And, therefore, a State, I would think, that had some totally bizarre Clean Water Act standard might find that it had a standard that didn't fit within the scope of the Clean Water Act. And, therefore, it wasn't going to be enforced here. Is that right, or not right? Maybe the Federal Government will explain this --",
  "Just for the few of us who think the dictionary doesn't answer the case, is it possible you could say a word about why Congress would, or would not, have wanted, in effect, to incorporate all State water quality standards into a permission to build a dam?",
  "Also to protect fish?",
  "Suppose that everything in this case were the same. Everything is identical except what the court of appeals or the State supreme court holds is that we think under rule 403, which happens to be the rule in our State, the probative value doesn't warrant admissibility in light of the risk of prejudice. But everything else is the same.",
  "Now, in your opinion is that constitutional?",
  "Yes.",
  "Because?",
  "Well, what they'll say --",
  "-- if they want to build it out, is they'll say, look, there -- there is DNA evidence here. It's absolutely conclusive, and all that the light -- the -- the only doubt of the -- the defense has cast on it is they found that there was some opportunity that the police could have tampered with it. That's true of 60 percent or so of all chain of custody cases, and that is not sufficient to overcome what it shows. And therefore, it's not worth the jury's time and it'll prove very confusing to the jury. Now, why would that ruling under 403 be unconstitutional?",
  "Good. Now, that's what I want you to get to.",
  "And the key points that suggest that what I just said is not a fair characterization or a correct characterization are?",
  "Your point is that we're quibbling with the language. Certainly the language can't be right. I mean, Gregory is quoting America -- Am.Jur. It's totally right. And I don't -- in my opinion. I don't see how there's a problem. It's simply a way to prevent the defendant from confusing the jury with evidence that's not -- doesn't have high probative value. That's -- so we --",
  "They don't agree with that necessarily, but I'm taking that as a premise.",
  "Now, he describes this, the writer of the opinion, and if I hadn't been guilty of this sin myself, I couldn't criticize others, but he uses language that's absolute. He says, where there is strong evidence of an appellant's guilt, especially where there's strong forensic evidence, the proffered evidence about a third party's alleged guilt does not raise a reasonable inference as to the appellant's own innocence. I took that to mean doesn't tend to show that the appellant is innocent. And you do have to have when faced with guilt. It's not relevant if it doesn't tend to show he's innocent. So that wasn't the problem. The problem is that this sentence is wrong. You could have incredibly strong evidence that this person is guilty and it could be incredibly strong evidence that the other person did it.",
  "And so it should come right in. So what should have been there is the word automatically, but the word doesn't automatically show, but the word isn't there. It doesn't say automatic.",
  "And he goes on to write as if it isn't that automatic. And he then favors you because he says the standards set out in Gregory and Gay, as if they aren't different.",
  "But the language says they are different. So what do we do?",
  "And so what do we do? We get the -- we read the opinion literally, and moreover, that's why I asked it. If you look into the evidence, it looks -- you know, maybe it's closer than you might think. And if we start looking at the evidence of every case in the United States, it's going to be a problem for everybody. But -- but -- so what do we do? That's my question.",
  "What do I do in this case? I'm totally with you if I read American Jurisprudence and others as saying the following. Judge, there's a particular kind of evidence that really has a tendency to mislead the jury, that's that somebody else did it because they start trying the other person in their minds. So if you have a strong case that this guy did it, don't let them even introduce that evidence unless you have some reason to think it's really going to show this guy didn't do it. That's what it's saying, isn't it?",
  "Okay. Now, that gets us through Gregory. And the difficulty here is that the court went on to say something that couldn't possibly be true, which is if you have a strong case against this guy, never admit this other thing. That couldn't be right.",
  "And so now what do I do with that particularly? Because the other side has said, by the way, this is that case.",
  "The trial court's findings -- I read them the way Justice Thomas did.",
  "Why --",
  "Why, if we're going to catch some additional people, is that not sufficient? That is, why is it unreasonable, say, not for law professors, but business school professors, management consultants, to say, \"You have a lot of prisoners in California, hundreds of thousands -- I don't know, maybe more than 100,000 -- and we'll tell the Legislature that they can cut the terms, save money, release them early, but we want to have management checks. And the management checks are, you might be searched at any time. And we catch a few. And that's helpful.\" Now, if the --",
  "-- State decides that, what's unreasonable about it? \"They're\" --",
  "-- \"letting the people out earlier than they otherwise would\" --",
  "-- says the Legislature.",
  "And what's on the other side? The other side --",
  "-- is, you'd rather not have policemen search you, but your alternative is going to be in jail.",
  "But, of course, that's how it happens when he's in prison.",
  "But the reason ---",
  "-- the reason that people, I think, are saying that is because they have a lot of prisoners, they're trying to create a category of people who don't have to stay in prison, where they have no rights. And the real question is, can California, in trying to create this interim category, reduce the Fourth Amendment right in the way you describe?",
  "Of course they can't do it, but the justification is not that there is something bad about this particular individual or he's in some kind of limbo. The reason is that there's a policy tending towards release, which California has decided they want to introduce this as a condition. Now --",
  "-- and so, what -- and the question is, what's unreasonable about that?",
  "But what do you achieve by this system that you have that you couldn't achieve by a system that more carefully worked out the rules and conditions of a random search? I mean, rules, so that you avoid the totally discretionary element. And if you want to have management consultants, as I was imagining, have 'em. They're not just going to tell you, \"Go and ask anybody to search anytime he wants.\" They'll have a system worked out. So, why not at least require you to think it through that much? And, otherwise, it is unreasonable.",
  "But the reasonableness here would be unreasonable, unless there are some checks. We're talking about suspicionless searches. And you could have checks. But what about saying -- why is it reasonable to do it without any rule-based controls on the behavior of the police? That's the question.",
  "Okay. But what interest does it serve not to have some rules, manuals, regulations that help make sure it really is random, or help make sure it isn't harassing, or help make sure that it's serving the very ends that you hope to serve with the suspicionless searches?",
  "Your position is, it should be like any other civil case.",
  "You can raise it sua sponte, we've said, in exceptional circumstances.",
  "I don't know what they are.",
  "And if --",
  "-- they're not there --",
  "-- then the judge could say, \"You know, I'm surprised that you haven't raised statute of limitations.\"",
  "And then the lawyer for the State says, \"Oh, my goodness. Quite right. We'd like to amend.\"",
  "And we don't --",
  "-- have to decide --",
  "Why, just out of curiosity -- I'm not familiar with the actual practice of a lot of civil cases, but when somebody -- let's say the defendant in an ordinary tort case forgets to put in the statute of limitations, and the case is all tried and finished. At the very end, he says, \"Oh, my God.\" And now he goes in and asks to amend it under Rule 15. Do judges normally say, \"Fine\"?",
  "Because it's --",
  "District judges can't comment on the cases? And -- they suddenly raise something, curious about something; and, lo and behold, it becomes the subject of an amendment.",
  "That's a violation of -- I mean, what I'm driving at is, I don't really understand Rule 15 thoroughly, because I'm not a trial lawyer. And why do we have to decide every matter? Why don't we let the District judge free to run his trial and just say, \"Hey, we don't want to proliferate law. It's complicated enough already. Let's leave it to Rule 15, whatever that might be\"?",
  "Yes, but the other way means we're now going to have a new area of law. The new area of law consists of habeas law involving what is the equivalent of an amendment suggested by the judge to bring up a statute. That would be good, because West would then have five more pages, with a new keynote --",
  "-- and there would be more for lawyers to look up. Whereas, if you just say Rule 15, it's finished.",
  "Why, though, would we have a special rule in this respect for habeas cases? Same question I've had throughout. Treat it like any other civil case.",
  "All right, if it's not a special rule, then the answer to this is, just say, \"No, you don't have to raise it sua sponte. Moreover, you cannot raise it sua sponte, except in exceptional circumstances,\" cite the three cases that said that. And, as far as you're suggesting it to people, you could do it just as much as you do in any other civil case, no special rule. If they want to move to amend, fine, end of case, we did it in a paragraph.",
  "Well, the same with strike suits. You know, there are a lot of class-action strike suits and so forth that at least one group of people think are terrible and the other group think are great. So, you say, \"Well, we're going to have a special thing here for amendments in strike suits. Have a special amendment for some\" -- you know, why proliferate law?",
  "Well, I don't understand --",
  "No, but that's not that issue. That is, I think the question is, why is it that this statute doesn't simply provide the following route? Party A and party B enter into a settlement, and they say $10,000 is for medical and $90,000 is for pain and suffering. You, Arkansas, are out $50,000. Well, fine. You're in the case anyway. Sue the defendant for the remaining $40,000.",
  "And that's the end of it.",
  "Well, I have no idea about that. I'm interested in this nest of statutes, and the question I think that I would have is why doesn't the statute propose the route for a State in your -- in your position that I just said. If they have a good faith settlement and they think that $10,000 of this good faith settlement is attributable to the medical expense and you are out $40,000 -- $50,000, you can sue the other party. And if you're in the case, you just proceed with the suit.",
  "They can't settle your claim out from under you.",
  "No, but the --",
  "I want to go back to the Federal statutes and the State statute.",
  "Why isn't this discussion just suggest what the answer is to the legal question raised? The answer is, of course, you cannot get a hold of this money in the hands of the victim. The money in the hands of the accident victim is not your money. It is not medical expense money. It was stipulated that it is not. That doesn't leave you without a remedy. The remedy is to go against the causer of the accident and get the extra money that you think is entitled to you. The statutes say that literally, and why not just follow them?",
  "Well, so why -- why then is it unreasonable for the State to take this position, the one that the government took? They said, of course, we, the governments of State and Federal have only the right to attach the portion of that settlement that is representative of the medical expenditure. And where we're in on the deal, you'll all agree what that portion is, or there won't be a settlement and we'll proceed to trial. But where we're cut out of the deal -- and we shouldn't be because there's a duty to cooperate -- we will assume in that instance that it -- every penny of that medical expense is included in the amount that was settled for. And they say, given the statutes, that's a reasonable way of enforcing their Federal obligation to recover the money. Now, whether we agree or disagree with it as a matter of policy, what is wrong with their saying as a matter of law, we choose to interpret the words this way and implement the statute that way and we have every right to do it? Why don't they?",
  "But that's all consistent, of course, with their position. They say Congress delegated to us the authority to interpret the words this way. It is a reasonable interpretation of the words. We don't deny that you can settle for what you want. All we're saying is, where we're cut out, that that pile of money is deemed by us to include every penny of medical expense, and therefore we get it because we're not taking money that isn't medical expense. We are taking money that does represent medical expense according to our deeming rules.",
  "Now, what's legally wrong with that?",
  "Suppose, though, that were the rule.",
  "Just given your experience -- say, think of the generality of cases like this one -- would it be difficult for you, representing the victims, if the rule were that these statutes give the Government the authority that they want here, as I understand it -- the Federal Government -- which is to say you have an obligation to notify the State of the presence of settlement negotiations. Now, once you've done that, you've given them an opportunity to participate. If they have that opportunity, thereafter they cannot attach more than what are the real medical expenses, which could be a matter for argument in a settlement like this. But if you don't give them that opportunity, they have the right to presume that that settlement, which they knew nothing about, contains the full amount.",
  "Because? What are the practicalities of that? Why would it hurt the lawyers representing victims?",
  "It would just require a letter, certified.",
  "Yes, but it's -- it's relevant. And I'm trying to think through the practicalities of it, which you're more familiar with. Suppose that you win this. If you win this, then the defendant's insurance companies know that they're subject to further liability for the medicals in every case. And why won't they sit there and tell you at this settlement, hey, we're not going to enter into this unless you get the State involved so they sign off on it too? We're not going to just compromise some of our liability.",
  "I mean, it sounds as if we're going to get to the same place, that if -- if you prevail, probably the insurance companies will want the State to be involved or they haven't limited their liability, and if you lose, then we would have said that you have to get the -- the State involved.",
  "No, no. He's thinking in -- he sometimes thinks in the past. He's --",
  "He's translated it into 1974 or '72 real dollars.",
  "It's $200. The same question or $201.",
  "But I have the same question Justice Scalia had. I mean, the -- the question is you -- you have limits here of $100 per election. It's $200 per cycle.",
  "For a House. $300 for the Senate, $400 for a candidate for statewide office, including the Governor. That's $200 for an election for Governor. You throw in contributions in kind. You say that the political parties themselves cannot give more than that $200 for an election for the Governor. If we translated those into 1974 dollars, they're just the numbers Justice Scalia mentioned, and I would like to know why are they -- why does not give incumbents a tremendous advantage, that if you have the incumbent plus a newspaper, it's hopeless, that there's no way of spending as a challenger. In other words, why aren't these limits far too low?",
  "It's not going to help to say incumbents had a bigger advantage before. That is, the question is, what we're interested in is -- at least what I've written that I'm interested in, is at what point do these become so low that they really, as a significant matter, shut off the possibility of a challenge. And from that point of view, your numbers, which do not tell me the expenditures in a competitive district, and your numbers, which do not explain all the problems that Judge Winter had with these things, do not help. That's why I'm asking you the question.",
  "I want your answer.",
  "I'm not talking about the expenditure. I'm talking about the contribution limits. I and my friends have the following thought. We don't know who the candidates for State rep are, but we want a Republican slate or we want a Democratic slate. So we get all our $5 together, give them to the Democratic Party or the Republican Party in Vermont, and lo and behold, that party cannot give more than $100 in an election to a State rep, et cetera. Now, to the -- to the ear, that sounds as if a challenger or a slate of challengers or a party that wants to challenge is going to have a really tough time. So I want you to explain it.",
  "Just can I ask a technical question here?",
  "Just -- is -- is it the case or not the case that if I contribute my car to drive the candidate for Governor, let's say, between Burlington and Montpelier, and I buy the gas, does that count against the limit? Yes or no. I'm a volunteer and I buy gas and drive him back and forth.",
  "No. He drives.",
  "No, I'm not there. I lent him the car.",
  "Okay. I got the idea. If he does -- if I do, it's not. What about I have a coffee -- coffee. I wanted to get the line. I see it. Coffee. I want to have coffee and donuts, free donuts because -- and coffee for people to come in. Is that counted or not?",
  "No, no. It's $200. Coffee and donuts are expensive.",
  "Okay? Count it or not?",
  "Donuts and coffee. In other words, it counts as long as it's over $100.",
  "Under $100. Under $100.",
  "Counts.",
  "On your question -- the -- I'm sorry.",
  "I thought the --",
  "Wasn't it the State auditor?",
  "No, I know, but didn't we have in front of us a limit, which I wrote was rather border, that involved a State auditor campaign?",
  "I thought so, in Shrink Missouri.",
  "Which is not quite the same political volatility perhaps, but --",
  "I have a different question I'd like to ask you which I haven't heard addressed yet. On the expenditure limits, there is a case, Buckley v. Valeo, and the Court held in that case that expenditure limits are not constitutional. Now, whether I agree with that or don't agree with that, am I not bound by that? And insofar as you try to distinguish it, you've read what Judge Winter said about your efforts to distinguish it. And therefore, I'd like to hear why you think I'm not bound by a past precedent in an important matter, with which I may or may not have agreed at the time.",
  "You like this -- apparently you like this argument, although you say you're miles away from probate. Well, if you want to get into that argument, I guess the strongest argument against keeping it -- for keeping it is bankruptcy jurisdictional statutes shouldn't be interpreted differently than diversity jurisdiction or any other statute, and Markham at least recognizes that there is such a thing as the probate exception and that Congress implicitly adopted it, just as they did the domestic relations exception. Therefore, if we are going to find for you on this ground, we'd have to go back and overrule that case and a lot of other water that's flowed over -- under the bridge or wherever the water flows.",
  "And we ought to take what's given as given, whatever the true meaning of ecclesiastical courts having jurisdiction over certain probate matters or not in the 18th century.",
  "I guess what you're going to hear in 5-10 minutes --",
  "-- you might as well deal with it now --",
  "-- is that the inter vivos -- a -- a claim for a -- the Texas tort of interference with inter vivos gift, according to Texas law, must be brought at the time of the probate proceeding. And for that reason, it is bound up with probate, and for that reason, they didn't have jurisdiction.",
  "All right. Now, let's suppose you're --",
  "-- suppose they're right about their interpretation.",
  "And the strongest case for you on that is?",
  "You said this Court has repeatedly said. So what --",
  "But this is all -- this has nothing -- I mean, I -- you have the total differently -- different understanding than I do of this case, and I did read Judge Carter's opinion. I thought that case simply held that because your clients had interfered with an effort by J. Howard to give quite a few millions of dollars to Vickie Marshall -- because of that interference, they had committed the tort of inter vivos interference with a gift, and they had to pay damages. Now, they said a lot of things by way of what the evidence was. Indeed, they did say, as you point out, that your clients forged three pages of the will. But that was simply evidence of their bad intent, and it did not invalidate anything in the probate proceeding, as I read it. Now, what have I said that's not right?",
  "I'm not interested in what he said. I'm interested in what Judge Carter said --",
  "-- because that, it seems to me, is -- and what is it that Judge Carter did that was wrong in this respect?",
  "That -- that sounds to me like a matter of preemption, but -- but -- or not preemption but, you know, res judicata. But just out of curiosity or -- because I think it is relevant, did the Texas probate court have in front of it the documents among the lawyers that the district judge, Judge Carter, relied upon in showing that there was an intent to create the catchall trust?",
  "It had all those documents.",
  "Why? Why? Why? That is to say, what the finding is, is that there was a different matter, a catchall trust, and he told the lawyers, go draw it up so I can give gifts to her, the increase in the value of my property during the 13 months we're married, do it, and they never did it. Now, that seems to have nothing whatsoever to do with the GRAT trust or with the will. It just happens that those are evidentiary, what went on there, of what likely happened with the catchall trust. So I don't see why those are necessary. I don't see why they're more than evidentiary, and I don't see whether or not those are barred, those particular facts have anything to do with this, as far as jurisdiction is concerned. Now, explain to me why I'm wrong.",
  "Well, that's just one of the things.",
  "Among other things that went on were they hired private detectives to go after her, to keep her from the bed. I mean, you've read that opinion and there are like about 30 things in there. And I grant you that one of those things is the fact that three pages of the living trust, according to the judge, were created after the event of that trust and slipped in without his knowledge. I mean, it's quite a story.",
  "And -- and so I -- but as I read it, there were many, many, many things involved here, and this is just one of them. So how can Texas say that you have to prove this particular one as -- as opposed to proving a lot of others?",
  "I don't think they're going to impose a constructive trust, are they? All -- all they're going to say is pay her the money.",
  "They're going to say it because they make a finding that through a whole variety of various devices, all of which were listed, that J. Howard, who wanted to give her money through something called the catchall trust was prevented in about 15 ways. And even if you're right that there's a Texas finding that those three pages weren't slipped in, well, how do we know? Maybe it was a valid GRAT trust, but if only they hadn't tried to isolate J. Howard from contact with her, J. Howard would have figured out what had happened before he died and he would have told his lawyers, hey, cut this out. Do what I want. Revoke it. But all that is just hypothetical. I'm just using that to show you why I think this is evidentiary not a matter of what the elements of the crime are -- or the elements of the tort are.",
  "What's the cite on that that I -- that I need for --",
  "You're saying you can't bring an inter vivos trust -- an inter vivos -- interference with an inter vivos gift action in Texas unless you show that a will, for example, is invalid.",
  "By the way, in Texas if you have to go through all this probate stuff and everything, and they want to claim 15 years ago my mother gave a ring to my cousin who stole it, is that precluded to bring that tort action when the person who, you know, was supposed to get it finds out about it?",
  "So -- so, in other words, if it -- when the guy is 2 years -- 15 years old, he gives a ring to somebody, and now he dies at age 93, and when they find out about that incomplete gift at age 15, nobody can bring a lawsuit anymore. You have to go to the probate court.",
  "Yes, but did those documents -- did those boxes contain the key documents --",
  "-- about the catchall trust?",
  "On the merits, I think that their claim is -- take company A and company B. Both are located in Toledo, both hire a certain number of people, have a certain payroll, have a certain amount of property, and have a certain amount of business. Identical. And they're charged a tax. And now, what -- company B, when it's thinking of building a new plant or make new investment in machinery, if it goes to Wisconsin, it will discover it pays less taxes on all those things that were already in Ohio. And, therefore, the people who sell land or machinery in Wisconsin are discovering it isn't being bought, because that old tax, which really had nothing to do with this new investment, is now less because of the new investment. So, that hurts businesses in Wisconsin. As I understand it, that's their claim. And if I've got it wrong, I'm sure you'll correct me.",
  "All right.",
  "Well, then I'm probably wrong.",
  "So, that -- that is true, and then the effect of that is that firms that now do business in Ohio won't build their new facility in Wisconsin, because they like the lower tax bill in Ohio. And that hurts businesses and others in Wisconsin.",
  "You were saying they have no harm? I think they're pointing to that harm.",
  "Well, what is the harm --",
  "-- they think -- well, they can tell me. All right.",
  "Have you found any other instance in which -- any case -- there was a absolute lack of standing, prudential standing, but the Court waived that, because it was prudential and not constitutional?",
  "Which one?",
  "If you have --",
  "-- dog license -- dog license costs $10, but you have to pay 20 if you invest next time in Wisconsin.",
  "By the way, we're not going to do it that way, we're just going to say you pay half.",
  "No, no.",
  "No. But, you see -- but my point is --",
  "-- separate tax in Ohio, and we're going to double it, though, if your next investment is in some --",
  "-- other State.",
  "Correct. Now, all we do is, we say, \"We're not going to double it. You're going to pay the same. But everybody invests here, pays half.\"",
  "May I just clarify one thing on that?",
  "I take it your reason was that in Bush v. Vera, the Court said, of course, they can use race to prevent retrogression. Of course, they can, but if they do, they have to create a compact majority minority district, not an elongated majority --",
  "That's the -- that's the argument. I have to go back and look at Bush v. Vera.",
  "Oh, well, that's -- but now, in fairness, I think to the red brief argument -- you've read the red briefs.",
  "Yes. They are filled with factual information that in their opinion shows that previously the Democrats had gerrymandered this much worse, and that what -- this was an effort to create a balance. That's what their view is. Now, I want to know really precisely what is your response to that argument.",
  "Now, what do I look to in the record to verify what you just said?",
  "What is the answer? I mean, you've read the briefs. The obvious reply to that is there are many, many districts in the United States where African American voters have a big influence on the Democratic primary.",
  "A lot. And there are a lot where the Democrat wins. So if your principle is accepted, says the other side, that means that any district that's drawn here to favor the Democrats can't be changed, but all the ones that favor the Republicans can be changed. Now, if that argument is right, it's hard for me to accept, but that's a neutral principle of constitutional law. So I want to see what -- what your response is to that.",
  "Obviously you're not. That's why I would like --",
  "-- you to say what specifically the answer to that argument is.",
  "All right. So I -- I wrote an opinion, as you know, where I was agreeing with you on that, and I wonder if -- if then the thing to do would be to say, yes, indeed, a legislature can redraw a map to prevent a minority of the voters electing a majority of the congressional delegation. But when they do that, there has to be some reasonable assurance that it works the same way for both parties. I mean as a standard. I thought my standard worked before. I guess there wasn't that much agreement, but -- but --",
  "-- from the point of view of -- of taking that standard, which you agree with, I'm glad to say, apparently, and modifying it to be sure it works out the same way for both.",
  "Would a -- I'd like you to elaborate a little because, as I understood your claim, particularly in response to Justice Stevens, you agree that if 23 violated section 2, they can't make up for it somewhere else. You agree they can't make up for it particularly when their only way is for political reasons. But your argument is they never violated -- that 23 as redrawn didn't violate section 2.",
  "And the reason that it didn't violate section 2, I want to know, is what? Because you have the three preconditions which seem to be met, and then you have some kind of -- it doesn't violate section 2 from De Grandy if, despite the preconditions, there is some kind of overall proportionality. But all that is rather unclear in my mind, and I want to know what your view of it is.",
  "What -- district 24. I take it -- it's a long walking stick is what it looks like. And the -- I take it you're saying when I go back to the record here, I'll discover a finding that the district court made. They said this was not an effort to use race to district. Is that right? And one of the reasons that you think that is because, although it's not a circle, it's not absolutely terrible. That -- that is a supporter of the ultimate conclusion they did not use race. Is that right?",
  "Then -- then if I -- if I -- so I have to go back, look at the record, and see what it says. Now, suppose I came to a different conclusion. Then you might still win on this point if the rationale for using race to district was because we want to avoid a section 2 violation. And there, you would lose, however, because you can't use that rationale unless, according to Bush v. Vera, the district that you draw is, in their words, reasonably compact. So, again, you'd have to say that this district that looks like a walking stick is reasonably compact for that other purpose. Is that right?",
  "Yes, so I understand that. But -- but if -- if I -- you have two bites at this apple with your reasonably compactness. One, you want to say it wasn't -- you think this proves it wasn't to use race in the first place, but if I'm wrong on that, it's still a legitimate use of race because it's a reasonably compact effort to conform with section 2.",
  "And is there anything I can look to to decide what reasonably compact means in that second --",
  "Yes, 25.",
  "On the -- either it is reasonably compact or it isn't. If it is reasonably compact, we never get into Bush v. Vera, whatever, the Vera case in the first place. And if it isn't, you can't get out of it by saying it's an effort to cure a section 2 violation.",
  "Is it possible it violates section 2, the following? We look at the map as it's drawn. We ask the question, is there a way to redraw this map so that, say, the minority group has a more significant influence for their bloc voting, et cetera, et cetera? Gingles. Answer: Of course, there is. It's the old way. And you say, well, why didn't you do it the old way? Well, the only reason you didn't do it the old way was pure politics and that that isn't a sufficient justification.",
  "I was thinking of district 23.",
  "Well, you started out by saying that the purpose of the Confrontation Clause was to keep out the accusations made out of court, but I would have thought that was the purpose of the hearsay rule. And if that's the purpose of the hearsay rule, how does the Confrontation Clause differ?",
  "Ah, so it's not the purpose of the Confrontation Clause to keep out out-of-court accusations. Only some, and which, and what's the rule?",
  "I know you do believe that, but I want to know why in terms of the purposes of not the hearsay --",
  "-- rather the confrontation.",
  "How would you do that? How would you do that forfeiture?",
  "How would you do that? I'm interested in that because I thought it sounded good. Then I thought about it. I thought to have forfeiture, you'd have to show that this defendant, in fact, forced the wife not to testify. It's a crime to do that. So you'd have to prove another crime against the defendant in order to prove the first crime. And I thought perhaps that doctrine is not very practical. You tell me why it is.",
  "I understand that. My point is that to prove the wrongdoing would probably be even harder than to prove the original crime. All we know is the wife isn't there.",
  "And we suspect that she's afraid of her husband. He may have offered to cut off financial aid, said goodbye, no money, or he may have done worse. I'm just saying you're telling us that because the prosecution can prove that in court and only then will it be able to introduce the testimony given beforehand by the missing wife.",
  "How does it work?",
  "This is true, but the reason I thought spousal abuse cases are relevant --",
  "A reason I thought they were relevant is just what you're about to address. They're evidentiary of the problem that exists when you bring something within the Confrontation Clause. Prior to Crawford, even though it was within the clause, if it fell within a well-recognized exception to the hearsay rule, it could come in. So you could bring in co - conspirators before the conspiracy ended. You could bring in, for sure, excited utterances. You could bring in all kinds of things that now, no matter how reliable, you have to keep them out.",
  "And so that is a problem that you have to address in respect to drawing a fairly narrow line, and I want to know what that narrow line is with spousal abuse and other cases in mind.",
  "What do you say in that respect about the blue brief's reference to 17th century cases, the hue and the cry where someone went out and told the sheriff, help, I'm being beaten up, and that that evidence wasn't admissible?",
  "Well, rather than build that into the law, it might be wiser to deal with Justice Kennedy's case, in whatever system we come up with, explaining it. So what is your full explanation of the diamond necklace?",
  "That may be hearsay. That may all be hearsay.",
  "When, for example, there's an undercover agent, a law enforcement officer -- let's think of the mafia or the Ku Klux Klan reveals himself. One of the co-conspirators during the ongoing conspiracy switches sides. But no. He doesn't switch. He's still in the conspiracy. Makes a whole lot of statements. Those are all inadmissible, though they'd come in now because they would be in the furtherance of the conspiracy.",
  "Yes. There -- but there's -- in other words, I've got your definition and all I've tried to do is create a circumstance where, while it fits your definition, it's made by a person that is in the conspiracy. So I make him undercover, the law enforcement officer.",
  "But known.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "So you're saying my hypothetical could never come up. What I'm trying to do is -- it seems to me that your hypothetical is going to take statements that would come in that are pretty far removed from the prosecution that are in odd circumstances, are not just a testimonial at all in anybody's thought, but it keeps them out.",
  "He's known.",
  "It's continuing.",
  "All right. You've convinced me I have a bad hypothetical.",
  "You go ahead.",
  "What's -- what's worrying me on this is -- I'll tell you my concern without the hypothetical. Crawford wrenches the Confrontation Clause free of the hearsay rule, and therefore, testimony -- it might be testimonial even though it is not hearsay or falls within an -- doesn't fall within an exception. You understand what I'm saying. Fine. Now, you come along with a suggestion, and what struck me immediately was that, wait a minute, can't I easily think -- apparently not easily -- can't I easily think of instances where it would be testimonial but it isn't an accusation made to a policeman. And conversely, can't I easily think -- not easily -- of instances where, well, it would have come in, but it was statements made to a policeman maybe years before, maybe about this, maybe about that? Maybe it's a hospital record. Maybe it's a business record. There are all kinds of exceptions to the hearsay rule, and they don't run parallel to the test you've just given. That's what's worrying me. What's the test?",
  "What about present sense perceptions? That might be a good one.",
  "Apparently 803(1) has the first exception --",
  "-- to the hearsay rule. It's present sense impression.",
  "So on the phone, somebody is describing very calmly -- very calmly to the policeman the terrible crime that he sees going on in front of him. Now, I gather from the fact that it's an -- that it is a exception, that now in the Federal courts that would be admissible.",
  "Yes. No. Forget the -- yes. Every day of the week, they come in. Is that right? Present sense impressions. It's here as the first exception to the hearsay rule.",
  "Well, there it is, 803(1).",
  "I mean, and you practiced this for years. See. I mean, you're an expert in this, and I -- I think my impression -- just tell me if I'm wrong -- is it's 803(1). It says a present sense impression comes in. So I guess it does unless I'm --",
  "So if we adopt your rule, a person calls up on the phone and says, I'm here at the baseball game, there's a terrible crime going on in front of me, and he describes it --",
  "-- to the police officer, that no longer could come in.",
  "No, no. I wasn't --",
  "-- trying to reduct you out of --",
  "I just wanted to know what the facts are about the rule. I was just -- that's what I was asking.",
  "Do you have a second choice rule? I mean, we have Professor Amar, who has pretty formal criteria.",
  "We have the rule that you just enunciated, and I don't want, before you sit down, to -- I want to find out if you have an intermediate position, a fall-back position.",
  "So what's the test?",
  "Resemblance to?",
  "Which were?",
  "All right. This is helpful, very helpful to me, but I'm trying to see what you're driving at. I'm imagining the woman saying, he's hitting me, he's just hit me. She's in tears. That's excited utterance. Not. Then suddenly the officer, 5 minutes later, says I've heard what you said. Let's reduce it to writing. Here's the formal affidavit, et cetera, that is -- but to prevent Mr. Friedman's problem, we're going to have to say as to the second, that is even if you don't have the formality, you see, everything is the same, but not the formality. Now, how do we do that?",
  "I'm making the distinction you're making between she's in tears, excited utterance or res gestae, around there, just what you were talking about. Now think of the second affidavit -- when he reduces it to writing. That's different, calmer, clearly motive to testify, et cetera. Fine. But now what Mr. Friedman pointed out is if we make it turn solely on the formality, the piece of paper, the stamp, et cetera, they'll just avoid that. So we're going to have to sweep into the second the circumstance where everything is the same but the formality, and that's where I have the difficulty.",
  "Why? Because he might be interrogating with no idea at all primarily in his mind of later court appearance. He wants to find out if there are guns in the house. He wants to find out if there are other people in the house. He wants to find out if somebody is being held captive. He wants to find out if these are the same people who did some other crime that's immediately taking place, what's the relationship. There are all kinds of interrogation. You're saying that all that interrogation by a policeman can't come in under the Confrontation Clause.",
  "What about the resemblance idea to get around your problem? Of course, it's not purely formal. It's purely formal, plus those things that resemble what's purely formal.",
  "Listen -- it's purely the formal criteria, plus anything that's the same. Now, same is vague, but it's no vaguer than a lot of other things floating around here today.",
  "So what do you think of that?",
  "That doesn't --",
  "That isn't the point. I think the point is, at least for -- I think point is who is going to decide whether there was some justification here. And I read this memo. I thought that the DA had a pretty good claim, that the police didn't do anything wrong. And there's also an argument they did. All right. So, who decides that kind of thing? A constitutional court or a State, under its protection laws or whistle-blower statutes?",
  "And the argument that you have to face, I think, is that it will be very disruptive to have constitutional judges dive into this, when there are so many other remedies, and where the very act of their doing it, allowing discovery, allowing court cases, allowing juries, itself, will no protection at all, I want to hear what you have to say as to what the standard is to separate the sheep",
  "The only cases that would go into court are cases where the employer says, \"I have no reason at all for firing him\"?",
  "But that's because --",
  "-- they think they have a better claim on the other part. I mean, if -- even if will come along, and they'll say, \"Of course we had a good reason for firing him. One, we didn't fire him for that reason. Two, if we did, we would have been justified,\" or whatever. So --",
  "-- if your standard is, the only cases that go into court under the First Amendment are cases where the employer says, \"I had no basis for doing anything to him whatsoever,\" then I think there will be few such cases, though you might convince me that that standard --",
  "-- wouldn't do any harm.",
  "Say it's a --",
  "-- borderline case --",
  "But what he has --",
  "But the argument that I think people are worried about, against you, is, you have a case -- it's actually a wonderful example. Your client thinks that, in the affidavit that the sheriffs gave supporting the warrant, they didn't tell the truth, because they said that whoever was looking into it, you know, said there was a private driveway and that there were tire tracks, and there were no tire tracks, and it wasn't a private driveway. The other side says, \"Yes, it was a long road, but sort of like a driveway, and the edge of the -- of the driveway was broken down, and that's what the sheriff's deputies were referring to.\" I found it a dispute on both sides.",
  "Now, if, in fact, he's being disciplined for that, the other side is telling you he has a lot of remedies, he has a variety of remedies. Go to the bar associations. Many States have laws, the statutes that protect people under these situations. And why suddenly go to a constitutional court to get remedies? And if you do, there are going to be thousands of cases less good than yours, and they'll So, now, what's your reply?",
  "I guess that - -",
  "But you told the -- you said, judge, if you in fact hold that this claim 13 satisfies section 112 and is sufficiently precise and specific and concise, if you hold that, then the claim would violate Morse?",
  "And you argued that specifically? And so your problem -- I guess that you said that. I mean, you quote it in your supplementary brief on page 6.",
  "And it's the language.",
  "That's what it said. It didn't say Morse. It said Diehr.",
  "Dier incorporates Morse.",
  "As was my understanding.",
  "So your complaint about the paragraph on 17a is that it did not deal with that argument.",
  "But I imagine they'll say that simply mentioning it in an oral argument is not enough to get us to think seriously about it.",
  "I didn't understand the definiteness doctrine. I mean, all these things in 1854 I guess weren't so clear. But I think the precise claim in Samuel Morse's case was the use of the motive power of the electric current for making or printing intelligible characters. That sounds absolutely definite. Anyone can understand it. I thought the problem there was that although anyone can understand it, you can't claim something as broad as that. You must intend to claim something narrower. And insofar as it's narrower, it isn't precise. So insofar as it's broad, it's too broad, but definite. And insofar as it's narrow, it's not there, but indefinite. Okay? Precisely the claim that they raised before the Federal Circuit and precisely the claim -- with appropriate citations, and precisely the claim in respect to which the Federal Circuit said nothing.",
  "Yes. And we here apply the correlation to any homocysteine test, any one here, any one in the future, any one that any mind might impend. What's the difference?",
  "I apply electricity to all methods of putting down letters with electricity. I apply the correlation to all methods of creating a homocysteine test.",
  "Oh, no, I'm not talking about going beyond it. I just thought that line between definiteness and 101, 112, 101 is not quite so clear as I would have thought, because it sounds to me relying on the 1854 case of Samuel F. B. Morse, they're making the same kind of argument and, indeed, you translated Morse as a definiteness 112 argument, and yet it seemed to me that's the kind of argument they're making.",
  "Now what do you say in response to my question to the Solicitor General?",
  "That they thought it was obvious, that they thought that obviously the problem here with this particular claim is that it doesn't say specifically which tests this principle is meant to apply to. So it isn't definite enough. It never occurred to anyone that if you tried to apply it to every test, it was somehow a valid patent, so they made it in the definitive context. Because for 154 years, it's been clear that you can't take a principle of nature like electricity and simply make a claim for all uses of electricity to create letters. That's their analogy. And they thought by referring to the cases and by referring to the failure to point out definitely what the tests were this applied to, it violated 112 because otherwise, it wouldn't be a valid patent, which everyone in the patent field would know. That's at least, I think, what they're saying.",
  "You're onto something, to me, that is absolutely fundamental. You have millions of doctors and scientists and computer people who are working extremely hard to think of useful ideas and if you don't give them an incentive, they may think of less.",
  "And they're all useful. At the same time, if you patent all of their ideas, including very useful mini-micro principle ideas, you will establish monopolies throughout this country beyond belief and it will be difficult for people, without paying vast amounts of money, to use their useful ideas. So what principle do we use to separate the scientific idea which can't be patented from the process which can be? I thought that the claim was settled by Morse, Flook and Diehr. Now would it make sense -- you can answer any part of this question you want.",
  "Would it make sense to send this back and say, look, at least address their argument? You can answer any part of that.",
  "Does that fall within it? I mean, I can't resist pointing, as one of these briefs did, the phrase anything under the sun that is made by man comes from a committee report that said something different. It said a person may have invented a machine or a manufacture, which may include anything under the sun that is made by man. So referring to that doesn't help solve the problem where we're not talking about a machine or a manufacture. Rather we are talking about what has to be done in order to make an abstract idea fall within the patent act. Now, sometimes you can make that happen by connecting it with some physical things in the world and sometimes you can't.",
  "And if you have a clear statement other than Diehr, Flook, Morse, which draws that line properly, let me know.",
  "If you have an employer who says, I promise to give $200 a month per worker to a fund, which money will go to pay their health costs when they're sick, that's plainly covered.",
  "And now suppose it's exactly the same, but instead of his paying $200 a month, he pays $200 to an insurance company in return for a promise that they'll pay precisely the same amount to the employee if he gets sick. In your view, that's not covered.",
  "Of course. It's not meant to be.",
  "I want to know how you are going to answer my hypothetical.",
  "I'm not -- I'm asking you --",
  "-- to answer my hypothetical please. If in fact -- you didn't want me to repeat it?",
  "Then what is the answer?",
  "In your view, is my hypothetical covered or not?",
  "It is not.",
  "And therefore, if we accept your interpretation, then all those employers who, instead of contributing directly to health funds, instead buy insurance policies to do the same thing, will discover they do not have the advantage of the fifth priority.",
  "Now, if they are covered -- if they are covered, as I thought, then what is the difference whether the employer buys a policy whereby the insurance companies pays for their health benefit when they're sick or pays for their accident benefit when they have an accident at work?",
  "Well, that's -- that's a better way to put it. If -- if that's right, then what you're saying, as I understand it, is in those cases where an employer goes to an insurance company, they give a contractual promise to pay the employee when he gets sick in return for a premium by the employer -- and it's a health benefit or a vacation benefit, the most typical thing -- you're saying all those -- all those -- there's no fifth priority. They don't -- can't take advantage of that.",
  "There -- there are two parts in my mind to this. The question is what is the difference between a workmen's -- worker compensation and health benefits. I agree with you, so far tentatively, that that difference can't lie in the nature of the contract providing the benefit. Now, I know they'll want to argue the contrary, but put that to the side. If it doesn't depend on that, it depends on the difference between workers' compensation and health benefits. And you want to say there isn't enough of a difference there, though they argued the mandate makes a difference. Of course, you could mandate health benefits too, and I don't think that would matter. But if you're right, what about a -- a long- term contract for bottled water for the workers?",
  "Well, actually -- this is -- to me anyway, this is an important point because at some point you have to draw the line between the things of a kind that workers might bargain for and things not. Now, if that's where we're getting there, the history of workers' compensation may cut the other way.",
  "Because? What's -- what's the principle I'm going to use?",
  "Well, they're doing that to get a standard.",
  "And I'd like to know what your -- they're trying to use that as a basis for separating the bottled water from the workmen's comp from the health benefit. And they're saying here's an example of where Congress put the workers' comp on the same side as the health benefit. Now, that's their approach. What's your approach to the standard? What rule or system would you use from deciding which insured-for or paid-for benefits count as the plan and which ones don't?",
  "So if, in fact -- if, in fact, the State legislature mandates certain health benefits, then the plan that provides those benefits would no longer qualify.",
  "But is that --",
  "-- so here? I want to know, if your client had known about this law or gone to a lawyer and said, \"What do I do now?\" wouldn't the lawyer have said, or would he have said, \"Just leave. Leave the country, quick, before you're caught. Now, when you get back to Mexico, you can apply and point out you've married an American citizen, and then you'll be able to come in, in all likelihood.\" And if I'm right about that, the Act does not attach new consequences to old behavior, it attaches new consequences to new behavior; namely, the act of staying within the United States, when you could leave.",
  "I mean when this particular --",
  "-- provision was passed --",
  "-- a week later, he goes to a lawyer, and the lawyer says, \"You'd better get out of here fast, because if you're caught while you're here, you're married now, and you won't be able to take advantage of that. It would be terrible. So, go to Mexico. Then there is no problem.\" And if, in fact, I'm right, you see what I'm -- I find your argument excellent on the first part, but so is the Government's. So, I think there's a kind of wash there, so I'm looking to the second part. And there, you're just said, it attaches new consequences to old behavior. So, I'm asking you, if it doesn't attach the new consequences to old, but, necessarily, plus new behavior -- namely, remaining.",
  "Well --",
  "Being -- if you get married -- if you're outside the country and you marry an American, you're married to an American and you can't come in for 5 years?",
  "As a result of --",
  "-- the initial deporting order.",
  "So, his choice is this Act or -- in which case, you never can get back, if you're caught -- or go to Mexico, wait 5 years.",
  "Ten to 20 years?",
  "No, no. I mean, he either stays in the United States --",
  "-- in 10 to 20 years --",
  "Is caught.",
  "If you lose this --",
  "-- case -- if you lose this case, then his choice would be: stay here, get caught, and you never can come back, or 10 to 20 years?",
  "I see.",
  "Or go to Mexico, and you can come back in 5 years.",
  "Okay.",
  "I -- but I -- I didn't understand this now. I guess I don't. Forget the '94/'96 periods.",
  "Suppose it stayed the same throughout. Would you say, then, that someone who came illegally into the country, and he's caught, and he's married to an American, there's no possibility he can stay, no matter what, no matter how appealing? Is that the answer?",
  "I'm -- yes, but you're talking technically.",
  "Maybe there's --",
  "-- some other way you could stay. What's the other way?",
  "Yes.",
  "Which was what?",
  "All right. Well --",
  "-- then it comes to the --",
  "-- same thing. So, that -- what I'm thinking is that a person who is here, and they marry an American -- all right? -- they marry a citizen. Now, before this Act was passed, there was a way that if they're really good -- let's assume they're the best human beings around, and the Attorney General finds all that out, and everybody knows this is like a saint, and they say, \"Okay, you behave well enough. You can stay.\" Now, after the Act is passed, all those relevant actions have taken place in '86, long before. Now, there's absolutely nothing they can do. All they can do is go home. And now I've learned that when they go home, they will be told, \"You cannot come back, no matter what, for 5 years.\" Now, that's a pretty harsh consequence, to separate yourself from your family or have your family come to a foreign country. So, if I think the first part of this is a wash, you have a great argument, they have a great argument, and I look to the second part, does it attach new consequences to old and unchangeable behavior? I say, yes, it sure does. Now, why doesn't it?",
  "Ah. So, then, you're saying the answer I got before was wrong --",
  "-- that, in fact --",
  "-- I now have my client in, he's come after IIRIRA has been enacted, and he says, \"I've heard about this in IIRIRA, and what in heaven's name am I supposed to do?\" And the lawyer says, \"Get out fast, next train. Go back. And if you get across that border, you're safe. Because at that point, you can apply; and you're a saint, and you've been married, they'll let you right in, because they'll find out.\" That's what your view of the law is.",
  "It must be the one way or the other.",
  "No, in -- and this is not -- I was saying the question --",
  "-- would be, is this Act attaching consequences to old things that you couldn't do anything about? And you're saying, \"Not entirely. You can. You can leave. In which case, you'll be no worse off, except for the train fare.\"",
  "Okay.",
  "So, a person who just leaves voluntarily, having reentered illegally, cannot come back for 5 years, no matter what, under 1156(a)(6)(B).",
  "That was repealed.",
  "Yes.",
  "All right.",
  "They're saying that it's special here. If you look at the language of the text, the language talks -- is almost identical to the language that was in CRIPA, or whatever is -- you know, CRIPA. Is that the correct pronunciation of the concatenation of --",
  "I'm think -- oh, well, I guess it isn't -- unlike IIRIRA, it is apparently unknown.",
  "There was a predecessor act, and the predecessor act used this same language, just about. And what it said was, \"Judge, you may require exhaustion of such remedies as are available.\" And, given that language, nobody thought that was a procedure default rule; it just meant the judge, if there's a remedy available, can say, \"Prisoner, go do it,\" in an appropriate case. And all that happened here, if you look at the history, is, they changed the \"may\" to a \"must.\" And all the people that wrote in were writing in about that. Nobody dreamt, nobody said, nothing suggests, that what Congress intended to do was to bring in the procedural default aspect of it. And there would have been a lot of objections if they had. So, that's the argument the other way. Now, I'd like to know what do you have at all that overcomes what I just said?",
  "Before you get to the purposes, you quote in your brief -- the only legislative history I could find here -- you said that Congressman LoBiondo referred to McCarthy, which you find relevant, because McCarthy indicated that the word \"exhaustion\" would carry along with it a procedural default rule. So, what did the Congressman say?",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "All right. So, I take it from your answer he didn't really say anything helpful to you --",
  "-- except to refer to the name of the case --",
  "-- in which case, what we have on the -- all right. Is that right?",
  "Well, wouldn't it go -- wouldn't that apply -- that principle apply to reasonable -- unreasonable remedies? You have to have a reasonable remedy. I don't see how you can decide to import half of administrative law and not the other half.",
  "It's not just a filing deadline. It's the whole procedure. I mean, Rehnquist -- Chief Justice Rehnquist, in McCarthy, lists a bunch of reasons in cases where the process subjects the plaintiffs to unreasonable delay, to an indefinite timeframe. And there could be others. The normal thing is, you excuse exhaustion where the exhaustion requirement was such that the person couldn't reasonably comply. Now, either you do want to import that into this statute, or not. And if you do not, then I think you're asking us to say we import what goes normally with the word \"exhaustion,\" where it favors the Government, but not what normally goes with the word \"exhaustion\" where it doesn't.",
  "Why did they use the word \"until,\" instead of the word \"unless\"?",
  "Yes, all right, but the thing I don't understand in this, which is hard -- Is there any answer to this point from the other side? What this statute does seem to be about is exhaustion, which normally does carry with it the notion, \"If you don't exhaust, you lose.\" Dozens of cases say that. And it seems to make it a requirement, not leaving it to the discretion of the prisoner. Well, your interpretation leaves it up to the prisoner. If the prisoner doesn't want to do it, he doesn't do it. He pays a price, he has to wait, but it's up to him. Now, that's the point that is bothering me the most, frankly.",
  "Why not?",
  "No, no, but, I mean, that's a -- that sounds to me like a verbal gimmick, to tell you the truth. If he waits, and he waits to past the deadline, sure, he'll put a piece of paper in, but it'll be denied.",
  "Isn't that true? So, I'm not counting he puts a piece of paper in, and it's -- in my way of speaking, if what's left for him to do in the system, because there is this deadline, 6 months, it's passed, it's now 9 months, so he says, \"Here's my paper. I'm exhausting.\"",
  "Denied.",
  "Okay. Now, I'd say that's -- means he isn't exhausting. He's failed to exhaust, as I'm using the term.",
  "All right.",
  "Now, I want to get rid of that argument. Use my --",
  "-- terminology --",
  "-- and now answer what I am, frankly, bothered by the most --",
  "-- which is what I just said. It leaves it up to him.",
  "Not necessarily.",
  "That -- that's what I find interesting. It might be, if you're representing the interests of defendants here, you'd love this to have the procedural default rule, because it will end up with the Federal judges all over the country systematically reviewing the exhaustion procedures -- or the -- yes, the remedies in the prisons. And where those remedies are not right or unfair or too short or have other problems with them, the judges will say, \"You can't have this kind of remedy. If you want me to apply exhaustion principles, you can't do it.\"",
  "And, therefore, we'll get a force for improvement. And that's, I thought, maybe why nobody wanted, really, to bring it up.",
  "So why -- let's see. They go to the prison library what? Once every couple of weeks or what? Once a week?",
  "One -- one visit per month. And -- and how often do they go to the prison library?",
  "It's ordered.",
  "Yes, what it says -- that's what -- it says, to review legal materials, one at a time may be let out of his cell and is escorted to a mini law library in hand. All right. Why couldn't you have a -- if he wants to see the newspaper in that mini law library, why couldn't there be a copy there, only the parts that are consistent with the censorship policy, just like a news of the day.",
  "Is there a security reason or is --",
  "Is there a security reason when he's there in leg irons looking at the books, the law books, in the mini law library?",
  "But is there other -- are there other bases? Because so far your argument is they're so bad that you might as well give them whatever they want because it won't matter.",
  "Now, I'm parodying it, but you understand why I don't think it's your strongest for the reasons said. But are there others which might be a little -- you had other arguments --",
  "No, no. It has nothing to do with the law. I understand your argument. Your argument that you have made is, at the very least, you can't say that this deterrent effect is that big a deal. I mean, now, there were other reasons justifying it. They said, for example, if one --",
  "Yes, and they made a big case in this. It's on 188 in the appendix.",
  "And they made a major point. They said that with the newspapers, they set fires, they throw feces. They use them as a spear, and then when asked, why couldn't you do the same with library books, or couldn't you do the same with paperbacks, they said, yes, it's possible, but it's less likely because of the size of the document. And we don't have to forbid everything. We just forbid the things that we think are particularly likely. Now, what about that one?",
  "What is it that I should read then in respect to what's actually bothering me? In Turner v. Safley --",
  "-- the Court says we resolve, when a prison regulation impinges on an inmate's constitutional rights, which it does here, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests. That standard is necessary if prison administrators and not the courts are to make the difficult judgments concerning institutional operations. And that's where I think it's difficult to balance this case. If we were to decide for you, are we going too far in interfering on what the prison administrators should be doing, or have they gone too far? Now, if I'm supposed to look at this record and try and make up my mind, which I think is about that question, what do you want me to look at?",
  "Well, I'll read the briefs. I have no problem with the briefs --",
  "I'm rather surprised at your answers because I was thinking you want to draw a rather clear line between where fraud is at issue, and only fraud. Proximate cause, case A, the fraud does nothing but lowers the cost of the firm; case B, the fraud is something that directly is aimed to raise the cost of a particular specified competitor. I see a apparently don't.",
  "No, no, it's not nebulous. It's absolutely clear. In the one hand, you are targeting a particular defendant to raise -- a particular competitor to raise his costs. In the other hand, you are taking an action that simply lowers your own and, therefore, equally will hurt any competitor, whether there's one or a million.",
  "No. If you had my test, you'd win this case. my point is that I think that there -- with all candor to the Court, there are some difficulties in handling win if that's how that's the Court wants to read the case.",
  "No, no. I don't want to give you a win --",
  "on a theory that --",
  "I mean, if that's so, then go back for a minute, please, to Justice Souter's question. It doesn't concern violence. I'm -- certainly if violence is involved or a direct action I'll assume you'd win. But the line I think that he drew very heard it, is a -- a fraud where the person defrauded is not the competitor and the only effect of the fraud is to lower the cost of the person who is doing the fraud. Now, if that's so, you either draw Justice Souter's line or you don't. If you do draw Justice Souter's line, then you stay out of the thicket. If you don't, you'll have all the problems that were mentioned, that there is no way to distinguish between one person, two persons, 100 people. There is no way to know whether the lower cost of the defrauding person did or did not lead to the shift of sales. There is no way to know, indeed, whether it's a rent, in which case prices didn't fall, or whether it's actually some kind of ability of the competitor -- of the defrauding person to take over the market. All those things that are issue in antitrust cases and totally unsolvable are suddenly imported into RICO, where if you really want to bring a case, bring an antitrust case, and at least people know how to face it there. That's -- that's the -- that's the kind of claim -- that's the kind of problem that I think you're to it.",
  "But, I mean, you see the point. The point is I don't see how it's administrable in a law, particularly in an economic context --",
  "-- where people who are interested in making money are prepared to say, look, we want to make the money. We'd like to get rid all our competitors, and then we start distinguishing between they'd like to get rid of all of them. No, only five. No, one. And does that make a difference in whether you can bring a case or not? I frankly don't see --",
  "Where it would come from would be it would be an alternative way of getting to, say, Justice Souter's test, and it couldn't -- I agree with you -- depend upon whether these are within the realm of people who are relying. But suppose you had a fraud where nobody had relied. You see, it was really a failed fraud, and you can get that under Federal law.",
  "Or suppose you have a fraud where the only party that had relied was the RICO. And the strong argument, I think, would be where that's the case, cut it off because of all the indirect accepting it. I'm just trying --",
  "-- to put it in what I think of as a strong form.",
  "The place where it comes from is the idea that if, in fact, you have these monetary crimes, white collar kinds of crimes, money is at issue, and no one is hurt. You can proceed against a person under Federal law --",
  "-- where no one is hurt. hurt. You don't want the possible class of plaintiffs to spread out into every competitor, into competitors' class to people who are closer to any possible injury where, for example, there really wasn't any injury at all. So, I mean, that's the kind of argument being made for it, not that you find the word reliance somewhere in the statute.",
  "Well, I just tried to say where -- where it was. It's a -- it's a way of -- with proximate cause, and that's how I think you have to deal with it. You have a case where there was reliance.",
  "The government.",
  "So what you'd have to say is why that's good enough.",
  "But if you have to --",
  "-- approximately the same procedures, what's the point of having a military commission? I think that was implicit in Justice Scalia's question. So, if you go back -- Revolution, Seminoles, Modoc, Mexican War, World War II -- why have them?",
  "It's hard for me to --",
  "-- see that with the language of this, because the language that you're talking about refers to \"such standards.\" \"Such standards and procedures\" refer to the preceding paragraph, which is standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph (a). That military order is an order of August 31st which talks about procedures. It's not the order that sets up the commission, which is an order issued the preceding November. Rather, this language seems to mean what it says. But even if it didn't -- even if it didn't, wouldn't your reading raise a terrifically difficult constitutional question, if not this case, in cases that are pending right now, where prisoners in Guantanamo are claiming that they have not yet had the CSRT hearing, they're claiming, one or two, \"We had it, and we're still here. We won, but we're still here.\" They're claiming, \"We don't want to be sent back to Qatar.\" And they're claiming, some, that they were tortured. All right? Now, if we could avoid that case with your interpretation here, and avoid that constitutional question -- we can't avoid it. So, my question is, one, How is what you're arguing consistent with the language I quoted? And, two, How could it, if we accepted your interpretation, possibly avoid the most terribly difficult and important constitutional question of whether Congress can constitutionally deprive this Court of jurisdiction in habeas cases?",
  "I still don't see the answer to my question, which had two parts. As to the language, (a) which is what's cross-referenced, refers to Military Commission Order Number 1, August 31, 2005, or any successor military order. The order, as I understand it, that's created the commission by the President, is an order which was November 13, 2001, not a successor to 2005. But leaving the language aside, what I'm mostly interested in, because I think your interpretation inevitably creates it, is, what is the answer to the claim that it is not constitutional for Congress, without suspending the writ of habeas corpus, to accomplish the same result by removing jurisdiction from the courts in a significant number of cases, even one?",
  "I listed four sets of cases that I don't see how you could possibly shoehorn into E(2) and E(3), even if you are able to shoehorn this one. And my language was designed to make you see how difficult it is.",
  "I listed four that I don't see how anybody could shoehorn into that.",
  "No, the argument --",
  "-- the other side -- if you want the argument, the other side is, there are several hundred cases already pending. And, therefore, if we accept your interpretation, we know we have to reach the constitutional argument. If we reject your interpretation, since all these cases, several hundred of them, are already there, it might be: new ones won't be brought. But, of course, \"new ones won't\" might. And, therefore, what is your answer to --",
  "-- the question that this is unconstitutional -- if not here, in other places?",
  "Can I put the --",
  "-- that issue in -- don't -- ignore my question, which is the same as Justice Kennedy's, if it doesn't help. I'm trying to focus this. And, in my mind, I take their argument as saying, \"Look, you want to try a war crime. You want to say this is a war crimes tribunal. One, this is not a war, at least not an ordinary war. Two, it's not a war crime, because that doesn't fall under international law. And, three, it's not a war crime tribunal or commission, because no emergency, not on the battlefield, civil courts are open, there is no military commander asking for it, it's not in any of those in other respects, like past history. And if the President can do this, well, then he can set up commissions to go to Toledo, and, in Toledo, pick up an alien, and not have any trial at all, except before that special commission.\" Now, I've tried to summarize a whole bunch of points for you to get at, as you wish.",
  "Does it -- does it -- does it define the contours, along with other relevant international sources, of the meaning of the statutory words \"laws of war.\" He's being charged with a violation of the laws of war in both statutes, like -- what is it? -- 2240 -- 2441, in Quirin. To get the meaning of that term, courts looked to other law.",
  "Is it the President, and not Congress, defining the content of the law, the criminal law, under which a person will be tried? Isn't there a \"separation of powers\" problem there?",
  "Suppose in the 18th century -- I'm not an expert in this. You're more of one. But suppose you had an absolute classical trust. It's the -- it's a trust for the benefit of the fifth grandchild of the Duke of Hamilton. All right?",
  "The trustee. And this trustee, going to the fifth grandchild one day, lends him 1,000 pounds, and he takes his security. The grandchild says, 4 years from now my great, great Aunt Margaret is likely to die and she's going to leave me my ring -- her ring. And the -- the trustee says, repayment. Yes, okay, done. Now, the great, great grandchild being a bit",
  "All right. He keeps the ring.",
  "All right. My question is could the trustee go to the equity court and say, there it is. It's in his pocket. Equity court, I'd like you to order that ring to be given to the trust. Can that happen?",
  "It depends. They couldn't get that?",
  "What does it depend on?",
  "The great grandson's intent he thinks -- when he'll get the ring, he thinks he'll give it back to the trust but -- at least -- yes.",
  "In other words, a court of equity could not have taken the ring?",
  "Like -- what it is it? You have to go back to the 15th century or the 16th? Is there -- is there a case? There must have been cases like that.",
  "Well, then suppose there are no other creditors.",
  "There's no other creditor.",
  "See, he goes -- there's nobody. All there is is the ring. Nobody else makes any claim to it whatsoever. Now can the -- can the trustee get it?",
  "No.",
  "No. He has no money. All he has is the ring in his pocket.",
  "All right, fine. Then where do I look?",
  "What do you think -- claim, you know, traces itself to a contract certainly doesn't -- doesn't cause it to cease to be an equitable declaring a trust in exchange for some money, and he declares a trust. Equity will enforce that trust, but the trust is based on a contractual commitment. Right?",
  "If -- if you understand as I -- that four people on the Court took a broader view that Congress didn't want to get into this matter, and restitution is restitution, whatever it means now; but five took the historical view. Now, if we're in the historical view, which we are, that was the majority. At that point, I want to know how you think this case should come out. What words should be written there if I'm thinking of the next case? And after you win this case, if you do, the next case will simply be precisely the same as yours, but the lawyers, having acted 5 minutes quickly -- more commingled and all we have is exactly the same with every future case that you have, and now the pension that it should get back in good conscience. No doubt about it. A promise, good conscience, and they can't get a penny. Now, you have the interest in telling me what words this Court should write, other than overrule Great-Western, that will prevent that result from coming about. I would like to know your --",
  "In other words, you don't care about these other --",
  "Well, I was actually interested in what your response was because I thought those other cases.",
  "The question --",
  "Suppose they don't do it. They don't do it. They violated the treaty.",
  "We assume that. Then the question is, what is a proper remedy?",
  "And I'll assume with you, for the moment, that -- that the treaty has to be read as saying you have to have some kind of appropriate remedy, but it doesn't say what kind. So why isn't it an appropriate remedy that he was given a lawyer, if he wanted one, and the lawyer either told him about the right to talk to the consul or he didn't. And if he didn't -- if he did, he found out, and if he didn't and it mattered, maybe that was ineffective assistance of counsel. So if we have ineffective assistance of counsel claims to take care of the tough cases where it really did matter, doesn't that suffice under the treaty, or does it?",
  "Oh, he's stuck without an attorney. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt that the treaty was violated. I follow you that far, but now you're talking about the domestic court's power to do what there is an international obligation to do, which is to create a remedy. I'm not sure why that remedy need always be suppression.",
  "I think sometimes it could be something else.",
  "Why -- the ultimate question I think is the one Justice Alito asked. I think, as I read the ICJ treaty, we're under a legal obligation in this country to provide a reasonable, effective remedy. And why isn't that a reasonably effective remedy? Treat it, you know, like any other problem where the client should have learned something and he didn't. If the lawyer is there, this is the obligation. The lawyer tells him, and if the lawyer fails to tell him, then that's ineffective assistance in an appropriate circumstance, or if it isn't, it isn't. But that's a good remedy. What's wrong with that? And the other obligation is, counsel, you have to raise this issue as soon as everybody learns about it, in which case you might be out because I don't -- he's certainly learned about it by the time he was on appeal, and as I read your brief here, he didn't raise it on appeal either.",
  "Yes.",
  "He said -- when I read that motion, which I'll do -- so it's in the record?",
  "Where?",
  "Do I have it in front of me somewhere?",
  "Okay. Now, in other words, he did raise it. Okay. If he did raise it, then maybe he would be entitled to this relief.",
  "But is -- my general question is, is that approach sufficient under the law?",
  "Say, in an appropriate case, I can't find a rule for every case -- but that our obligation, as interpreted by the ICJ, is that we have, as the law of the land, a treaty that says you tell the person about his Vienna Convention right, and if you don't, now says the ICJ, there has to be some kind of -- of effective remedy. Now, assuming that's the law of the United States, why isn't this approach an effective remedy?",
  "There -- there are rules on conflicts of interest too, you know. So following our normal rules, is there any country, is there any international law, is there anything in American law that would suggest, in respect to any kind of significant procedural failure, that the State has to do more than we're just talking about?",
  "And if so, what is it?",
  "Anywhere. I -- I just think --",
  "-- think for our most severe violations, we provide an approach that you tell the lawyer. The lawyer brings it up. If the lawyer doesn't bring it up and it's important or there's a conflict of interest or something terrible is going on, normally you'd say that's ineffective assistance. And I just wonder if that approach doesn't work here.",
  "Well, I'm not interested in, now at the moment, whether it does or does not work. I want to know if there's any country or anywhere else in American law or international law where people have gone further than that. And there might be. I'm asking it seriously.",
  "I'm not talking about a procedural default rule. I'm talking about the system that was suggested.",
  "Yes, the procedural default rule would mean you get procedurally defaulted if you fail to bring it up, but I think you might say if you failed to bring it up the first time that the lawyer knew about it. And if it's his fault for not bringing it up or he should have known about it, then he's out -- the client. But if it's not, he's not out.",
  "Have there been courts that have held the contrary? Have there been courts that said when somebody wasn't notified and they sought to obtain some remedy for that, that even though the treaty has been violated, you have no remedy under our system?",
  "Which are -- which is the best authority abroad for you that -- where they say, no, we're sorry, we give you no remedy, even though we violated the treaty?",
  "That's a holding? They -- they held that?",
  "So we have a lower court opinion in Canada, and you -- and they have a lower court opinion in Australia. Is it fair if I come to the conclusion no one has ever really decided this?",
  "All right. If -- then if that's fair, is it fair also for us to say that -- that we have to take this treaty, since it's self-executing, as if it were written into American law?",
  "Is that fair?",
  "Okay. If that's fair, then suppose you're coming -- suppose the treaty had said -- and it's part of American law.",
  "It didn't say this, but suppose it had. You have to inform this individual, and if you don't inform the individual, you have to give him a remedy so that he is not prejudiced thereby. Now, if it had said that and the State or the Federal Government refused to give him a remedy and it's part of American law, wouldn't we have to say that American law, Federal law, treaty law requires you to do that rather than what you're doing, if it had said that?",
  "Okay.",
  "And once we're there, it seems to me what we're arguing about is not this metaphysical thing about rights. We're arguing about what the treaty says. Now, if that's so, I -- I think we're back to where we were in the last case and say does this treaty or does it not, as a matter of American law, say that the person is entitled to some kind of remedy. And our problem there is that the ICJ has said, yes, it does, but it doesn't mention it, but it does say that you cannot have procedural rights that do not give full effect to the purpose of -- of this section. So where are we?",
  "Well, the -- the thing is, I found stronger the other way, which you can answer, is that ordinarily, I guess, since they quote in one these amicus briefs, since at least 1927 we consider -- our State Department -- the treaties that have obligations are -- also require appropriate enforcement remedies, et cetera. And we have Avena and we have LaGrand, and there the ICJ, as I read it, has said you have to have some kind of remedy, being pretty vague about what kind it is. All right. So normally we follow the ICJ, if we can. Schooner Betsy and go back forever. All right. So why not? Just follow what they say, say there has to be some kind of remedy. And then we put our minds to figuring out what that kind is.",
  "I have a couple --",
  "-- thinking of the wrong thing, but it seemed to me I have a couple of opinions here on habeas, State habeas, where they did raise it. Am I thinking of the other case?",
  "And -- and not on --",
  "So then the -- then the only question really is this thing that I find metaphysical, and maybe you can explain it. To start talking about the individual rights that -- enforceable, that sounds to me like a -- you know, a case that arises under 1983 or something. But I thought we don't need that concept. We all agree that -- that this -- this is the law of the United States. It's self-executing. And the only question is whether the action here violates a provision of the treaty, which is the law of the land. What else is there? And -- and the only thing I read that the ICJ said, it said, by the way, I'll tell you what kind of procedural rule you can't have. You can't have a procedural rule that says after you failed to inform him of the right and after he's unbelievably prejudiced, you say he can't raise it because he didn't raise it before he could possibly have found out about the right. That would be self-defeating. So you can't have that kind of a rule. Now, do you agree with that?",
  "You explain to me where I -- where I --",
  "I wonder what that means. Suppose that the treaty provides that if the individual sends a letter to the counsel, they have to deliver it. Doesn't it?",
  "Well, suppose a sheriff somewhere grabs the letter, keeps it, and the counsel sues him under State property law. And State property law, they say, entitles me, says the counsel, to this letter. It's mine. It was sent to me. Now, if that happens to be the interpretation of the judge in the State of X the sheriff can keep the letter, wouldn't you say that that property law of the State is invalid in light of this provision of the treaty, which is the law of the United States self-executing?",
  "No. I just would like an answer to my question.",
  "No. I've given you the straight facts. The straight facts are they sue -- I don't have to repeat them. I want to know under -- under my straight facts, wouldn't you say that -- you got the question.",
  "But I'm not saying a treaty. I'm saying there's a letter and wouldn't it be the case that the judge would have to say, here, Mr. Sheriff, you take the letter and you hand it to the counsel? It's his property.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Okay, fine.",
  "And now what they're doing here is they're saying we have a cause of action. It's called habeas corpus. And we're asking for a rule of decision in that cause of action, and the rule of decision in this cause of action, just like mine, was in property. Is the decision -- the rule of decision is the rule written into the treaty, just like in the property case, and you cannot do anything that contravenes it though, of course, you can argue about the content of that rule of decision.",
  "I imagine there's not -- there's some little authority both ways. To put it in my perhaps -- I know you disagree with this way of thinking about it. But I'm -- I'm thinking about this article 36 and thinking that you're reading it as if it said, inform the individual, but if you don't, he can't do anything about it. And the other way is to read the silence as if it said, inform the individual, but if you don't, he can do something about it. We're not saying what. Okay. Now, between those two interpretations, we have the ICJ picking interpretation two and rejecting interpretation one in, I grant you, a different case. But I guess since a lot of these amicus briefs tell us throughout history, a long history, we've tried to follow ICJ interpretations of treaties to which we are parties. Why -- it's all up to us, but we've tried to. Why -- why should we not, given the two possible interpretations -- they choose one. Why should we not choose to follow theirs here?",
  "Well, then you're going back to putting weight on the absence of authority. In those contracting states, most of which I guess are civil system states, and in civil systems, you'll have magistrates who do take this kind of thing into account, but you won't find a case on it. So -- so --",
  "-- are there authorities in these other states to the contrary? I'm surprised if there is.",
  "Do they, in all those property cases, you know, from like the early part of this republic where property law was determined in accordance with -- you know all those cases that are cited.",
  "In those treaties where the courts then looked to the treaty to help decide who owned what property, they used it as a rule of decision. Do those cases -- treaties all use the word individually enforceable rights?",
  "Where does this term come from as applied to a rule of decision? I mean, when somebody is arguing that the treaty should apply a rule of decision in a case brought under some other cause of action, what's the best thing I could read? I'm not an expert.",
  "You say the way to think about that --",
  "-- is the, quote, individually enforceable rights.",
  "On Justice Scalia's question, I was trying to think of some, and I was trying to think the analogy might -- you might find some analogy in the public utilities field, the -- or a ferris wheel or something. What you want is a person who uses his property not at all himself, but licensed the public generally. And now would a -- would a court I don't realize I don't know the answer.",
  "Yes, that's what -- I mean, that -- that's what you're trying to analogize this case to, I guess, is a person who licenses others to use his property and never uses it himself.",
  "And there, I don't know how courts do normally act in other areas of property law.",
  "Suppose --",
  "There isn't an automatic distinction, but a person who licenses a patent and who very much beyond what it is -- it's fairly easy to -- I'll ask Mr. Waxman.",
  "Why? I mean, I think there are so many factors that could enter into it.",
  "What I was going to ask was if you have a -- a patentee that does only license and, moreover, licenses only to people who, by and large, will not take that product and develop it further, then it's fairly easy to calculate damages. who also waits for a long time, waits till the invention is embedded in a series of other inventions happen is that the patentee will be able to extract far more than this particular invention is worth because the infringer would have to give up the entire invention.",
  "Couple that with a patent that, if you read it on page 2 of the red brief, reminds, at least one person who read it, namely me, that if this could be patented, maybe A&P could patent their process for a supermarket. I -- I mean, you'd worry about that as a judge. And couple that with all the other things that are here. Now, special case? Why not?",
  "The main point -- what I was trying to do is I was trying to take what I'd call the patent troll case. patent troll. The founder of MercExchange really did invent this innovation. He really did, as the record the system to suit himself, and he is no promiscuous licensor. He has -- it has entered into licenses, which are all in the joint appendix, that are very specialized in terms. He was asked by eBay in 2000 to consider selling them. He offered to license them. The parties couldn't come to terms, and eBay then stole the technology. It willfully infringed it, knowing about it, having cited this as prior art, having had one patent rejected as fully anticipated by the '265. And the common law and equitable principles have -- are quite clear from Story, Pomeroy, all the way back, that when you -- when you're talking about balancing private harms, which is what equity courts do -- I'm not talking about the public interest, but I mean private harms, when you have an adjudicated, willful infringer -- I mean, the jury found that it had no good faith belief either that it wasn't infringing or that the patent was invalid -- you don't balance private harms. But let's take the case in which you don't have willfulness. It's not this case. Let's take the the patent. That's not this case. Let's take the case of somebody who's a garage inventor who decides the way this -- so far as I'm aware, this is the first case. The district court decision in this case is the first case in the context of a permanent injunction. And I'll explain why preliminary injunctions that seek to preserve the status quo are different. This is the first permanent injunction case I'm aware of that has ever thought that exploiting the patent by licensing it to others to make use of would in -- somehow be costly or disable you from obtaining the relief that section 283 and the -- and tradition provided. Section -- section 284, which is the damages provision, talks about remedies, remedies for infringement that has already occurred. The text of section 283 says -- the other side keeps referring to may, may, may not, shall. That's fine. But the purpose of it is to prevent. The operative word in 283 is to prevent. And unless there is an instance in which the patent has expired, the -- the infringer is out of business and can show that it couldn't possibly infringe anymore, an injunction issues to prevent further violation. question there really was -- that was the heart of it -- that I don't think there's a moral or even patent- yourself or not. It's just that when you license it, it's easier -- and a lot of other things matter too.",
  "But it's easier to calculate the damage. Now, at least in some subset of cases. So if you have a case where, on the one hand, it's easier to calculate the damage remedy, and at the same time you fear that to issue an injunction will produce a harm to the other side way out of proportion to, in fact, the value that's being lost by infringing on the patent, then those are two things you'd put in the balance.",
  "So the -- other things being equal --",
  "No. Willful, willful. It wouldn't matter willful or nonwillful, because if he's willful, the reason that he might be willful is he thinks that the patentee is holding him up. are 52 self-proclaimed intellectual property professors that filed a brief written by Professor Lemley in testified under oath to Congress that, even though there are problems with patent trolls, in the case of a willful infringer, the law -- equity doesn't balance private harms. But even if that were wrong, I acknowledge that in balancing, there may be cases in which you can show a vastly disproportionate harm. Okay? I mean, the other side has amicus briefs that come up with these hypothetical scenarios about, you know, one little aspect of a computer chip that has 30,000 components to it. Note, A, that all of those are hypothetical, and B, I'll explain why it's a problem of extremely limited circumstances. But, of course, equity courts can decide that, just as they can decide whether the -- the, quote, innocent patent holder is guilty of laches, unclean hands, estoppel, all of these other equitable considerations that aren't captured by this formulaic four-factor test but that equity courts, including district courts sitting under -- under 283, consider. But this is not the case of some profligate specific provisions. The other side says, well, there are no operative licenses, suggesting somehow that the fact invalid. That came up in their reply brief. It is not correct. It is absolutely true that eBay will not -- the '265 patent is included by that license. It relates to the field of use of auto sales. It provides specifically that eBay -- that MercExchange cannot receive royalties unless it enforces this patent within the field of use. There is no doubt that -- that MercExchange will not be able to start getting patent royalties from AutoTrader unless and until it obtains this injunction. And for example --",
  "Well, the answer would be because Congress is worried that people won't complain. That's why. And there are millions of ways of harassing people. They start issuing a complaint. You do all kinds of things. You freeze them out. You -- you insult them. You -- I mean, it's easy to think of things that don't rise to the level of the -- Ellerth. So, I mean, if I -- maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong, but if I'm right, why not just take, say, the D.C. Circuit standard? They -- they say that you have to show that the employer's action would have been material, which means the action might well have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. Now, how about that? That has the virtue of allowing a person not to be harassed, et cetera, who wants to make a complaint, and it also allows the judge to focus on the particular case and see if what the person is doing is reasonable. It holds the complainant to a standard of reasonableness, which is common in law.",
  "Well, in fact, if it turns out to be the power lunch of all time and, in fact, the person can't be at the power lunch because she's a woman, for example, and therefore, her future career is likely to take a real nose dive, why shouldn't that count as a violation?",
  "Why? Why? You see, I can think of a million things. I can't think literally of a million, but it does seem --",
  "-- to me there are many, many possible ways of really discouraging a worker from complaining that are not quite as tangible as the list under 703. So the D.C. Circuit -- and I think even the SG here, which seems like a variation of the D.C. Circuit -- much -- the standards seem much -- not as different as you might -- as it seems to me you're saying. But -- but they're -- they're trying to be a little vaguer and a bit broader than the specific Ellerth language because they recognize there are many possible ways of seriously injuring a person with the intent or -- to stop them from complaining. That gives effect to the language differences.",
  "It leaves it up to case-by - case. It leaves it up to the administrative agency, all in areas where I frankly don't know one lunch from another.",
  "I don't know one lunch from another often, but the -- the EEOC might and -- and so might a judge who hears evidence.",
  "And that's the virtue of their standard.",
  "Well --",
  "It's not -- it's not -- the -- the words of the statute that I think are relevant is it -- is it -- you can't discriminate with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. Now, the words I just cited are present in 703. So that's the substantive offense. Those words, as Justice Scalia pointed out and others, are missing in 704, and that suggests that you could have a broader definition than those words I just cited as to what counts as harm flowing from a discrimination. That's the statutory argument. And then you add, there could be good reason for that. These people typically are at work and there are lots of subtle forms of harm and some not so subtle.",
  "Well, I'd be curious. In the -- in the Seventh Circuit, they have a test, I gather, like the D.C. Circuit, which you've characterized as broader. Have there suddenly been a flow of these claims towards the Seventh Circuit? Is there any empirical data that this concern that has been brought up is empirically present in the Seventh Circuit?",
  "Am I right in thinking -- I just want to clarify this -- that in the circuit court, they applied a pretty tough standard, namely, a standard that sounds a lot like Ellerth, the Kocsis, or whatever it is? Tangible employment actions, a significant change in employment status, hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits. And that's basically what the jury was instructed.",
  "And you won under the toughest standard.",
  "So in a sense, you have nowhere to go but up.",
  "You don't care what standard --",
  "-- for this case.",
  "Take Justice Alito's case, and nobody litigated it because nobody doubted that it was a loaded gun. Now, what's the result?",
  "All right. So -- so, therefore, it's harmless. So, therefore, we use harmless error analysis. So what's the difference between that case and this case?",
  "Yes, I quite -- I quite agree with you that there is the difference that in the Alito case as amended, it all happened before the jury got its verdict. In our case, it happened after the jury reached a verdict. Now, absolutely true. And my question, of course, is why does that matter.",
  "No, no. It was improperly instructed. The judge forgot to give this instruction about the nature of the firearm. I take it -- at least my case -- the judge forgets to instruct about the firearm. He just forgets. All right? And then the jury goes out. It comes back and the lawyer says, Judge, I handed you the instruction. Why didn't you give it? He says, oh, my God, I forgot. Now, does harmless error apply to that case?",
  "And I want to know why that matters because the only thing I've tried to create the hypothetical to matter is the one thing happens before the jury goes out, and the other happens after. And why does that matter?",
  "Yes, but on -- on that one, the -- the Second Circuit said that he was incompetent, and you could have excluded the time on (4) because (4) allows you to exclude time when he's incompetent. And if, in fact, the district judge is sitting there thinking he's incompetent, then the failure is simply a failure to write down his reason why it's excluded. I guess there's uncertainty here as to what reason was the district judge excluded that time, and it's a little bit hypothetical for the reason that Justice Ginsburg mentioned. But if you were to lose on the first point, then I guess on this point, the thing to do would be to send it back and determine whether, in fact, the judge intended to exclude on the ground of competency, in which case his failure was simply a failure to note down his reason, which is not required by the act.",
  "I'm sorry. My act must read differently. My act says in (4), any period of delay resulting from the fact that the defendant is mentally incompetent. It doesn't say anything about 30 days.",
  "Yes, that's why, see, I guess on this point, we'd have to send it back because if, in fact, the judge had determined in his mind within the 30-day period that the person was incompetent or he was incompetent in fact, then that could have been his reason. I'm not sure what to do about this point in any case, and I understand that you think he wasn't incompetent, or at least it hadn't been so found. The Second Circuit seemed to think he was incompetent because that was their basis. So I guess if he was, it's excluded, and if he wasn't, it isn't excluded. And I don't know. The Second Circuit said he was. So maybe you should have another chance to argue this before the Second Circuit.",
  "So your view is that we should say that the Second Circuit's statement that the defendant could not have been tried because, at that time, he was incompetent, that we should simply say that's false, that the Second Circuit is wrong to say that.",
  "I'd like to know how -- how do we know that the judge didn't set forth orally his reasons for finding that the ends of justice outweigh the interest, et cetera? Is that in the record what he actually said?",
  "Because I don't know that you'd have to use the exact words, the ends of justice served. You know, you don't have to -- I'd like to read what he actually said, and where -- where is that? It's not on page 192, which is somebody's opinion. But rather, if I want to read the words, where do I look?",
  "Maybe you could say then that it's the Government that has the right. If it's the Government that has the right, then Government should have objected. I mean, the problem, of course, is obvious, that it's a little hard on the district judges that people come in and both sides tell them what you have to have here is a waiver. Are you sure you won't raise this against me later? I'm positive. I swear. You mean you absolutely swear a thousand times that no matter what I do and have delay, you will never raise this as an error and it's fine? Yes. Okay? So he says, okay, fine, done. You win. Then he raises it as an error. That's rather -- called sandbagging the judge. And obviously, one would look to -- or I would look to ways to avoid that, but you're telling me I can't avoid it, and that's what Congress wanted and so be it. Is that right?",
  "How is it not correct? That's what I'm --",
  "I'm not talking about here. I'm saying that in your -- if I adopt your position in this case, I would have to have the same position, I would think, in the most egregious cases. Wouldn't I? Because the only reason I'd adopt it here is because Congress wanted it no matter what.",
  "Is that right?",
  "Okay. Then you're -- then am I right in characterizing?",
  "Maybe. I mean, judges are very busy. Not all the prosecutors get the word. It's very hard to ask district judges to raise something on their own in the face of lawyers who are telling them the opposite. So you say, oh, they'll all know. I've noticed there are a lot of opinions we write that they don't know about --",
  "-- until, say, the lawyers point them out.",
  "It's pretty hard to read those pages as if they were anything other than what they seemed to be on their face, that he didn't worry about the Speedy Trial Act because he thought that it had been waived.",
  "Well, then why isn't that the end of that, that the -- if you agree that the defendant can't waive it, well, the reason that he got the continuance is because he waived it, otherwise there would have been something else done and -- or at least might have been.",
  "Suppose you ask the judge. You say, Judge, 2 months ago the defendant came to you and said, I waive the Speedy Trial Act. Now the defendant says, Judge, I now would like a month's continuance. The judge says, I'll give it to you. The opposing counsel says why. He says, because he waived it. Now, you're telling me that, one, he cannot waive it, but two, even though the judge said I did it because he waived it, that still itself is okay. We go ahead and let him exclude it because the judge might have done something differently. Is that what you're saying?",
  "But it's possible you could argue, looking at the record, that the judge should have tried it -- should have excluded it on a different basis. He should have excluded it on the basis of the interests of justice, et cetera required. So what the judge said, just to make it clear, is I'm not even thinking about this different basis, though I might. I'm doing it just because he waived it. And now you're telling me, I take it, he can't waive it, but nonetheless, the error is harmless because he waived it, or something like that.",
  "It's not harmless. You're saying it's a procedural error.",
  "So we don't say the judge is right because he waived it. We're saying he's right because the judge made a procedural error. I'm having a hard time following that.",
  "But does it make it possible to read -- I mean, I agree with you it doesn't say to do that, but I guess you could read it to do that, couldn't you? I mean, you said the word cost wasn't ambiguous.",
  "Maybe you might be right, maybe absolutely, but might you also be wrong? How is it not ambiguous? It might cover -- it might cover the fees of consultants. It might be that the argument you made is right, but it also mightn't.",
  "Which involved this statute?",
  "All right. Well, I mean, we have a statute and they're using the word costs in the statute, and whatever they used in some other statute they might have meant something different in this statute. And my question is simply how do we know they didn't by just reading the word five times, particularly since, in fact, if you look at another part of the statute, they do seem to use the word cost to include number of hours spent by personnel, including consultants, and the expenses incurred. I mean, can you say -- is there a dictionary that says the word costs couldn't include that?",
  "Well, once you say it could, then possibly it's reasonable to ask what the Congress Members were actually thinking, and as soon as we look at what they were actually thinking, that's perfectly clear. Isn't it? Because both the conference report and the Senate report say absolutely clearly that they intended this kind of expense to be used, which is why the GAO went out and did all the studies to include it.",
  "It's true, but --",
  "That's certainly possible. I just wonder why don't we look and see what they intended, since they told us. In the conference report, they say the conferees intend the phrase, attorneys' fees as part of costs, to include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable cost of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of a parent or guardian's case in the action or proceeding. So why are we metaphysically trying to guess what Congress intended when they told us what they intended?",
  "My question is why don't we just look and see what they intended since they wrote it down on a piece of paper and all we have to do is read it?",
  "I thought it did. I thought that the conferees in Congress wrote in the conference report precisely what they intended.",
  "Oh, I'd like you to respond to it.",
  "So it's not correct it's just for one house. It's -- what I have is the Joint Explanatory Committee, and it says the managers, on the part of the House and the Senate.",
  "All right. And is there some rule -- I don't know what this rule is you can't refer to legislative history. Does it say that in the Constitution of the United States?",
  "No. And so --",
  "Which ones are voted on? I've not heard of that. I mean, they might be, but it used to be that the -- they circulate the report to all the Members and the Members read it, and if a Member disagrees with it, they note their dissent. Maybe it's changed. But I guess --",
  "I didn't have an opportunity to work for a Senator who, in fact, to my experience asked me to report on a vote on such a thing. I just wasn't aware of it.",
  "Well, one thing here --",
  "No. Of course --",
  "You can't use red if the statute says green. Green doesn't include red. I understand that. And that's why, in fact, I wondered if the presence in this bill of the GAO section suggests in the bill itself the possibility that the word cost means something special. And if that's so, then I would think it is ambiguous enough to refer to the legislative history. It's not like using the word red and arguing it includes green.",
  "Would you read the phrase from the conference report as a limitation? That is, that -- we're trying to figure out what the Congress meant by the phrase costs. It says it means includes reasonable expense and fees of expert witnesses and reasonable costs of any test or evaluation that's necessary. So then is that -- have the courts read that as a -- as a limitation?",
  "Was there any opposition? Was there any -- is there any history of anyone in this Senate or the House either before or after suggesting that they didn't want to allow recovery for the expert fees?",
  "No --",
  "-- what they have here -- the -- what the SG says -- which seemed right to me, and I would like you to explain why it wasn't -- is that as far as the insanity defense is concerned, that everyone in Arizona agrees that you consider whether he knows right from wrong in respect to this act. Thus, if he thinks the truckdriver is an alien, or he thinks he's an animal, and has a serious mental problem in knowing what's going on, that comes right in, as it did here, because it's relevant to whether he knew it was right or wrong to shoot this person. And, therefore, once I read that, I thought there is not, at least in this case, a question of whether the insanity defense is complete, because it is. Everything that you wanted to introduce was introduced. And, indeed, it was considered, properly, under the insanity defense. And if you had convinced the jury, you would -- or the -- I guess, the jury -- you would have won on that. Now, am I -- what's wrong with what I've just said?",
  "Yes, but I'm interested in Arizona, remember. I'm not -- what I'm interested in is whether if you say, \"Judge, I am going to prove the following. My client knows right from wrong, in general, but he thought that the truckdriver was a wild animal, and that delusion meant that he is so insane, he could not have formed the necessary intent.\" The judge replies, \"You can bring that in, because if he thought the driver was a mental -- was a wild animal, he did not know right from wrong in respect to this killing.\" Now, is that what happened --",
  "-- in effect? Or would -- did the judge say, \"You may not introduce that evidence, because it is not relevant\"?",
  "In this case.",
  "Well, fine. So, then, what is -- would -- if he thought it was a wild animal, then he would not have known right from wrong in respect to killing that individual.",
  "What is it?",
  "No, but whether it --",
  "Then, what do you do --",
  "All right, if that's --",
  "But the Arizona Court, the Court of Appeals, writes that it turns on the finding of criminal responsibility at the time of the criminal offense. It is difficult to imagine that a defendant who did not appreciate the nature and quality of the act he committed would reasonably be able to perceive that the act was wrong. Now, those words, written by the Arizona Court, suggested to me that, in the case of the lemon you're talking about, or in the case of the individual who thinks that the truckdriver was a Martian, they would say he does not know right from wrong, here, now, in this case. That, it seemed to me, is what the Court of Appeals wrote.",
  "And if that's what they wrote, then they don't adopt the test you're attacking; rather, they do let the very evidence that you want to come in, come in, and it is totally relevant.",
  "All right, suppose he did, he believed there -- it's an alien, which is not immoral, to kill an alien, let's say, if he comes from Mars. I don't know about the morality of that, but --",
  "-- I'll go with you. I'll say that you're absolutely right about that. Now, suppose, in addition, the judge did consider that. He did consider it, because he thought the person wouldn't know right from wrong if he thought this was an alien. All right? A space alien. Now, suppose that's true. Then what is the problem, from a due-process point of view? After all, you were able to make your claim there. The judge would have heard the evidence. And if the judge believed that that was so, he would have acquitted the individual. Does there remain a due- process problem?",
  "Actually, I was --",
  "Well, suppose --",
  "-- I read State v. --",
  "-- Mott --",
  "Well, that's a different question. If, in fact, it came in via the insanity defense, I guess the burden is on the defendant to prove it. Is --",
  "-- that true? Well, if it comes in via mens rea, then the burden is on the State to disprove it.",
  "Doesn't the State have to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, if it came in via mens rea, that the mens rea was there?",
  "And so, the State --",
  "-- would have to show that, in fact, he was not so insane as to preclude intent.",
  "That would present a serious constitutional question, wouldn't it? Or what -- I mean, I -- that's -- but I thought some of these questions might be in this case, but I now doubt -- I'm having doubts about that. But suppose the State so limits the defense that an individual defendant, who, by any ordinary psychiatric test, would be viewed as seriously insane, and, therefore, not a person who is capable of being held responsible in any moral sense for the crime, is, nonetheless, going to be convicted of murder? I mean -- and that might be -- come up with irresistible impulse, because the person is totally insane, not like any other human being. Anyone would normally say he lacked the knowledge of -- he's not responsible for what he does. And then, the State, nonetheless, convicts him of murder.",
  "If he knew right from wrong, if they -- so, I mean, he -- it's not his intellectual capacity that's wrong, it's his ability to control his impulse.",
  "But that's not in this case, I agree with you.",
  "But is a variation of that in this case -- namely, the variation -- but we've discussed that at length, and I take it you think that's not in this case.",
  "But we don't have to reach that question here, in your view.",
  "Or do we?",
  "But if we have to reach it, this -- they're arguing we do, because they're saying the person is so insane he doesn't know whether this is a human being or a sack of lemons. Now --",
  "-- he said that they didn't consider that in the insanity defense. And he's not attacking the burden of proof, at least not in this Court. And so, I -- do you think we do have to -- that we have to --",
  "-- assume that he's right on that?",
  "What is \"diminished capacity,\" if it is -- what is that?",
  "But partial responsibility does not -- insanity -- they use the words \"insanity\" and \"diminished responsibility.\" I took the word \"insanity\" to mean the kind of mental state that would, in fact, show a lack of intent. I took the word \"diminished responsibility\" to mean there is intent, but it's excusable.",
  "Now, am I --",
  "In the --",
  "Yes, I -- the best I can find in that Court of Appeals opinion, at the moment, is that they do reject the idea of diminished responsibility, on Mott -- on the ground of Mott. That's true. They say, \"Don't even consider it.\" But I didn't think diminished responsibility went to the question of whether he had the requisite intent. I thought insanity went to that, as they use those words. What is \"diminished responsibility,\" if it isn't, \"We admit the intent -- we admit that he intended to kill the individual, knew it was wrong, but he isn't as responsible as an ordinary person would be\"? What is - -",
  "-- it, if it isn't that?",
  "He thought he was killing another individual.",
  "Does that --",
  "Does the State have to -- does the Constitution have to let you off if that's the situation?",
  "Yes, you --",
  "All right, but --",
  "-- but does the State have to say, \"We are going to convict you of a lesser offense,\" in the Constitution?",
  "Well, it doesn't -- what Thermtron says is that we read (d) in conjunction with (c). Now, the reason that (c) is relevant here is because it says, if at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject- matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded. Presumably what (c) is thinking of are cases where subject-matter jurisdiction is not the whole issue before the -- the Federal court. It's thinking that subject-matter jurisdiction in certain instances, like a defect in a removal proceeding, is something that the -- that the Federal court could get to prior to a final judgment. But here, the final judgment in the Federal court is the very question of whether this is preempted or not. And therefore, I guess what Easterbrook is thinking is that that isn't the kind of subject-matter jurisdiction dismissal to which (c) refers. Consequently, it is not within the scope of (d)'s no appellate review rule.",
  "No. It's no doubt that all the lower courts then would be wrong. But the reason he says that they are wrong is because they looked at the word, subject-matter jurisdiction, in (c) without realizing that the reference in (c) is a reference to instances where subject-matter jurisdiction is not the whole issue; i.e., it's something other than the final Federal court decision.",
  "That would be the argument he's making. I would like your response.",
  "I agree with you. You would also have to say that the same rule applies, one, to the complete preemption cases and, two, to sovereign immunity determinations under the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act. But he would say that may be so, but nonetheless, Judge Easterbrook would say, well, so be it. That's what Congress intended. That is wrong to deprive someone of a right to appeal when it turns on a misreading of (c) and an incorporation of the misreading into (d).",
  "Would it make sense --",
  "Does it make -- what's worrying me in the back of my mind is we have decided Dabit since this case was brought. Then I thought, well, could we remand this case in light of Dabit. Now, if we did that, we wouldn't decide the issue that you all want decided, and we'd let this, unfortunately, slightly confused situation continue to exist. What would be the consequence of that? Are there -- are there a lot of cases, or is this something that comes up often?",
  "I'm trying to think. It seems if you -- it ought to work out similarly to what happens in a case where there's a Federal issue that you remove under. Now you've removed. And there also is a State issue pendent. Now, what the judge does is he says, defendant, you win on the Federal issue, and I'm going to send this thing back now, remand it, because I don't think I want to maintain here the State issue. And so it's a remand order. The case is remanded. Now, I think you get an appeal on your Federal issue there. And then -- then why shouldn't -- if that's so, shouldn't this work out the same way?",
  "Shouldn't it work out the same?",
  "I'm confused now. You're saying both sides agreed that section 1447(d) does not apply?",
  "All right. Now, then -- then I understand that. What I don't understand is the question about something remaining to be done. What -- what 77p(b) says is the covered class action, I take it, is any private party alleging. And when I see the word alleging, I think you're supposed to look at the complaint to see what they allege, not some other thing about what's going to happen later. But you're telling me that's wrong.",
  "And if you're right that that's wrong, I don't see how you could possibly get out of (c) in 1447(c) which talks about a decision before final judgment, that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction. Because if you're right, then this is before final judgment, it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction. That's the end of your case.",
  "All right. You have to disagree with -- I guess -- go ahead. Disagree. I'd like to hear the answer.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, which would have to be a colorable defense that there is an allegation by the plaintiff that falls within (b).",
  "In other words, if -- I mean, it's awfully surprising -- I think that's why you're getting this resistance -- that there's an issue in a case, does -- is the -- the State action preempted or not. They've never had an appeal. So they get it tried. The whole case is tried out, and then the -- some State court says, in our opinion it is preempted. But they can't decide that. They can't decide it because there was a Federal judge who said the opposite in the same case before the case was final.",
  "And if they don't -- and if they refuse to decide it, why wouldn't this Court say, this is the same case? There is only one case. It isn't over yet, and we're reviewing that, and we think that district judge was wrong. We think that Federal district judge never read Dabit, which isn't surprising since it was decided after he wrote the opinion.",
  "But it's so odd.",
  "Suppose -- suppose the -- it came up under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The district court judge remands the case. In his opinion Romania is not a country. That's what he thinks. Never heard of it.",
  "So -- so it goes back to the State court and the State court says, yes, that's right. We've not heard of Romania either. It's not a country. All right. Now, you're saying there we are for all time. Everybody is stuck with this holding.",
  "Is that right? Maybe that's why I'm so surprised that such could be the law.",
  "Then the district court was wrong too I guess because the district court made the same --",
  "Why can't you? Is there any case or anything that says you don't look at the whole circumstance to decide if it was reasonable to enter? I mean, suppose I just wrote an opinion, for a hypothetical's sake, that says, look, there was so much noise at 3:00 in the morning nobody could even hear a knock and he looks in the window, sees one of the -- a kid there being held, who's obviously been drinking under age. He takes a swing at somebody else and pokes him in the nose and blood starts to run or -- and under those circumstances, of course, it was reasonable to go in. End of the matter.",
  "You mean -- you mean the noise stopped?",
  "No. The question is whether he could go into the house, and are you saying that before he went into the house, all the noise stopped?",
  "Okay. So my question is I'm interested in the law of it. Why can't I -- what's -- what -- the -- the Constitution says reasonable or unreasonable, forbids an unreasonable entry, search. So this doesn't seem unreasonable. A policeman isn't a lawyer. He just has to do what's reasonable in the circumstance. It's a huge -- well, I would be repeating myself. But what I want to know is what in the law makes that opinion wrong?",
  "And there are two reasons why he didn't want to go get a warrant. It would take about half an hour, at which time all the neighbors are awake, and they have to lose an hour of sleep. And in addition to that, the underage drinking will continue for another half an hour or an hour. And in addition to that, somebody else might get poked in the nose. So those are the reasons why -- or worse. So those are the reasons why he thought it was reasonable to go in.",
  "Those are the reasons why it was reasonable to go in.",
  "Now, what's wrong with that opinion?",
  "Now, suppose I were to say at the end of that it doesn't require a warrant because it was not unreasonable objectively to go in under those circumstances. What I'm looking for you to do is to tell me why.",
  "Does it say that in a case somewhere, or is that just your opinion?",
  "All right. Now, what I would like to know is what does it say in a case because I -- I agree, at 3:00 in the morning, it might not appear to many people to be unreasonable when the party is so loud that no one can sleep, that they have to take an extra hour or half an hour or 40 minutes to just tell the people inside the house, knock it off. Now, is there a case somewhere that says -- I guess, we could take a poll or something, but is there a case that casts some light on this?",
  "Which case?",
  "Was that involving a -- is that in this Court? Yes?",
  "And was that involving a party or noise, or what was it involving?",
  "I mean, I wouldn't want this to be the party case. This also involves violence and it also involves underage drinking and all three are there together. But I guess a policeman, where he sees or hears or knows a crime is going on, can take steps to try to stop it so that it doesn't have to continue. And is there any case that says it depends on how serious a crime? Is there a case that says if it's a sort of minor crime, like a disturbance of the peace, you have to permit it to continue, but if it's a major crime like homicide, you don't have to?",
  "Leaving law out of it, which I'd like to do, just for the sake of argument, imagine you're a juror, and this is a totally contrived situation, which I think we're deciding -- I don't know if there's ever been such a situation -- but you're a juror, and you're told the following by a fellow juror, \"The reason that we have these aggravating circumstances, which are hard to understand here, is, we want to be sure this fellow is, morally speaking, somewhat more deserving of death, than the average.\" And then he says, \"And the reason that we have these mitigating circumstances here is because every one of them means that he's somewhat less moral -- he's not as morally undeserving, cuts the other way, it reduces -- it makes him less deserving of death, morally speaking.\" Now, you're the juror, how do you feel about this?\" And you say, \"They're absolutely in balance, absolutely in balance. For every fact here on the aggravating side that puts me thinking, morally speaking, he's more deserving of death, there is a mitigating factor which makes me think, morally speaking, he's less deserving of death. So, I'm in perfect balance.\" And your fellow juror says, \"Now, will you please give me, then, one moral reason why he should be executed?\" And what's your answer?",
  "No, but if the law says, \"You have to be able to give, morally speaking, reason -- you have to reason your way towards the moral conclusion that he's deserving of death\" -- that's why I tried to take the law out of it. I don't want you to be a lawyer. I want you to be a juror. And I want you to give a moral reason --",
  "-- why, when this is in equipoise, he is more deserving of death than the average.",
  "Well --",
  "Is there --",
  "-- anything --",
  "Okay, well, what do you say to --",
  "But the difficulty, I think, in the case is, it's artificial. I think it is. We're in an artificial situation, and we're imagining those 12 jurors saying they're in equipoise between mitigating and aggravating. We don't know. They -- even. All right. Now, you could look at this as saying, \"You have to have a reason for thinking these people are -- this person is morally worse than the average.\" And then we imagine some fungible commodity, like moral badness units. And for every one we go up on the aggravating side, we go down on the mitigating side, so we're back to zero. And then, some people, like you, are looking at this and saying, \"See, you're at zero. You went up, you went down, so they're no worse than the average.\" But other people can look at it and say, \"We'll tell you about -- one thing about this individual. This is an individual who did do the aggravating things, and he has counterbalancing mitigating things, and that's good enough to separate him out, morally speaking, from somebody who doesn't. Now, my problem is, you either look at it the one way or you look at the other way, and you -- and I'm trying to find a reasoned -- if you -- can -- do you want to add anything?",
  "Is there any significant variation among the different carriers as to the terms of the contracts they use in different places for Federal employees?",
  "Under this program.",
  "Is there a lot or a little?",
  "What I'm thinking of is a statute. The statute has fairly close detail as to what the contracts must contain. It gives authority to OMB or -- to write regs. And they have written regs that have very detailed provisions as to what the contracts must contain, and then there is the contract with the individual carried -- when the -- when the carrier is implementing these rules, regulations, and statutes.",
  "And I'm trying to figure out is --",
  "It gives some.",
  "It gives some.",
  "Yes, I know, but I'm trying --",
  "Insofar as the individual carriers write contracts with their covered employees, i.e., me and you and other people, and there's a lot of variation, I would say there's a lot of private going on. But insofar as those contracts are dictated by what OPM says, then it looks more to me like a regular Federal program.",
  "And I'm trying to get a handle on that.",
  "So in other words, when I sign a contract, or anyone who's a Federal employee, it's OPM who effectively sets those terms?",
  "No, I understand.",
  "It's quite possible no one in Congress thought about this --",
  "-- which is common. So if it is common, why is it that we would not use the same approach that the Court used in Clearfield Trust, in Kimbell Foods, and really look to the nature of the contract? Whereas here, the rights at stake are really those of the United States in that they are going to get the money. We have a statute. We have all those things I just listed. It covers only Federal employees. Should -- there are strong interests in uniformity throughout the Nation, et cetera, et cetera. So what is the difference between this case, other than a technical difference? I concede that one. The title is not United States. It's Blue Cross Blue Shield or whatever.",
  "Empire, et cetera. But aside from that, why is it different?",
  "Why -- why?",
  "The obvious reason for uniformity would be you are a Federal employee, whether you're in Alaska or whether you're in Virginia.",
  "And it's unreasonable to think Congress would want the rights of those different Federal employees to differ just because of where they live. And so what's the answer to that?",
  "But I'm curious --",
  "I -- I wasn't thinking of that kind of uniformity.",
  "I was thinking of the contract -- the contracts that the carriers enter into with the individual Federal employees in different places. And I'm trying to get an idea of whether those contracts all read the same or they don't. And so far, you have found one example of where they read differently. Some contracts apparently say when you reimburse us, you can subtract attorney's fees, and others say when you reimburse us maybe you can subtract attorney's fees, depending on how we feel about it. And I grant you that is a difference. And I am curious, as was Justice Souter, as to whether you have to get OPM approval for that difference or whether OPM can tell you, knock it off, we want the same. And also I'd like other examples. What I'm trying to do, to be clear about it, is I'm trying to see how similar this is to the instance of the Federal employee checks, which this Court many, many years ago said, when you pay your Federal employees and you write a check, it's Federal law that's going to govern the interpretation of the endorsement. I want to see how similar it is and how different. I have two differences. One is the name on this case is Empire, not United States, and the second difference is the one you just mentioned about may rather than must. Now, are there others?",
  "Well, I would have thought the issue is whether Federal law governs this --",
  "-- and they come to Federal court. So what is clearly -- maybe I -- maybe you've -- I don't think you've said this. We know this. That if the United States issues checks to all of its employees throughout the country and then it seeks to recover from one of the drawees or one of the people who endorsed the check on the ground it was fraudulent, we know that it is Federal law that must govern those checks. Right? From Clearfield.",
  "All right. Now, what is the difference in this case? In this case, we have a private administrator of this Federal -- of this -- of this Federal program. There are Federal employees throughout the country. They are supposed to receive uniform -- reasonably uniform health insurance, and the private administrator wants to obtain money that it thinks it's entitled to to put into the Federal Treasury. Now, aside from the name, what's the difference?",
  "That's exactly what I'm trying to find out. That's -- that's what I'm -- I'm trying to figure out in my mind how close this is to the Federal Government running a uniform program. I mean, everybody agrees Federal law governs questions involving the rights of the United States --",
  "-- arising under nationwide Federal programs. And here, we have not the United States. We have Empire. And so how close is Empire to being simply an instrument of the United States in this respect, and how close is it to being really an independent company that sets up its own insurance contracts? That's what I'm trying --",
  "That's quite good. What are you reading from?",
  "What are you reading from there?",
  "You mean everybody in the entire United States gets the same piece of paper.",
  "So it's identical. There is no difference between every individual's contract, every Federal employee's -- I guess it's a contract with the Federal employee. Isn't it? I mean, he's bound by it you say.",
  "All right. So I am -- in Alaska, Virginia, everywhere, they get the same piece of paper. They enroll and then they're bound by it.",
  "And the question here is whether that should get different interpretations possibly in different places.",
  "Well, why is this worse in that respect? And lots of things in the case that you have to prove may be hard to prove because it requires finding out what someone said to the defendant over the telephone, what happened 4 years ago in a room where the defendant was the only one now alive present. There are lots of cases like that. Traditionally in the law, I take it, it's been that most instances where the defendant excuses his conduct on the ground he wasn't morally culpable, mistake, accident, self-defense. Entrapment? Not -- that's a different kind of ground. This one? Evidence mixed. But you have to prove lots of things where it's really in the hands of the defendant, and the defendant saying I'm so innocent because I'm not morally culpable. I was asleep. I was -- you know, we can imagine. So I don't see why this is different.",
  "And that's going back to Justice Kennedy's question. I would look -- I guess if we're supposed to get the better rule, the first place I'd look is what did the Model Penal Code think. They think you should have the burden. Then I think has this turned into a practical problem in the 29 States that have had it for 20 to 40 years. And you say we don't have any evidence to that effect. Now, I've listed about four things here that I'd like your response to.",
  "But if we're thinking of things logically, logically you're right. I can see that this is in the hands of the defendant. But I've wondered why hasn't this turned into evidence of a problem in the 29 States. And the following occurred to me, which I'll put to you to see what your reaction is. The defense has to do something if they are going to put duress in issue. They have to get the defendant to testify. So the prosecutor has something that the prosecutor doesn't ordinarily get. He has that defendant right on the stand, ready for jury evaluation. And that is something a -- a prosecutor may want, and it's something the defense lawyer may not want. He has to choose.",
  "So when you get into the practicalities of it, I see things both ways, and I'd like to find some evidence of what's actually happened.",
  "If -- if does that --",
  "He has a few other things, the prosecutor. He has that defendant on the stand. There was an implication that you were in Chicago at the time.",
  "Where you on the night of such and such?",
  "And that's an advantage for the prosecutor.",
  "Well, that's why this is problematic.",
  "I mean, I don't have the experience as a criminal lawyer that allows me to say whether it would be one way or the other. You're saying -- and I'll repeat that. Is there anything at all I could look to try to figure this out? Because I think it is a question we're supposed to get the better rule. What did the Model Penal Code authors do? Did they take testimony --",
  "Did they have evidence or did they have -- take testimony? Did they go around trying to find out how prosecutors and defense attorneys -- you know. I don't know.",
  "What about mistake?",
  "I thought it was a deer.",
  "And would you distinguish between instances of duress where it may a negative mens rea and instances where it may not?",
  "Suppose we get through that. I see the artificial part. Just what is it? Piling Pelion on something or other. Mountains that you pile one on top of the other. But your opponents have cited in your brief -- in the brief on page 12 that counsel for Mohawk said to the court, specifically, Mohawk agrees that a corporation can be both a RICO person and part of an association-in-fact enterprise. Now, if we can overcome all these other problems --",
  "-- what do we do about that particular concession?",
  "Well, what -- what sense would it make on the merits to get your interpretation on the merits, which would mean, I guess, that five individuals could be an enterprise because that's a group of individuals.",
  "Five labor unions couldn't. Five corporations couldn't. One individual and four labor unions couldn't. One individual and four corporations couldn't. One individual and three partnerships couldn't. And -- but what -- what sense would that make?",
  "There is --",
  "Yes, but if we're trying to think of what they were getting at, it's possible that Congress was worried about organized crime taking over the pizza parlor or taking over a trades union or taking over a similar kind of enterprise. So that's what they're thinking about. Now, if we're thinking about that, they put in the word groups of individuals because they understand that organized crime could take over a group of individuals. Now, once you do that, you RICO-ize vast amounts of conspiracy law.",
  "But -- but they had no reason whatsoever for doing the same thing for what we have are associations of trade unions with each other or associations of -- of corporations with each other. And to do that, adding that in when it doesn't say that, would RICO-ize, with its treble damages and private plaintiffs and everything, vast amounts of ordinary commercial activity, not ordinary only in that, but importantly, a certain amount of criminal activity like passing bad checks or fraudulent behavior is involved. But Congress wouldn't have wanted to -- that has not to do with organized crime. That does not have to do with taking over legitimate enterprises. So read this, I think he's saying, to mean what it says most naturally. They're worried about groups of individuals. They're not worried about groups of corporations or groups of trade unions interacting with each other. And I'm trying to put the argument the other way, and I wanted see what you respond.",
  "You're -- you're willing to go this far with them. You say take those words, groups of individuals, and throw them away. And you're saying after we throw them away, they're still covered, and the reason that they're still covered is even though the word enterprise includes any individual, partnership, corporation, the word enterprise also includes groups of legal entities, groups of trades unions, groups of associations, even without that word group of individuals.",
  "All right. Now, is there any indication in the legislative history or anywhere else in the statute that this meaning of the word enterprise is what is intended, that is, that this meaning of the word enterprise went beyond what it says here, excluding group of individuals?",
  "Are there any dissents in any of those cases?",
  "But what he -- I -- I take it the ripeness issue is -- he delayed in bringing it because he wasn't certain what you'd do. And -- and one of the reasons, I think, would be that it's only recently there was an article in the Lancet --",
  "-- that says the -- in the opinion of the doctors who wrote it, a significant number of executed people are conscious when they die, and that's painful. And then it's been suggested there are ways around that. Just give them more sodium pentothal or have a doctor or somebody there to make certain the individual is unconscious at the time that the death- causing drugs take effect. All right. Now, that doesn't seem too difficult. Maybe it's difficult, but it doesn't seem too difficult. So why can't they think, you know, Florida -- they can read there too. They have people who read these articles, and indeed, maybe they'll just do it. They don't have any real interest in -- in causing suffering. Why don't they just do it? And so he thinks, up until the last minute, that maybe Florida will just do it, and lo and behold, when the death warrant is actually executed, it now begins to appear that they won't. And therefore, at that time, he brings the case. Now, I've spun out a story which seems probable, but if it's true, it would be very understandable why this wasn't ripe before the execution warrant is issued and thereafter it is. Now, what is your reply on the ripeness question?",
  "-- my -- my little story was inaccurate as to Florida or accurate as to Florida.",
  "Is the kind of thing I was explaining why it would be ripe I think -- is that accurate enough for the purposes of ripeness as to what happened in Florida?",
  "No.",
  "But in respect to that core position, I can understand the State's concern with the possibility of abuse. But in Nelson, what the Court says is it points to Gomez, and Gomez was a 1983 case. And there, the Court denied a stay of the execution because it looked into the history of the litigation, and they said that this particular individual had done just what worries you, though in a somewhat different context. He kept bringing the cases, and every time, you know, he'd lose. Then he'd think of another way of making the same point, and in your context, it would be first he challenges this method and he says there are others that are fine. So we go to another. Then he challenges that. Then he challenges that. Then he challenges that, always at the very last minute. So there's a case that provides a weapon if the abuse that you worry about occurs. So why do we need something else like an absolute rule of some sort that the Petitioner has to think of a method of execution, a matter on which he is not necessarily expert, that would turn out in the future to be not painful? I mean, you don't need to put on your overcoat and also turn up the heat.",
  "You've got the case that helps you if that occurs. Why do you need to argue for something else?",
  "Well -- well, why? But I mean, suppose he doesn't. Okay? But it's absolutely clear he's not saying all methods are unconstitutional. He's saying this method is unconstitutional. If he says this method of constitutional and he wins, then his challenge will not necessarily prevent the State from carrying out its execution. And, of course, I'm reading to you directly from Nelson v. Campbell. That would seem right in point. And why isn't that the end of this case?",
  "Yes, and if I bring a claim that my prison cell is so cold, I actually get pneumonia and die, or near it, and then I challenge the coldness of the cell, I'm preventing my confinement in one particular way.",
  "It's a cold cell. And so that would similarly, on your theory, be habeas, but we know it isn't.",
  "My cold cell is habeas?",
  "Why more than in Nelson?",
  "So you're saying -- saying then that the defense bar, the capital punishment bar, and the prisoners are the group of people that have to go and do the research on humane methods of putting people to death rather than the government.",
  "That strikes me as a little odd, doesn't it?",
  "Why?",
  "Old age. They'll come with that alternative, old age. Right?",
  "Sorry. I have laryngitis. Can you hear me all right?",
  "Why is it retroactive validation? I would have thought Segura and those cases are Silverthorne cases.",
  "All that it is is it's an independent chain of events.",
  "An independent chain of events that almost certainly would have led to the discovery of the evidence despite -- not without -- despite the unlawful entry. And if that's so, all we have is a -- is a set of cases where deterrence is most unlikely to play any significant role because no policeman could possibly count on that kind of thing getting the evidence in --",
  "Well, now you're talking about other cases in other courts. I looked through with my law clerks 300 cases since Weeks, not Mapp, Weeks. That's what we're talking about, 1914. I couldn't find in 300 cases one single Supreme Court case that did not suppress evidence where there was a Fourth Amendment violation with one exception. The exception is there are sets of cases where deterrence is really not a factor. For example, good faith; for example, it isn't going into a criminal proceeding. Okay? Now, what I'd like you to do is to tell me if I missed some, which is certainly possible, or second, if you want us to change the rule and go back 300 years or 300 cases back before 1914, or are you going to tell us that deterrence doesn't play a role here or whatever you want? I want to put to you the state of the art as far as I can see it.",
  "Well, there's a causal connection absolutely here. It is a but-for connection.",
  "This person being in the room and a child of 2 would know that if you get into a room, as a result of your being in that room, you're likely to find evidence. So it's both but for and it fits within the problem. There we are. That's the same, by the way, as it is with making a false oath to a magistrate. You make a false oath to a magistrate. That permits the magistrate to get into the house with -- the policeman gets in there with a warrant. It doesn't take the court long to suppress that. About a second. And -- and how -- how is this somehow different?",
  "No. We read Segura. We read Segura, which happens to be a case --",
  "He is not -- well --",
  "-- important exception. The exception which comes from Silverthorne is when there is an independent chain of events such that it will be -- not could be, but would be -- in fact, discovered anyway, despite the unlawfulness -- Silverthorne -- Holmes says, of course, you don't keep it out then because that's not going to impact deterrence. Now, that's Segura. That's Silverthorne. That's case after case. Of course, I accept that. And if you can show that this case somehow fits within that chain, fine. Then I -- then I maybe appear I have my mind made up on this, but I'm open to change.",
  "No, no. That's -- I -- I understand that point from your brief and I'm glad that you brought it up. But I have never -- I have never seen Fourth Amendment matters cut that finely. I have never seen the courts say I want to go back to the reason why this policeman is unlawfully in the room and then try to connect each piece of evidence with that reason. Rather, they ask is he unreasonably and unconstitutionally in the room. So my concern about that, which I'd like you to address, is if we took that approach, I think we'd be doing it for the first time, and we'd let a kind of computer virus loose in the Fourth Amendment. I don't know what the implications of that are. I can't tell you what you're saying is illogical. It's not illogical. It's conceivable, but it strikes me as risky and unprecedented.",
  "It's common, when you have a chain of causal connection, to say it ends somewhere. It's common, and in Harris, it ended once they left the home and now they're over in the station.",
  "This isn't over in the station. This is in the home. You speak of interests, but this doesn't interests. What about Boyd? I mean, the most famous statement in Fourth Amendment history to all invasions on the part of the government and its employees of the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life. It is not the breaking of his doors and the rummaging of his drawers that constitutes the essence of the offense. But it is the invasion of his indivisible right of personal security, personal liberty, and private property. Now, I thought -- 1886 -- that's what's governed these cases for about 100 -- and far more, a century and a half or a quarter. And -- and the -- then suddenly you say, well, it's this interest in the one or the other one. I mean, doesn't that describe it?",
  "Correct? I'm sorry. That is correct? I -- I thought that this warrant does not say you can enter the house without knocking. I mean, I have a warrant. This warrant lets me search the house in daytime. I search it in nighttime. Is my search authorized?",
  "I have a warrant --",
  "What -- what happens with my example? I'm curious. That's not a rhetorical question. I have a warrant which says, search 1618 5th Street. I search 1518 5th Street. Was it a warrant -- a warrant back search?",
  "I don't have a warrant to search 1518. I don't have a warrant that allows me to come in in the middle of the night when it says day, and I don't have a warrant here that allows me to come in without knocking. So where's the warrant?",
  "I don't see, anywhere in Mr. Schick's statement, at least from 165 to 170, where he says what you said he said. Now, maybe he says it some other place, but -- I'd like the reference to it -- but I -- what I have him as saying is that -- he says, for example, several times, \"The presence -- I don't suggest that the -- that the presence of religion, in itself, is totally mitigating.\" Well, it certainly wasn't, in this instance. I gather I'm right. Am I right in thinking that all this religious conversion took place before he murdered the girl? So, this is not a case of your trying to get some evidence that took place after the crime.",
  "All right. If - -",
  "-- that's right, then maybe it does more easily fit within factor (k). The prosecutor told the jury they should consider it, or they could. The judge told the jury they could consider it -- it sounded as -- says, \"You take it -- this is an example\" -- he says, \"It's an example in factor (k).\" Maybe he's wrong, but they certainly likely think they can consider it. And Mr. Schick doesn't say it's not in factor (k). At least, I don't see it. That's why I'm asking.",
  "No, no, I know the point of factor (k). I'm trying to be absolutely certain, before thinking --",
  "-- he didn't say it, that I've made every effort to get from you the place where -- that this -- where the defense counsel says, \"Jury, I agree, you cannot put this into factor (k).\"",
  "Were his words \"it doesn't constitute an excuse\"?",
  "-- \"in any way.\"",
  "Where?",
  "Thank you.",
  "But that's ambiguous. That's perfectly ambiguous. Because, the case of your client, it is a felony, and it is punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.",
  "No, that's - -",
  "-- right. But it is a felony under South Dakota law. And what the statute says -- and that's the Government's argument -- they say \"any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\" They don't mean, necessarily, any felony punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act.",
  "It might mean anything that is a - -",
  "-- felony, and - -",
  "-- it is also punishable; in which case, you lose. But, in the first case, you win.",
  "So, what am I supposed to look to, to decide which is --",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "Oh, but you don't mean that, because you're prepared to concede -- at least I thought you were, until your last argument -- you're prepared to concede that if a person engages in a crime that is punishable as a felony under South Dakota law, and it is also punishable as a felony under Federal law, under 801, et seq, well, that counts.",
  "Do you - -",
  "Do you concede that - -",
  "-- or not?",
  "You --",
  "-- you say your answer is, you don't make the concession?",
  "Do you work in - -",
  "-- this area?",
  "In the Southern - -",
  "In the -- have you ever heard of, or had, a client -- or heard of a person from Mexico who had been deported because he has been involved in drugs, and the Government wants to bring him back because he may be a witness -- maybe something develops, some other members of the gang are there, they'd like his information?",
  "So, if - -",
  "-- they pick up some friends of his who are engaged in drugs, the Government might decide to try to get him back.",
  "Well, it's conceivable, I guess, that people will break their parole. Often it doesn't happen; sometimes it does. Sometimes they want to get him back; sometimes they don't.",
  "I'm prepared to accept perfect ambiguity here, linguistically. And I thought of an empirical question, that you may know the answer to, that might shed some light. Now, going along the way -- maybe I'm making a mistake to point it out, if I am -- but I go to the key thing here, which is the words in 924(c), What is a \"drug-trafficking crime\"? A \"drug-trafficking crime\" is a crime -- \"any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\" That could mean an act, physically, that is a felony under some law, and is also punishable under the Controlled Substances Act as a misdemeanor. Okay? Felony under -- it could pick that up. And it also could mean any conduct which is punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act. And I could look at those words a thousand times and not have a clue which it means. So, I thought of an empirical test. This statute, 924(c), happens to be a statute that, if you engage in a drug-trafficking crime, as defined, and you have a gun with you, you get mandatory 5 years. That's the point of it. And the Government does all the prosecuting. So, in how many cases where a person committed a misdemeanor offense, simple possession, and had a gun, did the Government insist that they get the 5 - years minimum? Now, if you're prepared to tell me \"a lot of 'em,\" I'm prepared to tell you, the Government has consistently interpreted the statute the way you are now. But if you're prepared to tell me \"zero,\" I would say I would be suspicious of an interpretation that comes along now for the first time. And my mind is open on it. I'm quite interested in the answer.",
  "But if --",
  "No, no. We both agree. All - - everybody agrees here. It doesn't have to be a Federal crime.",
  "And --",
  "Correct, it doesn't have --",
  "-- to be. It could be conduct that violates the State law, but -- and punish it under the State law -- but the conduct involved would have to constitute what is a felony under the Controlled Substances --",
  "-- Act.",
  "A felony or a misdemeanor.",
  "Yes.",
  "All right.",
  "All right. So, I say it's suspicious.",
  "But why not?",
  "But 924(c)(1) says that if you have a gun, and you have a drug-trafficking crime, book, 5 years. Okay, now we go to two, what's a \"drug - trafficking crime\"? It means any felony punishable under the -- under the Controlled Substances Act. Now, in your definition, we first look to see whether simple possession is punishable under the -- in Controlled Substances Act. It sure is. It sure is. It's punishable as a misdemeanor. So, it meets that. Under your definition, is it a felony? Yup, it's a felony in South Dakota. Okay. So, now we've got a prosecution, in Federal Court in South Dakota. And, on your reading of the statute, that guy should get a bump-up of 5 years.",
  "Because?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes.",
  "But you still have to know whether that word, \"felony,\" in (2) means \"any felony punishable as a felony under the Controlled\" - -",
  "-- \"Substances Act.\"",
  "And there - -",
  "Yeah. You have to know the answer to that.",
  "Now, is -- if -- I guess there are three possible positions on the question of whether a licensee can attack a contract, a patent where he has a license and wants to keep the contract. One, he can never do it. Two, he can always do it. Three, it depends on what the contract says. Now, do any of those questions have anything to do with the question before us, which is whether it is a case or controversy?",
  "All right. If we were to reach the question, which is very interesting, \"What is the Government's position as to which of those three positions is the right position?\" -- were we to reach it -- I agree with you, I don't see it in front of us; but maybe it is -- if it were, what would be your view?",
  "All right. So, basically, though, you're not certain. The Government's view would be, it is a matter as to whether you can sue claiming the patent is invalid, whether the licensee can do it, that probably -- but you're not certain, and you haven't made up your mind definitely, because it is not in this case - - but you think it's going to be something they could regulate themselves by contract.",
  "Shouldn't we send that back? I mean, I thought we were here to decide one question, that the Federal Circuit has said that, \"Unless there is a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit, you can't bring a declaratory judgment action, because of the Constitution of the United States.\" Now, I have to admit, I've looked up, or I've had my law clerk look up, probably now hundreds of cases, and we can't find, in any case, such a requirement. Indeed, the very purpose -- as I -- we've just heard the SG say, of this act, the Declaratory Judgment Act, seems to be to allow people who -- a contract -- who are in a real concrete disagreement, to get a declaratory judgment without getting rid of the contract. But I might be wrong about that. But you've now argued a different point.",
  "So, isn't the right thing for us to do, to decide the issue in front of us and then send it back? If you're right that they have to pay, whether they win or lose; if they're right that they promise not to sue; if you're right on 14 other grounds, you might win. But should we decide those grounds today? Why?",
  "Let's suppose - -",
  "Well - -",
  "Will you assume Justice Stevens' hypothetical? Assume it, take it as given. They did put that in. I know you think they didn't, but I want to assume it.",
  "Now, I'd like to also assume - -",
  "The hypothetical is - -",
  "-- that they write into the contract -- the party who's the licensee says, \"And we stipulate that the licensee thinks that the patent is invalid.\" Nonetheless, the licensee wants a license, for business reasons. Therefore, the licensee and the licensor agrees that, after they sign the contract and he's paying a thousand dollars a month in royalties, he can go into court and challenge the patent.\" So, we assume that's written into the contract.",
  "And now, let us also assume a state of the law. The state of the law is that there is no public policy or any other policy that forbids such a condition in a contract. All right? Now, on those two assumptions, the next thing that happens is that the licensee asks for a declaratory judgment that the patent is invalid. On those assumptions, is there a case or controversy under the Federal Constitution? If not, why not?",
  "But he says, by the way, \"If I win, I will, in fact, save $42 billion a year in licenses\" --",
  "-- \"I would other have to pay.\" And the other side will -- or -- I was a thousand dollars, I meant 42 billion, okay?",
  "No. Now, that's - -",
  "I'm not asking - -",
  "-- your hypothetical.",
  "I'm asking - -",
  "-- my hypothetical.",
  "It is - -",
  "-- it is, under other fields of the law, isn't it? I mean, I imagine that the very -- we see, all the time, declaratory judgments where a State passes a law and the individual says, \"Well, I think this is unconstitutional, but my preferences are not to go to jail; my preferences are not to be penalized. So, my first choice is unconstitutional and my second is to obey it.\" There's no possibility in the world that he will violate that law. And yet, we've often held that, with regulations, you have to have the other requirements. You have to have the requirements that it's concrete, it's not just ideological, there's real harm. But, if those other requirements that are fulfilled, I've never seen any where it said that there also has to be a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit in the absence of the declaratory judgment. I've just never found that phrase, and I can't imagine why it would be part of the law.",
  "And you say there has never been a declaratory judgment action, except in the instance where, in the absence of the action, the person would have violated the law, if it's a Government law. In other words, if they're -- so, it's really not - -",
  "Yes.",
  "As I think as we - -",
  "-- both know - -",
  "-- in the Government area, it happens - -",
  "-- a lot.",
  "Yes.",
  "You haven't. Maybe -- if this doesn't clarify it. I think everyone has about the same question. You have a bunch of pay phone operators. And if the AT&T were charging them too much, I think everybody would say that the FCC can say, hey, that's too much. You owe them 2 cents a call refund, and everybody would agree that the people who are hurt could go into court and bring a lawsuit and get the 2 cents. Right under 47 U.S.C. 201(b). Now, the only difference here seems to be that it wasn't AT&T that was charging, in my example, too much. They weren't paying what they owed. They should have paid what they owed. And that, says the FCC, is, under 201(b), an unreasonable practice. And, therefore, go in and collect it in court. Now, what is the answer to that? So far I have heard nothing that suggests that this couldn't be an unreasonable practice under 201(b), which is just what the FCC said it was. Now, what's wrong with what I said? I'm simply trying to focus you upon what I think is the question that's bothering some of us.",
  "So, my answer -- not answer, but my characterization of what you have just said is that the FCC did say it was an unreasonable practice. But in your view, it was not an unreasonable practice not to pay. And you want us to go back and second-guess, which we could, if their view of unreasonable practice is unreasonable itself. And I guess you would have to overturn it. I didn't know that was what the case was about, but are you saying now that that's the issue? They said it was an unreasonable practice not to pay this money, you think it is a reasonable practice not to pay the money. There is a dispute. That's what we should do.",
  "Okay. Then what should we do?",
  "Just like AT&T when, in fact -- or any other utility that, in fact, runs into situations every day of the week, where but for an FCC regulation, they would not be overcharging, because they have a way of doing it that isn't on its face unjust. But the FCC writes some regulations and now it is unjust. So I guess to take that argument would overturn, I guess, about a hundred years of rate making law. Wouldn't it?",
  "So in other words, you are saying -- I think it is common that the FCC might write some accounting rules, for example. And they might say, before these accounting rules, Mr. Bell's system in San Francisco, you could charge people 8 cents a call. But given the way we set up the accounting rules, we think this month you have to do 7 cents in the first six months, 7 cents, in the next six months, 9 cents. And any deviation from that is unreasonable. And the company does deviate. I would have always thought when they do deviate, they are behaving unreasonably, and someone who pays too much could go into court and get money back. Am I wrong about that?",
  "That's actually -- that's, I think, your strong -- to me that was the strongest argument. When I finished reading it, I thought, well, so what. You know, I mean, can you see why I thought that? I mean, today's rule is different. It is true that you don't have simply a single telephone company providing service ultimately directly to the customer. You have everything mixed up. And there are a lot of inter-carrier things. Language covers it. Purpose covers it. Facts and circumstances change.",
  "Is it possible -- I was worried somewhat about, I think, the problem Justice Scalia raised, that old regulations become unjust and unreasonable. And then I thought, no, but tell me if this is right. That they're going to fall within 201(b) only if a violation is unjust and unreasonable. Now, we could say, and moreover, the FCC has to find that a violation of these rates is unjust and unreasonable, that is, it has to focus on it, make that determination. And then, of course, that determination has to be a reasonable interpretation. In other words, it can't just call anything unjust and unreasonable - -",
  "And it has to focus on the fact that their doing so will create this private remedy in the courts.",
  "That that -- if you have that tough -- which I haven't seen anywhere, but I mean, if you had that tough a requirement, so they actually have to focus on it, it would tend to minimize the problem of a thousand different actions in ten thousand different courts and a big mess. But I mean, how much is written into those words unjust and unreasonable? I'm certain you can't squeeze any rate -- it is not the case that any and every regulation can be -- fall within.",
  "Yeah - -",
  "As we're supposed to decide the case, in your view, there was instruction 13. Instruction 13 used the word direct.",
  "You object to 13. You said it should use the word in whole or in part.",
  "You then argued to the lower courts, 13 should use the word in whole or in part. And then you say you've argued that here. So what you're saying is now we're supposed to decide, should instruction 13 use the word in whole or in part. That's what it is. I have to admit, I didn't quite get that out of the blue brief. I thought you were arguing something else about railroad negligence. But you're not now, you say, arguing about railroad negligence. You're arguing about plaintiff negligence.",
  "All right. So if I reread the blue brief, what I'll discover on closer examination, that your real objection, not responding to the other side, has simply been about the standard to use in respect to plaintiff's contributory negligence. And what you want this Court to say is, you're right about that, we want the more relaxed standard used for contributory negligence. End of case.",
  "Yes?",
  "It says that in the blue brief?",
  "I would say it sure is before the Court, because what we are considering before the Court is your objection to instruction 13. And you said it should use the words in whole or in part. And I have to admit, I don't know why it shouldn't. But I'll have to ask them that.",
  "You're going to say yes. So all this other stuff is quite extraneous about whether -- the railroad standard of negligence, the railroad should be in a relaxed standard of negligence, in whole or in part.",
  "Causation.",
  "I think I'm seeing now, I think the structure of your brief is -- perhaps a gloss put on it, but saying this: Look, we objected to the contributory negligence instruction on the ground that it couldn't be different from the direct instruction -- from the railroad instruction. And we said they should be the same and they should both be in whole or in part.",
  "And we now want you to say that the refusal of the court to do that was wrong, because it violated the equivalence. But as soon as you do that, you're going to have to think about what the right standard should be for a new trial.",
  "And if you stop there, probably, they will put the in whole or in part, but that's not the right standard.",
  "And if you really think about it, you will see that the one we didn't ask for, but the one that the court gave, is the right standard and should have been given in the other case, too. Now, we wouldn't have to say that.",
  "But you're saying unless you say that, you're not going to give proper instruction to what happens in the future. Now - -",
  "Now let's think back for a minute on the merits.",
  "How could it be wrong? How could it be wrong to have instructed the jury with the in whole or in part language for the railroad, since that's the language of the statute itself?",
  "What possible -- you have two sides. One, you write a proximate cause instruction in whatever language you like.",
  "The other side submits a proposed instruction with in whole or in part. I'm a trial judge. I've never heard of this case, kind of case before. I just was appointed. I read the statute. And I say, well, here, theirs says what the statute says, and yours doesn't. I'll play it safe. I'll go with the statute. All right? Now, how could that be an error?",
  "All right.",
  "In other words, what the statute said it is not a correct statement of the law?",
  "I guess they want to make the argument now, whether they did or not, that if we look at Section 53, which I think is the part dealing with contributory negligence. I don't see anything else. It doesn't speak of causation at all.",
  "It just says if there's some contributory negligence, the damages will be diminished according to the negligence attributable to the employee. So I take it their argument was, maybe with hindsight, Judge, don't give this direct language, because nothing requires it. And since, other things being equal, nothing requires it, you ought to give the same language you gave for the other side. And they said the judge rejected that argument, so now they tell us, well, that was wrong, he should have accepted it. And all the rest of what he's saying is just in case the Court wants to reach it, or something like that. But what about that one?",
  "Well, I mean, should we answer the question he now -- perhaps in his minimalist position -- might want to raise, or maybe did, that Section 53 doesn't speak of causation, the judge gave a causation instruction. The judge's causation instruction in their view was wrong, and the law requires the judge's causation instruction on contributory negligence, if there is one, to be the same as it was on direct, the defendant's negligence. And he says that isn't what happened, we objected to it, we produced arguments, one of them was this equivalence thing. So he's saying to us: Decide it, say that they were wrong. What's your view of that?",
  "I'm not surprised.",
  "No, no. That's just an argument.",
  "It was not, but they say, nonetheless, we did object that this instruction was wrong. One reason it was wrong is because it speaks of causation differently than when they spoke of causation in respect to the railroad. We thought that was a reason why it was wrong then. We think that's a reason why it is wrong now, and we would like the Missouri court, but they wouldn't do it, so we want you to say it was wrong for that reason.",
  "Oh, we say, well, we'll abandon all that, that's just a series of different arguments that we'd like the Court to say.",
  "If you read it carefully, you'll see it, basically.",
  "As to the element, I thought that what the Ninth Circuit talked about was overt act. They didn't use the words \"overt act.\"",
  "Yes, all right. I thought that comes out of conspiracy law; it doesn't even out of attempt law. Then I thought it's unlikely -- but here you can correct me. The U.S. Code is filled with the word \"attempt.\" Just opening it at random, there are attempts to assault and steal mail matter, there are attempts to steal the mail matter, there are attempts to rob a bank, attempts here, attempts there. Is it the Government's practice whenever they charge a violation of any of these provisions to not just use the word \"attempt,\" but to use the words \"substantial step\"?",
  "I would have thought the answer was no. And therefore, this isn't just a small error of a technical sort. The Ninth Circuit is completely wrong and not even close. And therefore, if they're not even close, can the Government come up here where there's an obvious error and they decide, the Government, that it would like to have a declaration by this Court on a matter that they think is quite interesting and important to them in a lot of other cases where they can't win the cases easily? That's, I'm putting it a little pejoratively because I'm trying to get you to see what I'm driving at. It's like a hoked-up case. Why not? I'm using it pejoratively only so that you can see what I'm worried about.",
  "Does this come up very often? I think the case -- the issue you want to raise, because I would think normally there's a motion before the trial, well before the jury is empanelled. The defendant says: I want you to dismiss this; the indictment's inadequate. And if that's even close, I would think normally the prosecutor would go back and say: Fine, I'll get a superseding indictment, and that would end the problem. And it seems to me so likely to happen that the chances of the judge wrongly ruling against the defendant and then it goes through a whole trial almost never happens.",
  "Doesn't an indictment have as its purpose in part to tell the defendant what crime he's being accused of committing? Isn't that -- so that's why I thought it would be quite clear, wouldn't it, or helpful to say that to the Ninth Circuit? And so an error is when it doesn't do that? And an error is when it leaves out an element, and he doesn't know what crime is being committed, he's accused of. So suppose you had an indictment that really did that. Now he doesn't know what crime he's accused of. And then you go to the trial and so forth and now we have to go into at what point did he work out what crime he was being accused of, rather hard to say.",
  "Well, yes, of course the chances are. But there's a possibility he didn't.",
  "So if he didn't and therefore the indictment was faulty in that respect, then what? Are you going to say we have to track down -- I mean what it's reminding me of is like trying to say whether he got an adequate lawyer, didn't get an adequate lawyer, who knows, that kind of problem.",
  "-- me until halfway through the trial that it was robbery I was being accused of because they left robbery out of the indictment.",
  "Suppose -- suppose we found out. Somebody told what happened, and it was a crime of bank robbery or it's an assault of a mailman, a postman. And you know, it turns out they didn't present one word of evidence, not a word that says that this individual who was assaulted had anything to do with the mail. There's complete absence of any evidence whatsoever on a major element of the offense. And now, suppose we get finished with the trial. Plenty of evidence. Conviction. Can you go back and raise that?",
  "No. No. I mean can you win.",
  "Yeah.",
  "I mean, you see, I'm saying is that error? Is that correctible error? I'm saying there is an absolute error. It is far worse than here. We know for a certainty there was no evidence whatsoever presented to the grand jury on a major element of the crime.",
  "Yes, I assume we know that. Take that as a given. We know.",
  "Yeah, we know.",
  "Yes. Zero.",
  "Yes, but what is the answer to my question, yes or no? I'm saying after the - -",
  "That's right. So the answer is no?",
  "And if you can't raise that, which is a major area because there's a harmless error is what it really amounts to, why isn't the same true here where the error is far more likely to be simply technical and make no difference given the adequacy of the evidence?",
  "It does as well in my case.",
  "Can't you ask for a bill of particulars?",
  "Well, then you would have had no problem.",
  "That's a separate requirement. I don't know if it's constitutional or not constitutional, but I didn't think that requirement was at issue here. The requirement of stating the facts is not the requirement of setting out the elements of the law. At least that's my understanding. Now, you can correct me if I'm wrong.",
  "No, I'm not denying that. I just didn't think that had anything to do with this case. I mean, I thought that the object of the indictment initially was to set forth what crime the person was accused of and inform him of that. You are saying, and then there is another requirement, which seems a little vague. It's been hard for me to find out, to pin this down, and it's the one you state, which is that it says in addition in the rule you have to have facts. I don't know if those are the same. I thought they were two separate things.",
  "That's exactly what I -- I tried to read some treatises on this, and the more I read, the more confused I got. I started out thinking, well, it's sufficient if you have bank robbery you say on October 14, 2004, in the city of such and such, at the corner of such and such, where there is a bank, the defendant walked into the bank and he, he attempted or he did by force or threat of force, take property belonging to someone else, or whatever it is, and that that would be sufficient. And that you don't have to say, and in addition he, you know, what the force consisted of, did it consist of a knife, or a gun, or a fist. Can you give me some enlightenment, at least if you think that's relevant here?",
  "If it's excessive detail, the central fact, then why isn't on such and such a date at such and such a time he attempted to?",
  "All right. Then why, if that's so, why wouldn't that apply as well if they said he attempted to and committed an overt act in -- that is a substantial step. And then you're saying in addition, they have to list the particular facts.",
  "I couldn't find any case in this Court that said that. I mean, I found in Hamling a case that went the other way, a general statement. They said all you have to do is say obscenity, you don't have to say how obscene or in what way it's obscene, et cetera.",
  "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then Russell seems lost from sight for quite a while, or isn't followed a lot.",
  "Suppose that it's an assault and the indictment says on such and such a day, at such and such a time, he assaulted the postman, right? You also have to say what, that he waved his fist or that he had a knife? You have to say that in the indictment?",
  "No. All right. So I thought normally essential facts means simply the facts -- you can state the essential facts by writing the statute and normally that tells you. Now, is that true? One case that seems to go the other way is Russell.",
  "Normally, yes.",
  "Why more than any other word in the statute? \"Attempt,\" people know what that means.",
  "And they also know what \"assault\" means. And if you tried, you could spell out \"assault.\" They know what \"robbery\" means, but you could spell it out. So why does the Ninth Circuit think this one you have to spell out, but all the other words you don't have to?",
  "But does it say that the only basis for a judge reasonably imposing the higher term is that the judge has found a fact that the jury didn't find.",
  "It does say that? As I read the California opinion, they can go up above the lower, the middle term for any reason, but it has to be reasonable.",
  "Maybe that's hard to justify in terms of California's statute, but we take the California Supreme Court's interpretation of that statute as the law of California. So what is the answer to my question as you read Black?",
  "I think -- let me give you - -",
  "If that is your answer, my example will be -- I'll give you a specific example. One example is the question of consecutive versus concurrent sentences, which may have very little to do with facts. A second example might be that a judge in a particular community says there's been an unbelievable rash of breaking and entering. I see how the writers of this guideline, of the statute that embodies it, thought that breaking and entering was X, occurred with X frequency, but we have in this community a sudden rash of crime, such that I think the reasonable thing to do is to increase the sentence as a deterrent. Now, suppose that's what he writes. And is there anything in California law, as you understand Black, that makes that unlawful?",
  "What?",
  "Which statements make that unlawful?",
  "So in other words, when they say mandatory factor, they mean aggravating factor, they mean to exclude the kind of aggravating factor I just mentioned.",
  "Oh, could he? Could the judge consider the fact that I just mentioned, that there's been an extraordinary rash of breaking and entering in the vicinity?",
  "Yes or no?",
  "Unenumerated factors. So mine would be an unenumerated factor.",
  "All right. If he can consider unenumerated factors -- now, I purposely picked mine because I take it it is an example of a factor that Apprendi would not require a jury to find. It is a factor about the community. It is not a factor about this defendant. It is not a factor about the manner in which this defendant committed the crime. It is not a fact of that kind.",
  "But if it were reasonable, it would be upheld, or not?",
  "Well, to be quite -- to expose my thinking on it, I found it rather ambiguous, pages 1260 and 1261. Is that what -- the first part of that is -- it says what you said. I have no doubt. It says just what you said. But then you get over to the part, the discussion of Booker, and when they start talking about Booker, they seem to say, seem to say, that they're adopting what Booker says. Now, if they are adopting what Booker says, that means, and that's why I used my example, that I guess a judge would have the power, if it is reasonable, to just say the guideline, though it says thus and so, isn't right for my circumstance. And therefore, I don't adopt it. And that would be reviewed for reasonableness, his decision not to follow it. And similarly, we have cases, for example, where they're trying to construct a sentence and they can't get it right because of the consecutive/concurrent nature, so he adds a few things on, you see, to the sentence, in order -- and then makes them concurrent. Or you could have things where it is a very sophisticated conspiracy, and the jury found the conspiracy. It is a characterization of a conspiracy, it is very sophisticated. And I thought, well, maybe all three of those are reasons for going up in California. And I read those pages, 1260, 1261, and my honest opinion is I'm not sure.",
  "An aggravating factor means aggravating fact.",
  "That's interesting. Are there, in fact -- what's your estimate, guess, as to how many criminal jury-tried cases in California, what percent have two juries? Have more than one jury?",
  "In what percentage would you say they have bifurcated or several jury trials? I mean, more than just one.",
  "No, no, but how many, how many times do they -- let me call it impaneling the jury twice, or two juries, or it could be the same one.",
  "Yes. What percentage would you guess? Just make a rough -- roughest conceivable guess.",
  "It wouldn't necessarily be a fact. It could be a fact. What it says in here is that if the -- they speak of a circumstance related to the crime, or the offender. And in a case in which no such aggravating factor can be found, the judge cannot impose the upper term. Now, I grant you there's some language that I -- it seems to me on the next few paragraphs, seems to say something a little different. But that language, if you just take that, seems to say, unless, Judge, you find a fact about the situation that would make it reasonable to go above the middle range, you can't, under the law. Now, if that's what it says, I have to admit, I find it a little difficult to distinguish from Blakely and other cases where I dissented, but the Court's law is what the majority says. So that seems to me almost like it, unless you can tell me that I'm wrong in that.",
  "Well, that's critical, and that's what I didn't understand about - -",
  "It's appendix page 3 in the brief.",
  "What do I do here? Because the sentence I read to you seems to say the opposite. But then, two sentences on, they list, the Federal judge is not bound by the guidelines, he must consult the guidelines. And after they say, an aggravating California -- it says the discretion available -- the -- in California law, that may include any fact that the judge reasonably determines to be relevant. The Determinate Sentencing Law, about an upper term, is comparable to Booker's requirement that a Federal judge's sentencing decision not be unreasonable. Well, I assumed until this minute that the first statement trumped the second. But now when I see the court rule, certainly that court rule is possible, given that to be read as permitting them, particularly with the second statement, you could read the second statement as saying, yes, they can say a particular instance or a kind of sentence seemingly mandated at the middle level is, in this community, so contrary to the purposes of punishment that I'm giving a higher one. To be honest, I don't know what Black means.",
  "So what we have -- now, this has clarified it, but I don't know what to do. I think if I read the opinion the way you're saying, I would say the California court, which is a good court, conscientious, managing a huge system of criminal law in the state, probably bigger than the Federal system, reads Blakely and they see that those guidelines in California as previously understood were violated. And they're thinking, how do we maintain this system as constitutional. And therefore, they write 1261, which can be read as saying we're Bookerizing it, and we come as close to Booker as necessary to make it constitutional. Now, that would be an understandable judicial reaction, and I can read the opinion as saying that, at which point I'm not certain what we're supposed to say, because I have no doubt that your unease reflects the fact that prior to Black, in California, it would have been pretty unheard of for a judge to depart upward on grounds other than factual grounds related to the circumstances of the crime or offender. But I also have no doubt that this opinion is written to try to save the California system. All right, so now what do I do?",
  "So it is comparable to Booker. And then in the preceding four paragraphs, they correctly describe Booker?",
  "Why couldn't there be here? I mean, at some point, at some point, seeing every judge in this case say this is a thoroughly -- no, let me not exaggerate. But they say wearing buttons is a bad idea. For obvious reasons. Now, at some point, if enough judges say that, each time they say, well, it is a bad idea, but we can't say in this case that it was so prejudicial, there's that inherent risk that it's unconstitutional. But if some point, if people begin enough is enough to say, this is quite a bad idea to have buttons being worn in a courtroom, which is not a place for demonstration, does it not become pretty clear, irrespective of exactly what opinions say what, that this is just very unfair and unconstitutional?",
  "Absolutely right. Suppose you think in this Federal court, which we are, that banners, posters, and buttons are a thoroughly bad idea. Now, why? Not just because of decorum. But because they introduce an extraneous factor into the judgment of the jury. And suppose I also think -- I'm not saying I do, I'm trying this out -- but it is pretty hard to draw lines among buttons. It is pretty hard to draw lines among banners. And the only way to guarantee fair trials in whole -- is to have a wholesale rule on this. No buttons, no banners, no petitions, no posters. How would you explain -- you just say the law just doesn't permit that.",
  "What do you want to say about that? Because that is a concern I have.",
  "I thought the key sentence in this is he says the simple photograph of Tom Studer on a button which -- I don't know what the size is. Nobody has told them what the button is about. Nobody has put for the judge a picture of it. Nobody showed him what the button is. So he says a simple photograph of Tom Studer was unlikely to have been taken as anything other than the normal grief occasioned by the loss of a family member. Period. Now, what else is there to say? That's the court's conclusion. And it is pretty hard for me -- I looked for the button. I couldn't even find the button in the record. I didn't even know what this looks like. It is a button, somebody later must have said two inches to four inches. I don't know who said that. I don't know how the judge could have known that. The button isn't in the record. So why isn't it just a normal sign of grief unlikely to influence anybody? That's what they say.",
  "In this case.",
  "It goes on frequently in an opinion. I have been known to do that myself. And I say this court over here says it's a da-da-da, and I say \"sure isn't that.\" Well, what is it?",
  "Well, what was the -- what in your opinion -- this is why -- as you can see, I'm concerned about buttons. I think they're probably a problem. I think all judges are concerned about them. But then I think about this particular case. And I look at that single sentence: \"It was unlikely to be taken as a sign of anything other than normal grief.\" I mean, suppose this had been a different case. Suppose the defense in this case was the defendant Smith didn't pull the trigger. It was an unknown person called Jones. Then if I were on the jury, I would look out, see the buttons, and I'd say, hmmm, the family thinks it was Smith. Otherwise they wouldn't be here with those buttons. I could think that. But this isn't that case. This is a case where everyone thinks your client pulled the trigger. The only question is whether the family's son came at him with a machete. So when I look at the buttons, I'd think sure, they don't think the son came at him with -- I mean, they don't think that. He's their son. What would you expect them to think? So that's why I thought that they are saying that sentence, in this case. In this case, it would be taken as sign of grief and nothing more.",
  "This reason -- suppose, hypothetically, I would think -- well, the rule should be no buttons. No buttons, no signs, no banners. A courtroom is a place of fair trial, not a place for a demonstration of any kind. Now, if I were to think that, and I also were to think it's just too difficult to figure out case by case whether there is or is not an improper influence, suppose I thought both of those things. Now, you've heard, quite rightly, the other side says: One, you're supposed to decide whether this was clear in the law. Two, if you're worried about the future, you can't lay down a rule that's clear in the law either because of A, AEDPA, and B, the case that was cited, which said it's holdings that count, not dicta. All right. You write for me the words I'm supposed to put on paper to achieve your position.",
  "If that's your answer, can I go back to the other main issue for a second? I would have thought that your case, unfortunately for you in my mind, is the classic case where there should be jurisdiction because the AG is supposed to say look, I don't think anything happened, okay? So he was doing his job all day. But if something did happen, I'll tell you what, it was within the scope of his employment. And apparently, that's just what they did say here. And then it got mixed up in the courts below. In other words, if he made some phone calls and even if he mentioned the employee, even if he said something improper, it was within the scope of his employment, which is just what they said. So because of that, it seems to me this makes a lot of complexity out of nothing. Now you explain what your answer is.",
  "In the district court he didn't say, if something happened here, it was in the scope of his employment? I thought he had. Maybe he hadn't. I thought he had, but I'll ask him that.",
  "In the district court I thought he said that.",
  "Well, it was there first, but you can argue in the defense alternative, I think nothing happened. But if the plaintiff can convince a jury otherwise, fine, but then what they can convince him of is within the scope of his employment. Now did that happen in the district court, that they said something like that or not?",
  "Well, why can't they do that, which is just what Wood says they can do, if anybody, you know, thinks that's valid? But the - - what's the problem then? Because I would have thought that the reason this case appears difficult is because yours is a case where the AG should be able to come in and remove it.",
  "But it's wrong in that, isn't it?",
  "I mean, the Wood issue was the issue of where if anything happened, of course it's outside the scope. It's like one employee shoots another, you know. There is nothing to do with scope of employment there, it's plainly outside. And of course, this act, in my view then, then, was that this is not an act that allows the AG to defend that kind of thing. But if it's arguable at least that something happened, if it happened at all it was within the scope of employment, the AG can defend it.",
  "What's the problem with - - there should be a problem with what I say from your point of view, so - -",
  "So you're saying they have abandoned the argument?",
  "So that's the issue then. And what I -- is my, my question for you is this, let's imagine not this case, which as I said I think is too complicated and probably is one that the Government should be able to defend, but suppose it's an assault like Wood's, a sexual assault and there is absolutely no doubt that if it happened it was outside the scope of employment, everybody concedes it but Government. And the Government's position is, nothing happened. All right? Nothing happened. You say Government, would you like to argue that if something happened, and they may be able to prove something, something like a movement? No, we agree there was nothing like that, we agree nothing like that happened; we are not going to defend on any scope of employment ground. All we are arguing is that ordinary work went on and that was within the scope of employment. Now, does this act cover it or not? Your view is yes and you read, you know I thought it was a close question but you read what I thought the other way in Wood, though it was obviously a close question. So what is your basic response to that?",
  "The basic point I think in Wood is this. I'm the district judge. And the Government, you come in and argue in the alternative. Nothing happened, but if it did happen it was within the scope of employment and they say there is no possibility. You'd say, plaintiff, I want to know here if there is a reasonable chance, maybe any chance, that a jury could find that something went on here that was within the scope of employment that shouldn't have. And if the answer to that question is no, the defendant wins either because of summary judgment or because -- no, sorry. I've gotten lost in what I said. Do you follow it?",
  "All right. Good, I'm glad that someone did.",
  "I was talking really about practicality of it. I don't think you can give me a case that is going to be hard for me as a district judge to decide because I'm going to ask you, the Government, to tell me if anything went on here that might have been within the scope of employment. And I look at what you're saying; if you say no, if you say no you can't defend it. If you say yes, you can defend it and that's going to be the end of it as long as your view is based on a reasonable reading of the record.",
  "And as long as a jury could find that there is a view of the record such that the plaintiff might prove something wrong that it was within the scope of employment, such as finger wagging that hits her forehead, for example, you can defend it. What's the problem?",
  "The only problem is if you admit that you can't prove anything like that.",
  "No, not a fortiori, for the reason that Congress wrote this statute not to give the defendant the right to call in the Government to defend him no matter what he did. The reason that Congress wrote the statute was to repeal the Westfall case, which was a question of the scope of immunity, which was the question of the scope of Government responsibility to take away that limited determination in Westfall. That was the only point. Congress could have written a statute the way. What's your response to that?",
  "Right, but that's the strongest argument I thought the other way initially, that suppose the issue is whether he is on a frolic of his own. That you resolve in a bench trial. If the answer he was, okay, it stays in the Federal court anyway. I understand that. But if you're going to take your position whether, say, it's a sexual assault as it was in Wood and the question is well, was there a sexual assault or not, and if there was it's clearly outside of the scope of employment, well, then you're going to have all these things resolved in a bench trial and actually it's supposed to normally be before a jury, for example.",
  "Probably the reason they do this is that there are lots and lots of claims by prisoners in Federal courts that are hard to decipher. They don't know what it's about. They don't want to put the defendant to the burden of coming in in every single complaint when it's quite a good probability it's about nothing. That's the kind of reasoning that would lead to a rule like this. So -- and then you have the statute and the statute says indeed there's a special power here to dismiss if it's frivolous or it doesn't state a claim or malicious. So why isn't this just an exercise of the Sixth Circuit's or a court's ordinary subsidiary rulemaking powers? They're trying to figure out how to manage their docket.",
  "So your point would be that they can do this if we amend the Federal Rules. If it's a problem take it to the Rules Committee?",
  "Why does it hurt if you dismiss the whole thing? They could just refile.",
  "No. No. What would happen is you just dismiss the complaint. So -- I guess again the reason they have these things is they get a certain number of complaints, they have no idea what it sys, to tell you the truth, they don't know what the claim is, they don't understand it, there are a lot of things written here; the person wasn't represented; it's hard to make out. And for, the judge thinks I have to go through all these papers; I have to figure out if there is something here that was exhausted, we know something happened; it was something exhausted -- so the simplest thing is just dismiss it. Now the prisoner can always refile it with the parts that he has to now figure out were exhausted. Now is -- and it doesn't hurt because, just refile it.",
  "Is that true? Or what happens?",
  "No, well, the reason it would hurt is because it's difficult for the judge to go though this complaint that he can't quite make sense out of. And it puts the burden of the prisoner to go through and figure out what he really wants to say. That's why -- that's why it's easier for the judge just to dismiss it than to go through many, what could be many pages with a fine-toothed comb trying to figure out if there is anything here that was exhausted.",
  "Basically, I mean you've heard the question and so forth. It seems to me that my questions and certainly others were based on certain empirical premises that might be true, might not be true. So why isn't this a question for the Rules Committee? Why not go to the Rules Committee if this really is a burden and so forth, rather than doing something unusual, which is to make exhaustion something other than an affirmative defense, to dismiss the whole complaint, which appear to be rules that reached draconian results in a few cases anyway.",
  "It could be, because the statute of limitations could have run. So it depends. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. But my basic question here, isn't this a matter for the Rules Committees rather than for the Sixth Circuit to go off on its own?",
  "I think Y is Mr. Gearin.",
  "Can I ask you -- are you finished?",
  "I wanted to know what you think about a suggestion that I got from something that Justice Scalia said. I don't know whether he was making it or not, but I'll make the suggestion and see what you think. Suppose that this case -- suppose we were to say, there are many issues in this case, some of them very difficult, but one thing we're certain about: You cannot in a trial consistent with the due process clause in a trial of plaintiff versus defendant take money from the defendant and give it to the plaintiff for the purpose of punishing the Defendant for something he did to a different person who wasn't there. Now -- so he couldn't defend against him. That person didn't present a claim. So we are certain of that. Now, we're not certain whether that's what happened here. It may have done. There is certainly a lot of language to suggest it, and there is some language the other way. So we remand it to the court with that instruction that they cannot permit this to have happened if it happened. Whether it happened and what happened is a matter of Oregon law in large part and things about instructions, etc. Now, what's your view of that kind of disposition?",
  "Maybe, but it's possible the Oregon court would say: Well, no instructions are perfect, but -- and no set of jury instructions is perfect. But if we look at the jury instructions without the suggested one that was rejected and then we look at the suggested one, we find the suggested one had many things wrong with it, not just, you know, problems, confusion, et cetera. We find the instructions weren't perfect but, given Oregon evidentiary law, we think the trial judge made reasonable decisions, therefore okay.",
  "I don't know. That's what worrying me, what's worrying me about this is I see as we try to determine what this instruction said, whether it was good enough, whether the instructions without it are good enough, that we're going to be in a kind of bog of mixtures of constitutional law, unclear Oregon State law, not certain exactly what was meant by whom in the context of the trial, et cetera.",
  "Why, why -- why though? I'm having the same problem. As I read the sentence that we have just been quoted it seems to me at first blush that it's completely right. You may consider the harm, the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what the reasonable relationship is. Now you have to be sophisticated in this. Don't ask me how the jury is, but assuming that they are, that means that the more severely awful the conduct, the higher the ratio between the damage award and the injury suffered by this victim in court. And if it's really bad, you're going to maybe have a hundred times this compensation instead of only ten times or five times. So -- we take it into account, the extent of the harm that could be suffered, in deciding what that ratio should be. That means it goes to the evilness of the conduct. But you are not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons who aren't here in court. In other words, what you aren't to do is to look at good old Mrs. Smith who has really suffered terribly, she happens not to be in court, think about her suffering, which is real and serious, and then say I'm going to punish this defendant because of what he did to her. Which would be a natural human reaction, and perhaps admirable, but regardless, the law is that that's what you're not supposed to do. So reading it as I just read it naturally, it seems to describe what our cases have said is the law. Why isn't that right? I'm looking for a real answer to the question. I'm posing it in a hostile way and hope I'll get an answer.",
  "Yes.",
  "Because you read it's about harm. You say look here is the person doing something absolutely awful, I mean really awful. And look at how awful it is. It's the kind of thing that would have hurt X number of people badly, maybe kill them.",
  "Now I think we all agree that that's an appropriate thing to say. And as long as you can say that why can't you create serious damages for that type of conduct?",
  "The trouble with the more basic question, I don't know if you can answer it, but it is a problem, that when I -- most States have factors like that, or many do. Alabama did. You know, not quite as good as that, and we saw the patent fraud, you know. And there are other cases that would bring up products liability. And it's pretty hard to think of a products liability case where the jury found negligence, where they might not also find these factors. Because in a typical case, you'll get competing memos within the company. Somebody will have been hurt and likely seriously, and when you start thinking about the victim in front of you, it all looks pretty bad, and it often is, at least in this instance. And now you read these five factors, and the difficulty for me has always been, well, you read the jury factors like that and they can do almost anything. And it's that, it's that fact that anything goes that I found disturbing.",
  "I take it you're talking about language, if I followed it, in 2244(d)(2).",
  "And it tolled the statute while the \"properly filed application for state post-conviction or other collateral review is pending.\" So the question is during the 90 days after they said no to you in the state court and you had a chance to file the writ, is that application pending? And you say yes, that application is pending, that application is pending and subject to various motions, such as a motion or a petition for certiorari.",
  "But it is pending.",
  "That's where we are in this argument.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Does it say that? I would have thought it said that there has to be a final judgment of the lower court, and the final judgment of the state court concerns that application which is still pending and will continue to be pending at least for 90 days in your view.",
  "So it doesn't require a final state application. It requires a final judgment about the state application.",
  "That was the issue in that case. This issue wasn't in that case.",
  "I can't when I write something, I don't think I or anyone else can, if it happens to be a state case, refrain from using the word state. I wouldn't say there is an implication in writing an opinion that it doesn't mean Federal as well. As least I can't find that written in the opinion anywhere.",
  "Those are the most likely where people are going to get mixed up. I mean, I'm not following -- I think I think this argument about the word is metaphysical, you know, and I can make wonderful arguments, and you have made wonderful arguments on both sides of this. I just can't get a clear answer. So if I were right about that and there is no clear answer from the language, then the thing, I'd like to go back to Justice Stevens' question, because it seems to me that that puts my greatest concern, my greatest concerns are practical. If we take your position, we have words right next to each other, near each other in the same statutory provision, meaning different things. And I've learned out of my own experience perhaps, judges and lawyers are not always geniuses and they get mixed up. And they will get mixed up all the time, and when they get mixed up, people will lose rights that they have. The second concern of Justice Stevens, which is what happens in the case, and those are the ones who intuitively are going to cause the problem. Because on a rare occasion, the state or the prisoner has a very good Supreme Court case. And that's going to be the case where he forgets to file in the Federal court because he thinks this thing isn't over, and lo and behold, the Court grants it. And now what happens? On your interpretation, I just see a mess, and on the other interpretation, it seems to work out fine. So those, I would say are the two practical problems, and anything you would like to say about that, I'd like to listen to.",
  "That's if you're formally right on the metaphysical question. But if you're not, now thinking you just gave a response to the Chief Justice that said, well, really the Federal district judge when he gets these things just has to look at them and then he figures out whether he is going to stay it or whether he's going to proceed on some issues or whether he is going to do something else. And that's what you thought was fairly easy. You have the experience there and I just wonder how easy it is. I mean, why wouldn't it be easy? Because I guess before doing anything the judge has to know what this thing is about. And that's where it seems to me to take the time of a district judge. They have many, many petitions. Sometimes they are well organized, sometimes not. He sends them to a magistrate possibly. The magistrate has a lot to do, and the time consumed is the time finding out what is this case about. Is that fair characterization or not? How easy is it?",
  "You can still argue -- what hearsay exception did it come in under?",
  "Adequate indicia of reliability?",
  "Is that universal in Nevada? I mean, is they are no more hearsay rule in Nevada, that you just evaluate hearsay straight out in every case?",
  "So if you lose this case, you can go back to the Ninth Circuit and say, well, even under Roberts it shouldn't have come in?",
  "Can I ask you about an argument I think they did make? I think they made this argument. On page 26 of your brief, I think it's explained well. You set out the regs and the reg says that a major modification is \"any physical change in the method of operation that would lead to a significant net emissions increase.\" Then you have little (iii), which is an exception, and it excepts a physical change which leads to -- is just an increase in the hours of operation or the production rate. So that's out of it. Now, the question is what's in it? If that's out of it, what's in it? I think what they've said is, if you think about that, we'll tell you what must be out of it is a physical change that does nothing to increase the capacity, but just means you can run it more hours. And they say their proof of that is that that was the EPA's interpretation for years and years and years. Indeed, we did what we did thinking that was it. And then after we did what we did, they pulled the rug out from under us and said no, that isn't it; now it means any physical change, like you change a nut, or a bolt, or a tube, even though there's no increased capacity to emit more. It's just you run it more hours. Now, that they say is basically unfair, it's not what this reg has been about. And they made that argument, according to them, very strongly and the Fourth Circuit took the argument and changed it all around and made some propositions of law that it's hard for even them to defend. All right. Now, that's what I think, that's what I think is lying -- maybe that's lying at the heart of it. And if it is, what do you say?",
  "It looks like -- I went back and read the Puerto Rico cement case. And it certainly looks as if -- though the issue was somewhat different. It looks as if the interpretation that the EPA is taking there is not consistent with what you are reading now and is consistent with what they're saying today. And that was in 1988-89, I guess. They must have been starting on that in '87. So it seemed to me we have a mixed bag. Some people were saying the one thing. Some people were saying the other thing. And the later in time seems to be the Puerto Rico cement. And that was at least 17 years ago. And - -",
  "The analysis which was probably pretty much based on what they said, I think was that the reason there was increased potential here to pollute, was really because this change would permit the plant to be run more intensively or more hours, something like that.",
  "No, we didn't address it. I'm not taking it as evidence of that. I'm taking it as evidence that the EPA then had a basic position similar to what they have now. That's what I'm using it as a basis for thinking that they were not saying to have a change, the word \"change\" includes only a change in physical facilities that increases the amount of emission per hour. Am I right? Or - -",
  "So then they'll say your argument here, even if you are right, I think they think you're wrong -- but even if you're right, they'll say well, that's an argument that it is arbitrary, capricious abuse of discretion for them to change horses in the middle of the stream, i.e., for them to take an interpretation of a reg that was longstanding and without adequate notice and comment and so forth radically reverse that interpretation. Now that's not the issue in front of us now.",
  "Because?",
  "They say because the Fourth Circuit didn't go really on that, it went on some statutory thing, and - -",
  "The obvious reason to do it is, I guess you have an area of the country, let's say, which is quite clean in the air. And there is a power plant. And what somebody works out, which is normal, is demand for electricity is increasing. And so what we will do is we're going to take these turbines and system, and we're going to change it really radically. It doesn't produce one more particle per hour, but now we can run it 24 hours a day and previously we'd run it 12 hours a day. So there's going to be twice as much pollution in the air. Now the whole idea of the PSD system is you don't have twice as much pollution in the air, and I guess that's why they wanted to do it.",
  "Because you can use the same word, you can apply the same word in different places differently, depending on what your basic object is in the different place. It's very hard to say what kind of modification might exist over here, there, the other place. And you put your finger on a very difficult question for power companies, because those turbines do go at different amounts of rates and so forth during a day, during a month, during a year, so it's hard for them. Therefore, you have a complex definition. What's wrong with that?",
  "Why? Because the language, I don't see anywhere in the statute where -- the words of modification are, it's a physical changing or change in a method of operation which increases the amount of any air pollutant. Now those words, \"physical change which increases the amount of any air pollutant,\" could mean different things in different places.",
  "Where does it say in the statute that they can't?",
  "But you do have a brief here. You have a brief filed in the D.C. Circuit, which is Brief For Industry Petitioners on Actual Emissions Definition.",
  "And throughout that brief it refers again and again to the problem, their proposed reg is not taking, i.e., the potential capacity, which is change the machine so it puts out more per minute or whatever, but rather, it's using actual emissions even though you don't change the capacity of the machine. There's a whole brief on that. So you already argued that whole brief, that what they were doing was inconsistent with the statute, et cetera.",
  "No. As being outside the statute at that time, and you did.",
  "No. I was just thinking, then you're left with what you called the weak argument, arbitrary, capricious, et cetera, because I don't see how you make the stronger one, what you think is stronger, since you made it before, or a version of it before the D.C. Circuit.",
  "No, not collateral estoppel, but you know, I'd be repeating myself.",
  "That's what it is.",
  "What happens -- I'm trying to think of what the problem is for you. On January 1, your client's arrested unlawfully. Now suppose the rule was you have two years to file it, starting now. What is the problem for you? The problem is maybe in a year, or maybe less, the police start to prosecute him. In the meantime, your trial is going forward because you filed it on time. So when they start to prosecute him, you don't yet know what's going to happen. And it could happen that he's convicted and you think it's illegal because of the arrest and necessarily so. And therefore you have to stop the trial, I guess, because of Heck.",
  "That would work, I guess. They'd stop it and then they'd have to bring it -- you'd have to stop it and then you'd have to go through these other remedies and they you'd have to go back to it.",
  "But that would work.",
  "A mess.",
  "Suppose I modify it.",
  "Suppose it is complicated. I want to suggest a modification with this suit here. You say you have to file within two years. But wait, you have -- we tolled the statute. If the person is arrested and charged, and convicted, for all the time that is going on, it is just tolled, equitably. And after the conviction, if he's acquitted, by the way, or he isn't arrested, the statute starts to run again. Now if he's convicted, as long as you have filed, proceeding to challenge the conviction, it is tolled. Now, would that -- that it seems to me would help every problem you have, and it would be called equitable tolling. And that's been suggested by judges in different forums and many states have it. And what's the problem? That just solves the problem, doesn't it?",
  "All right, well, we could do it in this case.",
  "What cases require overruling?",
  "Well, it seems to me identical to the rule you are advocating but with one difference. The difference with the rule you are advocating is a judge who is going to be judge at time A with your first case, is going to have to guess whether it is in this case or not in this case necessarily related to some kind of challenge to conviction you're going to bring later if you happen to get convicted.",
  "There is no way to guess that.",
  "And is there anything that you are aware of that it would be contrary to? I know there are cases that say you look to states but you only look to states where the state law is, in fact, consistent with the Federal right.",
  "That problem is solved too if you simply say bring it, day one, you are arrested, and if in fact before the statute of limitations expires, your client is brought to the court and is going to be prosecuted. Tolled. They don't need two actions.",
  "I want to be sure I understood your position with regard to Justice Kennedy's hypothetical where the defendant is arrested and excessive force is used by the police, they beat him up or something like that. When does that cause of action accrue?",
  "But that's the problem. I don't know if it is easy. It seems to me if you take your point of view, now, on January 1, some, let's call it an unconstitutional action allegedly. So, I don't want to distinguish for the moment between Fourth and Fifth. On January 1 the event occurs. Then you say you have two years to file your claim in the Federal court of a violation of 1983, for example. Then that happens. Let's say two months later they file it. The defendant files it. A month after that, there is a state criminal proceeding. Now, you're the Federal judge. What's supposed to happen? It sounds to me as if the judge sitting there, under your theory, is going to have to make a decision. He's going to have to say now, is the kind of claim that's being argued in my court that the policemen did something unconstitutional, if I say that's correct, that the plaintiff wins, I have to go on to say does the correctness of that, there was a violation, mean that the conviction if there is a conviction in the state court later, will necessarily be vitiated. If the answer to that question is yes, he shouldn't go ahead; is that right?",
  "All right. If that's correct, we're getting to exactly the same problem, whether we do it through a set of abstention rules, which we have to have Federal abstention rules or it won't be worked out properly, or we have to have Federal tolling rules. I don't see any way to get to a sensible result here without either having clear abstention rules, just as you say, having clear tolling rules, as I suggested before. Am I right? If I'm wrong, let me know why; and if I'm right, which do you prefer?",
  "If you do it with a stay, I mean, I see that disadvantage. If you do it with a stay, the Federal judge is going to have to sit there with the papers in front of him, look at that evidence, think what's going to happen in the trial at the criminal case which I'm not quite certain yet, and then make a determination. It sounds like a very difficult decision and it sounds like sometimes they'll get it wrong, sometimes they'll get it right. The defendant might be arguing two different things, you know, one in the state court to try to get them to go ahead, and the other to try to get them to go ahead in the Federal court. What do you - -",
  "If you delay accrual by tolling, you do have the disadvantage that in some instances the policemen won't know for quite a while whether the case is being brought. That's true; and in the other instance, he won't know for quite a while how the case is going to come out, which may be worse. But you don't have any uncertainty. You have no uncertainty. You would know once the man is released. It's no tolling. Once he's convicted, it's tolled. Then the conviction comes in. Not tolled until they bring a proceeding.",
  "If we just could go to the merits for a second here. You're saying this word, where it says, the word is you \"may convert,\" and that means you can convert no matter what?",
  "No matter what? Okay, suppose they repeal Chapter 13 before you convert. Then can you convert?",
  "I'm just producing examples where it's clear you can't convert. Now, suppose Congress -- there is no Chapter 13. Could you convert then?",
  "No, okay. Suppose he dies. Could you convert then?",
  "Yes. No inheritance, no nothing.",
  "Even though there's no such person existing any more. He's gone and his whole family is gone, and there's no inheritors, nothing. Then can he convert? No.",
  "I'm trying to produce ridiculous examples. Maybe -- all right, so you say even if he's dead and there's no family he still could convert. That's an extreme test of my hypothetical, but okay. What about if, in fact, he goes insane? No.",
  "What about if, in fact, the conversion is part of a scheme to defraud millions of people in a foreign country because it will be viewed as a signal that they should mail their life savings into a particular account in Switzerland? Can he convert then?",
  "You say yes on that?",
  "Even though it's going to bilk people out of millions of dollars?",
  "No matter what? Even if he's dead, even if he's insane?",
  "Well alright, then I can't get anywhere with my hypotheticals.",
  "I would have thought the answer was no, but there we are.",
  "But there is a difference, and this is -- assume with me, which apparently you don't agree, that everywhere in law there are implied exceptions for unusual circumstances. I have never found an instance where you couldn't think of some exception that they didn't see. You could not bring a thing if you were insane or dead or if a death would ensue or a murder. Assume that, all right. Then the question would be, well, what about this instance? And I think the strongest instance - - the strongest argument for saying there's is no exception here is the argument that the trustee discovers that this individual is behaving dishonestly, that he's hidden assets. Maybe he has a safe deposit box and he has a key and the key -- the key will allow him to get diamonds out of the safe deposit box and hide them. Under 7, the trustee has the key. As soon as you convert it to 13 the key is given back to the debtor, who has been shown dishonest. Now, assuming you're going to have some exceptions, why isn't that a very, very powerful one?",
  "Is it true or not what I said, because I don't know the area, that if in fact you had a dishonest debtor, the present -- the proceeding is dismissed on 7. He gets the papers back. The papers permit him access to a hidden source of resources, and he steals them basically. Is that possible or is that fanciful?",
  "So is it possible if it's in 13 that then the debtor, let's say a dishonest debtor, could get back pieces of paper which would admit that debtor to the possession of certain property which he could then take and hide in a way that that couldn't happen in 7? Is that possible or not possible?",
  "When you say extra culpability, do you mean the nature of the crime? Suppose there are three crimes all committed at the same time -- murder, rape, and kidnapping. They're all very serious crimes. And if you sentence them consecutively, you will take into account that there were three. If you sentence them concurrently, it doesn't matter. The Washington court says, we're not just looking to the fact that murder or rape or kidnapping are serious; we're looking to sentence consecutively if do you more than that. You have to look to see that the kidnapping was a special kind of kidnapping.",
  "The fact is, we're looking at page 34, 34 of the joint appendix, and that is the first petition that was filed; is that right?",
  "So you look at it and it says, filed December 28, and maybe this is what you said. Then it says date of judgment of conviction, December 16, 1994. So looking at that, you'd think that is what he was attacking. Where does it say he's attacking anything else?",
  "Yes, but I imagine there are tens of thousands off petitions filed in the Federal system. And I would think that judges when they're trying to look at those petitions, or the magistrate looks at them and says what judgment are you attacking, he has to figure that out often for statute of limitations purposes, or some other purpose. He'd look over there, go down and read that line two, and he'd think yeah, that's the judgment that's being attacked, unless of course there's some indication that it's something else. I've never heard of this before. Is there any precedent on that where even though the petition refers to date A, and there's nothing in to suggest anything other than date A, because it turns out that there's a different judgment that in fact, he's being held, which is date B, that the court says oh, you're attacking date B. Is there any precedent that says that's how it's read?",
  "No. So this might be the first time. I don't see a reason why you wouldn't read the petition that's filed in an ordinary way and say the judgment that's being attacked is the judgment that it refers to.",
  "I don't know what implication this is going to have for a lot of these petitions. I don't know one way or the other, but it might be there are thousands right now in the Federal court which have date A, and somebody is going to go back and say no, it is really date B or something. I'm a little nervous about it. If you're not nervous, you're the ones in charge.",
  "I don't want to take you up. Let me just have one on the merits, one. I mean, the reason I want you to get to the merits, and I put in my dissent. I was trying as hard as I could to show why I thought this case was wrong. I start the dissent by saying that -- what it says, and then I quote the two sentences that any fact, et cetera, any fact that increases beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and prescribed statutory maximum, again quote, means \"solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict.\" Okay. Then at the end of the opinion I say: \"Until now I would have thought the Court might have limited Apprendi so its underlying principle wouldn't cause so much harm.\" Now, the next sentence of course I explain how they might have limited Apprendi, but somehow that disappeared from the opinion because I guess I couldn't think of it. So you're going to tell me now -- I mean, I didn't say how they might have limited Apprendi and I couldn't think of how they might have limited Apprendi, and they read Apprendi to mean what it said. Now, you tell me the phrase I might have put in but couldn't think of that would have limited Apprendi?",
  "Why doesn't anybody -- you know, count. It sounds to me if you're wondering about whether there's a specific serious risk of harm, you could find out. Look at the conviction that in Florida for attempted burglary, look at the convictions for burglary, and see if the harm involved, the number of cases in which people are harmed is roughly similar. We have all these law professors who like statistics. Now they like law in economics and everything. So why don't they go out there and count, and then we'd actually know, instead of sitting here and trying to figure out something I know nothing about. I've never been involved in a lot of burglaries. I don't know how the burglaries operate. I suspect some people are hurt, but rather than my suspicion why don't we find out what the facts are?",
  "But wouldn't it be, as a method of approaching - -",
  "Sorry, go ahead.",
  "If we don't know and if I can't get too far with the language and I frankly could sit in my office looking at the computer screen I think for hours and I wouldn't be closer to knowing whether there is or is not a lot of injury that accompanies attempted burglary, but that is something that is possible to know. All we have to do, as I said before, is count and there are a lot of people who can do that. In fact, there are people who at least have a mandate to do it and that is the sentencing commission. So they have the tools. They have the ability. And so in the absence on a question like this of my being able to get anywhere by cogitating about the language and in a borderline case where it isn't obvious, why don't we as a Court simply follow a reasonable interpretation of what the sentencing commission did in the absence of better information from some other place?",
  "They're trying to find out the same answer to the same kind of question: How many of these attempted burglaries, how many burglaries, how many other crimes are accompanied by an individual being hurt? And as I say, I cannot imagine how to answer that question in a borderline case without trying to find the numbers, which I don't have here, and therefore since I don't have them, why don't I look to the best, second best alternative, which is at least they could get them, and I hope they did get them before coming to the conclusion they did.",
  "So in an ordinary city street in Miami walking along the street, there are a lot of houses, and there's a little bit of lawn or bushes in front, and there's not a fence, because there isn't, or there aren't fences in many city blocks, a person goes up to the house and starts to monkey around with the window to raise it or whatever, that's attempted burglary, not burglary, in Florida?",
  "All right. So then I doubt -- then again I'm left at sea. I don't know how often that happens or is dangerous. So if I think that this is really a statistical question, and I think maybe it is -- and the Government is in the best position, they have all the statistics, they have whole bureaus over there. So what about a presumption against the Government? In a case where it seems to be a close case and it is a statistical question, and the Government doesn't have any statistics?",
  "How are you supposed to decide it if there's a question as there is this instance I think? I just don't know how dangerous attempted burglaries are. I mean, maybe I'm not supposed to admit there are a lot of things I don't know but there are. And this is one of them.",
  "I read the text several times.",
  "Correct. And here I think it might be less than burglary. And extortion, though one thinks of somebody writing a poison pen letter or something and revealing a secret from the past -- many such crimes are threats of violence. I mean, and that just read through the statutes, and that's what they are aiming at. So I would say extortion is something that quite often could involve violence. But again that's cogitating. So I get to attempted burglary. I don't know. Now what do I do?",
  "What about attempted assault? I bet nobody has ever been hurt in an attempted assault.",
  "All right. But it wouldn't fit within your -- I mean, I just wonder what happens when you try to get away from numbers. Maybe there are a certain number of people injured during mail fraud or embezzlement, you know, some people get annoyed during an embezzlement and start hitting each other. I can't get away from the numbers.",
  "So what's the test? The test is either a high statistical number of injuries or if not, a nexus to a crime that does have a high statistical number of injuries? I like the word nexus because whenever I see it in an opinion, I have no idea what it means.",
  "But the problem with this is that there -- well, some doctors absolutely agree. I mean, you know, my list over here, in which I have hundreds of references from this thing, is doctor after doctor who takes the other position, and they say: Look, all that we're doing here is trying to remove the fetus in a single pass. The fetus is going to die anyway. It's not viable. We're trying to remove it in a single pass, and the reason we're trying to do that is if we don't, there may be bone fragments left inside the womb. There may be fetal parts left inside the womb. Every time you make another pass, it turns out there's an added risk of scarring or hurting the inside of the womb. If you try to induce demise through a drug before, there is serious risks of introducing drugs into the system. If the woman has uterine cancer, it's a serious problem of not trying to get the child out as quickly as possible. If you have preeclampsia or eclampsia, where you're in a situation where the woman will be dead in five minutes or 10 minutes, there could be such a situation. The doctor thinks only one thing: Get it out as fast as possible. All right. Now, I know there are doctors who think the contrary. There's lots of testimony of the doctors who think roughly along the lines I've taken. That was true in Stenberg as well. So I think the issue is not that you don't have support -- you do -- but that the support is contraverted, and therefore, what do we do in that case?",
  "Is there a definition in the law of significant risk, other than doctors saying, I've been trained to try to save life and I want to perform the safest possible way? Is there some legal definition of what's a small risk, a big risk, a giant risk?",
  "I think you're wrong about -- you're probably wrong about this. But just before you leave, I mean, this is why it's so hard for me to get into the medical procedure. I heard you as saying, perhaps wrongly, that well, the doctor can always use a lethal injection to kill the fetus. All right? That rang a bell. So I look up and see what the lower courts said about that and what they said is that nearly everyone agrees it is not always possible to kill the fetus by injection.",
  "He says It is not always possible -- what?",
  "Well, he then goes; he tells you why. He says there is a Dr. Knorr who says you can't do it when the woman has a prior surgery, pelvic inflammatory disease. And then another one says they are not considered appropriate candidates because of medical illness or cardiovascular disease, etcetera. So there's a list of medical situations where they couldn't use a fetal injection.",
  "Yes.",
  "It's bothering me, why I'm using this as an illustration is that there are so many of these things. Of course there are special cases. We are only talking about a few, rare special cases. And as soon as you tell me that what's supposed to happen is that the judges are supposed to start deciding whether this is one of these unusual cases or not, rather than relying upon significant medical opinion, as this doctor is now illustrating, I don't see how it's going to work. At least I don't see how it's going to work without some people suffering serious illness as a result of mistakes by the judge.",
  "Yes, once you're making a point of that study, I think it was also the case that the ones that had the intact were older or rather further along in pregnancy; isn't that true?",
  "Therefore the risks were greater.",
  "And therefore since the risks were greater, the other side says that this actually shows it was safer. I mean, I don't know how to evaluate that.",
  "I missed that.",
  "Could you address the question I asked respondent's counsel in the last case about the availability of other facilities? Because there are alternate methods but some of these require hospitalization, and my understanding is the hospitals aren't always open.",
  "So it doesn't make much sense to say well, there is an alternate procedure if you can't be admitted to the facility.",
  "How do you do that, because I looked at that part of the statute and, comparing it with the statute in Cathcart, the relevant part forbid a doctor from doing this for the purpose of performing an abortion that the doctor knows will kill the fetus. That's the language basically, right. And in this one it says you can't deliver past the fetal trunk for the purpose of performing an overt act that the doctor knows will kill the fetus. So I look at those two sets of words. I mean, I've simplified them slightly, but I don't see the difference. So if the one in Cathcart is viewed as too vague, why is the other one here not too vague?",
  "Well, I'll grant you that in respect -- if what Cathcart was worried about I guess was you didn't know what the words \"significant substantial portion of the child,\" that tends to be cured. But if what Cathcart was worried about was the fact that a doctor who sets out to perform a D&E will, making a pass, think he'll have the fetus dismembered and, lo and behold, it doesn't dismember, so the bottom portion of the fetus descends outside the womb. And there he is and now what happens? If that's the concern, then I guess you'd agree that that same concern exists here.",
  "For such a doctor, a doctor who thinks that I'm trying to remove in this emergency situation as much of the fetus as possible as quickly as possible, would such a doctor often, never, sometimes be thinking what I think is likely to happen here, I'll make a pass at the fetus, try to draw it out, and what's most likely to happen is that the trunk, a lot of it will come out and then the head of the fetus will dismember, after a lot of the trunk comes out. Is that - -",
  "So if a doctor is being honest about that, is there any way that such a doctor could escape the language of the statute on the government's interpretation?",
  "Just from my going through this record, I compare it with Stenhart, with what's in Congress. We have two cases here. And it's a fair conclusion that there are, in each case, before Congress and in here, there are some doctors who think this is safe and some doctors who think it isn't safe. And if you look at the -- sort of by counting, by numbers, I guess if you look by lines of testimony or by different doctors, interestingly enough, it seems to me there are more doctors in these two cases and in front of Congress who said it is not safe than there were when we considered the other case. And there are fewer doctors who say it is safe even with the other case. So I don't know if you're supposed to count doctors or what. My question would be, if this -- do we owe more deference to a congressional finding or to Congress than we owe to a State legislature? What is -- I mean, I take it a State legislature is democratically elected, and don't we owe similar deference to both?",
  "Well, if we owe deference to both, and I would have thought that we did, then I think in the Nebraska case, despite the deference that was owed, the Court came to the conclusion that the statute of Nebraska was unconstitutional because it lacked an exception for the health of the mother, something that came from preceding cases. So if giving deference to Nebraska, we reach that conclusion there, and if the deference that is owed is the same, and if the evidence is about the same on both sides, how can we reach a different conclusion here?",
  "If -- I see what you're driving at in terms of the procedure. We are focusing on a universe where the fetus is not going to survive no matter what, right?",
  "Okay. So we are not talking about anyone being born and living. They are not going to.",
  "And that's the area of focus.",
  "Now, Congress has said that - - the doctor, you can achieve that result through method A, but not through method B, and you're saying Congress had good reason for doing that. I take it Congress also agrees that if method B, which they don't want, were to be necessary for the safety or health of the mother, the Constitution would require it being done. I didn't see anything here about Congress disagreeing with that.",
  "All right. If that's right - -",
  "Right. Fine. Okay. They make a finding that although we don't disagree with that, we don't think it's ever necessary for the health or safety of the mother. That's where we are. Now as I look at the record, I see many, many, many doctors telling Congress and everybody else that it is necessary, and safe. And I see other doctors telling Congress primarily, but in court, too, that it isn't necessary, ever for safety. And so if medical opinion is divided, and I'm not advocating what I'm about to say, I just want to know your reaction. If medical opinion is divided, why wouldn't it be up to this Court or could this Court say this use of this procedure, we enjoin the statute to permit its use but only where appropriate medical opinion finds it necessary for the safety or health of the mother? Now, if Congress is right, there will be no such case so it's no problem. But if Congress is wrong, then the doctor will be able to perform the procedure and Congress couldn't object to that because the Congress isn't worried about, I mean Congress, then Congress was wrong. They agreed that we had a health or safety exception.",
  "No. It just wouldn't be a question of the doctor's preference. You would have to refer back to prior cases, and what the prior cases talk about including Stenberg is not that that the doctor simply has a preference, but rather that there has to be a significant body of medical opinion that says that this is safer procedure and necessary for the safety of the mother. Now, where that's true, the Court has previously said that the Constitution protects the right. And I don't see anything in what Congress says that wants to change that law. They simply have a different view of the facts.",
  "So if they have a different view of the facts, why can't we leave it up to whatever facts develop? If there is an appropriate body of medical opinion that does in fact believe this is necessary for the health of the mother, so be it, and the abortion could be performed and the injunction would say that.",
  "And otherwise not.",
  "So in terms of - -",
  "I didn't like your characterization and the Government's of the state of the record. I asked my law clerk basically to go look up every statement that was made in four forums. The first was the first Stenberg case. Second was Congress. Third is this, one of the cases here; and the fourth is the other case here. Now, my own impression of that is if you're talking about the medical need for such a case, that is for intact D&E, that there is a risk attached if you don't use it in some instances. The fewest number of statements for that proposition was in the first Stenberg.",
  "More statements in Congress, more statements that you -- doctors who say, I need this procedure for safety.",
  "There are many more in this case than there were -- in these two cases there are many more than there were in Congress and in Congress there are many more than they were in first Stenberg.",
  "Now, if we look to the other side of the coin, the doctors who say, no, it isn't safe, there I'd have to say there are probably many more in Congress than there are -- who say it isn't safe, there are probably many more in Congress; and then there are some in these cases, too; and there are hardly any in Stenberg, not too many.",
  "It was against you, in other words.",
  "Yes.",
  "All right, so I'm left with a record where I guess you have a subjective characterization that there is at least as much evidence in these cases supporting you and as much in Congress supporting you as there was in the first Stenberg case. But Congress made this finding, so what am I to do with the finding?",
  "My question basically I think you might have been going after is, I was saying that I agreed with you in that there is more evidence supporting your side in these cases than there was before Congress, than there was in first Stenberg.",
  "But still there was a finding in Congress and there wasn't a finding in the Nebraska legislature, and so does that fact of the finding being in Congress and not in the Nebraska legislature -- what kind of legal difference does that make?",
  "Suppose you go back to the 15 year old action which led to disparity that continues up to today, and suppose at the beginning or in July of 2006 the woman discovers it and brings her claim and suppose she wins. Now, is it the case -- and here I'm uncertain. I thought there was some rule in respect to getting damages that you could only go back 2 years?",
  "And in that case would it mean that in this case where it happened 15 years ago and she won, but she didn't bring her act until August of 2006, that she could only then collect the extra money for the preceding 2 years?",
  "So it isn't going to open up tremendous liability for 15 or 20 years ago.",
  "Justice Brennan's opinion sounds to me, part one, as if he is saying what the mistake was that the company made here is that they didn't really eradicate the effects of the past bad act, and they were trying to eradicate it.",
  "That's another part of the case that's part two and part three about the evidence that came in. In fact, there are about six other parts. I'm just talking about part one.",
  "Yes. All right. So I read that. Now, this is my this is my cost/benefit analysis here. If we follow the other side's rule, it's very simple, we just said Bazemore applies, whether there's a practice or whether it was a discrete thing, or whatever, so it's simple. But we do have to distinguish pay from the other kinds of things. And we have heard them explain why there is a distinction. I'd rather get to your side and then you can attack both, or whatever. Your side of it, it seems to me, if I agree to you, I now have to create in the law some kind of thing that sounds very complicated about whether that old bad thing was somehow a pattern or a practice that, as a pattern or a practice, didn't get eradicated within the last few years, or was a totally discrete act, and therefore, had no implication as a pattern or practice that didn't get eradicated. That sounds hard. And the second thing I guess I'd have to do is to create a lot of tolling law because there will be probably a significant number of circumstances where a woman is being paid less, and all she does is for the last six months get her paychecks and she doesn't really know it because pay is a complicated thing, and through no fault of her own, it takes about eight or nine months or even a year for her to find out. And we are going to have to toll, aren't we? So I have, legally speaking, a complicated tolling system that I have to graft on to this, your case. I also have to start distinguishing Bazemore which is pretty hard to do. But on the other side, they are just saying, go with the flow. Nobody is really hurt, because the employer has to worry about all this stuff anyway under the Equal Pay Act. I'm giving you that summary so you can just shoot it down.",
  "What would you do on the other side of this? It if you win on this, then don't you have to have a fairly relaxed standard of allowing the woman, tolling or something, when she just gets some paychecks that would take her a while to figure out that these are really reflecting some old discrimination and she doesn't know. It's different in that respect from the promotion itself.",
  "Well, she knows this. She knows that, all these boxes on her paychecks and she's not quite sure what they mean. All right, your answer is not much different.",
  "But you do have a case - - anywhere, forget antitrust. Suppose it's a tort case, and the following complaint is filed. My foot hurts. I've gone to Dr. Smith for 15 years. I claim he is negligent. Is that valid?",
  "All right. Now, if you think that's valid, I understand that you think this complaint does just what I said in the field of antitrust. But is there any case that you've come across which would say a complaint just as I have described it - -",
  "Either is valid or is not valid. You'd like to find one that says it's not valid, so what's your best effort in any field of law.",
  "You can get into trouble by alleging too much, I guess, because if you allege a lot, you might leave something out. And you say, well, what about that one. But suppose we keep it very, very minimal. And a person just says, I'm hurt and the defendant, I claim, negligently injured me. Period. Period.",
  "Well, why not?",
  "So the only thing that's missing there are some facts.",
  "All right. So now you're saying a complaint has to have facts?",
  "Now you're, that's the part precisely which you're following that I don't, that I actually don't know, is the extent to which you have to put in a complaint, in whatever field of law, you can allege a fact. You say the person ran over me - -",
  "Or you say, they treated me negligently. That's a fact. That means something happened there. But suppose you write the complaint and there is just no notion that you have a what and when, how, under what circumstances. It's just totally out of thin air, and the defendant doesn't know what, what period of time he is supposed to be thinking about, what, what happens to such a complaint? There must be some law on it in torts or someplace?",
  "Well, why couldn't you do the same?",
  "Oh, but they're - - they're using the fact that there was parallel behavior as a basis for thinking there was more than parallel behavior. They are using it as a basis for thinking that once, on some occasion that's relevant, there were people meeting in a room and saying things to each other. So they are not just saying that it's sufficient. They are saying it's evidence that something else occurred.",
  "Can they say on the 14th of January, 2004, we believe that in the city of New York, they agreed upon this course of action? That would surely be sufficient?",
  "Well, it's saying, all I've done is limited it in time and space. Just as you might say on October the 24th, 2004 at the corner of 14th and Third Avenue, defendant drove negligently and injured me. That's certainly a complaint, isn't it?",
  "Isn't it?",
  "Well, look, the one I just alleged in the tort law is a complaint. I've just copied it out of the model complaints.",
  "Am I right or not?",
  "Well, I understand the standard.",
  "I want to know how to apply the standard and now I take my tort case - -",
  "-- which is okay, and now I say sometime during the last 10 years he drove negligently and injured me. Is that no good?",
  "And so you're saying that this case is like that, when because they don't say when they met, they don't say what happened, they don't give a time or place. If that's, leaving your side parallelism out of it, I'm past you on that, all right? I'll accept for argument's sake all your point about that. Now if you're saying this is too vague, leaving that out of it, because it doesn't say time and place of the meetings or give any other clue for meetings etcetera, what's your best authority ? This is an area of law I'm not familiar with. I'm looking for cases that will tell me how specific a complaint has to be to tie the events down to specific ones.",
  "Dura is still the best. I think I, did I write that case?",
  "I'm not drawing total comfort from it.",
  "In fact I'd like something in tort law or something that, you know, that I get a general idea of what the law is because I don't know that antitrust is - -",
  "If my case, the gasoline, oil prices fell, but I happen to know there were four gasoline shops near each other, gasoline stations, and they didn't cut their prices. Complaint?",
  "Well, then that's the economy, and you can go sue half the firms in this economy. Every firm in a concentrated industry engages in -- I mean, normally conscious parallelism, and I know there are economists who think that that should be the case, but I thought the law to date was that the Department of Justice is not given by the Sherman Act the authority to remake the entire American economy. But if we accept your view I guess it is.",
  "Ordinarily, if you take that sentence and read it for how you're reading, a consciously parallel action is a violation of Sherman Act section 2, then we have that radical change that many have advocated for the last 40 or 50 years, that half the economy is in violation, because in any concentrated industry, after all, it is in the interest of a firm to cut prices and to make a large market unless he knows his three competitors will also keep prices up. Now, you have to know that or you'd cut them. And that's called conscious parallelism. And I had always thought that this Court had not said that that in and of itself is a violation of the Sherman Act.",
  "I know that, but if in fact all you have to do in order to bring a price-fixing case and get into discovery is to allege conscious parallelism and then add without further foundation, and we think there was a real agreement too, but there's nothing other than the conscious parallelism to back it up, now we've got just what I said, with the exception you might not win at the end of the day. What have you is a ticket to conduct discovery. Now, that's what's bothering the Department of Justice and so I'd like to know the answer to that problem.",
  "I'd also like a clear answer, and I would like to go back to Justice Stevens' question because I'm not sure what you're thinking there. We have three steel sheet companies in the United States, no more. They sell at $10 a sheet. One day we have action in the case, a memo to the president of the company. He says Mr. President, if you cut your prices to $7 you will make even more money unless the others go along. And if they get there first, you will lose money. So whether they cut or not, you'd better cut your prices. Reply from the president: But if I don't cut my prices, they won't cut theirs, and we are all better off. That's your evidence. Do you win?",
  "There is no depend. That's the evidence. Do you win?",
  "All right. And you cite Matsushita for that?",
  "If you're right, then I guess we could engage in this major restructuring of the economy, and if that's the law, I'm surprised they haven't done it, but maybe they have just been recalcitrant.",
  "Well, because we have concentrated industries throughout the economy, I guess, or at least we used to, and I suppose that that's a perfectly valid way of reasoning for an executive in such a company, at least they teach that at the schools of government, and people who aren't really experienced in these things, but - -",
  "Okay, fine. Now, let's forget my immediate disagreement or not. Let's say I agree with you on this. Now we have our example right in mind. What other than the parallel to my example could one reading this complaint think you intend to prove?",
  "I can understand, I think, what a teaching is. I take it a teaching is you put all the prior art -- that's what I guess that's what Judge Rich explained, which I thought was very enlightening to me in I can't remember the name of the case, Wigmore, Winsmore - -",
  "Winslow. You put it all around the room. All right, we've got it all around the room, and I begin to look at it and if I see over that it somehow teaches me to combine these two things, if it says, Breyer, combine this and that, that's a teaching and then it's obvious. Now, maybe it doesn't have the teaching, it just has the suggestion. Maybe it says, we suggest you combine this or that; okay, then it's obvious. But I don't understand, though I've read it about 15 or 20 times now, it though I've read it about 15 or 20 times now, I just don't understand what is meant by the term \"motivation.\"",
  "I tried. You've read a lot of cases. You're a patent lawyer, and so what is the understanding as best you have it of what is just meant by the term \"motivation\"? To be more specific, if they mean motivated to go look to the prior art, well, anybody would want to look in the prior art. If I want to invent something I'll look anywhere. I'll look to the prior art. I'll look to the Library of Congress. I'll look to my cousin. I mean, I'll look wherever I can find it. So they can't mean that, and if they don't mean that what do they mean?",
  "Say that again? You wouldn't have a motivation to look to the prior art to find your problem. What's an example where you have a motivation distinguishing you from everybody else? I mean, everybody has a motivation to look to the prior art.",
  "Right person to ask.",
  "Fine, that's fine.",
  "Well, if that's all it means, why don't they say it?",
  "Well, then what is this word that confused me a lot, motivation? I found a lot of enlightenment in Judge Rich's idea of taking all the relevant art and putting it up around the room in pictures. And then I thought, well, okay, if that art teaches me to do what your client did, okay, it doesn't. Does it suggest it? Not really. Well then, you say motivated. Where does that get you?",
  "For who? For me?",
  "For me the inventor?",
  "I know that, because otherwise - -",
  "That's true.",
  "You look at that thing, you think what this genius did, and I don't doubt that he's a genius, is there are wheels that turn around. And the wheels turn around to a fixed proportion to when you make the accelerator go up and down. Now I think since high school a person has known that if you have three parts in a machine and they each move in a fixed ratio one to the other, you can measure the speed of any part by attaching a device to any other as long as you know these elementary mathematics. I suppose it wasn't Mr. Engelgau, it was probably Archimedes that figured that one out. So he simply looks to something that moves, and he sticks a sticker on it. Now to me, I grant you I'm not an expert, but it looks at about the same level as I have a sensor on my garage door at the lower hinge for when the car is coming in and out, and the raccoons are eating it. So I think of the brainstorm of putting it on the upper hinge, okay? Now I just think that how could I get a patent for that, and that -- now that's very naive, that's very naive. But the point is, I don't see what we're talking about, and what is supposed to happen with all these affidavits. And the -- the -- Mr. Asano himself, I would think at some point when the Ford company decides to switch to electronic throttles, of course will have every motivation in the world to do precisely what your client did, because he can't use that thing that pulls back and forth anymore. Rather, he has to get a little electronic cap and attach it to something that moves in fixed proportion to the accelerator going up and down. Now those are my whole reactions when I saw this and I began to think it looks pretty obvious. What's supposed to go on, I don't understand it.",
  "As you know, we've had a series of cases and in these series of cases we have received many, many briefs from all kinds of organizations and there are many from various parts of the patent bar that defend very much what the Federal circuit does and there are many from parts of the patent bar and others who are saying basically that they've leaned too far in the direction of never seeing a patent they didn't like and that has unfortunate implications for the economy. So if you're going to these very basic deep issues, is there a reason for me to think, which I do now think, that there is a huge argument going on in those who are interested in patent as to whether there is too much protectionism and not enough attention paid to competition or whether it's about right, or whether it goes some other way. In other words, your argument now suggests all this is well settled, but I tend to think maybe it isn't well settled and maybe it is a proper thing for us to be involved in. So what are your views since you brought it up?",
  "It doesn't have to go on top. It's just to say what you've been saying, that what you're supposed to look to ultimately is whether a person, as the statute says, who is familiar with the subject, of ordinary skill in the art, whether to such a person this would have been obvious. Now, there are many, and this Court has listed several, factors that might count in favor of it not being obvious, such as people have been trying to do it for a long time and they haven't been able to figure out how. That's a good one, and there are some other ones here. If there's a teaching right there, it seems to cut the other way. But to hope to have a nonexclusive list seems to me a little bit like Holmes trying to hope to have an exclusive list of what counts as negligence. In the law we have many standards that you can get clues about, but you can't absolutely define them, and why isn't this one of them?",
  "Supposing we then were to say exactly what this Court already said, that the standard here is obvious, we list a few of these additional factors that they've thrown in, and just as the Court said before, all these additional factors are there. They can be considered in an appropriate case, but it is important to remember that the ultimate matter which is for the judge is to apply the word \"obvious\" or not in light of the evidence and what the experts say and the facts as found by a jury or whoever is the factfinder. Would you have any objection to an opinion like that.",
  "Is it basically an invention where in fact there are only four or five moving parts on the thing that we have seen, every one of the moving parts is moving with a fixed ratio to the accelerator going up and down, as it must be because they're also moving in fixed ratio with the throttle thing coming out. And so, whichever of those four that you figured out you were going to attach it to, it's obvious, isn't it, that you have to attach it either to the pedal or to the throttle thing that comes out, or to a part of the machine that moves in fixed ratio to the movements of one of those two? Now, that's what I would find fairly obvious. Why isn't that obvious?",
  "And it so quickly modified itself.",
  "I'm sorry. Doesn't the axis turn?",
  "Isn't there an axis, and the axis turns?",
  "The pivot rotates?",
  "Why would that be? I mean, I've worked out that the raccoons are gnawing the machine, at the bottom of the garage door and that's a problem. So I move it to the top of the garage door. Does that suddenly -- nobody before thought of moving it to the top of the garage door; nobody before had thought of moving it to a different part that moves in a constant ratio with the accelerator.",
  "But even it does hurt the suppliers and the antitrust laws are just as, I don't know just as, but they are just as concerned about a group of small farmers or a group of small growers or a group of small fishermen faced with a monopsony buyer as they are with a group of consumers having to fight off a monopoly seller.",
  "I mean that's pretty well established, isn't it?",
  "No, no, Congress has actually passed special legislation that the Mandeville Farms is consistent with the Farmers Cooperative and so -- you want me to write the proposition that the antitrust laws are not concerned - -",
  "-- with the monopoly buyer who would in fact exploit a group of small suppliers, farmers?",
  "Okay.",
  "That can't possibly be right, can it? I mean if in fact the object here is to strike, is -- suppose their object is what you say. Their object is in fact to try to get a monopoly on the buying side over a group of small woodsmen. And they might do that if they drove out all the buying competitors, and now what are they going to try to do? What they will try to do if they get that terrible monopoly, which would be bad - -",
  "Right. Drive prices way down, below what the woodsmen could get for them. And if that's going to have any effect aside from an income effect, it will leave some of them to go to the bread line or go to other places where they have other jobs at lesser revenue than they would get by staying in the woods business and selling at a reasonable price. That would be an antitrust concern.",
  "So where we are is at the problem. The problem is the same as at the buying side. What we have is possibly a very bad motive and very bad effects. On the other hand, low prices are good for the consumer.",
  "Here we have bad effects, bad possibilities. On the other hand, higher prices are good for the woodsmen. So we need rules to separate the sheep from the goats. And the other side is proposing a rule, and the rule simply is don't count this as bad conduct, unless the person who pays the money for the goods is in fact buying so many goods that later on when he tries to sell them he will incur a loss. Now I would have thought for 40 years that was a traditional idea. If you're trying to decide whether people are hogging goods unnecessarily for bad purposes, or rather storing up nuts for winter for good purposes, then a very good key to that is do these people expect in the long run to make money out of this without driving those victims out? If the answer is yes; they can make money on the market, they are storing up nuts for winter. It's good. And if the answer is no it's bad. That's called the recoupment test. I don't think that's new. I think it's old. And I'm not sure what your view of it is.",
  "-- I agree with you. But I don't still think you can defend this retail versus maximum price restraint. That's a whole another kettle of fish. And what I'm interested -- I guess my question particularly is, I propose one test not two, but it might be that my test encompasses the dollar test and incremental costs and so forth. What do you think of my one test?",
  "One test is if they are not going to make money legitimately out of this in the long run, it's bad, unless they can explain it away. But if they are, it's okay.",
  "Why did they say they needed it? I mean, why do you need all this Ph.D. guy up there? Why don't you just prove what you just said?",
  "Fine. Then why do you need all these other instructions about pricing? I suppose the only reason you'd need them is if there's a dispute as to whether it was in their economic interest in the absence of any intent to monopolize these people to buy all these logs or not. And so it would be very interesting if you have a way of proving that they did not need these for any legitimate purpose, a matter which is likely to be disputed. So, I think the hard thing in these cases is to prove that. And if you can tell me how you prove that without giving the jury an instruction something like, look to see whether they can sell them reasonably at a profit. Or, look to see even if they can't sell them at a profit, whether they could recoup whatever they are losing later. Or, or, and you fill in some blanks, and now I'll have some candidates for testing.",
  "Oh. But of course, I want to injure competition always when I in fact sell at a lower price that I very much hope my competitor can't possibly meet, indeed would go out of business. I cheer. I would love to get a monopoly. I would love to make a better product, lower prices, et cetera. Do you see the problem? And so what you've told the jury there on that instruction - -",
  "-- is that they can find this person guilty even if all he wants to do is so second-guess that market that he gets the logs and will sell them at a huge profit later on in a competitive selling market.",
  "What if it were the highest cost producer? Suppose still, they think that by buying these logs we later can make a profit when we resell them on the competitive market. You see, the reason they're coming up with this test is they don't think you can give, the reasoning of it is that they don't think that you can produce a better one. So I'm listening.",
  "On this particular issue, the opinion as I read it, of the EPA, consists of 32 pages. Twenty of those pages, 22 in fact, deal with whether they have statutory authority. And of the 10 that deal with the issue we're talking about now, five of them give as their reason that they think that the President has a different policy. Of the remaining five, two more consider international aspects of the problem and how you have to get other countries to cooperate; and then the conclusion of that part says in light of these considerations, we decide not to exercise our power. Now their claim with respect to that, is that at least three of the four considerations are not proper things for the agency to take into account: namely whether the President wants to do something different, whether we're running foreign policy properly, whether cooperation with other countries are relevant to this particular issue. So what they've asked us to do is send it back so they can get the right reasons. Now -- if they want not to do it. What's your response to that?",
  "The reason it depended on that is whether or not these other, improper considerations might have influenced the ultimate decision not to go ahead.",
  "When I write an opinion - - when I write an opinion, sometimes I write the words: \"We decide this matter in light of the following three factors taken together.\" And I guess a lawyer who said, \"one of those factors alone the Court has held justified the result all by itself\" -- in saying the Court has held that, I guess that wouldn't be so. That would be a bad lawyer, wouldn't it?",
  "If they write that all of these considerations justify our result, again, one of them by themselves, it sounds, they think would not have been sufficient.",
  "Suppose it is not greenhouse gas. Suppose it was Agent Orange. Suppose there a car is coming down the street and it sprays out Agent Orange. And I come into the Court and I say, you know, I think that Agent Orange is going to kill me with cancer. And the reply is, well, we have some scientists here who say your chance of dying of cancer from Agent Orange is only 1 in 30. Maybe 1 in 50. Maybe 1 in a thousand. Maybe 1 in 10,000. And therefore, you have no standing to require the EPA to regulate this pollutant, Agent Orange, which is in a green cloud all over the city. Now, would you say that the person who's made that claim has no standing?",
  "I was only addressing, using that to -- to address your problem that the chances are too small that, in fact, any one individual will be affected by the 7 percent or 6 percent of the material that comes out of the truck -- the CO2.",
  "Suppose others cooperate? Suppose, for example, they regulate this and before you know it, they start to sequester carbon with the power plants, and before you know it, they decide ethanol might be a good idea, and before you know it, they decide any one of 15 things, each of which has an impact, and lo and behold, Cape Cod is saved. Now why is it unreasonable? Why is it unreasonable to go to an agency and say now you do your part, which is 6 percent, and now we're going to go to a different agency like NHTSA and we're going to ask them too, and we're going to go to your electricity regulation program, and coal. And there are like not a million things that have to be done, maybe there are only seven. But by the time we get those seven things done, we'll make a big difference. Now what is it in the law that says that somehow a person cannot go to an agency and say we want you to do your part? Would you be up here saying the same thing if we're trying to regulate child pornography, and it turns out that anyone with a computer can get pornography elsewhere? I don't think so.",
  "So they couldn't have gone in and asked for ozone regulations, because that requires other countries? Or what about dumping heavy metals in the sea, and as the sea gets polluted because of what other countries do, but EPA tried to regulate that. Acid rain they tried to regulate. You're saying there is no standing to ask for any of that.",
  "But you are saying if Congress passes a statute and they put the words CO2 right in this statute under ambient air, and they say anybody can go and sue if the EPA doesn't do it, you're saying Congress lacks the constitutional authority to do that, because it's Article III we're talking about?",
  "I'd like you to address that. You said there was a lot of legislation in Congress that would have been pretty inconsistent with serious regulation by the FDA. And in this case, I don't think Congress is opposing the notion. I don't know anybody there who's in favor of global warming. And it seems to me they haven't passed laws that is actually, that would be significantly interfered with by the EPA trying to do its best to deal with this problem. Or am I wrong?",
  "What articles would be - -",
  "Is there anything in the statute that prevents them from consulting with other nations or prevents the government from doing that when they determine how best to work out whatever standards or other forms of regulation they want?",
  "Do you think they have a good reason, yes or no? Because I'm not an expert in foreign affairs. The EPA probably is more than I am. But do you think that if they do rest their decision on their analysis of foreign affairs, that that is a proper basis for an agency like the EPA to refuse to regulate?",
  "What is your answer to Justice Scalia? Because I thought you said before that you thought it was appropriate for us to send this case back so that they could redetermine in light of proper considerations whether they wanted to exercise their authority.",
  "Am I wrong about that?",
  "Suppose that it was a national bank. Forget the subsidiary. And your State says: Well, we want to have a law here that says we want to send our own bank examiners in. And moreover, we don't want them to make any loans in excess of 12 percent interest. Fine. Would that be constitutional? I mean, wouldn't be preempted?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, of course, because it conflicts and they don't want it.",
  "All right. Do they have the authority to say a subsidiary is a national bank?",
  "No, they can't? Where is it in the law that says they don't have the authority to say that a subsidiary of a national bank owned by a national bank is a national bank? Is there something specifically that stops them from saying that?",
  "What?",
  "What is it? What is it - - I mean, what statute or what is it that prevents them from saying it? I don't know the Gold Foods case.",
  "Doesn't it have exactly the same power that any other agency or Congress has? That it has the power, if its regulation is authorized, it has the power to what they say, preempt a state law that obstructs, impairs, or conditions a bank's ability fully to exercise its federally authorized real estate lending powers? That's what they say, and then they list some examples. Suppose they said nothing. Wouldn't we be in the same boat? After all, a state cannot under the Federal Constitution normally enact a law that interferes or stands as an obstacle to the achievement of the objective of the Federal law. So if that's right, or if it's wrong, explain why it's wrong, but if it's right, why don't you tell me whether the two laws that you are worried about do or do not stand as an obstacle to the full achievement of the purposes of the statute as implemented by their regulation?",
  "Let's assume I don't agree with you about that, that I think conflict preemption does not require clear language. Assume that, even though you disagree with it. Now on my assumption that you can have the law if it doesn't conflict, but you can't have the law if it does conflict, so now you explain to me why the two laws at issue here don't conflict.",
  "We're not looking for that. We're looking for the opposite. As I read this, the banking agency has not said, we wipe out all of your laws. They've said, we wipe out a subset of laws, which are defined as those laws that obstruct, impair, or limit the ability of this bank to fulfill its federally mandated powers. Okay? So they're just saying, we only get the ones that are in conflict. Now, they then have a list of which ones they preempt and which ones they don't. So my question to you is, give me a list here of which ones they think conflict that you think don't.",
  "That's the question I had. I got somewhat thrown by the Chief Justice's question, because I thought first, when I read the reg, 34.4.ab, that those things that are preempted are those things that obstruct, impair or condition, or in other words limit, the Federal powers of a national bank.",
  "But I thought we were basically dealing with conflict - -",
  "-- not fielding.",
  "But -- but the last part of the reg says that what applies, no State law applies to a national bank operating subsidiary if it doesn't apply to the parent bank. And I began to think it fields preemption. Am I right in thinking that it is conflict preemption, not field, because it is conflict in the case of a national bank?",
  "Conflict preemption basically strikes down a State law that stands as an obstacle to the full enforcement of the Federal law.",
  "All right. Now, with that in mind, suppose that you didn't have either 7.4006 or 34.4(a)(B). Neither existed. But we listened to what the agency said as a Court and they explained how the regulation worked. Would you expect to come to precisely the same result?",
  "Would you or not?",
  "I know, but would you - - would you expect to come to the same result or not?",
  "But I think that the point that Justice Souter is trying to make, as I understand it, is of course there are similarities to Gratz, they can choose, but there's a big difference. The similarity in Grutter, or the difference in Grutter and Gratz is that you had to prod a school that was supposed to be better than others, that the members of that school, the faculty and the administration tried to make it better than others. It was an elite merit selection academy. And if you put the black person in, the white person can't get the benefit of that. Here we have no merit selection system. Merit is not an issue. The object of the people who run this place is not to create a school better than others, it is to equalize the schools. That's in principle and in practice, if you look at the numbers, you see that the six schools that were at the top, their position would shift radically from year to year, preferences was about equal among them. They have the same curriculum, they have similar faculties, and I don't think anyone can say either in theory or in practice, that one of these schools happened to be like that prize of University of Michigan, a merit selection system. That, I think, was a major difference that he was getting at, why is this not the same kind of thing? That was at issue in Grutter and Gratz. Now what is your response to that?",
  "I didn't say that they were. What I said was that the object of the school board and the administering authority was to make them roughly equal. I said that in terms of curriculum and faculty, they're about roughly equal. And in terms of choice, what you see is a wide variation in choice by those who want to go as to which is their preference among six schools over a period of five years. And that suggests a rough effort to create the equality, not an effort as in Michigan, to run a merit selection system.",
  "Fine. Now the question is, why doesn't that fact that this is not a merit selection system put a different kind of thing, a sorting system or a system designed to maintain a degree of integration, why doesn't that difference make a difference?",
  "While you're talking about the way, let me ask a practical question. 35 years ago in Swann, this Court said that a school board, particularly an elected one -- it didn't say that -- \"could well conclude that to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting the proportion of the district as a whole.\" Far more radical than anything that's at issue here. Then it adds: \"To do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities.\" That's what this Court said 35 years ago. Thousands of school districts across the country, we're told, have relied on that statement in an opinion to try to bring about a degree of integration. You can answer this in the next case if you want. So think about it.",
  "My question, of course, is simply this. When you have thousands of school districts relying on this to get a degree of integration in the United States of America, what are you telling this Court is going to happen when we start suddenly making -- departing from the case? Do you want us to overrule it? Why? Why practically?",
  "Justice Kennedy's question, I think, was is this basically a kind of last report? Or how close to a has resort is it? What's the history of this? I thought the history involved a lawsuit to desegregate the schools, a much more rigid system of racial -- abuse of race. Ultimately you come to this. Now you stop this. And what happened after you stopped it?",
  "Well, what is the history basically? Am I right?",
  "But that's not what I'm thinking.",
  "I mean I'm thinking that, I thought as I read this, and you have to correct me because you have a better knowledge, originally the schools were highly segregated in fact. People brought a lawsuit. Then to stop that Seattle engaged in a plan that really bused people around on the basis of race. That led to white flight. That was bad for the schools. They then tried a voluntary choice plan. This is part of that plan. Then when they abandon this plan, they discover more segregation. Is that basically right or not?",
  "This is the -- as I gather, the plan where race is used, has to do only with the ninth grade. And therefore, what you would like to note is when you look at the ninth grade after they stopped using any racial criteria at all, what happened to those ninth grade classes. Did they become more heavily separated or did they retain their diversity? Are the numbers that you are about to read us, which I have in front of me, going to do that? Tell us that? I think they're about the whole school.",
  "The numbers I have here, Franklin went from 25 percent white to 12.7 percent. Roosevelt, which was basically a white school, jumped up from about 51 to 59. Ballard jumped up from about 56 to 62. Then Garfield went down some, more mixed. But those were the worst ones; am I right on that?",
  "Okay.",
  "Not an improvement exactly, but maybe from the Constitution's point of view. That Constitution wanted, as they said in the Slaughterhouse cases, to take people who had formerly been slaves and their children and make them full members of American society. And part of that was that the State couldn't insist that they go to separate schools. Now, the question from a constitutional point of view that you're being asked is how could that Constitution which says that this is intolerable, that segregated school, and insist that the school boards in Swann and elsewhere take the black children and white children and integrate them? How could the Constitution the day that that decree is removed tell the school board it cannot make that effort any more, it can't do what it's been doing, and we'll send the children back to their black schools and their white schools? That I take it is why the Court in Swann said explicitly that you could use race as a factor in the public schools when the school board so chooses. Now, that's the general question that I think Justice Ginsburg began and Justice Souter was following it up. And I would appreciate your response.",
  "You have doubt -- you have little doubt. Are you an educational expert? I mean, the -- it seems to me from what I read, that there is a terrible problem in the country. The problem is that there are lots and lots of school districts that are becoming more and more segregated in fact, and that school boards all over are struggling with this problem. And if they knew an easy way, they'd do it. So I don't know whether this is exactly the only way to do it or not. I do know courts are not very good at figuring that out. And I guess that's why the Court previously has said it is primarily up to the school district. What's your response?",
  "Why is -- I'm trying to find out -- I understand what you think of Gratz. We can agree or disagree about that. But the overall view of the Constitution, that interpretation that you have in your mind, if it really forbids it, no use of race, I mean, basically -- all right? Think -- go back to Cooper versus Aaron. Go back to the case where this Court with paratroopers had to use tremendous means to get those children into the school. That's because the society was divided. Here we have a society, black and white, who elect school board members who together have voted to have this form of integration. Why, given that change in society -- which is a good one -- what -- how can the Constitution be interpreted in a way that would require us, the judges, to go in and make them take the black children out of the school? See, my objection to your approach to the Constitution is primarily a practical one.",
  "Are you prepared to just say, all right, they can do it some, just be careful about it? How far will you go with that?",
  "All right. So you're saying we'll do it some, just be careful about it?",
  "Why did you say -- in truth, maybe I missed it. In your response to Justice Kennedy, I think you said, when he asked, that this Court has never said that the explicit use of race by a K through 12 school board was constitutional, and I thought the Court had explicitly said that in Swann.",
  "I thought that, that Justice Powell explicitly said it. I that Chief Justice Rehnquist had explicitly said it. I thought if you went back in sense to the slaughterhouse cases, you'll find in 1872, this Court thought that the primary objective, the primary objective of that Fourteenth Amendment was to take people who had been formerly slaves and to bring them into this society, and that all of phrases of that amendment should be interpreted with that objective in mind. I mean, it didn't say that explicitly there, but it seems explicitly and implicitly this Court has said that.",
  "What about the other part? Because I think the Solicitor General -- I hope, I don't want to put words in his mouth -- but I think he agrees that Brown held out the promise of an equal education, that the country worked for 35 or 40 years to try to get a degree of integration, and that maintaining it is important. I think the Government agrees with that. They think this case goes too far. And in that I think he's referring to narrow tailoring. It isn't narrowly tailored enough. So I would appreciate knowing why you think it is.",
  "So then the Ninth Circuit was wrong in your opinion when it defined generic theft as the taking or exercising control over property without consent, with the intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits, even if it is less than permanent or total? They're wrong in your opinion?",
  "Well then, I don't see how you make - -",
  "Isn't that inconsistent with what you just said?",
  "Why not?",
  "I don't understand how that could be right, though. I mean, when you joyride it's less than personal. In other words, their definition is if you take somebody else's property for an hour that that isn't theft, but if you take it for a day it is?",
  "They're trying to -- is there a common law, because they're trying to report - - is under the common law there a rule or any generic rule that says if you take somebody else's property for a couple of hours it is not theft, but if you take it for several hours or several days it is theft?",
  "You're saying that the rule is something is theft only if you take it long enough to deprive an owner of a significant portion of its value?",
  "No, no, no. Wait. I want to know where that comes from, because I would think I have a Volvo. It lasts for about 30 years, apparently. So I guess if you took my car for a year, that that then would not be a theft, or maybe it would be. Where is the source of the rule you just cited?",
  "No, no. I want a book. I want a book that will tell me that if they take my car for a month it isn't theft, but if they take it for a year it is. What book, or where do I look to verify that this is common law? I'm not denying what you're saying. I just want to know where to look.",
  "But what do we do about that? No, you have no interest in answering my question, but the question, it seems to me under the law, here is what I do -- and I'm a good deference lawyer, as you are. I simply look at the statute. And I imagine some very weird case that the statute could cover where the person wouldn't have the right intent or it wouldn't be theft or it would be some odd thing. There's no possibility in the world that applied to my client. But most charges are simply stated in the wording of the statute. And most judgments simply say guilty. So I say \"see, you see, it is theoretically possible.\" And now when you decide what really happened, Court, you're supposed to look only to the charging documents in the judgment; and you can't say it didn't. So the whole congressional scheme is basically put to the side. Now what's the answer to that problem, insofar as you want to answer it?",
  "Have you been able to think of any examples where a person could have been, convicted of this statute, under the statute would he actually have been some kind of accessory to another person committing another crime, and the natural and probable consequence was that that other person would violate this statute?",
  "Have you been able to think of one?",
  "Yes, I am.",
  "Well then, what's an example of where you're held guilty on the ground that you aided and abetted natural and probable -- somebody did X and the natural and probable consequence was Y. Because after all, you are properly held guilty when you do an act and a known consequence is Y. So what's an example of that?",
  "One would be good enough. The best one.",
  "That's a known and probable consequence? That's a probable consequence?",
  "Well then, maybe the problem is that they don't define natural and probable consequence properly.",
  "You're asking us to say that not only do the states have to have the same rule, but they have to interpret the rule the same way. This would make the application of the categorical approach impossible. You'd have to look not only to the expression of the rule of law by the state courts, but to its application by the state courts in every jurisdiction. I mean, that just makes the whole enterprise infeasible, it seems to me.",
  "I guess in many thousands of municipalities throughout the United States it's fairly common to have a locally owned electricity distribution company, or an electrically -- or a gas distribution company. And I thought it was fairly common for a municipally owned pipeline, gas pipeline, or electricity distribution to say, if you live in our town you've got to buy from us; you've got to buy from the local community. And I guess that's been going on for about 110 years. And yet I've never seen anybody think or write or anything that that violated the Commerce Clause. But of course, there could be somebody in another State who'd like to sell electricity to the people in our town. They can't do it because the town says, we own the company and you got to buy from us. Now, if we agree with you are we saying that all those gas companies, distribution companies, et cetera, are behaving unconstitutionally?",
  "No, I'm not interested in tests. I'm interested in just the outcome. I just raise the question.",
  "Well, I used to teach the subject and I can't say you're wrong. But I knew that it was a fairly common thing to have a certification that gave you a -- as a company, it would give them a local area in which they had an exclusive monopoly. And that was common and it was called a service area, and in the local town, the service area, I never even heard of a company trying to come in and sell from abroad, because I thought that this certificate gave them an exclusive right to provide the local electricity service or the natural gas service. I mean, it's a fairly obvious thing. And I might be wrong and I mention that my memory -- I've never focused directly on it. Just everybody I read and everything I read, I assumed the constitutionality of this. But of course, memory is fallible, including mine. Therefore, I raise the question.",
  "No, no. I'm not talking about that because I guess that would be trying to attack Carbone. Far be it from me. But I know at least there are these things called municipal gas utilities and municipal electricity companies; and during the New Deal that was thought to be quite a good thing, and that's years ago. In all that time when people were attacking New Deal agencies, I've never seen an attack based on this ground.",
  "Yeah, I think it would. The same logic would apply.",
  "Well, the fact is there is a difference between public ownership and giving an exclusive franchise to a public company. And the public ownership means that the people of the State have decided to have their own little nationalized industry, which again people don't like, many. But I never knew there was anything in the Constitution that forbid it.",
  "Nationalized industries?",
  "Well, there is still at least the obvious distinction, that one of the main purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause is to prevent protectionism. Protectionism is when a state favors its own producers. And you could see, indeed a big argument in Carbone was, you aren't favoring your own producer; well, we are at least favoring one. But now where the municipality is running it itself, no one is favored. So I don't think it was an object of the Commerce Clause to prevent a State from favoring its own government.",
  "Well, it's about - -",
  "Well, is there something here that is not protection? Because Carbone was still perhaps viewing it most favorably, an extreme case of protection, only one individual was protected.",
  "Here, I take it the reason they want to do this is because they wanted their municipal facility to charge a higher price for the non-recyclable rubbish and that will encourage people to segregate the rubbish and thereby have more cyclable - - recyclable rubbish, and therefore overall pay less. And that's why they want to do it, and of course that's not going to work. If somebody comes in from out of State and charges a lower price for all of the non-recyclable rubbish or you know, for all rubbish, it just won't work. It is rather like electricity, interestingly enough, where municipalities would do the same thing. They want discriminatory rates in order to push out the possibility of poorer people getting electricity. This they want to do the same thing but they want to do it for rubbish, for, to encourage recycling.",
  "Like it - -",
  "I actually point out that California, I think, wants to own the grid and privatize the rest of it. And there are -- I mean, it - - Justice Kennedy is totally right. There are all kinds of combinations and permutations. There, there could be distributors who are in fact regulated private companies and local distributors who are owned by the city, and I guess there, there is one generator, at least, company that's owned by the -- that's a -- TV -- with TVA. They, they make their own. So there are all kinds of permutations and combinations. And I think we're getting at, when we take that aspect of the permutation and combination and say that aspect of it which is owned by a Government says: \"Our way or the highway.\" You know, that's what they say. \"Buy from us.\" Period. And if you're in a certain region, I've always thought they could do that. And I have to admit I never really looked it up; I've just never came across a case that says to the contrary.",
  "I have a question, if I can, if we should reach the merits of the case - -",
  "I know that. That isn't it. I have a question about -- I have a question about the merits.",
  "I know, but I have a question I'd like you to go into.",
  "I looked up, my law clerk has, and found eight States that seem roughly comparable. Those that go to assessed value, every single one of them -- and most of them do -- they have the word like \"assessment. The only comparable places we found are Puerto Rico, Philippines in 1916, and Guam here which don't use the word \"assessment,\" but use the words \"aggregate taxable value.\" All right. Now, what's happened in those places? We know what's happening in Guam. I can't - - with the Philippines in 1916 and Puerto Rico, there ought to be some experience there even if we couldn't find a case how they treated it.",
  "Try Utah, try Iowa. Try - -",
  "My question is the following. In Puerto Rico and in the Philippines after 1916, and in Alaska, were there any instances in which they issued bonds that exceeded the 10 percent of the assessed value as opposed to the aggregate market value? They either did or didn't and that shouldn't be hard to find out.",
  "There are big lenders in the United States and those people don't fool around. They get opinions. And they lend money to Puerto Rico or they lend money to some of these places. They're going to have opinion letters. And those opinion letters are going to say whether they think in their opinion this is over reaching to many bonds or not. And Of course, I would think those opinion letters would say for Puerto Rico, what the words aggregate tax valuation mean. They might or might not. In other words, I'm trying to find ways of getting the tax.",
  "That's where I'm having trouble on your side. I can't get very far with a history of other places. Apparently I can't get there. Tax doesn't seem to help me very much. So I thought, well, one thing is clear. What they're trying to do here is they take out of the box, if you look at it, take all of the list of property that they don't tax. I guess a school, maybe some tax exempt business or something.",
  "Now their reason for doing that must be that those people who they've exempted entirely by statute are not going to be much help in paying Guam. Well, if that's true, isn't precisely the same thing true of the two-thirds of the property that they don't take into account when they set their taxes?",
  "Because?",
  "No. It doesn't secure it one bit if, in fact, the tax statute says you can't take it into account when you set your taxes. Just as is true of, let's say, a tax free business of some kind. Now Guam doesn't have to do that, it could change its statute, but so could it change its statute in respect to a school, a university, or whatever the other things are that are off those tax rolls. You know that, you know, your answer was circular. That assumes that the whole property is, but it isn't.",
  "Which one? You say they've all used market values?",
  "Well, which of the ones that use it have in fact an assessed value that is a percentage of market value?",
  "All right. Well, that doesn't help us then.",
  "Well, we could look at Hawaii. In Hawaii they use the word assessed value. They couldn't possibly have wanted it to be market value, I wouldn't think.",
  "And in the District of Columbia -- where are we on this? It's something else in D.C. They use assessed value in the Virgin Islands.",
  "Even if it is incorrect, if we -- we don't know precisely what he meant by the words he said, why doesn't that argue even more strongly for a hearing? At the hearing he wants to introduce, doesn't he, his stepparents, or foster parents, a school teacher, the various others? And he'll say anyone who listens to those people will see that I have the most horrendous upbringing anyone could have. The worst you've ever heard. And my argument is that if only my lawyer had looked into this at that moment in the trial, he would have said in the sentencing proceeding, look what I can present for you. And if he had done it and told me that, anyone would have said, \"of course, present it.\" And I want a chance to show that that's true of my case. Now, why shouldn't he have a hearing on that? No hearing was given him in the State court.",
  "In State court he didn't.",
  "Well, I mean, is the requirement such that when you ask for a hearing in a State court on a general matter, \"I would like to show through a hearing,\" then he gives a whole lot of affidavits of the kind of thing he's going to produce, that then the State says \"no,\" you go into Federal court and say \"I'm roughly going to do the same thing, I have a few extra witnesses, some of the people say some extra things,\" no, you can't do that?",
  "Didn't he say my claim is ineffective assistance?",
  "Yeah. Because he didn't investigate to discover the horrendous circumstances in which I was raised, and had he done it, he would have found roughly this kind of thing, and I would like to show that he should have done that because it would have changed the result?",
  "What is the standard? I ask that because I'm not certain from what I heard previously -- I think the State was saying that the only issue that was raised before the State proceeding, collateral, the State collateral post-sentencing proceeding, was that you wanted to present evidence that he had a biological gene, it's a faulty gene, something like that. When I've looked at this, it's on page 88, the motion filed says we have two claims. One claim is the claim that was just mentioned, it says that -- about it's from the biological mother, and use of drugs and alcohol.",
  "Joint appendix A. And then there's a second one on page 88 that says in addition to failing to investigate these alternative sources, we also want to say that counsel failed to explore additional grounds, and that was the sister. And the sister was going to testify that the mother -- the foster mother, Mrs. Landrigan, abused alcohol, and she has a whole list of things in her affidavit. So is that still before us? I mean, isn't that something you want to argue?",
  "All right.",
  "And then the claim would be this: You want a hearing in which you're going to present the sister, the Landrigans, what they did , what the school says, what happened to him at school, all things that are there in Affidavit 5 which was in the State court, and that the biological gene. And you want to say, am I right, I don't want to put words in your mouth, and you want to say that given all this, had this been looked into and presented to the defendant, the defendant would not have said don't present any of that, it would have been presented, and it would have made a difference. What -- is that what you want to do?",
  "All right.",
  "All right, with that too.",
  "Now, what the Ninth Circuit said is, we'll give you a hearing. We don't know if you're right or wrong. What's the standard for giving you the hearing? I -- a lot of things in the law aren't always written down exactly, and I was under the impression that trial judges often give hearings on what you might call seat of the pants. I'd like to hear more about it. I've been on appellate courts where rightly or wrongly we've said, I just think I'd like to know more about this. I can't quite understand it. Let's have a hearing. And we're going to tell the trial judge to do it.",
  "I'm not actually talking about waiver. My question was just generally what I asked. What is the standard there on whether you get a hearing?",
  "Yes, but what do you distribute?",
  "What do you distribute? I mean, I agree you have a, some kind of, let's put something on cards, so you have thousands of cards and each one has a number on it. What are you distributing -- the cards? Are you, are you -- what's distribute - - a 5th percentile refers to some kind of distribution. What's it a distribution of?",
  "Is it a thing?",
  "Like a -- like a set of things that you're distributing, what are they?",
  "In other words, you take all the -- there is a set of numbers, each number is a different number and the characteristic of each number is there some school district that spends per, or takes in per pupil, revenue equal to that number. So we write each one on a card. Is that what we're, is that our distribution? We have like, let's say we have a, a thousand cards. Is that what it is?",
  "No. No. I'm not, I'm saying what do you think it has to be? What do you think it should be? What are, what is it we are distributing? A simple question, I guess, for a statistician. I unfortunately am not one and can't find one, so I have no idea what this statute means.",
  "Not a value. I want to know what I'm distributing. And if you don't know I would say that this is, I have never seen a case so much better fitted for relying on the views of an agency.",
  "I'm sorry, I don't know how --",
  "So, so in other words we are distributing those cards, it's a set of numbers? If you're certain, isn't it fair to say that this statute is not clear as to what it is you're distributing?",
  "Well, I -- I thought not. Is there a - -",
  "Yeah -- that -- right. But I unfortunately don't know enough about this subject, so I thought, not being an expert on it, that when you referred to a percentile, you have some group of things, a set of things that's being distributed in a certain order and there is a top of that and a bottom of that.",
  "And if that's what percentile refers to, I just want to know what those things are that are being distributed. And - and that's where I find the ambiguity. And if there is an ambiguity, I guess we are going to take the view of the agency at least as I understand it. So -- so that's why I asked the question.",
  "And does the statute say you have to do it that way? It has to be the group that's distributed?",
  "Clearly.",
  "No, you could do it that way and the reason the Government, I think, says that you shouldn't do it that way is that it would produce an absurd result.",
  "That the object of the statute is to catch the outliers. And if you, for example, had one giant school district like New York City which was at the top of the list and another giant school district that was at the bottom of the list you would cut those two out, and you might have cut out half the pupils in the whole State, and those wouldn't be outliers would they? I mean, that's the problem.",
  "It, it eliminates 26 school districts but those 26 school districts account for 5 percent or 10 percent of the pupils. And I guess what we are interested in here is not school districts; they are not a thing -- they are a thing of a kind, but we are interested in students, real people who get money. And so that it, that it -- it eliminates 26 percent of the school districts would see, to be a good thing, not a bad thing, because what we are really interested in are the pupils and it keeps in 90 percent of the pupils.",
  "That's all right. I wouldn't think that was a problem. But what about Justice Stevens' question. There are 20 districts in our State -- it's exaggerated, let me exaggerate it - - and the rich district has 20, has a quarter of the students, and the poor district has another quarter. So our outliers in that situation which we're eliminating from our calculation are the rich district and the poor district. One's at the top, one's at the bottom. And now we're left with 18 districts to figure out whether they're equalized. But those 18 districts account for less than half or about half of all the students. That's the problem. It seems that isn't very representative and we're trying to get representativeness.",
  "I understand that. If the language doesn't permit it you can't do it, they can't, and you win. But if the language does permit it, the reason -- you have to stretch the language, I suspect, in my view to get to the Government's result. It might just barely permit it. But one of the things on their side is that if we take your view it produces an absurd result, because of what Justice Ginsburg said, because there is such variation in the number of pupils among school districts in different states.",
  "Why doesn't it -- why doesn't absolutely compel it? Where is the ambiguity, you say?",
  "-- the 5th percentile of such per-pupil expenditure. And that - -",
  "Now how are you going to get that so it doesn't just say just list cards with per-pupil expenditure on it, different ones and take the top five?",
  "Do you have a lot of cards that have the same cards that have the same number? You have a lot - -",
  "Yeah.",
  "And why, why don't you take the top five where we have 10 percent of the students, let's take the second five and they happens to have the same number on the card as the first five, and why don't they fall in the first 5 percent?",
  "All right. Forget it.",
  "To include the words per-pupil revenue for each pupil, is that what you're saying?",
  "How do you want to say it, per-pupil revenue attached to each pupil?",
  "Or how do you want to say it then?",
  "What is attached to each pupil? You say the word such is broad enough to include per-pupil revenue as attached to each pupil?",
  "And I don't know where to look to discover if you're right or wrong.",
  "Is there any statistical text that you could look at to see it that's the way people use the words?",
  "If that's what they intended, then how can a State say, well, it's the union's money, we don't want you to send this little bit of your money to contribute in a campaign, but if the local swimming team wants to, or the bar association or the corporation, if they want to spend money that people have given them for totally other purposes, the compulsory bar association, well, they can do that. It's just the labor unions that can't spend the money that these people forced to belong -- you know, they have to object affirmatively -- but all the other similar organizations, they can't.",
  "Well, now you're talking about this other purpose, but that other purpose, which is rather interesting -- I take it that's one of the main points on the other side -- the other purpose has nothing to do with this case. If Washington wanted to have a similar statute where it was worried about protecting the interests of the compelled member or the compelled payor, fine, fine, that would be a different case. That isn't this case.",
  "In this case they couldn't care less about that.",
  "That's true, but in that case, in that case they didn't have a State Supreme Court interpreting the statute which is just as you started off saying it was, which has nothing to with the rights of the nonmember, zero. It has to do with the appearance of fairness in the election.",
  "Do they get their money back? If this is upheld and I'm an agency member, I hate the union, can't stand it, gave them the $20 for this and they spent it on a political candidate I hate even more and you win, do I get my $20 back or can the union just spend my $20 on something else?",
  "I'm trying to get at the question is this the union's money or is this the workers', the teachers' money?",
  "So does he get this money back if they violate the statute.",
  "I'm just curious below in the opinion, I didn't notice in footnote 6, which I hadn't taken in, that the court explicitly says that you did not make any argument about underinclusiveness and overinclusiveness with respect to other organizations, corporations and so forth. Now, did -- I can't recall, I just don't recall. What you're saying now, I take it, is that the word \"election,\" you can't use it for elections, and elections involve candidates and they also involve ballot issues.",
  "And you're saying that the real problem with this statute is that it throws in ballot issues along with candidate elections.",
  "But on that first one, did they discuss that at some length in the lower court opinion? I don't - -",
  "So this is really a ground that they haven't considered.",
  "But this thing about the ballot issue is not there.",
  "In fact, you want to us decide that question, and was there another one that - - you just said there were two reasons basically.",
  "And I see that you've put a lot of weight on this argument.",
  "What you're saying right now, if it is, is ballots versus candidates under the word \"election.\"",
  "And that has a lot of implications for all kinds of campaign finance law that has nothing to do, I think, with unions.",
  "And the lower court didn't consider it, and is this open now, if it's going back for other things such as the State Constitution, for them to consider this matter on remand?",
  "And I don't know, perhaps you don't know, what the implication of a decision say in your favor here would have for Vermont's campaign finance law or California's or some other.",
  "If that's yes, then the category here is election speech. If you're going to call a statute that treats election speech especially, then all of campaign finance regulation would fall in that category. And if you're going to use that distinction to say strict scrutiny applies, then strict scrutiny would apply to all campaign finance regulation. And courts never to my knowledge apply strict scrutiny to campaign finance regulation because there are speech interests on both sides of the equation.",
  "I'm glad you said yes to me because that implies a no to the last question.",
  "Question - -",
  "I'm sort of back where Justice Kennedy started on this. Forget -- I'd like to forget your case, because your case seems to me to be a case where parties argue reasonably about whether the contract itself covers this kind of fee. And maybe it doesn't, if it's very unreasonable, et cetera. But let's take a very straightforward case. It's an obvious contract to collect a debt, or maybe a mortgage, and in the debt or the mortgage agreement, it says, attorneys' fees will be paid for collection. It clearly covers bankruptcy, too, by its language. And now there must be many instances or some, anyway, where the security is inadequate.",
  "And there must be other instances in which there wasn't any security. And if I read Collier as you pointed to, that seems to say, in such cases, very simple, the creditor has the status of an unsecured creditor in respect to those attorneys' fees.",
  "Overage in the secured case, and the whole claim in the unsecured case. So get in the queue and you can collect your pro-rata share.",
  "My question is, I have 19 professors on the other side coming to tell me that that's never happened. They can't even find an instance. So it isn't as if, it isn't as if you haven't found an instance, it is that they are prepared to say it never happened. And then there may be one exception or two or something like that. And I can't, that -- I'm now totally puzzled. Because if it's so clear as you say, and I follow your logic, and I followed Collier, why? After all, there are bankrupt people who do have some assets. Explain it.",
  "You would have thought that the one group of people who ought to know this thoroughly, or at least have a view are the bankruptcy bar.",
  "And, and yet there are no briefs from them; there are not -- there is no article that I could find in Bankruptcy Journal.",
  "Well, how do you avoid - - what about their statement from Collier?",
  "No. No. It said -- a pre-petition claim, if a creditor incurs the attorneys' fees post-petition, they incur it post-petition, afterwards they file, after the petition they file a claim with the bankruptcy court, in exercising or protecting a pre-petition claim that included a right to recover attorneys' fees. And they say that's what we have, we had a contract that gave us this right to attorneys' fees. The fees will be pre- petitioned in nature, constituting a contingent pre-petition obligation that became fixed post-petition when the fees were incurred. All right. Now, what is your response to that?",
  "Because?",
  "Then you explain that to me?",
  "Well, that's because 506 had to do that in order to tell the bankruptcy courts how to deal with secured claims.",
  "Of course, that is exactly what's puzzling me. But why haven't they gone out and got? So why -- what you're pointing to so far is that Congress has said a particular class of people get the attorneys' fees out of the security insofar as the security will support it. It doesn't say a word about what happens to the attorneys' fees after the security is exhausted, nor about anybody else's attorneys' fees, where so provided by contract. Colliers says they can get it.",
  "Same puzzlement.",
  "Suppose I sell you a house and I make a promise that I'll fix any leaks in the bathroom. And lo and behold, before there's a leak the -- I'm bankrupt. And while I'm bankrupt it floods, the bathroom. No claim?",
  "It is a contingent claim. And you're saying this is the same.",
  "Well, are those 15 places -- do they involve attorneys' fees as administrative expenses? Do any of them involve attorneys' fees simply as an unsecured claim for attorneys' fees?",
  "What's the answer to my question? Is the answer that 11 of them say you can collect attorneys' fees, but only as an unsecured claim against creditors.",
  "All right, so six.",
  "So six are administrative, and then the remaining two say that the creditor can collect it as an unsecured debt?",
  "Which are those two?",
  "Which is that?",
  "That seems to cut the other way because it says it's disallowed insofar as it's unreasonable of course, and therefore it would be allowed insofar as it's reasonable.",
  "Yes, but I mean you don't have exactly what I was driving to. I was quite interested that you said there are 11 other provisions that we could look at for support, and I wouldn't think it was support if those consider -- concern administrative expenses, which nobody's asking for here, they just want an unsecured claim, or if they concern some other - -",
  "-- irrelevant thing.",
  "How -- can we decide? But I'm wondering about, maybe you don't want to answer this, but I mean, if we were to say Fobian is wrong, everybody will agree with us. But we should have to say why it's wrong. And if we say the reason that it's wrong is because you can't collect attorneys' fees at all, you'll be delighted. And if we say the reason it's wrong is because you can collect attorneys' fees regardless, they'll be delighted. And our only other alternative is to not say why it's wrong or -- I mean, that's the problem.",
  "You're saying this particular set of pre-petition obligations. Collier, I think in context must be saying, you get paid the money. I mean, he goes on in the next sentence and says by the way, despite my last sentence, you don't get the money?",
  "Oh, in other words what he implies, if I ready the whole page I'll see, although he just said what we quoted, the whole page means, by the way, I'm not telling you if you get the money or not?",
  "Sorry, I'll - -",
  "I think your 506(b) argument, I see your point, I see your point, is there -- I mean, and you'd have to say well, 506(b) simply repeats 506(a), as sometimes provisions do, and then it becomes somewhat superfluous, somewhat not. I got that point. I also have your point about, well, there are other references. Now, is there any other point in the code?",
  "How do they do it with my leaky bathroom?",
  "Would you say it's all right to use the model penal code definition of reckless, which is basically what you -- taking it here, you would have to consciously disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the action is unlawful?",
  "If you come across anything that would use that, I mean \"reckless\" itself is unclear. The model penal code tried to clarify it based on this Court's opinions primarily.",
  "What's the difference?",
  "Well, you said there is no way they couldn't have been conscious of the risk here. I mean, after all, that's why they went to lawyers. They know there's risk that this is unlawful.",
  "But consciousness, I mean, maybe it should come in in the standard, but I don't know that that would help you.",
  "That isn't how the statute defines it.",
  "The statute says an adverse action is an increase in a charge for -- in connection with underwriting.",
  "That's what it says. And then it says an increase is -- and if you take an adverse action, i.e., if you increase it, and your increase is based in whole or in part on information contained in a consumer report, you have to send the thing. How did you get -- in your example, there was no increase. I mean, in a charge. In your salary, it's a decrease in the salary. Same thing.",
  "You mean unfavorable change in terms, unfavorable change in terms.",
  "Well, suppose you don't have, you don't have any terms because you never did it before. There's no change in terms.",
  "You mean those words \"change in terms\" refer to rates, in other words? That's a rather odd way to refer to it. In one place, you refer to an \"increase\"; in the other place, you'd refer to it as a \"change in terms.\" That's sort of an odd way to write a statute.",
  "No, no, I understand that. But what we're after is this. Everybody has a credit report, just about. You put it in and you give people the best possible rate conceivable, and now, how do you know that maybe there could have still been a better rate? And it can't be that the statute intends you to send out notices in such circumstances or you'd have to send notices whenever you read a credit report. Now, I think that's, I've overstated slightly, but that's basically the argument. So what's your response?",
  "Okay, so your response is just to repeat my question and say that's right?",
  "Well, how could that be? I mean I agree that the statute is clear, but I think it's clear the other way. That is, if you look at the language, as you've just heard, if you look at the purpose it's very hard to reconcile with the purpose an instance where a person has continuous accidents. He's a reckless driver. His insurance company puts him in just a category below the bottom and they read his credit report and they discover, despite his faults, he always pays his bills on time. So they increase it, not to the top category, but they give him a much better deal. And you're saying this statute means that what I just described is an adverse action based on a credit report?",
  "Yes. Okay. And then if you're going to say yes, I want to hear why yes, and then in light of the following: The little boy who says wolf. You're probably puzzled what I mean by that. I mean that if you're right in that interpretation, there will be tens of millions of notices going out and they'll have the same effect on the public that these privacy notices have today. We get them every day, dozens of them, and they go right in the wastebasket, because they will become meaningless because to an average person that notice will not mean that he better look at his credit report. It will mean throw it in the wastebasket. All right, now I've got the purpose, I've got the language, and I have what I think of as common sense. Now, you explain why it's obvious the opposite.",
  "It doesn't explain it because if you have an increase in the charge based on race, of course that's an increase based on race.",
  "And if you refuse to give a person the best rate, and lower his rate but not the best rate, based on race, that is not an increase based on race. That is discrimination based on race.",
  "That's true, and it's a discrimination, but you didn't increase the rate. You decreased it.",
  "It's still a discrimination, it's still unlawful.",
  "Let me look at the language. Go back to give me -- because in ordinary English, which I hope I speak, it is not an increase, but maybe there is a technical term in the technical language of commercial law or in FTC law where the word increase means decrease. And if you -- is there anything you want -- no. It's a serious question, at least if you want to cite me to some authority that uses this word increase in the way you just suggested.",
  "Which dictionary shall I look at?",
  "By that you're talking linguistically, but I am interested in the purpose. So I looked up on the Internet approximately what percent of the people have the best credit score and that's about 1 percent. So 99 percent of the public doesn't have the best possible credit score. Now I take it that means that you could in fact, if it's even roughly right, have 99 percent or a little less or even perhaps a little more when they look at that report that, since it's not perfect in 99 percent of the cases, it's quite possible that they won't get the best conceivable rate which might be reserved for just perfect people. And if that's so, in 99 percent of the cases they'll send out notices. And that's why I asked my question about the boy who calls wolf. What will happen if 99 percent of the people who apply for insurance or any other thing get notices? I suspect that this is only intuitive, that the notices are more likely to go into the wastebasket than they are if there was really a decrease. Now, do you have any light you can shed on that?",
  "If the question is one of the evidence was weak, why isn't that a harmless error question rather than a question of whether the jury can give it effect?",
  "The likelihood of?",
  "Well, constitutional error is - -",
  "Yes.",
  "All right. So if the evidence is very weak and if the instructions prevent you from considering it, then it's precluded. But if the evidence is very weak it didn't matter.",
  "So imagine you're a juror and you think to yourself, I see all this stuff about the childhood, frankly it doesn't move me so far as his dangerousness, I think he's dangerous, and I also think he did it deliberately. And then you think to yourself, well, could I consider it because it shows a bad childhood and that is deserving of a life term? I'm not sure it shows me that, but can I consider it for that purpose at all? What's my answer under Texas law?",
  "No, no. I have gotten - - I've finished considering it for future dangerousness. No, it doesn't move me; he's dangerous. Now I say to myself, can I consider it for the purpose of showing a bad childhood deserving of mercy, if you like? Can I consider it for that purpose? What's the answer under State law?",
  "The answer is no.",
  "The answer is yes?",
  "I'm not talking about future dangerousness. I'm talking about -- I would be repeating myself. You've taken that, I'm not talking about future dangerousness. The jury's decided that matter in your favor. I'm saying does Texas law allow -- you understood what I said, didn't you?",
  "All right, and the answer is yes, you can take it in to show mercy?",
  "What you're going to hear in a second, I'm sure, because I read it in the briefs, my understanding of the Texas point is slightly different. It is this. That under Texas law, when you file before the, before the trial, a general objection, unless you make the objection again when the specific, when a specific instruction is given, you've forfeited your rights to appeal. Under Texas law. And they say that's true of evidence and that's true here, too. And they say that's just Texas law, ordinary Texas law. Now - -",
  "That's what you did, you didn't make the right objection. Now you come up here and well, you are out. You can't make any argument. But -- we are very generous, and we will let even people who make every wrong procedural thing still have a shot, if what they have, if what they are pointing to absolutely egregious. But your isn't absolutely egregious so you're in the same boat as if you just didn't have any argument because you didn't follow the Texas law. Now, I take it, that's their point. What's your response?",
  "Oh, you're there in a Texas court. We're not. We are following Texas law, they say, and you're wrong. Now, what are we supposed to do about that?",
  "Why, why, why do you say there are a lot of cases where it doesn't matter? I would have thought every case it mattered. Look, isn't it an absolute rule that there's a Federal issue in a case and there's a State ground, the State ground typically is a failure to raise an objection, and a State court says the Federal ground is what we're talking about. They say nothing about the State ground and they decide the Federal ground. The defendant goes to a Federal court and he says, I'm entitled to be released because they got the Federal ground wrong. I thought it's a hundred percent the case, and this is where you'll correct me, that it's now too late for the State to raise the State ground but the State's waived their adequate and independent State ground and that if they try to raise it again the answer is always, not some of the time: I'm very sorry, State; you're out of luck; you should have decided it on the State ground and not reached the Federal ground.",
  "Why wouldn't that be the case? Suppose the - -",
  "Suppose the State - -",
  "It's a question of waiver, part of it. I mean, that's -- it's well established that, I guess, I mean, if a State waives an adequate State ground by considering the Federal issue, the Federal courts will go into the Federal ground and they can't later, can they -- is there any case you found anywhere -- I haven't found one - - where say any Federal court considered a State case where the State went into the Federal issue, the State had said nothing about a State ground, and then after the Federal court's decided it somehow the State got a hold of it again and they this time said, oh dear, we forgot, we forgot; in fact, there is the State ground here. And is there any case that you found like that which says that was permissible?",
  "Okay, there's no such case and therefore this would be the first.",
  "Right.",
  "No, no, no. I'm saying the State typically decides against the defendant. They decide against the defendant on a Federal issue. There's a perfectly adequate State issue. It's called failure to object, and they don't mention it. I'd be repeating myself. Are you following what my, my -- and I'm saying is there any case you found anywhere which says after that occurred that the State when it gets a hold of the case again can say, oh dear, we forgot, there's also this adequate State ground, bad luck? I've never seen such a thing. I doubt that you have.",
  "And I say this would be the first.",
  "I'm making a mistake here. I thought that the reason they bring in the Almanza standard is, as I put it before, a kind of act of charity. That is, since there was no contemporaneous objection or proper one, you don't get any appeal normally. But we'll let you do it if you can show egregious harm. I'm wrong about that?",
  "Speaking of that case, can you give me any citation? And just give me a citation, and here there may not be one, but you give me a citation where Texas previously said that a defendant who raised an objection before trial to the application of the statute to his client, he said it's unconstitutional as applied to my client, give me one example in Texas law where that was raised and the State appeals court of any -- at any level said, I'm very sorry, you can't really appeal that because you should have said it again during the trial.",
  "In other words, there's no case, there's no case in Texas law which says what I just said?",
  "You can't say.",
  "I thought it was because he didn't raise it again in the trial.",
  "What is the argument?",
  "In, in this case suppose the following circumstance. Suppose a Federal court has decided in the case of this defendant - -",
  "-- there was an error of Federal constitutional law, search and seizure or confessions or something, and now we send it back. And let's suppose further the State has no independent State ground, they are not trying to make the argument, whether or not they're trying to make it here. There's no independent State ground, no objection to problem, nothing. Now, I read that one standard that could be applied is the structural error standard. A second is a harmless error standard. But I've never seen a case, but that's perhaps my ignorance -- -that's whey want you to show me -- where it's definitively established by a Federal court anyway that there was a serious Federal error, I've never seen a case where this Court said, or I can't recall one, that the State applied yet some third kind of standard, such as, well, I know there was a very important error, I know it was Federal and constitutional, but nonetheless we're not going to give them any remedy unless it's absolutely egregious harm. I've never seen that in the law. Now, can you point to me in the law where, which will correct my lacuna?",
  "Have you ever seen it in a State? Have you ever seen a State which gets a case back from - -",
  "Where? Where should I look on that?",
  "No, no. I'm not talking about that because obviously they can do what they want, I think, in the State courts, but they might violate Federal law if they do it. And now so what's happened is somebody has gone into Federal court or this Court and Federal court or this Court has said: Here's a Federal error, of course you're free to apply harmless error or whatever, you don't have to let the person have a new trial or let him out. But I've never seen an instance I can think of where, that having happened, the State then applied yet some third standard like absolutely egregious horrible harm or not totally wonderful harm or something like that. I've never seen. That's what I'm looking for. Is there such an instance?",
  "Yes, that's possible.",
  "I guess the reason would be that there is a problem with enforcing Federal constitutional standards. I have not heard of a State that says, suppose the jury was chosen in a racially discriminatory way, suppose there are all kinds of things, the State says, well, we admit, we admit that there is this violation, but we're just not going to apply a harmless error standard. We're going to apply a tough one. I guess that would be the reason. That's why I don't think I've ever seen it.",
  "Where does that come from as a matter of law? That is, suppose -- now you can say I -- if you want, say my hypothesis is wrong, but if I start with an assumption that Congress did want the court of appeals to try to create greater uniformity in sentencing, and it wanted cooperation between the courts of appeals and the sentencing commission, indeed the sentencing commission itself is an effort to copy a system that exists in Britain where courts of appeals create a degree of uniformity. Suppose I start with that assumption and say that's what the guidelines were about and the reason that number 4 is in 3553, it's not just one factor among many. After all, it was attached to a bill that was the guideline bill. And indeed, the part we excised was a floor amendment that came along later to make it even tougher. So if I start with the assumption that's what Congress wanted, not what I wanted, Congress wanted it, now is there something in the Constitution that forbids it? That's where I start -- I am starting personally with that question in mind, always, if this is what Congress wanted, we should try to do it unless there's something in the Constitution that forbids it. And is there something in the Constitution that would forbid the court of appeals to do what on page 91 they did here, leaving the word extraordinary out of it? Now, just going through the different elements of this case and coming to the conclusion that what the district judge did was unreasonable?",
  "It's not mandatory. It says the district, the court of appeals judge says, now, let's think here. We have 8 -- 7 people on the sentencing commission that have really looked into that. And they think that in an ordinary course with this small amount of drugs, the person ought to get so many months. That reflects a lot of thought. Seems reasonable to us. And here the district judge is giving him half that or 40 percent of that without a good reason that we can find. The judge said he did it because it was just one little episode and we think there were many episodes. And that's basically their reason. Now, now -- what -- the Sixth Amendment forbids that?",
  "Yeah - -",
  "Yeah, yeah. But there - - you know, we can go back into that, but there was a whole history that people testified, tremendously, no opposition, virtually none, that you needed a judge wheel. Why do you need a judge wheel in New York if, in fact, the sentence didn't depend on the personality of the judge? And why did you get different sentences across the country which I don't -- I've never heard a possibility of explaining that the judges didn't understand what the parole commission was like. That's a different issue. So what -- what I'm concerned about is if we followed your position literally, what we're saying is that the Constitution of the United States prevents any effort to create uniform sentences throughout the country for people who different judges -- God doesn't tell us what the right sentence is. We don't know. There are reasonable sentences within a vast, vast range of possible sentences. And you're saying we have to go back to that. And that wasn't -- I'm looking, in other words, for you to tell me something that says we don't have to be back to that, but we don't have to make it that rigid either. And that's what I'm looking for, to be honest with you, and I haven't -- I'm not certain I get it.",
  "Do you agree? Because I think that system would, in fact, give total sentencing power to the prosecutor, who would determine the sentence by the kind and degree of evidence that he introduced and what he charged. So I agree that that might produce some kind of judicial uniformity, but only because the prosecutor would have total power to decide what the sentence will be.",
  "We're pointing out there are problems to every solution. And that's why I'm still looking for the - -",
  "What do you think about taking some of the Rivera ideas -- I'm slightly hypothesizing this -- and following up with what Justice Stevens said. You'd say look, one thing a district judge can't say, he can't say that I believe the guideline is right for a typical case. And I think this is a typical case. And I won't follow the guideline. You couldn't think those three things?",
  "So one big power a judge has that they didn't have before, after Booker, is to say the guideline itself is unreasonable. So we're - - let's just say -- and there if they say that, the district judge could decide whether or not, the court of appeals could decide is the guideline reasonable or not reasonable. But leave those cases aside. I imagine they'll be few and far between. Now we take one they assume is reasonable. And now unlike the past, the judge has to do three things. One, to give the kind of thing that -- the reason he's not following the guideline, which he admits is reasonable for a typical case. So what's the kind of thing that leads you to think yours is not typical? And he says it. And then he has the evidence as to the related facts. And then he has the degree of departure. As to the first thing, the court of appeals could review it and decide whether it is or is not the kind of thing. As to the second and third, they also could review it but only after giving considerable weight to what the district judge thinks about the case in front of him. Now maybe that's -- I mean, you might not have a reaction to that. I'd have to sort of think about it.",
  "Not quite - -",
  "That's the other thing I'm not certain about, the proportionality, and the reason I'm not certain of it is I'm not certain what it means. That is, it sounds nice, as if you're saying something, but proportional to what? I mean, I can think of two problems. One problem, of course, is that the chart in the guidelines is written on a logarithmic scale and that means that if you move from one level, from 9 to 10, it's 3 months or 2 months; if you move from 29 to 30, it's 2 years. Now, whether you're at 29-30 or whether you're at 9 and 10 might depend upon things that just have nothing to do with your reason for departure. You might have added on something for having a gun and your reason for being lenient might have to do with the person's having a gun. So you're going to say it make a difference whether you were high up or whether you were low down, when your reason for departing has nothing to do with whether you're high up or whether you were low down? You see? It doesn't actually work, I don't think, proportionality review, because it's so hard to say what's proportional.",
  "Well, why use the word \"proportional,\" because the other thing is what the Chief Justice brought out, is that why is it that if a person has a bad reason, I mean, why should a bad reason justify a little departure rather than a lot? And if he has a good reason, well, why doesn't it justify a lot just as much as it might justify a little?",
  "That's the part, they said that. An extraordinary reduction must be supported by extraordinary circumstances. What worries me about that it sounds like a slogan. I would think an extraordinary reduction must be supported by whatever reasons that justify the extraordinary reduction, period. And it also sounds like you're going to start getting a mechanical set of charts and things, which is going to be a true nightmare, and if we really were to repeat that it would take on a tremendous force of generative law which would worry me quite a lot because I just think it's too complex to reduce to a formula. What you want is a reason that supports the sentence. It is - -",
  "Better than what? Better than justifies it?",
  "Well, you know, you don't get a summary judgment case all the time. I used to get them, and the district court would hear all the arguments and write down the word denied. Does that mean he didn't consider the arguments? That's a very common thing. Here we have a district judge, he hears all the arguments. The attorneys brought it out. It's in the file. He reads the presentence report. It's all there, and the judge says, on balance, I'm going to go apply the guidelines. So how can you say he didn't consider them?",
  "No, he doesn't in a summary judgment case either. I mean, I've had quite a few of them, I used to, I think, where they just wrote denied. That was the opinion.",
  "Now, he says the reasons are these. I think that the guidelines sentence is a reasonable sentence. Would that be sufficient?",
  "Why not? What in the statute or the law or the Constitution says that a district judge, although it might be good form in a difficult case to write more, but I've often written opinions where I say, and the remaining arguments we feel are not sufficient to change the result. That means I don't think they're that great an argument, and I don't answer every single one.",
  "Where in the law does it say that?",
  "So it isn't sufficient, in your view, that the judge just says, the reason I imposed this sentence is that's the guideline sentence, and I think in this circumstance it's reasonable?",
  "I think these other factors that have been brought out, while they're serious factors, I don't think they're enough to warrant a different sentence. Suppose he adds those words?",
  "What I'm worried about basically is, I don't think in the law there's a special category that requires a judge to give special reasons in a guideline case. I think it's the same as any other matter. Judges do normally give reasons. And I'd worry a bit about creating a special situation where district judges have to do something unusual.",
  "Well, I get where you're going. Can I say this in an opinion, would this satisfy you? And of course, like any other matter, judges do normally give reasons. They do normally reject arguments with reasons, and it's the same here. Would that satisfy you?",
  "Then the question ultimately is, does it violate the Sixth Amendment to say that we have a presumption there, a sentence is in the guidelines as a reasonable -- if you're an appellate court judge. And you think it does violate the Sixth Amendment?",
  "Then I guess the argument of the other side, which I would like you to address, is that, in which there -- we didn't think it violated the of Sixth Amendment if the district judge simple applied 3553 -- uh, 3553(a). And of course, 3553(a) includes all of these things that go into the guidelines; it make a big point of that in 3553(a). So why -- why couldn't you say, you know, all these factors are taken into account by the commission? They start with an effort to a apply them in typical cases. This is their judgment in typical cases. So it is entitled to some kind of weight; and - - at least in a typical case.",
  "No, no, not consulting them. What I'm trying to do is to how much weight can a judge reading this give them without violating the Sixth Amendment? All I'm trying to do here is not whether the guidelines are good, bad, or indifferent. Congress wanted to apply them. We excised the mandatory to comply with the Sixth Amendment. Now, what else do we have to do to comply with the Sixth Amendment? Because I would think unless we have to do something else, we shouldn't do it, because Congress wanted it.",
  "There are two separate things there. The general aims of sentencing, the four basic aims of sentencing, I believe the commission certainly took into account. A separate thing was the rule that said you can depart only for a matter that has not been fully considered by the guidelines. And there the original version, I believe, said that we've considered nothing thoroughly. Except for certain specific matters that had been mentioned like age, race, and we'll refer to statutorily. Now, that is what you're thinking of? I mean, if that's what you're thinking of, I don't think it's relevant to what your present point is.",
  "That's because when they looked at all of the literature, they explained it, the rehabilitative purpose was not that it wasn't taken into account, it was there was a consensus among experts that there isn't much you can do about it. That's different from not taking into account.",
  "Are we back to the original version, which I'll read what it says. It says: \"With a few specific exceptions -- race, sex, national origin, creed, religion, socioeconomic State -- with those exceptions, the commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual case.\" That's what it said. A part of the guidelines in the heartland. If it's not the heartland, depart. Now, what I wonder is are we not back under your theory of it just to where we were when it started out, before the commission started ruling all these things out and began to make all its -- the judge could do that.",
  "We said we took nothing into account and therefore any circumstance that makes the case unusual would be in principle a ground for an exception.",
  "You're saying more than that is necessary.",
  "He could do this: He could set aside the guideline on the theory that the guideline itself is unreasonable, that is it doesn't properly take account of sentencing. But suppose he doesn't do that. Then, if you take your view that there's a presumption in its favor and if it is the normal case, not an unusual case in any respect, how can he not apply the guideline?",
  "I know, but Booker says what we're trying to do is to come close to what Congress wanted but not violate the Sixth Amendment. Now, what I think we're talking about now - - I think -- i mean, you sort of shed some -- you clarified something very well for me, which is that in this case we're talking about the situation where the district judge applies the guidelines sentence, and then what's the attitude of the court on appeal, and the attitude is going to be, well, the Sentencing Commission thinks it's okay, the judge thinks it's okay, okay, you have to -- you better show me a good reason to think to the contrary. Fine. But the interesting problem is the problem of the next case which you're now talking about, is, well, what happens if the district judge and when should be the district judge and how free should the district judge feel he is to depart from the guidelines sentence even if it's not an unusual case.",
  "It's not that complicated. All that happens is the court of appeals says, look, in the case of bank robberies we've discovered about 33 percent of the defendants in the typical case have been in the Army. And therefore, we think that just ordinary armed services is not a reason, ordinary armed - - services in the military is not a reason for a diminished sentence. That's all, period. Or they can say it the other way, the absence of a military service is a reason for having the higher sentence, put it any way you want. And by the way, district judge, if you disagree with that, we're going to reverse you because we think it's unreasonable. Okay. What about that?",
  "It did. But is there anything in the Sixth Amendment that forbids that?",
  "Well, what do you think? Because I would think that if you're going to answer that question yes, you are saying that not even the court of appeals can try to assure a degree of fairness among different defendants in respect to sentencing.",
  "It's not sub-legal rules. What it's called is precedent. What you do is you decide a case and you decide this is unfair, and then the thing that as a similar case comes along, is you decide it the same way. And if a district judge doesn't follow that, you reverse it.",
  "Exactly. You've simply substituted stare decisis and the necessity of the district court following circuit law for the guidelines. And - -",
  "If the guidelines are unconstitutional because they make facts automatically determinative, I assume that would be unconstitutional because it makes facts automatically determinative.",
  "Well then, in other words, the Constitution of the United States prevents the courts themselves from trying to assure that sentences who are -- that individuals who are in similar positions, commit similar crimes, will be treated in similar ways. That to me is possible, but of course I've been in dissent in these cases. But it seems to me - -",
  "We're back - -",
  "Copyright. Copyright. You normally copyright.",
  "I take it that we are operating under the assumption that software is patentable? We have never held that in this Court, have we?",
  "So what should we do here? Should, if we are writing this, since it's never been held that it's patentable in this Court - -",
  "If I were writing something, should I say on the assumption that it's patentable? Since the issue isn't raised?",
  "Suppose I send someone to the Patent Office - -",
  "Suppose I send someone to the Patent Office, goes there, picks up the patent, and this patent is written very, very, very concretely and specifically. Gets on the phone, phones somebody in Germany and reads it to him. And that person, having an excellent memory, takes everything in and now he has the precise instruction necessary to change the machine around or put various things into it. So now it is a precise copy of the machine in the United States.",
  "Is that -- how is that different from this? How is it different?",
  "No, no. We have a genius -- we have, as they used to have to get all the stuff that we stole from England, with the -- with the - - remember the weaving machines and the cotton spinners and so forth? This genius comes over here; he looks at a really complex machine; it is now stored in his head, the precise details that nobody else could do. He runs back to Germany, and he builds it. Well, he has absolutely stolen the precise, incredibly complex details of this machine.",
  "Now, does it matter, if instead of sending the individual, we send the machine to Germany. This genius looks at it in Germany and there he makes the copy. Are they any different?",
  "How would you, how would you -- go back for a second, please, because, if you're finished with that, because I don't see how to decide for you without at the same time permitting a person to walk over to the Patent Office, to read that application and the description, which after all at least can be a very highly detailed set of instructions of how to make a machine, getting on the phone, explaining that just like the blueprint which it is just like to somebody in Europe. They then make it. And that on your reading would violate the statute. It can't be right that that would and you don't even think it would.",
  "But is there any precedent for that sort of thing? That is, I understand your point now, I think, but however you put it, it has to come down to the fact that this very, very complex and detailed thing that is being supplied is an abstract set of numbers. And I can understand how the patent application does not itself contain that set of numbers, but rather contains an instruction as to how to generate that set of numbers. But I then would be quite frightened of deciding for you and discovering that all over the world there are vast numbers of inventions that really can be thought of in the same way that you're thinking of this one, and suddenly all kinds of transmissions of information themselves and alone become components. So I'm asking you, is there any outside the computer field analogous instance where the transmission of information has itself been viewed as the transmission of a component?",
  "Well, sure, there is. It's a bigger - -",
  "But it's totally different in that of course it violates the patent in the United States. The whole question here is whether or not the person has to go get a patent in Germany, which he can do or not do. And the -- the concern that I'm worried about is in the future it might be outside your field, it might be in biology, but if you suddenly say that the transmission purely of information is the transmission of a component, no matter how detailed, I can easily see in biology or medicine where a patent has an instruction and indeed, that instruction is an instruction to create other detailed procedures, processes, dishes, Petri dishes, I don't know what it is, and we transmit that detailed information abroad. Then suddenly it's our patent law and not the foreign patent law that would govern. That's why I asked for precedent.",
  "His answer to me is that - - that -- it's sort of misleading to think of this as if it's just information, because it's really a method that switches things at a level of detail that is impossible to put in a patent application. It's taking the information in a patent application, it's transforming it into what we think of as 1's and 0's, but they're not really even 1's and 0's. What they are is things that happen with electricity.",
  "And it's putting that on the disk and then it makes other things happen.",
  "It's putting something physical on a disk, pits and lands, instructions that are copied from the master disk and then put into either a hard drive or a disk, it's the same thing. It's something that is into the computer that will make the computer operate. You're right, Justice Ginsburg, that the court of appeals for the Federal Circuit thought it was bringing this statute up to date and it even said so. We are making an extension of the statute to keep up to date with the technology. That is not for courts to do. This Court is - -",
  "So they had a license to do that, because if they didn't have a license to make the master disk here in the United States, the making of it would have violated the patent; is that right?",
  "Why isn't the obvious difference -- I may have missed this -- but you say, in the case, a taxpayer owed some money and the Government via a lien took property from a different person who then had to pay the tax who then had to get rid of the lien and wanted it back. And in this case they did exactly the same thing but they did it via a levy. So you say if the first could sue so could the second. But the difference, the obvious difference, which maybe you have explained and I missed, is that in the second case, namely this case, there is a specific statute that says you have to do it with a levy in nine months, and in the other case there wasn't such a statute. Why isn't that the obvious difference?",
  "Encompasses a lien for a refund action in the case where you took the property via a lien. And you'd say -- they say, I guess, but it doesn't encompass it when you take it via a levy. Why not? Because of the specific, the same thing I just said. Now I want to be sure I have your whole answer to that.",
  "If your interpretation is correct then are there many such cases where the Government takes property via a levy and the person who wants to sue would get worried about nine months, because obviously he would think I can sue under a - - kind of thing. It's two years. So are there still some where he would have to worry about nine months?",
  "In other words, are -- in your interpretation, does the nine-month statute become meaningless?",
  "The -- the, the statute that you point to talks about taking a civil action against the United States. When there has been a wrongful levy, is that right?",
  "It doesn't say an injunctive action. So I would reading it think it encompasses both actions for injunctions, which are rare, probably, and what I think is not rare at all, an action for damages or money back. Now your reading of the statute takes that whole ordinary case, where people are just suing to get back some money, and it says our nine-month statute of limitations here is meaningless. All it applies to are injunctive actions which I bet are far and few between. You can tell me I'm wrong on that.",
  "I won't say you've made it meaningless but you have eviscerated it. Is that fair?",
  "I mean, is my characterization fair?",
  "You want to say no to that.",
  "Why would it have? Because there I think we are talking about liens and it doesn't cover liens, the specifics statute.",
  "It looks like it's the same in the Kreider case. I can't tell, I don't know. But this case was a specific statute of limitations acted after the general refund statute, right?",
  "And in the prior case it seems to be a specific statute that was enacted in 1926. I just got it out of the library. They give it to us, you know, if you ask them.",
  "And it was the 1926 code and it concerned 1926 income, so it must have been brought, the suit, fairly close to when that was enacted. And the general provision was a general judicial code provision having to do with general statute of limitations and, no, it doesn't say. It looks -- I mean, it sounds as if that had been long in existence.",
  "I'm not sure why you concede that. I mean, I looked at the case and it seemed to me it's a case involving the whole ball of wax. And I suspect my reaction to that tape was in part affected by the fact that he went through the shopping center, came out and crashed into a police car, which is what Scott saw.",
  "So how do I know whether, which of these things is directly or not indirectly - - well, you go ahead. But I mean, are you -- am I not supposed to look at the part which involves the shopping center?",
  "Why are these absolute? I mean I looked at Garner and then I looked at Graham and Graham which came later said that all claims that officers have used excessive force, deadly or not, should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment and its reasonableness standard. So I guess-- isn't that right, isn't that the law?",
  "All right, if that's the law, then whether -- of course an automobile could, could kill people. Of course it can. So can a lot of things. But an automobile isn't a gun, and a chase on the highway is not a chase through a back yard, though both could end up with the person being chased dead. So aren't we supposed to look at all the circumstances, including the circumstance of what -- one that interests me, one, is that the right standard? Two, did Scott know that the reason he was chasing this person was because he had violated a speed limit, or was he ignorant of the reason why the individual was racing away at 90 miles an hour, which is as far as the record could show?",
  "And a reasonable juror could not conclude to the contrary?",
  "Why, why wouldn't it matter? I mean, other things being equal, suppose that he known that all that happens, suppose he was two miles beyond the speed limit. And Scott knew the whole thing or Scott was the one who did it, and he says maybe he is a young kid who is frightened and he has his license number and he could get him later. I mean, why wouldn't it be nutty to -- to try to bump somebody off the road, when all, that's all that's at stake?",
  "Did Scott, know that? Did Scott -- Do you have evidence to show that Scott knew that the underlying offense was a speeding violation?",
  "And Scott has testified he didn't know it.",
  "Now, do you think you can get to the jury on the question of whether he knew it.",
  "I'd like a yes or no answer.",
  "That doesn't sound like yes or no.",
  "The question is, can you get to the jury on the question of whether Scott knew that the underlying offense was for speeding?",
  "All right. If Scott didn't know it, I mean, my goodness, then I don't see the relevance of whether it was speeding or not. And I was with you when I read the -- the opinion of the court below. And I read the other brief. I was on the other side. Then I've been shifting back and forth. Then I look at that tape, and I have to say that when I looked at the tape, my reaction was somewhat similar to Justice Alito's. And so if it's doubtful and then you can't even show that the person who did it knew that this was for speeding rather than for murder, how can you get to the jury?",
  "That's exactly where I started. And I wondered -- that's what I'm uncertain about the standard for this. Because as you and the others have been arguing, if the question is one about rules surrounding the use of deadly force. But then when I read what I read out to you, in Graham, it seemed to me that Graham, which comes after Garner, says that's not the standard. Graham is a standard of simple reasonableness and Garner is simply an illustration of that as applied to guns and a backyard chase, not as applied to cars which threaten other people much more.",
  "Well, what is the standard? Am I supposed to apply -- am I not supposed to apply Graham?",
  "So you're saying I cannot do the following under the law, which would seem to be contrary to common sense, to say there is a big difference between a policeman shooting a person who is running away and threatens no harm to others, and a policeman using a gun -- using a car on a highway to try to get a person to stop who is threatening others. I have to treat those exactly as if they were the same thing.",
  "I don't see how -- I mean, you know, given our prior discussion here, I don't see how that's the issue. Because you say we have to assume that the Defendant here didn't know that, in fact, all that was at issue was a violation of the traffic law.",
  "That conduct -- it could be conduct -- you could say exactly your same question, just as the Chief just said. I mean, I don't know how to get around this. You could say the question was, does a person who reasonably thinks he might be being pursued for a murder - -",
  "What am I -- you said factually. What am I supposed to assume? You said in light of -- I mean, I looked at the tape and that tape shows he is weaving on both sides of the lane, swerving around automobiles that are coming in the opposite direction with their lights on, goes through a red light where there are several cars that are right there, weaves around them, and there are cars coming the other way, weaves back, goes down the road. Now, what in fact -- am I supposed to pretend I haven't seen that? What am I supposed to pretend to here?",
  "You didn't see that?",
  "You didn't -- I thought that -- you didn't see that?",
  "No, no. I -- what I saw is he is driving down one lane, what I mean by weaving, and this lane goes with me in traffic. And there is some cars in front of him, so he goes in the other lane where the cars are now coming right directly at him. And then before they hit him, he goes back to the first lane and he does this while going through a red light, it seemed to me. Am I -- did I mis-see that? I'll go look at it again if you - -",
  "Yeah.",
  "Well that's, that's what I wonder. If the court says that isn't what happened, and I see with my eyes that is what happened, what am I supposed to do?",
  "What am I supposed to do? I mean, I'll look again at the tape. I certainly will do that. But suppose I look at the tape and I end up with Chico Marx's old question with respect to the Court of Appeals: Who do you believe, me or your own eyes?",
  "What is this to do -- I mean, I'm -- I'm puzzled about why we're talking about this complicated thing. I mean why -- the statute as I read it has a section and it's called procedural, procedural rights.",
  "And it says that the procedural rights, right at the beginning, are for both the children and the parents. And it sets up some procedures in the agency which is for the children and the parents and school board, and everybody is supposed to be there. And then another part of the same section says any person aggrieved by the first has a court hearing. Why isn't that the end of it? It's clearly aimed, as the statute is aimed, at both students and parents. And then we give them all procedural rights, and what in the statute says that the procedures that they're following before the school board happen to be for both parents and students. But without saying a word, a different procedure, a Federal court procedure in the same section, without saying anything, would be just for the students and not for the parents? I mean, I find that hard to read the statute that way.",
  "No, I'm not. I'm talking about the whole Act. Throughout the whole Act, they talk about parents and students.",
  "And who writes the check? The student?",
  "No. Of course. The parent writes the check. And has the interest? I have an interest in educating my children as you do in yours. And this statute talks about that throughout.",
  "So I'm looking at the particular words in the procedural section, and the particular words explicitly say that every subsection is both for parent, through child; and then we get to the Court one and it talks about person aggrieved. And you, I guess, have to convince me - - which as I'm putting it, sounds like an uphill battle - -",
  "But you have - -",
  "You have to convince me that person aggrieved at the at the end of this section is meant to apply to only some of the people whom every other section talks about, namely just children, not parents. Now why should I read that it way?",
  "Your argument, I guess, is this argument. Now you're conceding the parent does have a right to go to court, but he can only complain about something that hurts him. Right?",
  "He can't complain in court or -- well, it sounds as if you were saying that. You're saying that the hearing officer has to decide against the parent and if he doesn't decide against the parent, obviously the parent can't go into court because he doesn't have anything to complain about, the parent. Isn't that your point?",
  "Oh, well -- right. I'm sorry. Then you go ahead. I thought I heard you say that the problem is that the parent didn't have a right taken away by the hearing officer, and that's why the parent can't go to court.",
  "Oh, I would agree, we can be on the same grounds there.",
  "I agree that if the parent isn't hurt, if the parent wasn't deprived of anything, the parents can go to court but doesn't have anything to complain about, you know, whereas another section of the statute says that reimbursement is something supposed to be reimbursement for the parent, so it would seem as if the panther has something to complain about. Isn't that so? It says the -- I think so -- it says a parent is to be reimbursed. I thought that was one of the things that - -",
  "So, now it looks as if the parent has something to complain about. The parent hasn't got the money that he was supposed to get. Now we have something to complain about, so therefore, we're aggrieved, and then the last section says an aggrieved person can go to court.",
  "So I take it your argument is, your red brief argument is that Congress said, states, if you get some judgments against you and they award attorneys' fees, you pay for it, we won't? Is that what it said?",
  "You don't pay for it, you can't pay for it out of the grant?",
  "Okay. So we're not paying for this, you pay for it. Is that right?",
  "States - -",
  "-- if some people bring claims against you under this because you didn't have a good plan for the child and your attorneys' fees are awarded against you, don't pay for it out of this grant. Isn't that what you're saying it says?",
  "I thought what your argument was -- and if it's not, forget it, it's just that I don't understand it. That here the Government says pay for this out of your own pocket, and then its defines what you're supposed to pay out of our own pocket is, as a parent representing a child, not his own action. And then later on they say, they define it differently. They talk about prevailing party. The parents of the prevailing party. But you say that second phrase must mean the first phrase. Because it wouldn't make sense for the Government to say pay for that out of the grant but not this out of the grant. That's your argument?",
  "Okay. It is an argument.",
  "I don't understand. I'm back -- I really -- I'm surprised. And it's probably my fault. But that I thought -- I started where Justice Scalia was with his first question. I thought this had something to do with whether Congress passed a statute or the President acted on his own. But listening to you now I think, I can't decide -- I think you have a different argument. Suppose -- I'm just trying to understand. Suppose that Congress passes a law and it says it's a very nice thing to commemorate the Pilgrims by building a Government church at Plymouth Rock, where we will have the regular worship in the Puritan religion. Now can a taxpayer from California in your view challenge that?",
  "Yes, but - -",
  "Why not? Because I thought Flast made clear that they could.",
  "Then you go to a private group?",
  "So you're saying that if the Government has the most amazing, let's -- I'm trying to think of something more amazing that what I just thought of.",
  "All over America, they build churches dedicated to one religion; and Congress passes a statute and says in every city, town, and hamlet, we are going to have a minister, a Government minister, a Government church, and dedicated to the proposition that this particular sect is the true sect; and they pass a statute like that, nobody could challenge it?",
  "Is that what you're saying, then?",
  "I don't know, I mean - -",
  "-- everybody else who doesn't want to go just avoids it. So that they don't have to do anything. They just have to - -",
  "Who? Who?",
  "Maybe they don't walk into it because it is not \"our church.\" So they don't walk into it.",
  "And moreover, they don't - - they don't feel it's discriminatory. It's just we're doing this to commemorate the Pilgrims, and we'll give the money to any group that's a Pilgrim.",
  "So what's wrong with just saying that Flast stands for the proposition that when the Government spends money in violation of the establishment clause, a taxpayer -- after all, the money comes from the taxpayer -- can bring a lawsuit? And the reason that they do that is because the establishment clause is an important joint part of the religion clauses; and there'd be no other way to bring such a challenge. And sometimes it's that simple principle, and when we depart from that principle, say by giving property away instead of giving money away, you don't have the standing. So we have a pretty clear, simple rule. That rule applies whether it's Congress or the President acting under congressional authority, et cetera, which I think is close to what the other side - -",
  "Because there is a real case or controversy, because people become terribly upset when they see some other religion getting the money from the State for the -- for building a church, for example, and that's why: There's a real controversy.",
  "It is the kind of upset that is a genuine injury if you look to the objectives of the establishment clause and possibly that kind of genuine injury is not the case when you look to objectives of various other clauses of the Constitution.",
  "That's what I was saying. I said that Flast then encapsulates that principle drawn out of the objectives of the establishment clause in a rule; and the rule is what I suggested.",
  "Based on money.",
  "So in fact, you have - - just help me with one point here. I mean, I see that deciding what's incidental and what isn't incidental will be difficult. I guess many of these cases would end up being decided on the merits, there is no violation on the merits, or maybe sometimes there is. But I'd started thinking of the question of standing by thinking that there are strong feelings when the Government spends money in favor of one religion and not another. After all, they led to the 30 Years War. We see that in other places in the world today. People feel strongly. And if, in fact, they have that terribly strong feeling and can't make any challenge because the feelings are shared by many, then there are no cases in the courts at all, and the Government can do what it wants without challenge. So in Flast, they carved out an exception, and the exception was where the taxing and spending clauses were involved, because Madison and others said this is aimed at \"Government shall not tax and spend\". So that was my theory. And all we're saying is where there's a big taxing and spending and it isn't incidental, there's standing. Now we're worried about the merits. Simple and clear. To which the response was, which has me a little worried frankly, was that, well, that was Justice Stewart's position, or roughly speaking. But the Court rejected that quite clearly, and if you look at later cases, they reject it too. And therefore, whatever you might think of it, it isn't the law. And I'm not free to think whatever, I have to think exactly in accordance with what the cases say. So what is your response? I'd like you to focus on that.",
  "So you're saying that what Justice Stewart's view, insofar as it was rejected, that Flast suggested even broader standing, but it suggested at least what Justice Stewart said?",
  "Is that right or not?",
  "But not neatly, I mean, in terms of the purposes of the thing. Are your clients claiming that it would violate the establishment clause for the President to go to lots and lots of prayer breakfasts?",
  "No. I never met anyone who did, but I guess there is a legitimate concern, somebody might think that, I guess. And I guess that if people -- there is some tendency of the people that are worried, you know, there are pro ses, there are all kinds of people, somebody could claim that. So you want a way to keep them out.",
  "It's Justice Kennedy's concern.",
  "But what they're worried about is will this word \"incidental\" and -- be sufficient to keep out the people who might somehow decide they want to claim, which sounds like a frivolous claim, that the President can't go to a prayer breakfast. Now does the word \"incidental\" do that? That's what I think - -",
  "I'm surprised you say piecemeal. I would have thought most agencies in the government have like an inspector general or someone that you can complain.",
  "You can write them a letter and you say, look at what's been going on, they've been trespassing, they've indicted me on a false charge; I want you to see the whole list here and I'd like you to do something about it. And if they don't do anything about it, you go to your senator. Maybe you can go to the newspapers. I mean, has any of that happened here?",
  "And what's been the result of that?",
  "Well, why is it a State law matter? Why didn't he know about this possibility? Why didn't he know that his predecessor in title had granted? Why wasn't there an actual notice, given the fact that everybody in this area of the country seems as a matter of course to give mutually beneficial rights-of-way? I agree it wasn't recorded.",
  "If this case were identical, everything's the same, except that the officials involved are state officials, would there be a 1983 action?",
  "That's a different - - that's a different reason. That's a merits defense. I just wondered if - -",
  "Yeah. You're saying there is no Bivens action, period.",
  "No, I'm not even thinking of it. I just wonder if 1983 would apply and it would be clear that there is an action. If you win, there would be no problem.",
  "Who would have thought - - wait. When you say that, I mean, there's a lot of these acts, it seems, they are plainly illegal.",
  "Well, if they are plainly illegal, then there are remedies in the courts.",
  "All right. But what is actually worrying you, which probably you can address at some point, is this: There are remedies one by one. That's true. And each has one. And maybe you can even get injunctions against harassing.",
  "Well, maybe he didn't do it.",
  "And so it may be, they thought he did do it and - -",
  "All right.",
  "Did you bring a suit for malicious prosecution?",
  "All right. Now - -",
  "Maybe he should have won. What's worrying me throughout, if you want to know - -",
  "All right.",
  "What is worrying me throughout is, put this case to the side. If the Court recognizes what I take it has not happened in the past, that there is an action for private people to bring against the government, Bivens, under the Fifth Amendment, all of a sudden vast numbers of regulations, the coal pillars in Holmes case, everything south of that will be suddenly in Federal court as people claim that what's going on with this regulation is there are individuals in the government who have gone too far, and they are just trying to get my property and the use of it, without paying a fair price. Now by the way, sometimes people in government do go too far, so many of those claims might have some justification. But suddenly I see the possibility of this kind of action becoming a major roadblock, an obstacle sometimes used unjustifiably, and not necessarily, not necessary, this kind of thing, to impose a roadblock to totally legitimate government regulatory action.",
  "You see, part of what's worrying me is that once you get into the Fifth Amendment, which is -- prevents the government from taking property for a public use without just compensation, the possibility of the legal imagination becomes endless. Because every time a person walks across the doorstep, every time a person wants to install a pipe in the basement, read the meter -- I mean, I can see possibilities of actions of this kind arising, and particularly when the government wants to buy it and is pointing out all the reasons why it should be sold. Is there a threat lurking in that conversation? You see what I'm worried about here, which wasn't present in the other case?",
  "No. The reason would be probably that the, if you can make a comparison. The number of Government actions that affect criminal charges and so forth are tiny compared to the number of governmental actions that affect people's property. Virtually, I mean the number of Government actions affecting how people use their property, it's the whole series of law books. It fills the room. And suddenly to open up a new remedy in that kind of thing is what's frightening me, which is what I said already. So you don't have to answer.",
  "Retaliation, what is retaliation? Isn't retaliation statutory?",
  "Well, the two cases you cite, the first one is the person who was charged with extortion is a judge - -",
  "And he was extorted on the ground that he told the plaintiff to pay the defendant, so the money wasn't given to the government. So I don't see that that's a difference. And then the second case - -",
  "-- it may have been, but you say \"See Also,\" which is a sign to me there's something wrong with that case.",
  "I'm surprised that you didn't put it first if there wasn't. Page 49.",
  "Why did you say \"See Also\"?",
  "No, no. You can go to an agency and say, agency I want to do such and such, dah dah dah, here are my reasons. Agency says no. I want review.",
  "I don't know. You might have written to the Secretary of the Interior: Secretary, I want to you do such and such, please. No. Okay, review.",
  "And what happened?",
  "Well, why is that? Why? Why? I mean suppose you go on a school trip, and the teacher says on the school trip, I don't want people unfurling 15 foot banners. I don't care what they are about.",
  "We are going to visit the state capital and we are not marching down the street with 15 foot banners. I mean, does the First Amendment say the teacher can't say that?",
  "You just said suppose - - why should I not say that? I mean I'm not going to do it, necessarily. But why could I not say, would it be wrong in an opinion to say a school board can on a school trip tell the students they can't unfurl 15 foot banners? Is that a correct statement of the law or not? In your opinion.",
  "Well, why go into this? I mean, that's what I actually, seriously don't understand. Suppose the rule has the following rule: by the way, on our field trips you can carry around 15 foot banners. They can say anything. Except they can't talk about drugs and they can't talk about sex and they can't talk about -- I don't know. Or I'd say three things. Would that be constitutional?",
  "Suppose that this particular person had whispered to his next door neighbor, \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus, heh heh heh,\" you know. Supposed that's what had happened?",
  "No. What would be different -- that's what I -- what a principal that has to act quickly sees across the street at a school meeting, a big banner go up making a joke out of drug use. So the principal acts. Now, are we supposed to divide that into little bitsy parts? Because as soon as we do we are going to get a rather interesting, complicated and very difficult set of constitutional rules. But you want us to do that.",
  "Yes, but you rephrased it that way, but what actually happened is the principal looks across the street, a 15-foot banner goes up at what's supposed to be a school event with everybody together in a single place, and it says a joke, it makes a joke out of drug use. The principal thinks of course adolescents and post-adolescents sometimes like to test limits, and if the kids go around having 15-foot banners making a joke out of drug use that really does make it a little tougher for me to convince the students at this school not to use drugs, and particularly putting up 15-foot banners. I don't know why everybody wants to get away from that because I think you would have had a very different case if in fact it had been a whisper or if it had been a serious effort to contest the drug laws. It wasn't either. It was a joke. It was a 15-foot banner. We have the message plus the means plus the school event. Now, what's your response?",
  "That's an excellent response, I think.",
  "I conceive that interference consists of it's pretty hard to run a school where kids go around at public events publicly making a joke out of drugs. That's what his thought is. Now, I don't think he has to be able to read content discrimination, viewpoint discrimination, time-place. He doesn't know the law, the principal. His job is to run the school. And so I guess what I'm worried about is a rule that would -- is on your side, a rule that takes your side; we'll suddenly see people testing limits all over the place in the high schools. But a rule that against your side may really limit people's rights on free speech. That's what I'm struggling with. Now, I want some help there and I'm worried about the principal.",
  "But I mean, that's -- I have, I guess his note, you accept this with what the teacher said. The entire class went to view the relay. Individual students -- this is at 9:30 in the morning. They were not given the option of remaining in class, nor were they released to do as they pleased. They were to watch the relay with the rest of the student body, either just in front of the school or just across the street -- that's me, not them -- and then return directly to their classrooms, which I guess the school did. So it sounds like you're going to one place, stand together, behave yourselves, watch the relay, and the teachers will be there and take you back to class. Now is there something else in the record that suggests something different?",
  "Just tell me where to look. Where are the conflicting affidavits? I'm just reading from page 51 of the joint appendix. I didn't know there was a dispute.",
  "Okay, I'll look at those. Another somewhat minor point. Can I ask you another point about the record? I'll read those.",
  "No, they went across the street.",
  "Was there any -- there was no requirement, they didn't have to go across the street or stay on campus, they could wander off distantly.",
  "Okay.",
  "Can I ask you another record point, just so I know where to look?",
  "You've also asked for an injunction that would require expunging his 5-day suspension from his record.",
  "10 days. Well, 10 or 5, unclear. I noticed the superintendent of schools on page 66A when he's reviewing this, what he says is, \"Joseph contends that all his behavior is excusable because he was exercising his free of speech right. Even if I were to concede his speech across from the high school is protected, which I do not, the rest of his behavior warranted the suspension.\" And then he says, \"And I'm cutting it from 10 days to 5. So given that, if you win, suppose you were to win, and you - - that it is protected and so forth -- then would you concede or not concede the suspension, the 5 days, it's over, it still stands, I don't care about the expungement or not?",
  "No, but I'm asking that you think about it. I'm putting you on the spot.",
  "I want to know what the superintendent said. As I read it is, he says, look, I don't care if this was protected or not. I'll give you that. It's protected. But the rest of his behavior, the way he treated the principal, what he did, the reluctance, et cetera, et cetera, that warrants a suspension too, and I'm cutting it from 10 days to 5. So it sounds to me as I read it that the teacher is saying even if you're right, he's still suspended for 5 days. That's what the superintendent says. Now suppose you win your point that you're interested in winning, which you may not or you may. Are you still then going to pursue this case on the 5 days, that that should be erased?",
  "You couldn't what? I didn't hear the last part of what you said. You just got to the point of - -",
  "Yes. What's the answer?",
  "So you would not pursue it?",
  "Why does it matter? That is, why doesn't the -- you're suing the teacher or the principal and why wouldn't the issue be what that principal really reasonably thought the situation was? I mean, if a principal reasonably thought he was part of the school group, if the principal reasonably thought that this was a school outing, if the principal reasonably thought that students are staying together, why wouldn't that just be the ground on which you'd take the case, we should take it that way, because the principal reasonably thinks?",
  "But even on the merits?",
  "Even if the principal couldn't tell him to take down the manner even if she thought he was part of the school group reasonably, if he really wasn't?",
  "And I don't think the majority said the contrary. I mean, I wrote it. I mean, I don't know -- what counts is what I wrote, not what I thought. But if you read it, I don't think it decides this question. What I wonder, though, is why does the - - how does this case present the issue you want to argue? I'm -- Justice Ginsburg made me wonder about that. As I understand it, the trial court said, I'm not going to let this witness testify, it is cumulative. All right. And then the appeals court said, well, that wasn't a mistake. And one reason it wasn't a mistake is that this witness added nothing. There could no possible prejudice, says the trial court, when he excluded that person. That means it was cumulative, that means it did nothing, and that was the appeals court. So the appeals court finds no error. Now, we get over to the Federal court. And they say, oh, no, this witness added a lot. Well, they couldn't have thought this witness added a lot to the point where the constitution is violated unless they disagreed with that decision of making no possible difference. Very well. We disagree, send it back. End of case. Now, where does it raise all this stuff about harmless error and -- I mean, when I -- it is hard for me to get my mind around this issue, because it's so complicated. How does this case raise it?",
  "Was that as a reason for there not being error? Or was it in the context of saying, well, even if there was a mistake, there was no possible prejudice. What does the footnote mean, in your opinion? The second?",
  "What is the footnote number?",
  "Okay. I'll read it.",
  "Thank you. Very helpful. The other thing which I brought up, so I might as well get both my questions out, is that years ago I read a decision by Judge Leventhal that made a big impression on me. And he was a very good judge. It's in a different context, it's the same problem. He said, I originally thought this was the case dreamed of by law professors, a case where I could conscientiously say, although I consider the findings clearly erroneous, so I'd reverse if it were a judge's decision, nonetheless, there is support and substantial evidence. And therefore, I affirm it, because it comes from an agency. But when I think about it, I don't think there's substantial evidence either. Okay. In other words, has there ever been a case in the history of mankind where you think a judge has actually thought to himself, after reviewing the record, oh, I think that this is harmless, so I'll affirm. But I don't think it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, so I'll reverse. I mean, I find it very difficult to get myself in that state of mind, where I think such a thing is possible.",
  "But O'Neal, I thought O'Neal just says that this word \"burden of proof\" is out of place when you talk about an appellate judge reading the record.",
  "How do they say that after I thought I wrote an opinion for the majority of the Court which said this concept is not applicable in - - when you're reviewing a record for harmless error. It's not a question of presenting evidence. What I think it said is that it's not a question of presentation of evidence. In such a case, we think it's conceptually clear for the judge to ask directly, do I the judge think that the error substantially influenced the judge's -- the jury's decision? Now, maybe I was wrong, but I think there was a majority of the Court that agreed with it.",
  "To talk about burdens of proof?",
  "Yes. But that's my basic question in this case and it's a serious question. Suppose I think, which I do think, that I as a judge can conscientiously review a record and decide for myself whether I think this error of the judge was harmless, and if I really try I can bring myself to understand this question. Regardless of what I think, could another judge, say a State judge, reasonably have thought the opposite? I can do that mentally. You try to get me to make more fine distinctions than that, I cannot do it. I can't. I'm sorry. I admit it. Now, if that's the state of mind that I can get myself into -- and I believe that's true of many judges -- how do I write words that are realistic in this area?",
  "Suppose we apply Brecht. This is what I'm having to little trouble with but I'd appreciate your commenting or straightening this out. The Ninth Circuit holds two things according to the SG in the briefs. He states them very well. The first is let's look at this witness. The testimony was excluded. Now the Ninth Circuit says that exclusion was unreasonable of -- an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, because that testimony of the witness that was excluded was not only material, it would have substantially bolstered the claim of innocence. So that's their finding on the merits. Then they go on to say, but the exclusion was harmless. How could both those things be true? How could it be true that the reason that there was error in excluding it was that the evidence is so important that it substantially bolsters the claim of innocence? That's one thing they say. But the exclusion was harmless. I just fail to understand how anyone could think both those things. But maybe in the context of the case it was possible, but that's what I'd appreciate your explaining.",
  "So - -",
  "Go ahead.",
  "But what she heard was that they were going to kill, this other person was going to kill a man and a woman, and it turned out that that was the crime at issue.",
  "What did she hear?",
  "Do you think -- do you think, do you think I should do this? I'm still looking, I'm worried about on the one hand, as you are, having this Court announce too many six-part tests, and having a lot of words and it becomes easy to make a mistake for a judge and then you never finish a proceeding. I'm worried about that, as are you.",
  "At the same time, I think what counts is what the judge does, the reviewing judge. Not what -- quite what the test says. So there has to be a conscientious effort to decide, was there -- was it harmless? Could a reasonable jurist in California have concluded the opposite? Okay. So maybe we should do it in this case. We simply try ourselves to go through this record, make that determination to show by example, rather than by trying to find a form of words.",
  "It is -- I agree with you, I agree with you that we should look at the whole picture. When I look at the whole picture -- I've actually got a little chart that my law clerk prepared. And what he did, he went through this and looked at a case called Newlon and it was the same prosecutor. And the prosecutor was told in that case just what he shouldn't do. And now if we look what he did in this case and look what he did in that case and look at the law, the whole thing, not just little bits, it looks like he did an awful lot of what he wasn't supposed to do. You're not supposed to give an argument that vouches as the U.S. attorney that I think that this is what you should do. So in Newlon he says: I'm talking to you as prosecuting attorney of the county, the top law enforcement officer. And here he says: I'm the top law enforcement officer and I decide in which cases we have the death penalty and not. Worse than Newlon, I would say. Then what you're not supposed to do is you're not supposed to tell them they're like soldiers. I mean, there's Supreme Court cases that say, don't tell them you're like a soldier doing duty. At least that's what all these prosecutors -- a case called Byron versus the United States. So in Newlon what he says is: I want to impress on you, this is a war and it's justifiable to kill in war. Here he says: As in the movie \"Patton\" and in the movie George Patton is talking to his troops because they're going out in battle like the soldiers. And then he says: And when you're a soldier, you know what to do when you put your hand in a pile of goo that a moment before was your best friend's face; you'll know what to do; and last July this defendant's face was a pile of goo. Okay, there we are. I mean, that sounds pretty emotional. It sounds like a soldier does his duty and you're doing it. And then another thing you're not supposed to do is you're not supposed to tell them it's their duty to the community. And this is just filled with instances where you hardly even know that there's a person called Weaver because he says: What you have to do here is send a message to the drug lords, send a message - -",
  "Well, there's a brief - -",
  "It's not? Why did they file -- is this brief wrong, then, the brief of the former prosecutors giving the propositions that I just stated and have the Supreme Court case next to each one? Are they wrong, those prosecutors?",
  "Was there with the Patton and the goo?",
  "Was there a curative instruction?",
  "In Viereck the words were: \"This is war, harsh, cruel, murderous war.\" And the prosecutor went on to analogize the jury's duties to the duties of soldiers and he said: Do your duty. Do you think that's a lot different than this case?",
  "So those things that are improper for a prosecutor to make in summing up in the guilt phase, are they then proper to say, exactly those things, in a sentencing phase with capital -- with - - you know, capital sentencing?",
  "There are a number of cases in this Court that say what a prosecutor can't say, guilt phase. All of them happen to be guilt phase, I guess. You can't, you know, vouch. You can't use too much emotion. You have to focus on what the defendant did, not on what somebody else did. I mean, there are a number of things. Now, do those -- is it fair or not fair to say that those precedents apply in the capital sentencing phase, too?",
  "Can I ask you, where -- one of the passages that I thought went a little far where is he says to the jury, the one thing you've have got to into your head; this is far more important than William Weaver. This case goes far beyond William Weaver. This touches all the dope peddlers and the murderers in the world. That's the message you have to send. It just doesn't pertain to William Weaver. It pertains to all of us, the community. The message -- there are street, et cetera. Okay. Now. That struck me, as you argue this is rather extreme. Its seems to be removing the attention of the jury from William Weaver and saying you have a duty to send this man for other reasons. Now - - to execute him. But where do I find in the U.S. reports the case or statement that then says this is the kind of argument the prosecutor cannot make?",
  "You were talking - -",
  "Suppose that you said explicitly, the prosecutor -- which he didn't say -- but you're arguing basically, it is a fair, sort of an implication, suppose he said there are a lot of drug dealers around, and he's one of them. And this sentencing phase isn't about just -- just isn't about William Weaver. It is about sending a message to the others. And if you execute him, even if you think he shouldn't be executed, you don't think he ever should be, but, you see, others will think that this is a message. So do it just to give a message. Even if you think he never did it. No matter what you think of him, you think he's the best person in the world. Still execute him just to send a message. Now would that violate the Constitution?",
  "Yes. Of course. What case in the Supreme Court would you look to to show it did?",
  "You don't find any one where anybody ever had an argument like that.",
  "Ah. Ah. So you are saying we should look not just to -- if we try to look for exact, identical arguments maybe we'll get into that problem? Of having to uphold things we all know -- or is that right? Or what?",
  "You say very. Which economists? I know the Chicago school tends to want rule of reason and so forth. Professor Sherer is an economist, isn't he? Worked at the FTC for a long time. A good expert in the field. He points out the drug industry after you got rid of -- after you got rid of resale price maintenance, the margins fell 40 percent. The drug stores it went down 20 percent. He says with blue jeans, alone, it saved American consumers $200 million to get rid of it. And his conclusion is, as in the uniform enforcement of resale price maintenance, the restraints can impose massive anti-consumer benefits. Massive.",
  "What that sounds like is that if at least he, who is an economist, thinks if you get rid of Dr. Miles, every American will pay far more for the goods that they buy at retail. Now that's one economist, of course. There are other whose think differently. So how should we decide this?",
  "Should we overturn Dr. Miles and run that risk?",
  "We're supposed to count economists?",
  "Is that how we decide it?",
  "Well, I haven't seen a consensus. A consensus? Isn't, doesn't Sherer and all these people, doesn't that point of view count, too?",
  "Well, I don't know. We have -- you talked about -- just for fun I got out of the library a book by Professor B. S. Yamey, called resale price maintenance where he has five economists - - now maybe you're not going to count them as economists. Now I didn't find in that book a single argument that isn't also in your briefs, nor did I find in your brief as single argument that isn't in the book. There's one interesting thing about the book. It was written in 1966. So I guess my question is what's changed? Now I know two things have changed. One is there's evidence in Canada, Britain, and in the states that were under Miller-Tydings, that when you got rid of resale price maintenance, prices went down. That's changed. And the second thing that's changed is there's far more concentration, I gather, today in the retail side of the market than there are used to be, a factor which makes resale price maintenance dangerous because it's more likely to take place at the request of the dealers. Now, I see those two changes. My question to you is looking at Yamey's book which is called Resale Price Maintenance, so you might have found even it even on Google, and -- what's changed? What's new?",
  "Maybe I'll put my question, which is really just one for this. I understand perfectly that the per se rule is a result of balancing differ things. Of course, resale price maintenance does raise prices, and it is very often anticompetitive. Of course, sometimes, there are good reasons for it that might help consumers. Now, in addition, you need clear rules. Now those three sets of things require a balance. And we have a hundred years of history where this Court and Congress and others have balanced those three sets of considerations, and they've come out one way. Now, the Department of Justice wants to rebalance them and come out the other way. There are good arguments on both sides. Why should we overrule a case that's 96 years old, in the absence of any -- any -- congressional indication that that's a good idea, when it's simply a question in a difficult area of people reaching a slightly different weight on some these three sets of things?",
  "I would think it is quite a close question.",
  "All right, even so. Go ahead.",
  "Price fixing, horizontal, I guess, or territorial divisions, we should overturn those too.",
  "What you say is right. What you say there is right. I feel I'm back in 1966. The argument against that is, we don't know which way the push comes. The large retailers, Home Depot, whatever they are, huge retailers, they want -- or maybe it isn't the discounters, it's some other once. We don't know which way. You're throwing it into court. You're throwing it before 12 people who may or may not work this thing out. So the argument against what you're saying is not logic. It's empirical and administrative.",
  "That's what it was. That's what it is now, I guess.",
  "The Internet -- is it - - you would have said four years ago, or I think we are in this argument, you would have said that it's the large discounters, the growing discounters, the Walgreen's of the world who want to get rid of retail price maintenance, it's there to help the mom and pops. Okay. They're in now, they're big, and they may want to maintain resale prices because they may want to extract the other profit, while the Internet little company comes in and says I can get it to you cheaper. Now I can imagine circumstances like you say. I can imagine they're not like you say. I don't know. And so what should I do if I really don't know?",
  "What about the weekends? I mean, maybe the judge -- I -- it looks from my calendar -- I wondered what day of the week it was. You don't remember. 2/10, February 10, 2004, what day of the week was it?",
  "It looks like it was the middle of the week. So maybe there were one or two weekends. So maybe what the judge's mistake was, he didn't know how to count the weekend rule.",
  "Which may not be jurisdictional, the weekend rule.",
  "They're not. A numeral is not jurisdictional. What's -- what's -- what's the three-day mail rule?",
  "Speaking of the three-day mail rule, maybe the judge's intent when he signed this was that it actually was entered, took effect as of three days later.",
  "What about something here I hadn't run across, called the unique circumstances doctrine. This Court in Osterneck said this: Where a party has performed a act which if properly done would postpone the deadline for filing his appeal -- and indeed that's what happened here; he postponed the deadline for filing his appeal -- and has received specific assurance by a judicial officer that this act has been properly done -- and here he did receive specific assurance by a judicial officer that the act was properly done -- in those circumstances, you can make a little exception in the interests of justice.",
  "Yes, yes, the act was that he filed a motion to reopen, which motion to reopen postponed the time of appeal. And two things have to happen with that act. One is you have to get the district judge to agree; and second, you have to file the paper. So that's the act which if properly done would, in fact, have led to the appeal.",
  "I agree there were two parts to it or two acts, if you want.",
  "Why does that matter? I mean, also Osterneck I happened to guess involved a case that took place on Tuesday. This case took place on Thursday. I mean, I grant you the language literally you could say doesn't quite fit it, but so what? The purpose of this Osterneck I take it is to have a very narrow exception where a judge tells you basically what to do, and you follow what the judge said, and then, lo and behold, they hit you with this jurisdictional thing and you didn't get it right. Now, that seems to be its purpose, and the language is very close, so why not follow it?",
  "I notice the court applied it twice, so it couldn't quite be the unique circumstances.",
  "Well -- in criminal.",
  "But in -- though of course, you'd have to confine it very narrowly, I take that doctrine, if there weren't a statute, you read it into the rule. So there is a statute and you read the statute as saying well there could be very some very narrow circumstances that Congress would have been willing to make an exception. For example it is a couple of days and the judge tells you, \"do it\" or lets you do it. It's roughly the same thing, isn't it?",
  "What do you think, if we did go to Thompson and looked at that, this would be a fortiori from Thompson, as described in Osterneck, was a case in which the judge simply said from the bench look, your -- your -- the new trial motion is timely, though it wasn't; it was out of by two days. While here, we have a formal court order, it is a formal order entered with a -- you know, stamp of the judge, and it says you have till the 27th to file.",
  "Yeah, but in the -- in this thing, it says entered on February 10.",
  "But it says it in the index, it says -- it says docket entries. 2-10, it says entered 2-10, on page 11. On page 11.",
  "Received. So -",
  "What happened in respect to the SEC? What about primary jurisdiction? That's what I wondered as I read this. Nobody mentions it. But there's certainly a lot of precedent in the area in this kind of thing. You ask the agency, have to go to the agency, see what they say.",
  "That's why I wonder about primary jurisdiction. You put a burden on the, on the plaintiffs to go to the agency and the agency could take a range of positions. It might say this is absolutely unlawful, BUT it's close enough we think an antitrust court has no business mucking around in this. Or it's unlawful and we don't care. Or, it's not -- in which case they could bring their suit. Or it's -- it's not unlawful but we don't care, or it's not unlawful and we do care. I mean, there is a range of positions they could take which was the purpose of the primary jurisdiction doctrine, to see in the context of the particular conduct, not general but in the context of the particular conduct, what the agency thought about this in terms of its regulatory mission.",
  "That's in respect to the particular conduct at issue here.",
  "Of course the Petitioners have not had an opportunity, I would think -- they filed a complaint. But they've not had an opportunity to argue this out in front of the SEC with particular evidence, with particular witnesses, et cetera.",
  "And even then, why do you take the other position? It is pretty easy to imagine the SEC, under some circumstances, deciding that's a proper way to market securities, to have some kinds of agreements between IPOs or something like that. I don't see why not.",
  "It is possible. I'm back to Justice Alito's question. I mean, if you're worried about taking authority from the Department to prosecute territorial restrictions as some kind of blatant price fix, that's not in front of us. So this doesn't have to be precedent for that. You're talking about this case. And there, I think the Respondent -- the Petitioners here say that my goodness, we don't see any way that a district court is going to be able to start talking about whether this evidence is protected. What does that mean, protected? Maybe protected here, because they have thought about it, but there will be a lot of cases where the SEC hasn't thought about the particular conduct. We don't know what they're going to prove. I'm back to Justice Alito. How is anybody going to administer the standard that you are asking the Court to enunciate?",
  "Well, it might well be, because the reasoning would be, which I find very strong, is that as soon as you make an, bring an antitrust court in, you're talking about juries and treble damages. And as soon as that happens, the people who are subject to it stay miles away from the conduct that, in fact, would subject them to liability. And yet staying miles away, they will not engage in conduct that, A, the SEC might believe is permissible, or, B, actually favor. Where you get a complex complaint like yours, that begins to ring true, that argument. And that's what's concerning me.",
  "What they say in respect to that is the other side says it's common to try to what's called make a book or something. I don't know these terms.",
  "And when they do, what happens is that the marketer goes out and he asks people: What's your plan? What are you thinking of doing next month? What's your plan for this stock? Hold it? Not? It doesn't require much imagination to see how certain answers to that kind of question could be brought by a plaintiff in perfectly good faith as evidence that there's an agreement that next month they will pay more for the stock and next month they'll pay a lot more.",
  "The problem -- I'd be repeating it. we're not talking about, say, your case. I don't know what your evidence is. But let's imagine a case where the evidence of just what you said consists of some rather ambiguous discussions which might be characterized in a variety of ways, including the way the way the plaintiff wants to characterize it, who would repeat the very words you just said. Now, the issue, it seems to me here, is in light of that possibility, do we want an antitrust judge to say whether that's so? I know you do. Or do you want the SEC to say whether that's so in the particular case? Or that's why I thought of primary jurisdiction: Maybe first send it to the SEC. What's your view?",
  "What about an agreement among underwriters, among underwriters, which says the following: We agree that we go -- when we go on our tour, we will be certain to ask the potential purchasers whether they plan to hold this stock for at least a month.",
  "No problem.",
  "How do you know that isn't a disguise when they say - -",
  "Ah, ah. What they've said was -- you see, they have the same allegations. I don't know how to -- you see what I'm driving at?",
  "What's the answer?",
  "Can you get damages for that from the SEC? I mean, it sounds like bad conduct.",
  "Suppose you lose, your client -- suppose all these bad things happen and you don't have an antitrust claim. Is there somewhere in the law that you can get damages?",
  "So what's at issue here is not whether you get a remedy. It's whether you get treble damages.",
  "All right. So what are the words you use in the opinion, that would separate your case, where it is like price fixing and so forth, to charge them, from the case that they're worried about, which is where the evidence is, to prove the allegation is, really involves activity that could be quite legitimate? Now, now -- what words would I write in the opinion that in your opinion would separate the sheep from the goats?",
  "What about -- what about - - listen to what I'm about to say. I'm thinking of the standard. The standard would be where the allegations are such, where the case is such that -- to go further -- that, one, it is an allegation of a claim of illegality; is price fixing, in price fixing; and it is of longstandingly prohibited under the securities law; and there is evidence to support that, of -- strong evidence to support it, or the evidence in support thereof is not primarily evidence simply of asking the jury to draw inferences from conduct that is protected. Under those circumstances there is no immunity.",
  "I don't know if it's -- I mean, you know - -",
  "I would always -- I think the standard I was more or less talking about is pretty close to what the SG says. And I think he says that - - that -- that Justice Alito's point, which is certainly a good point, is that you would have to allege facts such that it was clear from the face of the complaint that you weren't resting your case on the conduct that was - - that's what he means by protected -- and there's an ongoing obligation, it says, on the part of the district judge to be sure that the case isn't really growing out of this conduct that is arguably okay.",
  "You, you could live with the SG - -",
  "We all agree, say a group of underwriters, that for the next we will insist that every customer, whatever price we charge, will pay 30 percent more for 50 percent more shares next month. Absolutely illegal, isn't it?",
  "They write it down, just what I said.",
  "But suppose it says, which I think it did say, that Mr. Notebaert typically stayed on top of the company's financial health by having weekly conversations with other executives. He had his hands on the pulse of the company. He saw weekly sales reports and product -- projection -- production projections. Now it seems like an allegation that's very specific.",
  "Well, I thought they alleged at least that for about a year previously in respect to the 506500 that it was wrong known throughout the company that the 6500 had been delayed. Don't they make an allegation like that?",
  "The 6500 has long been delayed. Everyone knows that in the company. So he knows it's long been delayed.",
  "Then what he says is it is being shipped and delivered. Something like that.",
  "April '01, he says everything we can build we are building, and shipping. The demand is very strong. And then what they say is of course nobody wanted any of it, it was long delayed, and they've known that since 1998 and he has his finger on the pulse of the company.",
  "Oh. Yeah.",
  "What do you think in writing this opinion? There are a couple of ways. One, you can find strong inference in terms of some other words. Two, you could look to history. Or three, you could just try an example. Say strong inference means strong inference. Here's an example. This is a complaint. It meets it, or it doesn't meet it. Which way, in your opinion, will work best in this case?",
  "You had something else to say in answer to my question, which I would like to hear.",
  "The most suspicious thing in the complaint that I could find was where you say there's an internal market report, and it revealed demand for the 5500 was drying up, and revenue would decline by 400,000,000. Then you date that with in or about early '01. Now, I think if you knew or had reason to believe that it was prior to March or April of '01, you would have said so.",
  "Yeah, and therefore, there's quite a good chance here that this report was written after he made the statements. What am I supposed to do with that? I mean, I know what you said. And you said your best. And that's your best.",
  "What's the difference between what Justice Scalia was just saying? You can't come into Federal court unless you have at least $200,000 damages. Now, you might have been just as much hurt if you had less, but that would be constitutional. So here you can't get into Federal court unless you have a really strong claim, an overwhelming claim that you have to demonstrate at the beginning. Now, you might have a good claim, but we're not going to let you come into Federal court. We only want those people who are really strong, just as we only want those people who are really suffering.",
  "No. No, not the burden of -- it's the entry.",
  "That's true, but imagine a case where the plaintiff with tremendous candor sets forth every bit of testimony that's going to be heard on both sides. And then you read that document and you conclude this is the weakest case I've ever heard, but I do think a reasonable juror could find for the plaintiff. And that would be the weak evidence standard. And lo and behold, that could be -- you know, what do we do about that? Because using your do you send it to a jury test, we could easily imagine cases where that meets the weak evidence standard, the weak inference and not the strong inference. And what I'm driving at is, I don't see a way of avoiding this Seventh Amendment problem.",
  "Because they certainly didn't intend the weak inference standard.",
  "What do you think about the approach -- because I have had some of these cases. And I see -- I think words, words, words. And what Congress said was strong inference, and we're not going to get any further by looking for some other words. So therefore, take strong inference. The most helpful thing is take it, look at the complaint, read it, and then say okay, this is a strong inference. Or maybe we'd say it isn't. We read it, and avoid all the other issues. What do you think about that?",
  "Yeah, and so I think we have to reach it, because it can't possibly be you would instruct the jury you need a strong inference, and it couldn't possibly be that a predominance standard if imported into the pleading would always mean a strong inference. You see, that's -- that's the dilemma. And I don't see how to remain true to the words of the statute which are strong inference, without actually producing a dichotomy. And so either Congress can do it or it can't, and -- and -- and that's -- and we could fudge it by just, you know, avoiding it at this moment. But I don't - -",
  "If in fact it goes back to the State court and you litigate it, you lost, can you raise as a point of appeal that you did not receive two things the statute guaranteed you? One was a determination in the Federal court that you're an organ of a Federal State, and second, a bench trial?",
  "No, but could you?",
  "No, I'm just asking could you, yes or no. I - -",
  "Yes, okay. Now if you lost in the State court, could you then use that as a basis for asking this Court to accept jurisdiction? And if they -- if we did, we took it and we heard the case, reverse, and send it back for the proper tribal under the statute?",
  "See, what I'm getting at is whenever there's an erroneous remand, the practical problems that you raise are present. And they're awful. I don't deny them. I mean, they're right there in the statute, it foresees them. So I wonder, is there any difference in this case from every case where the remand is erroneous?",
  "In terms of the legal right to get the trial to which the law entitles you on your view of the law, there is no difference.",
  "And you would get those eventually, it would just have to happen.",
  "One technical question. The same one. I would to be -- imagine it is a diversity case. Imagine that a Federal court erroneously remands it. A trial gets up to this Court. And we say it was diverse. It shouldn't have been remanded. Now what's -- is that like -- can that happen? I guess. And is the remedy then wipe out the State proceedings, go back to Federal court? What happens? Has that have ever been a case like that?",
  "What happened?",
  "And it is called, the case, Missouri - -",
  "Well, what, what reason would Congress have for wanting a system that says - - and there are many, many, many people in the United States who would like to sue Pakistan. They would like to sue China. They would like to sue Russia. There are all kinds of places they would like to sue. And why would Congress want to have a system that says to those countries, you can come into Federal court and get your claim adjudicated, whether it is really you, China a; but by the way, if the Federal judge makes a mistake, there you are in Mississippi, Alabama, Illinois, any one of 50 different states? In front of juries, the very thing that we gave you this statute so you wouldn't have to do. Now what would their theory be?",
  "They were saying they were an organ of - -",
  "Yeah, and therefore they are immune unless -- unless they fall within an exception. And it may be they do. Is that not right?",
  "Well, I'm saying, that's how the statute works.",
  "But I take it if you win this, it's precisely the same, in respect to a person who has total immunity.",
  "Why not?",
  "Why not?",
  "Yeah.",
  "Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Yes.",
  "And a Judge makes a big mistake - -",
  "China comes in - -",
  "And says of course you're China. And then it signs a remand order.",
  "No. Well, after all -- if you're going to say, you say that one is reviewable on appeal.",
  "Is it or not, in your view?",
  "Fine. And now all they want here is the organ issue reviewed on appeal.",
  "And what's the difference between the one and the other?",
  "Okay, and you agree with that?",
  "Fine. Then why is it in your opinion that the immunity thing is so important that they get this collateral appeal, but the organ thing is not so important since all, what turns on that is whether they're going to have their non-jury trial.",
  "We have this very old judge like me. China is there. And he says: This isn't China; Formosa is China. So he says remand. So there we are, China is now in the Western District State Court for Illinois and they're suing them for a lot of money. Now, you said, I thought, before that where that happened, and they wrongly ly denied immunity, they could, China, appeal in the Federal system. I thought you said that.",
  "All right.",
  "What?",
  "All they want is a definitive appeal that this is really China, all right. Now, can they do that, yes or no? You said yes. So I thought Justice Kennedy's question was, if they can do that, why can't Powerex appeal in exactly the same way on the question of whether they're an organ. What's the difference?",
  "I don't care. I don't call this an appeal of a remand. What this is, it is an Appeal of the determination precedent to remand that Powerex is not an organ.",
  "That would make them just as happy, I believe.",
  "Why not say, depending on the clever lawyers, or non-clever as the case may be, why not just say Congress intended that you do get an underlying appeal in the Federal system, for what is at stake is not simply where the case will be tried, but rather significant and important rights attach in the Federal court that do not attach in the State court. And therefore, it is right, the appeal you get when they -- when what is at stake is immune or not, and by doing that we avoid four more years of litigation and the necessity to hire clever lawyers.",
  "Was that later?",
  "How much later?",
  "No, no. I thought that the provision that was -- what is the number -- - where they say 552.109; that didn't appear anywhere until many years later.",
  "I mean, you read - -",
  "You read 3 and 3 says what you said it says. All right. How much later did they promulgate 109?",
  "That's what I thought. So the same day they say, 3, you have to have these domestic workers employed by the old lady who's sick, and then in 109 they say you don't.",
  "All right. Now, why is that a conflict? Let's imagine -- it sounds like a conflict. But it's easy for me to imagine a regulation that says birds for purposes of this are animals that fly, and then 15 pages later it says, but by the way, penguins don't and they're still covered. I mean, why is that a conflict? There are lots of specific situations. If I read that, I would have thought, well, okay, they have an exception.",
  "Did Congress intend to cover, which I guess is a growing situation, that there is an old woman or man and they're very sick and they live in their house, there's only one way to keep them from having to go to an institution. Their children hire a companion to look after them. Now, that's a third party.",
  "Because?",
  "It doesn't say that. It says \"about, in or about a private home of the person by whom he is employed.\" I live in San Francisco. My mother lives in Massachusetts. Now, if I hire a companion to live in Massachusetts, that companion does not work about a private home of the person, me, by whom she is employed. So if we're being literal and if you win this case, I don't see how -- and I'm worried about this, obviously -- however -- and I think it's probably very common, that all over the country it's the family, the children, the grandchildren, an aunt, an uncle, maybe a good friend, maybe they're not even related, who is paying for a companion for an old, sick person so they don't have to be brought to an institution. And if you win this case, it seems to me suddenly there will be millions of people who will be unable to do it and, hence, millions of sick people who will move to institutions. Now, if I were to say that that isn't totally a legal point, it is of course a legal point because it's a question of what people intended, but a worrisome point, I would be telling the truth. It is a very worrisome point.",
  "And there are many -- maybe Justice Scalia has the answer.",
  "Since we're into that, we're into this fascinating subject, I thought that possibly they had -- they promulgated the whole thing pursuant to the rulemaking power under that particular statute, because that's what it says in 552.2. It says \"this part\" -- it doesn't say subpart, it says part - - and part is 552. And both regs we are talking about are in the part. And B says interpretations, but they don't mean interpretive rules, because when you look at those interpretations, they have a whole lot of numbers in them, and divide by 32. Nobody thinks that Congress meant in this statute divide by 32, as opposed by divide by 33. So as I read that, I thought the whole thing is promulgated pursuant to their rulemaking authority; Part A has more general things. Part B has more specific things. Where am I wrong?",
  "All of them. All of them is what it says unless I missed something.",
  "Okay. I got the point.",
  "Right. Right.",
  "I understand very well your argument that if the EPA is going to transfer this, they transfer it to Arizona and the first thing they say is, we look at Arizona's laws and they protect everything. And now we look at our own authority and if they get - - start mucking around with this, we can refuse the permit. And besides that, we have a memorandum of understanding and the memorandum of understanding or whatever it is, agreement or something, is going to be they're going to pay as much attention as we are. So they'll pay attention to this, too, and if they don't we have an enforcement mechanism. So no problem; we are not putting any species in jeopardy. We satisfy the standard. I've got that part of the argument. I think I paraphrased it pretty well. The part I don't get is then you say, anyway, we don't have to do any of this because it says \"shall transfer,\" therefore, it's not discretionary, it's mandatory. That part I don't get because there are nine standards there and it seems to me to say that is rather like saying, well, the ICC used to say you shall let the railroad build a spur, provided it's in the public interest, convenience, and necessity. I mean, are you suddenly saying every statute that uses the word \"shall\" is not subject to the ESA?",
  "All right, fine.",
  "Now, my problem with saying it's clear is that they have nine criteria. One of the criteria is you look to five other statutes, which they have their own criteria and one of those criteria is you have to be certain that the State will assure the protection and propagation of a balanced population of shellfish, fish, and wildlife. And by the time you get through those nine criteria, I don't think you'd have to be too imaginative a lawyer to figure out ways that they involve everything the ESA involves. So if there ever was an act prefaced by the word \"shall\" where the ESA would apply, you would think it would this be this one, which has to do with water, environmental protection, nine criteria, many vague, and they use words like \"wildlife,\" \"shellfish,\" et cetera.",
  "That isn't the -- what I'm trying to figure out with Justice Kennedy's questions and your answers is, is there really an issue here? And I'm beginning to see maybe there is an issue when you said what are they talking about. Can you -- it's a cactus. They're kidnapping cactus, as apparently happens. And if in fact this cactus, if the thing is transferred to the State, that cactus is going to disappear. Now that isn't fish. It isn't wildlife. It isn't water. It's a cactus. So can you take that into account? Is that theoretical? I think they're trying to raise this question of, suppose you know the IRS, that if you mail a refund check at the time, the person who gets it is going to use the $500 to destroy the last salamander in the world. Okay? Now there we are, endangered species. Does the Act apply to the IRS? I would have thought the answer's no.",
  "And then I would have thought the same reasoning is true here, but what the Act tells you to do is read your existing authority, but read it in light of informed by the endangered species objectives language, et cetera. And now I wonder if with that approach, is it possible that even the cactus could fall within the nine criteria? You're not going to depart from them but you're going to read them generously in light of the objective of the Endangered Species Act, which is itself an environmental objective. Now how does that work? Can you do that? You're an imaginative lawyer. Can you do it?",
  "All right. The answer is you can. Then are you satisfied with this result in this Court? One, it can be read that way. They're not going to agree with that. It can be read that way, and therefore, it applies. The ESA, the Endangered - - Two, that means they consult. But three, the result of the consultation here which has been done means there's no real objection to the transfer, because it's virtually inconceivable given the weapon that the EPA has, withdrawing permits, given a memorandum of agreement, given the possibility of supervision, given the fact that the wildlife service will object, writing them a letter or a phone call immediately, given all that stuff, there's simply no reason to believe that Arizona will fail to protect endangered species.",
  "So what's your view of an opinion that roughly wrote what I just said?",
  "Before you say why you didn't argue it, it's exactly that point I sort of expected you might agree when I though maybe you have hooks to hang the NSA, the Endangered Species Act on. But it was the other half, which I think is what Justice Stevens is saying now. I read through this record, not completely but pretty well, and I couldn't find a single thing that would suggest that Arizona presents any risk to you. And so, what is the risk to an endangered species that you're actually worried about there? And you rather -- I didn't think you'd like to agree with that, but I want to press you to find out what actually is the problem.",
  "And how would that happen? How would it happen that they would get rid of the flycatcher in Arizona, considering the fact that they have laws themselves that protect endangered species, and that's a bird, and a bird is wildlife; and so if they decide they want to kill all their flycatchers, which I would doubt, you could intervene at EPA and stop them. So how is that actually a problem?",
  "What's a mandatory decision? No, what's a discretionary decision? I mean, in the sense you're using it. I've never heard of an agency that could just give out money to whoever they want, like you or me. There are always criteria. Write a \"shall\"; there are always criteria.",
  "You mean is it the word \"unless,\" because here we have nine and they're broad. Probably with funding we have 32. Maybe with some others we have 14. But I can't get my mind around - -",
  "What has this to do with the -- aside from the explanation, when I read through the transcript, as I have, it seemed to me in the transcript he didn't say a word that suggested he's against giving the death penalty. He kept saying yeah, in special circumstances, not always. Then they get into this thing where he's been thinking of a person who will in fact commit a crime again. And then it's put to him directly: Have you thought about that he won't be committing a crime again if he's in jail the rest of his life. He says: You're right; I hadn't really thought it through. I want to know, thinking it through, could you consider the death penalty? Do you think under the conditions where the man would never get out again you could impose it? Yes, sir. So you don't think that if parole was an option, etcetera, repeating it. Death penalty? I could consider it. Then could you impose it? I could if I was convinced that was the appropriate measure. And it's absolutely clear he's not thinking of the repetition. It is clear he is thinking that it's some kind of a mean. And I compare that with Witt, where the person just says no, I can't, and I compared it with this other case, Gray, and they say it's illegal to push him off a jury, a woman who is confused, and finally she says: I think I could.",
  "Well, that's probably right.",
  "So what is it that he could have done? Was he shaking, making faces? Was he shaking his head to indicate he believed the opposite?",
  "If something like that happened, isn't a prosecutor of any sense going to say, I want it noted for the record that the witness while he said these words was chortling inwardly or something like that?",
  "The law on this, and you've read the cases more recent probably -- I've skimmed through some but not read them all, as I'm sure you have. And the statement of the law that I want to know, is it still valid law, is in Witherspoon on 522, Justice Stewart in the footnote. And what he says in that footnote is, \"the most that can be demanded of a venire man in this regard is that he be willing to consider,\" and those are his italics, \"to consider all of the penalties provided by State law, and that he not be irrevocably committed before the trial has begun to vote against the penalty of death, regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge. If the voir dire testimony in a given case indicates that venire men were excluded on any broader basis than this, the defendant's sentence cannot be carried out.\" Is that still a valid statement of the law or has it changed?",
  "Of Washington law. No, this is Justice Stewart of the Supreme Court.",
  "This doesn't say -- that's one of the things it says. But the other is, \"the most that can be demanded of a venire man is that he be willing to consider\" -- that's the word that's italicized -- now, is there any -- \"and if you exclude him on a broader ground than that, the death sentence cannot be carried out\". Now, is there anything in any later case that suggests a change in that respect?",
  "Who -- who -- where does it say you have to have done that? My statute here says in any action to enforce a provision of 1983 -- the TRO or whatever was such an action. It says the court in its discretion may allow the prevailing party an attorneys' fee. Well, did they prevail fail or not? They got what they wanted. And it was such an action. Doesn't say anything about whether you have been declared horrible or wonderful or violator or not a violator. It says did they get what they want in the action? Answer, yes. End of matter. Now what's wrong with reading it that way?",
  "Yeah, they got the legal claim. The legal claim is we want to have our demonstration on February 14; we have a right to do it and therefore issue an order. You said no, don't issue the order, because they don't. And therefore, they won.",
  "It is not?",
  "Yeah. But what about the legal claim we are under the law entitled to a preliminary injunction.",
  "Well I thought, where it say that in the statute that you have to have that particular kind of a claim?",
  "So what do you think, when this was enacted, to make up an example that it is as horrifying as I can think, where the Ku Klux Klan was riding in the South, and a group of civil rights demonstrators wanted to make certain they could have their demonstration outside the jail and they go to the judge and says the sheriff is involved in this, the whole town is; we want an injunction tomorrow. Tomorrow. Right now. So -- and we don't really care that much about the end of it, but we'll -- we'll go ahead and litigate it if you want. Now they get their injunction. They have the demonstration; it's over. I would have thought if there was a situation for which 1983 was written, it's that one.",
  "Oh, there is. The other side has a lot of arguments. And they each have arguments. There are plenty of issues of law.",
  "What is the law in respect to this, which is right on the point you're arguing, that two parties have this kind of suit and the government party -- they settle it, and giving everything that the plaintiff conceivably wants, but at the end they say: We don't admit we violated the law. Can you get attorney's fees there or not.",
  "It's a consent decree, but no admission of a violation of law.",
  "I thought that it -- am I wrong about that? I thought that if, A, he goes in, he gets a preliminary injunction, he says the law is da, da, da, the judge says you're right, that's what it is, preliminary injunction. And now it's continued up on appeal, the appellate court says you're wrong about the law. You got it, you had the event, but you're absolutely wrong, the law did not support you. I thought under those circumstances you were not prevailing and you couldn't get it. Is that the law or not?",
  "Is there any authority for that? Because it does seem to me wrong, that where a person has got a preliminary injunction and it's legally unsupportable, and then he gets the fee but then they appeal that and the court of appeals determines it's legally unsupportable, he never should have gotten it, I'd be surprised if there is a case that awards the fee in those circumstances, but maybe there is. What is it?",
  "Is there any case you can think of that under those circumstances let's him have the attorney's fees?",
  "No, I would be surprised.",
  "The other thing that I wonder about this case is, are you the prevailing party? And the reason I ask that is because when I look through the record it seems to me your clients are very interesting. They have their point of view. And their point of view, one of their points of view was that the state said you can have this demonstration, just wear a skimpy swimming suit. No. Well, you can have the demonstration maybe, I'm not sure of this, but we're going to put up a cloth so other people who don't want to see you don't have to see you. And there your client said, we won't pay any attention to the cloth. At least we didn't in the past. And then looking at that I thought, well, maybe what they got was, they got a preliminary injunction or a TRO, whatever you want to call it, but it didn't stop the State from putting up the cloth. It was pretty clear the State would, and it should have been pretty clear that they were going to ignore it, which they did. And why is this any different than having won an injunction to say okay, you can demonstrate, but in your swimming suit? In other words, they didn't want this. They didn't want what they got. Now, what's the response to that?",
  "Well, before you leave that, I wonder if -- there's one other thing floating around in my mind. I might as well bring it up. The word is prevailing, and if I go with you on the ground that it's flexible and can apply to all kinds of things, at least you have to really be prevailing, is there a good faith element in that? That is to say, if your clients when they went in to get this order and they got it, and at that time they had no intention of following what they had to do. Rather, they had every intention of going out and tearing down the curtain. Does that enter into the determination of whether they are really a prevailing party who ought to get their attorney's fees, if you're bringing the ethical element into it?",
  "What was the evidence?",
  "What was the evidence?",
  "I mean, at this late date, you've had trials. You're saying -- did you ask? With all these people under oath, haven't you had trials and everything?",
  "Did you ever ask the people who were at the meeting, what was the evidence you considered that we haven't had a chance to see?",
  "Did you or not?",
  "And then, and what did they say?",
  "All right. So there were some notes taken by investigators, which did they have anything new in them you hadn't seen before?",
  "What was in there that you had not seen before in the notes?",
  "I'm asking you: What was in the notes that were presented to the decisionmaker that you had not previously seen and therefore had no opportunity to rebut? What particularly and specifically? And it's surprising to me that you hesitate at this very late date if this is a serious issue.",
  "What did it say in the notes that you, a factual matter or some other, that you did not have a chance to reply to specifically?",
  "What you learned was the investigators had not spoken to Mr. King, and you previously did not know that, and if you had known that you would have said to the decisionmaker: The investigators did not speak to Mr. King. And if you had said that, how would this case be different?",
  "And the other side says, Mr. Bart King was part of the school and had something to do with this?",
  "Is that right.",
  "Well then, I don't understand what the relevance of this is.",
  "But I don't understand what Mr. King has to do with this if the other side is not claiming that Mr. King is part of your operation.",
  "Who considered it?",
  "Did you ask the people on the board of control, what role did Mr. King play in your decision?",
  "So that they might have reduced it ed it from $3,000 to less had they not been under the mistaken impression that Mr. King had something to do with you when he did it.",
  "And the probation was - - and the probation, which was for four years?",
  "And have you served the four years.",
  "So there is three more years? So if in fact you are correct that they were under a misapprehension on this matter, then the thing to do would to be find out if that extra three years had something to do with this erroneous thing of Mr. King? It's surprising to me all of this is coming up now, but there we are. So but that's your specific claim.",
  "I thought it was a different claim. I thought you were claiming there was a violation of due process because an investigator spoke without you present to the board.",
  "And that I would think was not a violation of the Constitution since it happens every day of the week in administrative agencies. But if you want to claim it is, I'll be happy to listen. And I think in that you're saying the Administrative Procedures Act is unconstitutional, which would be a surprising claim to me.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Was there anything at the trial that came out that the investigator when they were in the private session said a fact about Bart King of supreme importance that they didn't know about?",
  "What's your opinion, then, how this is supposed to work? A person has been on death row for ten years, perfectly sane, no problem. He's going to be executed next month. Tomorrow he becomes catatonic, absolutely insane, no doubt about it, and now it is unconstitutional to execute such a person. Nobody denies that. All right, now what's supposed to happen?",
  "I don't want you to agree with me. I want to know what you think should happen.",
  "And what's your opinion, because I didn't memorize every page. I read it. So what's your opinion how that works?",
  "So your opinion is -- and then is that constitutional, if in fact Congress passes a statute and says there will be no court review of a person who clearly the Constitution forbids to execute, the State to execute him. Nobody doubts that. Nobody doubts this is an unconstitutional execution, but there will be no court review of a decision to the contrary. Is that constitutional?",
  "I know that's not - -",
  "Well, why not? Why not? Because we have, after all, a claim that the Fifth Circuit has as a general matter misapplied the standard of this Court's cases as to what counts as insanity for purposes of the Constitution. Now, you say this blocks it, but it doesn't block a direct writ for habeas, so why not? It's an important general question. Someone may be executed whom the Constitution forbids to have executed. Why not?",
  "Would you object if we do that?",
  "Because?",
  "There's also the substantive part, that is, I think there's also an argument that the district court here, and the court of appeals, applied not just Justice Powell, but Marshall's even stronger, and they took -- they say about the same thing in Ford, I didn't see much of a difference, but if there is, take Powell. And it seems to say, the Fifth Circuit following, that if you can answer the question yes, prisoner, are you being executed? Yes. What does that mean? I'll die. And why are you? Because I committed a murder. That that's the end of it. And they say explicitly, it doesn't matter if the next thing the prisoner says and the reason that's going to happen is because of the wild dogs. You say, what do you mean? The wild dogs are manipulating the minds of all of the State officials, all the witnesses, because I'm a victim of the wild dogs forever. And you have 15 psychiatrists and they absolutely prove that's what he thinks, and he thinks that this is all about dogs. Now should he have that delusional system, as I read the Fifth Circuit and the district court, that happens to be irrelevant as to whether he is insane and can't be executed. Now I can't read Powell and Marshall as saying that, so they're saying it's clearly contrary to Powell and Marshall, that sounds like a substantive claim, and they say correct the Fifth Circuit please. What about that one?",
  "But suppose you went back. You see, you say it's just Justice Powell. But Marshall said for the Court, today we explicitly recognize that it has been, for centuries, is abhorrent to exact in penance the life of one whose mental illness prevents him from comprehending the reasons for the penalty or its implications. So that sounds like a stronger statement than Powell. So you add Marshall to Powell, and you get a court. It isn't just Powell. And I agree with you that I don't know that that standard you just enunciated about the rational one is the right test. Maybe the right test is just to repeat these words from Powell or some others. But I think their claim is whatever that is, the Fifth Circuit's been using the wrong test.",
  "That may be. So maybe the thing to do is to send the case back to the Fifth Circuit and say you've been using the wrong test, this is the right test. Do it again.",
  "What about just repeating -- see, what is worrying me is that the district court said precisely what the Fifth Circuit said, indeed stronger. It says, \"Despite the fact that petitioner's understanding of the reason was impaired by delusions,\" the Fifth Circuit concluded that that didn't matter. Now, that means he is applying the same test in the district court that then the Fifth Circuit applied. What would you think about our just quoting the language from the Supreme Court opinions and say this is the language of the test. We can't do better than that. Go apply it.",
  "It seems to apply just to abuse of discretion.",
  ": Doesn't the new statute just apply to abuse of discretion?",
  "It says you have jurisdiction to determine whether it's an abusive discretion. Maybe I'm reading the wrong place. 6404 - -",
  "Right. Well that standard doesn't apply to the (e)(2). It has nothing to do with it; (e)(2) says if it's a refund, abate, if not, not. It's not a question of abuse of discretion or not.",
  "Yeah, but is there any other instance in the law? I suppose there probably is, but what surprised me about that is this: Imagine we have two citizens and they are identical in every respect in terms of their claim, they each believe the government owes them $50,000. They each have identically strong claims. And Congress passes a law and says one of you can come into court and the other can't. Now suppose it said the poor person can't come into court. Do you think there wouldn't be a constitutional problem there? Remember, they have the same claim for the same amount, with the same precise strength of their argument. But we say rich people can go in, and we'd say why did you do that? We say poor people don't have as much stake in society. They don't have -- now suppose you heard such an argument. How long would it take you to feel there's a constitutional problem?",
  "No. No. No. The rational basis is that the poor person doesn't have the stake in society that a rich one does.",
  "Yeah.",
  "But at the end of the day, the claim happens to be interest worth $5,000. The IRS abused its discretion under the statute in failing to write a check for $5,000 to both. What we do is we allow one of them to bring a lawsuit to get the 5,000, and we say to the other one, you can't bring the lawsuit to get the 5,000. Now my question is, what's the basis for that distinction?",
  "Why would there be no hardship?",
  "And so can a poor person.",
  "By the way, this has nothing to do with the progressive income tax. What I have not seen anywhere is the use of wealth, totally different from the dollar value of a claim, to shut the courthouse door. I'm just saying, is there such a case anywhere, and if there is no such case, then I'd say I wonder about this assumption. The assumption that the reason that you cannot keep the courthouse door open to everyone is because what?",
  "What.",
  "We know, attorneys' fees you give to poor people more than to rich people. That makes sense. That has nothing to do with having a formal rule saying you cannot enter the courthouse.",
  "I don't understand.",
  "Wait. That might be the answer.",
  "Wait. Wait. There are two separate things. I want to understand this. In other words, the Secretary does not have the power to abate the interest in respect to the rich person?",
  "Oh.",
  "He can do it -- in the first case with the rich person, he can abuse his discretion.",
  "In other words, in the one case Congress has passed a law saying with a poor person you cannot abuse your discretion, but with a rich person you can abuse your discretion. That's what the underlying substantive statute says.",
  "I now think maybe I don't agree on this point that there are different standards, because it does say in this abuse of discretion. And indeed that's a normal administrative standard, and so as you read this you would think that the IRS does not have any legal power substantively to abuse its discretion in refusing to bring an abasement in refusing to bring an abatement -- excuse me, to abate the interest. So far do you agree?",
  "Once they make clear that the standard is abuse of discretion, it only makes clear what's there in the law anyway, that administrative authorities do not have the authority to abuse their discretion. Now, sometimes we don't review that in the courts. That doesn't make it legal. It just means you can't catch them out in court.",
  "So there's a standard that applies to everybody. Then all that this does, to go back to it is it closes the courthouse door. Now I want to know what your rationale was for doing that? It had nothing to do with the standards that applied. It has to have something to do with why one class of people by wealth are kept out of court. I think if it were the other way around it wouldn't last for three seconds, and the only reason maybe I don't think about it as hard this way because I think, well, privilege is involved, etcetera. But when you force me to think about it, I want to know what the reason so.",
  "I'll accept that characterization. Now you give me the reason why we've opened the courthouse door to individuals who are alike in every respect but for their net worth? Now give me that, the same reason? I always want to know what the specific reason is, the specific rationale and. I'm not saying there isn't one. I just want to know what it is.",
  "What are -- what are they? I mean as I read this, I can't get anything out of the language. I mean the two \"others\" might just make it more clear. So we have another Section 113 that talks about contribution and it says you can get contribution if there has been a lawsuit, and so forth, or if there has been a settlement. Fine. Now the question comes up, well, suppose there hasn't been a lawsuit or a settlement. Now if we look at the language here, at least my initial reading of it, it does not say. It says that they are liable. These PRPs are liable to this other PRP or person there. But it doesn't just say explicitly bring a suit, and it doesn't say explicitly you can't bring a suit. So I think well, why can't he bring a suit? If he brings a suit how is the sky to fall? On the other hand, if you don't let him bring a suit, they say well, maybe the Government just -- will just stay out of this. The Government won't enter into settlements because the Government is a big polluter. And it would not like to get sued often, so they will stay away from the settlement and be home free. So that's what they say on your -- on their side, I think, primarily. What do you say on your side? How will the sky fall if in fact they win and they can bring suits under 107?",
  "Can I -- can I go back? Because I'm trying to, since I do find it so open with the language, what I'm doing is making what I call the list of acorns. You say the sky is falling and I want a comparative list.",
  "On their side I have an acorn, which is if they don't win, EPA and DOD just are not going to settle these things because they want to escape us suing them. And you say, are you kidding? EPA loves to sue.",
  "And they like to settle. Don't worry about it. All right. On your side, you're saying well, you know, if we don't -- if we don't -- accept your interpretation, they won't enter into settlements. To which I guess they will make the same response. Are you kidding? The EPA loves to sue us and we are frightened of them and we'll settle. Okay. So I've got one acorn each side, now are there other acorns on the Government side; namely the sky is falling - -",
  "What are they? I'd just like to make the whole list of acorns.",
  "How? I'm not so sure because -- unless you want to stipulate that that restitution -- if you want us to write in the opinion that in fact in a 107 action if one of the parties sued has entered into a settlement he shall have precisely the same protection from suit as if it were a 113 action. Do you want to say that or not?",
  "Well, I would worry about the equity. I just want to know if you want to stipulate that that's the proper interpretation, because I could easily imagine a case where your client bought a beautiful golf course and he wants to turn it into a golf course. Unfortunately, there's a little mess under there and he spends $10 million on that. And he says the real fault is the Union Oil Company and I'm going to sue them because they're the ones who dumped this and they've cost me $9 million. And it turns out that Union through precisely good luck and a brilliant attorney has settled this very matter for one dollar with EPA. Barred?",
  "Ah, that's what I thought, and that's what he's saying. That's what he's saying, that's why he has brought his second acorn, because he said there's a huge difference here. What you will do is if you get this 107 action you'll argue to the court as to what's fair, but what 113 says is once you settle with the Federal Government you're home free.",
  "How are you going to choose this? Because he is, I think you're -- maybe you're in a slightly awkward position because the Government is saying that one of the reasons that you're stuck with 113 is because Congress didn't really want through 107 to give parties like your clients an opportunity to review for fairness or equitable principles, whatever you like, the settlements that had taken place with the defendant in EPA. And that's so we can get people to settle, among other things. They feel they're home free. Now, you have two choices here. I think you could say, one, well, that's the way it is, we should have a 107 action and we should review these settlements for fairness; or two, you could say one of the principles of fairness is the principle that's written into 113 about no review, and we're happy with reading that into 107. So which is it that you would like to say?",
  "When you say that's absolutely true, you mean absolutely true that you have that choice, or is it - -",
  "All right, so then he's wrong in thinking that the motivating force behind this action is to permit people to get equitable review of prior settlements? What you simply want -- and you're not interested in that; you'll go with no equitable review of private settlements. Read 113 into it. You want the right to bring the case where there has no settlement and Government has done nothing.",
  "The California Supreme Court as far as I could tell was thinking that it turns, if you stop somebody, you stop somebody, if you make him think he isn't free to go. So you seem to me to give a lot of cases where he would feel free to go, and you're saying still that that's a stop. Well, I mean, suppose the policeman comes along and he sees three people in a car and there is Jack the Ripper driving. So he says okay, I'm stopping the car. Now he says the other three people, I'm not interested in you; my pal and partner here is in a second squad car; he will take you wherever you want to go. Have they been stopped?",
  "No.",
  "Okay. Well, I don't think you're going to find authority for that in the law. At least not in this Court. I mean, I'd like to know what it is. Maybe you are. I think that would be very interesting.",
  "Brower - -",
  "What, what were the facts there?",
  "There was a roadblock.",
  "So what it says here, getting out their quote from it, is it says it does not occur whenever there is a governmentally caused termination in individual's freedom of movement, nor even where there is a governmentally caused and governmentally desired termination of an individual's freedom of movement. That only when there is a termination of freedom of movement through means intentionally applied. Now, the only way I can -- I mean I say the difference between desired is that they didn't want to stop him. They are not interested in stopping him. That's not our desire to stop him. Our desire is to stop the driver. So if you don't have the desire and if there is no real restriction of any significance, is there a stop? I mean I would say Brower, they cited on their side, for that language.",
  "Well, the passenger, you also have to have two things. One they don't intentionally want to stop him. Two, he doesn't think his movement is restricted. Where both of those things are true, then no stop. That's why the people who, say, are on the railroad car and they stop the whole train, that the railroad says don't worry, not an inconvenience: We'll have another train for new 10 or 15 minutes; just get out, except for car one where there is Jack the Ripper -- you know, those other people are not stopped. Now that's their argument. What's your response?",
  "But I mean, the question - - so I want to know how to decide this case. I understand what your position is. But I think the normal instinct of everybody is not about boats, taxis, airports and all these other examples, but this case. And I, I would say if you want to go on instinct I wouldn't think of getting out of a car when I'm the passenger and the policeman has stopped. But maybe I'm wrong. So when you asked a million policemen, how many instances did they tell you about where they stopped the car and all the passengers jumped out and walked away? Was there one? Was there one.",
  "Does it matter if they're on the Santa Monica Freeway?",
  "I mean it would be pretty dangerous to get out.",
  "How are we supposed to -- I think it's quite interesting. How do you suggest we decide this/ I don't mean the result, but I'll go, I'll say yes, you've done your survey of the policemen, a million policemen think they're not restricting the movement of the passenger. Very few passengers jump out of the car, but that may be because they're worried about being run over. So you say, well, in fact they're restricted, but they don't think they're being restricted by the police, or do they? And here we have no idea, at least I have no idea. I really don't know what the majority think and yet it would seem totally relevant. How would we find out?",
  "So now perhaps I'm having so much difficulty, and maybe others are, because you've actually reached a question of law where facts matter. That is, the law points us to the direction of what would a person reasonably think in general in such circumstances, and we can look at five million cases, but we don't know. So what do we do if we don't know? I can follow my instinct. My instinct is he would feel he wasn't free because the red light's flashing. That's just one person's instinct. Or I could say, let's look for some studies. They could have asked people about this, and there are none. Or I could say, well, you're the State of California, you're the ones able to get the studies; you could tell some of those professors, you know, to stop thinking about whatever they're thinking about and go ask a few practical questions, but you didn't. What should I do? Hold that against you? Look for more studies? Follow my instinct?",
  "Well, that question hasn't been argued here.",
  "I'm just listening to this. It sounds to me as if you're saying, one, the employer decides to terminate, okay? Now that's done. Then we go to the next question. How would we terminate? And in respect to that, I think Justice Kennedy was asking, as I heard him, don't you have a fiduciary duty when you decide how. And your answer, as I heard it, was yes, you do. And now there is a third question. Does what happened in terminating mean that although you have a fiduciary duty, you couldn't consider a merger, because that's just not consistent with the basic plan of terminating. Is that right? If it's wrong, don't even bother to answer it.",
  "Why did you answer yes to his question, Justice Kennedy's, about the insurance company?",
  "What's the -- I'm trying to work this out now. Suppose I buy the annuity for these employees from the X insurance company, all right, and so the insurance company promises when they retire we'll pay them a thousand dollars a month. Suppose the company goes bankrupt. Does the, what is it, the PGPB, what do you call it, the Pension Guarantee - -",
  "Yes. Do they pick up any of that?",
  "They do not, okay. So I'm trying to understand this, then, the reg under this, and it says: Administrator, you buy the, the annuity from an insurance company, for example, or do the same thing, get an irrevocable commitment in another permitted form. So one question is when they do that the administrator doesn't have to have any fiduciary thought in his mind. The second position is -- that's their position. The second position is, even if that's so, this is not another permitted form because a merger isn't a determination. And the third position is, that's what we were just getting to, is that we don't see any way in which this could help the employee. Now you say, oh yes, there is a way. Now suppose we're choosing between two insurance companies. Insurance company A says: We will pay precisely what is owed, precisely; we're as solid as a rock. Insurance company B is hungry for business, so it says: We'll give those employees exactly what's owed and we'll write each of them a check for $500. Now, is that something that means then -- remember, this statute says you have to get what they promised them and not a penny more. Is that something that the insurance, the administrator then has to do? He has to take B because the insurance company is promising him a bonus?",
  "Well then, if not that why this?",
  "Could you go back for just one second to Justice Alito's question, because that's what I'm having trouble with, because I think the question is what, assuming you're right on all the other points for argument's sake, but what is the advantage to the worker here? And the answer I heard you give was the advantage is, well, maybe the worker if he goes and works in the right place will get some more money. Well, and I wonder is that relevant. And you told me in respect to the two insurance companies it wasn't relevant. So if it isn't relevant in respect to the two insurance companies, how can that be relevant here, and if that isn't relevant here what is the possible advantage to the worker?",
  "So then you're saying that the answer -- we have annuity company A and B, they're identical, the worker has a pension that promises them $1,000 a month, not a penny more, and company A says, we'll give you $500 extra. Then in your opinion under the current regs and so forth, the administrator must choose that company; is that right?",
  "I said they are equivalent in terms of -- of the security and so forth; they are each good companies and one will write out a check for $500, which is what I thought my example was. And now you're saying under the law the fiduciary must choose the first but you're hesitating on that which means I think I don't understand it fully.",
  "What was your distinction between a mortgage and a tax lien?",
  "Well, so think they can't enforce mortgage under this? That is to say the bank can't; it's not an interest of property in mortgage?",
  "That's, that's where it's hard for me because a purchase money mortgage, you sell the real estate. Ordinary secured interest in mortgage is secured interest by a lender is normally viewed as an interest in property, I think. I mean is there, is there any law anywhere that says that isn't an interest in property?",
  "But I take it there has never been a case in the history of the world you'll tell me where a lender or bank or anybody who loaned money to build an embassy has ever brought a case against the owner of the embassy, the sovereign, and won under anything like this exception, because they can't sue them.",
  "Ever. And there is none the other way, where they said you couldn't sue them.",
  "Okay. So why do people lend money to build embassies?",
  "And how did it work before 1605 was passed, how did they used to build, in the 19th century, embassies, if you know.",
  "What about paragraph 3 just after paragraph 2 in the complaint? Paragraph 3 asks the court to bar and forever foreclose the defendants from all right, interest, claim, etcetera in the parcel. Well, what about that? What they're asking, I just heard it. So what's the answer to that? They seem to be saying, we have the right to the parcel, you the defendant have no right to the parcel.",
  "Well, I did in part, so he can answer.",
  "The problem that actually is bothering me with your side of the case which I find difficult is, suppose I accept this principle that you have. All right, it seems to me anything at all can be reduced to a lien, any judgment, at least certainly slip and fall cases and you didn't keep the ice up in front and I want $4 million damages plus 300 million in punitives and where it is I have a lien against the embassy here. And I can't think of a distinction once I go down your road. I mean, he at least has an absolute distinction which I can see, but once I go down your road where is the stopping place? What's the principle?",
  "I'm imagining a city or Belarus or someplace where what they do is they say slip and fall on ice -- you know, you get a lien against the property prior to -- okay. I mean, it's easy to imagine that kind of thing.",
  "And in a range of subject matters. So I'm looking to what the stopping place is once I start down your road.",
  "I still have my question because I'm not world about malevolence, is that I don't carry around in my head all of the possible things that might be liens against property. And so maybe my imagination is wrong, but I want to know are you are arguing that every lien against the property is in fact a right in property which allows a lawsuit, or are you arguing that there is some distinction between some and the other. And I noticed that the Restatements and others are trying to distinguish between whether the lien in question grows out of the property or it doesn't grow out of the property, which I find possibly hard to work with and so I want to know how you see it.",
  "Can I -- can I can ask you to go back for a second to where I'm getting myself into a muddle here. I'm still now being very, very literal. I think you're very literal and you say it says, a case in which is involved rights to property. And you say, but this is a right to property in this case; if I win this case then I have a right to sell that house. Therefore, I have a right in property. Now, if that's the reasoning why doesn't that apply to every case where a State might say if you win this case you can sell his house? I mean, I can easily imagine a tort case, a contract case where a State would say, you win, you can sell their house to collect the judgment.",
  "So I'm still back in a different route at where I'm having the problem, which is a problem of distinguishing in principle between either your absolute principle, \"do it,\" his absolute principle, \"don't do it,\" or something in the middle.",
  "The hypothetical was doing away with the prejudgment lien. I would say the exact same words apply with just as much force if there is no prejudgment lien because a suit without a lien the State were to say, you win this tort claim, you can go sell this property to collect the judgment, is a suit in which there is at issue your right to sell his property, just as there is here.",
  "Do you?",
  "Don't you agree with Justice Scalia -- Justice Alito? Don't you agree with Justice Alito? I thought he's saying it's a ruling on constitutionality.",
  "I see.",
  "What does he do? I mean I looked at what he does in 74, 75, 76a. He seems to spend a lot of time moving furniture. He lists that twice. He runs the office. And he represents, he is out in the local office somewhere and he talks to constituents. I mean, he doesn't even appear in the Senate office except very rarely in which case he is doing casework. So I guess if he is included in that, I mean so is a full-time furniture mover.",
  "I have the whole list here. What here suggests, he ever -- he doesn't even write a statement for the floor. There is nothing here that suggests one word of anything he did ever went to a committee meeting, to a floor of the Senate, anything.",
  "What?",
  "What are the words?",
  "I agree with that one. I just said he doesn't do anything that gets to the floor of the Senate, that gets to a committee report, that gets to a committee hearing. Now what in there -- and you said it was not contested, so I guess the best source if it's not contested is his affidavit.",
  "Oh. Where does it say that? He drafted legislation that was then introduced?",
  "Where does it say that?",
  "What's wrong with this? I found what you're talking about here. It says in paragraph 13, contrary to what he says in his own evaluation, that Senator Dayton's staff, including Mr. Hanson -- that's a little uncertain, what they mean by that -- introduced a bill and drafted it. Okay? And then on paragraph 14 they say on November 15th, 2001, Mr. Hanson -- just as you said -- planned a Senate Government Affairs Committee meeting, selected hearing witnesses and prepared questions. Now suppose that we did as the court, lower court wanted to do, say let's just see if that becomes relevant. Because it's possible, given his other tasks that those two incidents, one on November 15th and the other, whenever help he gave to the drafting, had nothing to do with his being fired and nobody claims that. So what they said is let's wait and see if that becomes relevant. Now what's wrong with that solution?",
  "All right. Let's make an absurd case out of it which I'm trying to do a little bit to get you to focus on it. Let's suppose he got fired because he didn't move the furniture properly.",
  "Well, it could or couldn't be. I mean, I mean if the legislator, the Senator, says, I think relevant to my dismissal of this individual is the individual's performance that revealed itself in a speech or debate that I gave in the House, and if that's relevant, then why isn't that the end of the case, they can't bring it?",
  "Well, all he'd have to say is it's relevant to my decision to fire the person. Now, surely a jury or whoever -- it's probably a jury matter, I guess, on this -- is entitled to take that into account. If it's something the jury is entitled to take into account, you are questioning what that Senator did in the speech or debate and you are questioning it in another place, namely, a court.",
  "Can we go back a step. I just -- you said this is appealable and your reason for it being appealable was because the statute itself - - you said it was not appealable and the reason not is because the statute itself said that this has to be applied consistent with the Speech or Debate Clause?",
  "That's your reason. So I take it, what about the reason that's been given, that this is an as-applied challenge instead of on its face? What about that as a reason for it not being appealable?",
  "No, no, no, I'm not asking about the argument you are making. I want to ask about an argument you aren't making, that the reason -- I'll ask about the one you are making in a second. The reason I want to know about -- I want to know about the other possible reason for not being appealed, namely that this is as applied and not on its face. They don't strike down any provision. What's your view about that one?",
  "That is correct. And what you do about this case, what is it, Eichman?",
  "So then a holding of a district court in your opinion, the holdings say, imaginary, is that no one who actually works in an office of a Senator and who ever worked on any matter having to do with legislation falls within this Act because that would violate the speech and debate clause. That would be quite major in its implication. But you're saying there is no appeal on that because it's as applied.",
  "Does that mean if I go to your argument -- I mean, the problem with your argument it seems to me is that that leaves no room for this appellate provision at law, because the only reason that anything is likely to be unconstitutional in this area, at least 99 percent of it, would be Speech or Debate Clause violation. So in that interpretation of the statute there is no direct appeal, or hardly ever.",
  "Is this right? If I have it -- I'm using sort of a silly example to explain it to myself. But I'm thinking the FDA -- or no, the Agriculture Department decides they're really interested in red apples not being red. So they say we hire thousands of apple lookers, and the apple lookers look at all the apples and they devise a redness test which is really fabulous, you know, very precise.",
  "No. The FDA. The FDA has the apple looking redness test, and the apple lookers apply the test. And if you pass the test, you can say red apple, and if you don't pass the test you don't. Now I'll give you two different things that happen. One day because of budget cuts the FDA hires a lipstick company to look, because they're experts on redness; they know how to perform a test.",
  "The other possibility is they say to the apple companies, you do your own looking. Now I think there'd be the difference that you're trying to argue, and I don't think it cuts or you. Because in the first case, what they've done is hire somebody to perform a governmental function. In the second case, what they've done is to the people who are regulated and have the interest, in announcing they have red apples, they've said, you do it yourself.",
  "That wouldn't be relevant, because the -- the problem with the, with the approach that you're taking, as I see it, would be that, that there are probably a lot of instances where a regulated firm, the regulation meaning yes/no, market/not market; yes/no, advertise/not advertise, performs all kinds of tests to see if it is yes or no. And if you're going to start taking that kind of firm and breaking it apart to say whether it's doing the testing part or some other part, you're really opening the gates.",
  "All right. So what you are saying is that this function is so separable and it is so much a FTC function and it is so much like delegating it to the third party that did nothing of the testing, that even if you delegate it to the second party which does testing and then benefits from the testing, that's still not enough to take it out.",
  "Is that -- have I got that right?",
  "No. But I -- so, so to use my silly example, I mean, it is like the lipstick company. You're saying, well if they did it to the lipstick company it would be clearly that they're the Government agent. And it is so technical, so governmental, so heavily involved with the Government for testing, that even though you give it to the apple growers themselves, they are still Government agents when they perform it.",
  "I, I see the argument now.",
  "Then is there any, any authority ever, that you found for that?",
  "I have a quick question. Is there anything in the complaint that alleges you didn't perform the tests properly?",
  "Is it the apple institute who's doing the testing?",
  "No, I said apple institute. You know, that seemed to me to be the case where it was the apple institute or whatever it was that was the delegate, and then they applied the test, and the people they were applying the test to weren't.",
  "How could you tell? I rather liked the one - -",
  "I rather liked the one we had before about Senator Faircloth, and his ad was, Senator Faircloth is against the trial lawyers and their efforts to increase liability laws, so write him. Now, testimony all over the place. That is the advocacy candidate ad of the century. And you couldn't possibly know that without having known that one of the parties had spent millions trying to paint Faircloth's opponent, Senator Edwards, as the creature of the trial lawyers, that anyone -- that anyone in North Carolina knew it. So they read those words and they understand precisely what's at stake. They're saying vote against Edwards, vote for Faircloth. You just tell me how anyone could know such a thing without looking at the context.",
  "I thought people offered to bring in such facts as -- there was a web site address here. It says, indeed oddly, don't phone the Senator. Go look at the web site. And if you look at that web site, it says defeat him, defeat him, defeat him. I mean, that sounds as if they have defeat in mind. So certainly, there are about four or five things which they said to look at outside the four corners. So I'm not certain what it is in the law that says that you only look to the four corners. I mean, I read the opinion below. Did you read it, by the way, the 1,000-page opinion? I bet you did, the 1,000-page opinion of the district court?",
  "Good. Then you know like I know, and it took me a week, and it probably took you less, but you know what that record was like in the case, don't you?",
  "Thousands and thousands of pages that as I read it, I drew one conclusion. The one conclusion was if there's a law, and it's a good law under the Constitution, if it is, that corporations and labor unions cannot give money to political campaigns. And if it is true, as it is true, that what political campaigns are about now is television. And if it is true, as it is true, that these are the single lion's share, the single best way to get somebody defeated or elected, then if you open the gates and say corporations and rich givers or whatever can contribute by writing these ads and paying for them, forget the first two premises. Forget the rule that says corporations can't contribute. Now, I put all that in front of you. It seems to me what you're asking for is for us to overturn McConnell and to say either in practice or in theory, McCain-Feingold campaign finance law is unconstitutional.",
  "And you are asking for nothing else.",
  "I agree with you it's exactly as Justice Scalia said. If we agree with you in this case, good-bye McCain-Feingold. Maybe we should do it up front. That's what you advocate. Very well. Would you address that? Why should this Court only a year or two after it upholds McCain-Feingold, accept a position that either in fact or in theory overturns that case?",
  "But that's, that's the point, because where I get into my chain. You have an argument. I'm not denying that. I understand it. But it's sort for me deja vu all over again. We've heard it.",
  "And what happened before - - either you can distinguish this, which I don't see how frankly, or you're back into the chain, and if you want to say one more thing about the chain, I didn't draw it to the final ending there, if I take most of the ads - - and that's what that Kollar-Kotelly opinion is about. That's what that 1,000-page record is about. That's what the 10,000 pages of testimony were about. That's what McCain-Feingold was about, and all those witnesses. They said in today's world these are the kinds of ads people run just to defeat people. And then they said, moreover, most of the campaign money goes on them. And then they said, moreover, if you let corporations and labor unions contribute to these, well, then they can contribute to the campaign. And the only thing I left out before was, if you're prepared to say the Constitution the Constitution requires us to let corporations and unions buy these kinds of ads, well, how could it be constitutional to have a statute that forbids them to contribute directly to the candidate, something that's been in existence only since I guess 1904? But how could that be constitutional if they can just give this money directly? Why can't they give this same money to the candidate?",
  "Is that right? I mean, 1,000 is what we have here, is we happen to have three criteria, absolutely clear: Does it mix the candidate? Does it run within 30 or 60 days before the election? And is it targeted to an electorate? Now, that's clear. Now, if you're prepared to say that's unclear, I don't understand it, you don't need a 1,000-page record about that. All you need is a record where you have your organization to come in and show how yours is significant different from the mine run of cases. What's the problem?",
  "Oh, yes. Yes, I see you could distinguish.",
  "In fact this isn't the First Amendment totally on one side. Isn't this, isn't this a case where the courts held that there are very significant constitutional interests on both sides of the equation, which is what makes this kind of thing difficult. Isn't that so?",
  "I'm just suggesting why a pure First Amendment test doesn't necessarily answer the question and why we've upheld McCain-Feingold.",
  "The theory is that the ad itself on the web site, in your opinion, would have been okay? You turn to the web site three months before the election. It says 16 times out of 16 in the past two years, Feingold and Kohl have voted to filibuster certain of the President's nominees. Feingold and Kohl are putting politics into the court system, creating gridlock and costing taxpayers money. Now three months before the election you put -- write that in your ad. Now, is that in your opinion constitutionally protected, gets it out of McCain-Feingold?",
  "Yes. What you did, suppose instead of what you ran, you know, in a broadcast ad.",
  "You think that is protected?",
  "What about an exception if, in fact, the school district admits that they can't do anything for this child?",
  "But they have (b). What about (b)? See look, there are two situations. Situation (a) is that the school district thinks they can give them a good education, adequate. Then he should go and try it out, and if by the way the school district just can't do it, then (b). So what's been wrong with that scheme? Why doesn't that cover the waterfront?",
  "Just the language -- the language.",
  "The language plus the fact that nobody can think of a reason for putting that in there, unless that's the - -",
  "But my question was what about (b)? My question was not to argue with you. My question was, why doesn't (b) take care of the examples of absurd situations, law situations that you've mentioned?",
  "The case where the school district just can't do it.",
  "If they just can't do it then their job is to put the kid in a district - -",
  "-- in a place that can do it. And if their argument, which is your case, is it they object to the facility, then have an argument about that, about whether it should be this private school or that private school. That's what it seems to me your case is about, and that's why I think B.",
  "(b), that's my question, (b). I thought you were right. Until I heard that. Then I suddenly hear no, that don't worry about it, judge, is what I heard, because in the situation where the school district has not provided there is another section of the statute that takes care of the child. That's what I want to hear your response to.",
  "The basis is that that would be the end of the Guidelines. I mean, that - - every judge has his own view of policy and there is a vast range. No point having advice -- I mean, fine, but I don't think this Court said it, and I think that the test is supposed to be reasonableness, and I think 3553(a) does have a lot of instructions, and one of the major thrusts is follow the Guidelines. It doesn't make them mandatory. But they're in there. All right, so the problem for me is just what Justice Alito was saying: Is there a path here between saying, well, judge, leaving everything special about your case out of it -- we're only talking about a judge who says there's nothing special about my case - - I disagree with the policy of the commission. In such a case, is there a choice between saying that no matter what the commission says, the court of appeals must insist that their district judges follow in terms of a policy; and the opposite, which is to say they don't have to do anything that the commission says, because the commission is always choosing among reasonable choices. Very rarely -- maybe you have one in this case -- but very rarely is it totally unreasonable. How do we thread the channel?",
  "To the extent that it's reasonable, and where we're talking about individual cases we've already said, given the history of our legal system, it's very reasonable to give lots of discretion to the district judge. Now we're talking about what's reasonable in the context of 3553(a); and I don't think Booker says one way or the other on that, nor I do believe Rita says one way or the other.",
  "Driven by a Congress that wrote guidelines; and at the last minute, in a separate matter that we've taken out and wasn't put in the initial draft added the word \"mandatory.\" So the history of 3553(a) is a history of a statute that is seeking uniformity through guidelines. At least that's my view of it. And for purposes of the question, which is an important question to me, let's assume that.",
  "In other words, I'm assuming now you have not -- you don't have a good answer to my question. You're saying either we have to make it unconstitutional, which I don't think they are, or you have to say anything goes, and that my question has no answer in your view?",
  "Well, that's because of the cliff. But the cliff is undoubledly a negative, but the cliff is not as important as sometimes suggested, for the numbers after all, which relate punishment to amounts of drug, reflect, (a), more seriousness than what you have -- I mean more people likely to take it - - but also the role that the person is likely to play in the organization, high or low, and the likelihood that he is or this -- these groups of people are big deal offenders or not, and many other things. Therefore, a system that really is basically flat or only rises slowly until you get to the cliff, and then it again rises slowly to the next rise, is not an irrational system. It depends on what those other correlations are. I say that because suppose a judge, noticing the horrendous effects of this -- that the commission itself has listed and understanding that cliffs are not the end-all and the be-all of Guidelines that are rough correlations, suppose a judge said: My system, which we have before us, which doesn't have the absolute numerical progression, is far more reasonable than the commission's system. There it is. He's reviewed the commission's policy. Well, Rita says sometimes courts could. And so what is the law that forbids the judge from doing that, at least on occasion?",
  "No, because Congress has nowhere said that you can't have cliffs. You see, Congress could say, our rough judgment is that 5 Gs of hard -- of crack really is kind of a correlation with a medium-level gang, and 50 Gs is probably a correlation with a fairly high-level gang. And what has Congress actually thought about this? Nothing. They never thought about it. So I can't find an instruction there that tells the commission that they can't do it this way.",
  "They wanted to abolish the whole thing.",
  "Why? Why? That's my question. Everyone's assuming that \"consistent with the statute\" means a sentencing system that's smooth without cliffs. And I'm sure every mathematician would agree with you, but I'm not at all certain that prosecutors and defendants who have actual experience in this would agree with you, because there are lots of arguments that it's perfectly consistent with the objective of the stat tute to have a few cliffs.",
  "If Congress passes a statute that says the mandatory minimum sentence of eight years for possessing a 12-inch shotgun unlawfully, does that mean it wants four years for a 6-inch shotgun?",
  "At the cliff. But, of course, I've been through -- I hope not being hypnotized by numbers myself -- that these numbers reflect underlying realities that are far closer to the shotgun case than you are prepared to admit.",
  "What in your opinion is supposed to happen if we have Guidelines, a part of 3553(a), a part of it -- voluntary or not, they're referred to, so -- and I understand how you would deal with this. If the district judge's sentence rests upon his view of the facts, the appeals court is supposed to say it's the district judge that counts here.",
  "I can understand if it's a question of judgment, a matter of judgment about this case the court of appeals is supposed to say: District judge, it's your view that matters here. Now, the difficult matter is, suppose that this district judge says: I don't approve of the way Guidelines treat a certain class of people and I am going to have a different sentence because I don't like what they do. And now there are several situations: one, different from his fellow judges in the same court; two, different from other judges across the country; three, different from what the Guidelines did initially; four, different from what the Guidelines say after the commission has over and over and over reconsidered the same matter. All right, that I find difficult and I'd like your view.",
  "Wait, wait, wait, wait. I think what you're saying is that -- which is the subject of the next case, really - -",
  "But I want to know your view of it. Too. I want to know your view of it, too, because what I want to figure out here by the end of today is what are the words that should be written in your opinion by this Court that will lead to considerable discretion on part of the district judge but not totally, not to the point where the uniformity goal is easily destroyed. That's what I'm asking your view on, and I'd like your view and the SG's view and everyone else who's arguing today.",
  "This is exactly the kind of case, though, that I think would give tremendous discretion to the district judge. Because, as I just listened to you, you are listing a whole lot of features of it that are very case-specific, that require thorough knowledge of fact and thorough knowledge of the kind of judgment, a kind of individualized judgment, that sentencing judges are supposed to do. And that's what's worrying me about the test that the circuit court gives here. It lumps together things like what you just talked about with other things like: I don't agree with the policy of the guideline, itself. And this is a typical case and, therefore, I think we should look to try to find ways to unpack the sentence that it used, the statement -- you know, the worse it is, the worse the harder you look, et cetera, because that doesn't tell us much at all. It suggests a proportionate test, mathematical, which must be wrong. It must be wrong because the same degree of departure could result from a view of an abuse of a vulnerable victim as could result from a total misunderstanding of what robbery is about. Now, it's not the percentage there that matters. It's the rationale. It is what the judge did. And can you unpack it? We just did in the last discussion try to unpack that, and we continue in the next case to try to do it. What we want -- I think what we want -- is to interpret that word \"reasonable\" so that we get back to a situation where judges do depart when they have something unusual and maybe occasionally when they think the guideline wasn't considered properly, and then the iterative process takes over, going back to the commission. Now, how do we get there?",
  "So, on that ground I understand perfectly, and were we to write that into a paragraph in the opinion, this case still, would it not, be the strongest case imaginable for discretion to the district judge?",
  "You did, but I wanted to know what you were going to say.",
  "Why isn't that always true? A judge should always give reasons commensurate with the problem. So what if we added by saying remember give reasons commensurate with the problem? I see something we've lost. What we've lost is we've sort of pulled across the screen here a rather murky curtain called \"something of a presumption,\" which we can't quite define, which will lead to lawyers making endless arguments about whether this murky curtain -- they're on one side of it or the other. So let's sweep its aside. Let's get to the underlying facts.",
  "That's correct.",
  "We were making progress? I thought our last discussion -- we were making progress on this very point, where we have the judgmental matters, the fact finding matters, and the pure policy matters, and we distinguished the latter from the first two? If you were a district judge, wouldn't you find it more enlightening to talk in those terms?",
  "I've got that point, but what is your suggestion as to how to deal with what is underlying disturbing me and it seems like a lot of others, if prima facie Congress did not intend that you launder money where the activity is an essential part of the underlying crime itself? And there are three ways of dealing with that: One is this gross receipts method, which has the defects you mentioned. The second is a definition of \"promotion\" which says when you promote a crime that's different from engaging in the crime. And the third is sentencing; because it's a real offense sentencing method and where what you've done is nothing more than the underlying crime, the sentence should be nothing more than the underlying crime. I see three ways to get to the same problem, and you're asking us to decide them piecemeal, yet they're related. What do I do?",
  "But still your answer leaves me -- and I have no answer to this; I want yours. I want you to see that I'm in -- at risk here as a judge of getting whipsawed, that I first decide this case for you; and the next case, all kinds of arguments appear that I hadn't thought of; and then the third case, again. But if I could have them somehow together, I could look at the least evil way or the most efficient way of achieving the congressional objective.",
  "I have it in front of me actually. I was looking at it. And it seems to me what it assumes is that the underlying offense is different from the money laundering. And do you have any rationale at all as to why this individual, if it's true that he did nothing more than engage in the underlying offense, why should he receive one day more than 60 months?",
  "The question is can you violate the statute by financial transactions which - - have you promoted the crime, when those transactions are no more than part of the crime itself? That's basically the question. And I think Justice Kennedy is asking if, in fact, we wanted to reach that question, is this a case in which we could do it, through reargument or in some other way?",
  "And was it raised in the court below?",
  "The theory of this, I take it, is that, just as you said, voters elect convention delegates, and those convention delegates choose the official nominee, say, of the Democratic Party. So that nominee goes on to the final ballot.",
  "Well, what then of the fact that the convention delegates when they meet won't let people who would like the position of the judge appear before them?",
  "It's not?",
  "Well then, how are the delegates to find out the qualifications? In other words, if that's the intent of this statute, then you have a statute that's designed on the one hand to have convention delegates who will choose, and on the other hand to prevent the convention delegates from finding out the qualifications of the different applicants, in which case it would seem to be a statute that would give the actual power of selection to the leader or the chairman -- I forget the title -- of the Democratic Party. And I don't know about the constitutionality of that or not. In other words, go ahead.",
  "Well, if you're not sure, it's difficult - -",
  "Why? I mean I don't see how you avoid answering Justice Stevens's hypothetical? The reason I think you have to answer it is because the New York system is the system he described in the hypothetical, with a safety valve.",
  "The safety valve being that the party leaders cannot just choose anybody. I mean, if it looks they're going to choose something really nutty, then there will be opposition to these delegates and something will happen.",
  "So they have leeway, but you can't go too far.",
  "You don't like that. That's why I say you have to answer it. If you feel that that's so terrible, then you say no, the Constitution forbids that, though you'd have to explain, wouldn't you, why, with all its faults, that is not better in the judgment of New York than a system where people raise $4 million from the lawyers in order to run for office?",
  "What do you have besides the linguistic argument? I mean, when I start out, I can't think of a reason why Congress wouldn't want to penalize the buyer, not the seller. We are dealing with a statute that does catch your client, if they had only charged him with the right part. But no one in his right mind would ever rely on a ruling in your favor to actually engage in such a transaction, since it would violate the statute in 15 different ways. I exaggerate, but you see the point. So you have a linguistic argument which people are -- you're right, I think, in saying it's awkward but not impossible. And, therefore, awkward but not impossible; we create an anomaly in the law. I can't think of a reason why to do it. So what else do you have?",
  "And sometimes we try to - -",
  "I don't want to put you in a whipsaw here.",
  "Sometimes policy seems relevant, too, to figure out what Congress wanted. But let me go back to the question I had, which is do you want to us overturn Smith? Are you asking that, because I could understand it more easily if you said, look, both sides of the transaction should be treated alike, but they should be both outside the word \"use.\"",
  "But he receives the gun and it could have been loaded. And if it was loaded, you receive a loaded gun, and you're there and you give the money for the gun and you have the gun and somebody comes up, maybe you'll shoot him. I mean, that seems like a risk.",
  "I thought Bailey involved a guy, he had the gun in a locked thing in the trunk of his car, which is a little different from holding it in your hand.",
  "This is what -- this is what is bothering me about your side of this case. I start thinking this is a total fluke. Normally, you would charge him under \"possession in furtherance of,\" which you didn't for reasons I don't know. Or he would be an accessory, which he isn't here because the other side was a government agent. So we've got a fluke. Now, if I accept your linguistic approach, I don't know what I'm getting into. Imagine an artillery team. One loads the ammunition; the other pulls the trigger. We say the team used the ammunition, but the guy who pulled the trigger by himself didn't. Think of a baseball team. The pitcher doesn't use the bat, but the team does. Now, if I take your linguistic approach, where am I in respect to other statutes? But if I deny your linguistic approach on the ground that it's unnatural to say \"use\" of the -- the individual used it, all I've done is create a fluke case because it will never come up again.",
  "But those are all examples that I used the gun to pay for the item. You don't use the word \"use\" when you're the seller. It doesn't fit.",
  "Is -- is there any reason in such a case, if you lost this case, in the future could you not just charge, as Justice Alito said, that they're a principal in the possession by the seller?",
  "If the government is not involved? And if the government's involved on the other side, I guess you'd have to charge an attempt.",
  "And so your -- your practical argument then is that there has been considerable reliance on your interpretation to the extent that many people have been convicted under it. How many?",
  "About? About? Have any rough idea?",
  "I thought - -",
  "I thought the question - - and I apologize if I'm not paraphrasing it because I have my own. This has arisen frequently. Brussels has a treaty, and that treaty binds all the member nations, and supreme courts of various nations have come up against this problem: What would happen if the Brussels court or the EU court insists under the treaty that we do something that violates our own Constitution? I think this is an example of that. And the answer typically has been: Well, we'd follow our own Constitution, at least if it was a violation, what the EU said, of fundamental human rights or destroyed some basic structural part of our Constitution. And the question that I would have is, doesn't that kind of approach -- not exactly but that kind of approach -- satisfy whatever problem there is in this respect here?",
  "If the ICJ were to do something which it had never done, like, say, put everybody in jail for 50 years -- I don't know that there is such a thing -- but suppose they did, if they did, I guess that might violate something basic in our Constitution, in which case we wouldn't enforce it.",
  "If we took that approach - -",
  "Maybe you could spend a minute explaining that, because, as I read the Constitution, it says all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every State -- I guess it means including Texas - -",
  "-- shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. Now, as I understand it, the United States entered into a treaty. That treaty said we will follow the interpretations and the judgments of the International Court of Justice in respect to the Vienna Convention. And that Court did make a judgment in that respect, in respect to this client, and it said: Our judgment is that Texas, or someone in the United States, must redo the procedural hearing simply to see whether, in deciding whether there's prejudice or whether there's a procedural default, full account is taken of the importance of the Vienna rights. That's what we're talking about. It's a judgment of the court. The United States has promised to follow that judgment of the court. The Constitution says, since it promised by treaty, that is the law; and the law binds the States. That may be simple-minded, but I'd like to hear what the answer to that, rather, chain of logic is -- chain of law.",
  "I was not talking - -",
  "-- about the President's memorandum at the moment. And to be -- to disclose fully what I'm thinking, I'm thinking that maybe if a president disagreed in such a thing, some kind of a question -- I'm not sure what -- would be presented. But whatever \"what,\" I don't worry about that \"what\" here, because the President, too, agrees.",
  "No, forget whether we recognize it this way as a judgment. I'm saying we promised in the treaty to follow that thing. Call it whatever name you want. We promised to follow that thing, which I have in front of me -- excerpts of which -- called an Avena something. And we know what that says. I'm just looking to see what they call it. They call it -- well, you tell me what they call it. They call it -- it is not called the word \"judgment.\" It's called: \"The appropriate reparation in this case consists of the obligation of the United States to\" - - and then they listed it. So I take it we have promised to carry out that obligation by treaty.",
  "What are the words that the Senate said? Because, when you say \"self-executing,\" the easiest way for me to understand that is the Constitution means what it says. But there happened to be a few instances where the nature of the obligation or the intent of the party makes it very difficult to enforce it as a binding judgment of a court. That is not this case.",
  "Oh, and so if they did that, now, will you quote the words or give me the reference where the Senate said: Although we entered into this and although we ratify it, we're not going to do it - -",
  "-- unless you - -",
  "Fine. Then, are you saying there are -- there are 112, I believe, treaties in which we've entered into promises that we're going to follow what an international tribunal said. Somebody looked up, I saw on the Internet, that at this moment there are approximately 116 regulatory entities in the world where we've entered, or others have entered into, regimes, where there are various adjudicatory tribunals of different kinds, mostly commercial, that bind us. And is your view: All of these thousands, perhaps, or hundreds, anyway, of treaties are unlawful, and that our promises are not enforceable, because there's a constitutional question?",
  "No. No. I'm thinking that are self- executing. I'm thinking that there are - - like WTO, NAFTA. We can go down a long list of instances where the United States has promised to follow the decisions of tribunals that are not Article III courts and to put them into effect at once.",
  "And I wonder, without further ado, now, are you saying that all those are unconstitutional?",
  "\"Yes\" or \"no\"? I'd appreciate a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer.",
  "Okay.",
  "I'm sorry. What I don't understand about this is that I thought that the ICJ in this case interpreted the treaty. That's not Federal law. That's the treaty. And it said that the treaty - -",
  "Oh, then I don't understand you because the WTO interprets a treaty. It interprets a treaty that binds the United States, just like the ICJ is interpreting a treaty that binds the United States. So what's the difference?",
  "Maybe these other nations have an inquisitorial system where an investigating judge collects a dossier and the fact is noted in the dossier and the investigating judge and the prosecution give it such weight as it's entitled to.",
  "You know that doesn't happen?",
  "In an - -",
  "Of course it matters. But the -- of course it matters. That's why when I read the -- the ICJ opinion, I read it as saying that they're not telling you to set aside a procedural default rule. What they've asked you to do is to provide, by means of the United States' own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences by taking account of the violation of rights. And throughout they ask -- when you decided whether the person was really prejudiced, when you decided whether there had been forfeiture of the rights, at that time, did you ask yourself that the reason he might not have raised them was because he knew nothing about them and his lawyer knew nothing about them, because nobody ever told either about them? In which case there might be a causal connection. As I read it, the ICJ left all that up to you but just asked you, please, look at it again having read our opinion and keeping this in mind.",
  "And how does the WTO differ?",
  "How does the WTO and NAFTA and all our trade agreements differ?",
  "If you assume it is self-executing, just for one second, I'd like to find out -- you said that the President was unreasonable in a sense of saying Texas do that over again - - I assume the reason he asked Texas to have the hearing is because the ICJ knew -- and I guess maybe he knew -- that the only hearing they'd had on this subject -- as far as I can see; I looked at it, there didn't seem to be any evidence in respect to their finding that there was no prejudice. They said well, he had a lawyer, but that lawyer later got into quite a lot of trouble, I think.",
  "He had two lawyers. One got into trouble, and the other didn't?",
  "Okay, they vigorously defended him.",
  "Fine. Fine. My point is there's no evidence of that.",
  "There is? In the first habeas hearing?",
  "I read the whole thing.",
  "What I'm thinking of is the evidence at the first habeas hearing that led the district judge to reach his conclusion that there was no prejudice and that the procedural default was not excused -- it's in that hearing that I didn't see what that finding was based on; and I suppose the reason that the President wanted Texas to do it is it would be easiest for Texas to go back to that.",
  "It was in the first hearing.",
  "So you think there was no reason for the ICJ to ask the President - -",
  "And what did happen to the lawyers Texas gave him?",
  "Can I ask you -- I find it difficult -- I'm finding it difficult to follow the exact language on page 4a of the appendix, of (b)(1)(C). To you, that's probably the key provision, right? And that's in the blue brief. And catch me when I read it wrong, if I do. As I -- as I see it, it says -- and here it says \"a clearing organization.\" That's what we are interested in here, the clearing organization.",
  "Now, a clearing organization that doesn't enforce a bylaw properly or a rule or reg properly, which is what you're saying happened?",
  "The clearing organization got all mixed and it all - -",
  "Now, they're liable for actual damages to a person who engaged in a transaction in a contract market. That's what it says. And the contract market is the futures exchange.",
  "Not the clearing organization.",
  "And they're liable to that person for the actual losses that resulted from his transaction in the futures exchange --- as such transaction.",
  "So what your claim -- they were caused by the failure of the clearinghouse to follow its rules.",
  "If they just read that, we have a case where the clearing organization didn't follow its rules the -- my client engaged in a transaction over the futures exchange.",
  "And it was caused harm because the clearing organization didn't follow its rules. You say that's what it says.",
  "And that's what happened?",
  "Did I understand that correctly?",
  "Clearing organization.",
  "I know, but then the response I'm going to ask them is, so what?",
  "I know you're going to - - but I - -",
  "Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're going to be more favorable to this than I expect your opponent. I mean, there is nothing really linguistically or otherwise wrong if you had a statute that said people in the badminton court have to play carefully. And if they hurt somebody on the merry-go-round, they are liable. And so people in the contract market have to play carefully, and if they have hurt somebody over at the futures exchange, they are liable. But it says those people in the futures exchange are people who engage in a transaction on the futures exchange.",
  "And so they said well, by odd fluke of fate, your clients didn't. It was the - - rather, their client who actually went into the futures exchange and bought the commodity. Your point, I take it, is -- well that's true, but my client did something, he guaranteed that commodity transaction in accordance with the rules of the futures exchange, and that's what makes him a player in the futures exchange.",
  "He - -",
  "He guaranteed through the clearinghouse the payment of the contract made on the futures exchange - -",
  "-- which he didn't make, but he guaranteed it.",
  "He made it.",
  "He didn't walk on to the floor and make it. It was his client who walked on to the floor and said whatever. Is that right?",
  "So they had to pick it up in an hour.",
  "Fine. So therefore any transaction wouldn't happen in your hypothetical, because if I understand it correctly -- the buyer and the seller, who by the way are normally represented by clearing-houses by Klein, or by brokers like Klein, but in this case apparently they weren't -- they make the transaction in the pit and then the rules of the exchange say that the clearing-house has to pick it up, a clearing member within one hour, and at that point that person -- the clearing member, the broker, I guess, this Klein type person -- becomes legally responsible for seeing that the money is put up. Now, it doesn't require a big stretch -- in fact, zero stretch, of the word transaction, to think that word transaction covers that entire process. From the moment -- and by the way the whole process is governed by the rules of the futures exchange -- so there are rules in there. So why do you -- what reason is there for taking that word transaction, cutting out about two-thirds of the important event, ignoring the fact that it is covered by the rule of the future exchange, and limiting it to the physical moment when somebody enters the pit in an unusual case and says \"I buy for\" -- and then another person says \"I sell for\"?",
  "That's true, but is there any reason that the word \"transaction\" would have - - serves a purpose by being so limited?",
  "What -- what Congress would Congress have wanted to do that?",
  "That's not a reason. I want to know what reason, what harm will be done if in fact we take the word \"transaction\" and say the word \"transaction,\" while it's capable of the interpretation you give, is also capable of an interpretation that includes all the near contemporaneous events, including the financing and guarantees? Like a mortgage in selling a house.",
  "And that also is linguistically possible. What harm will be done - -",
  "-- if the second is chosen and not the first?",
  "I got that.",
  "I got that when you said there were two. What's the second?",
  "Do you actually have any information about the early 1940s, about who was a Federal law enforcement officer? I think the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons -- there were a lot of people being detained. There were goods that were having to do with contraband, foreign goods, maybe domestic, things you weren't supposed to have, food stamps. Illegal rations -- OPA -- I mean, you know, there were, you were only supposed to have so much food. Have we any notion who other law enforcement officers might have applied to at that time?",
  "I think the FBI had quite a big job in World War II.",
  "I thought there were thousands and thousands and thousands of FBI people.",
  "So do we know? I'm getting from you that you don't know and I don't know. Is that right?",
  "We don't even have a ballpark.",
  "Well, well that might be. But I'm sitting in Congress, I read this statute, I think maybe they were talking about customs people and the like. Now, there is this other word in there, that's true. So we look up, where does the other word come from? The other word comes from Judge Holtzoff. He explained it, we don't have to guess. We can read his explanation. His explanation comes in a paragraph having to do with customs and excise, and beginning with, I'm talking about customs and excise, and the additional proviso as special reference, where they use this phrase, and then he says it's all supposed to be like the Crown Proceedings Committee in England in 1927, which in fact had nothing to do with anybody but customs and excise.",
  "So -- so if it was not -- I mean, I would suspect at that time Judge Holtzoff was a pretty well known person in the legal community and I would suspected if we are guessing at such a thing that quite a few did know who he was. And I suspect that when Congress passes a technical bill, they are interested in the views of the Department of Justice and these were those views.",
  "So if we are going to play a magic game that we don't pay attention to what sheds light on it, fine, then we don't, but I would.",
  "But I think in reading that, I think that's a good point. My actual reading of it, of that paragraph 2, is that it's not free of ambiguity. I completely agree with you. And if I read through it, then I'm making up my mind as a judge, well, how do I feel about what these words likely show and how people in Congress would have interpreted that kind of reference or statement in testimony by a person who thought this? Free of ambiguity, I agree with you, it isn't. But it might cut somewhat more in favor of the Petitioners than the Respondents.",
  "Have you -- have you found any -- any research on that? I mean I think that's a very interesting point that -- that -- have you found any book I could look at or report that -- that would cast some light on whether at that time, 1946, the phrase \"other law enforcement officers\" referred to a large number of people who had a lot of different tasks that had not much to do with customs or excise? If so, this would be an odd way of sneaking them into the bill. That's who it would look like. On the other hand, if there were just a few of them, well, then, the bill, at worst, is a little bit more than somebody might have thought; and it would appear perfectly normal to a legislator. So is -- is there anything to look at?",
  "Indeed, it is covered by the statute because I read your brief as saying that the statute applies only in instances where either you're trying to sell it or trade it. That is what you're trying -- now it seems to me a different matter if it's covering only -- covering as well instances where somebody's simply showing it to someone else to show him what he got in the mail. Well, I'd appreciate clarity on that.",
  "If that's covered by the statute, what you're going to do then is suddenly criminalize what could be an awful lot of activity that goes on in schools all over the place and somebody has -- they think it's funny, and maybe it isn't funny, but they think it is and it's kind of school-boy behavior, and they're showing this stuff around, not totally certain what it is. Suddenly that can become a Federal crime. Seems like quite an extension. And I thought you'd written your way out of that problem, and now I think you haven't.",
  "All right. Then take it as that.",
  "Take it as that. I would say looking and presenting to schoolmates dirty pictures is a fairly common adolescent and post-adolescent activity. And I would suspect a very high-level percentage of that class of people don't examine too carefully what the age of the individuals depicted is, and many might misrepresent what that age is. So this sounds like a statute that has enormous reach, whereas previously I thought it hadn't.",
  "But none of those -- I mean, we've gone through this with the Solicitor General. He went through every example in his brief that you've been able to produce, and he said they aren't caught by the statute. What's wrong with what he said? Why isn't that so?",
  "Photographers, for example. That's not child pornography. And if it was, they would have to act -- if it is child pornography under Ferber, it isn't protected. If it isn't child pornography under Ferber, well, then there's no problem. Okay. That's their view of the photographers. And the same with Amazon, the same with Netflix.",
  "Problem with Ferber, you said. Same problem.",
  "So what's your response to what he said? It is the -- with possession. You possess these materials. What you are trying to do is take them to the police and stop them. Under Ferber, is that protected or not? If it is protected, as I think it would be, so is it here.",
  "Then under Ferber he's going to go right to jail because he has them. I would think it would be protected. I can't imagine somebody who collects, on these sites where they are molesting children, material to prevent children being molested and presents it to the proper authority is going to be prosecuted under the New York statute in Ferber.",
  "Suppose we did this? What would you think about an opinion, and why, which says the following? We take every one of those examples and all the ones listed here and put them in appendix A, and the opinion says this is the Solicitor General's interpretation of the statute, as amended, say with the word presentment, which comes out of promotion infer, and we think under that interpretation of the statute, none of these things, nor anything like them, could be prosecuted. And if so understood, we can find no example, at least none not present in Ferber itself, where this would be overbroad. Therefore, it is constitutional. I'm not saying that is my view. I am saying simply I want to know your opinion about what would be wrong with such an opinion.",
  "Of course, the point of the -- the point of the appendix, which unfortunately has the failing of many charming metaphors, is that it has acquired a life of its own.",
  "It distracts from the question. But it -- as I read the Solicitor General's interpretation of the statute, and amended it, taking the word \"presentment\" from its context in Ferber, where it was part of the definition of promotion, I thought that was the appendix. At least, that's my hypothetical question. And so whether you like appendices or don't like appendices, you could focus on why isn't it the appendix I'm talking about? He's filled it with qualifications using the words \"knowingly, reasonable,\" and a context that if it is not purely commercial, as I understood, is at least commercial plus a few things such as bartering. That was really my question, and you've come back to American Beauty and so forth, and if there's one thing I think his definition keeps out of this discussion, it is American Beauty and Traffic, because I don't see under his interpretation how anyone could conceivably be prosecuted even if he's talking to a group who have never seen a movie. That isn't a reasonable group of people. So what is your response to what he said?",
  "The question I have is, to go back, you said two separate things. One is you say the question here is a matter of Federal law. I'll give you that. It's a matter of Federal law. But the question is, what's the content of the Federal law? Does the Federal law say to the States -- State, in a collateral review proceeding, you want to apply Crawford retroactively to people whose convictions were long ago, do it, we don't care? And a lot of Teague says that should be the Federal rule, if it's called a Federal rule. But then you said a different thing, in answer to Justice Stevens. The different thing was but the substantive rule of Crawford only takes effect as of the day of Crawford and into the future. Now, on that position, or take any other date you want as one year earlier or whatever you're going to pick there, if you're right about that, you win. But how could you be right about what I call there a metaphysical point? Because on the metaphysics, as Justice Souter just pointed out, imagine three people who have three identical trials each one year before Crawford. The first person is called Crawford, and he wins. The second person is called Smith, and he's delayed forever in the appeals process. And the third person is called Jones, and he get a quick appeal, convicted, in jail at the time of Crawford. Now we know that the first two Crawford applies to, but metaphysically, if the law of Crawford was the law at the time of the first two trials, why wasn't it the law in terms of what the rights are in respect to the third person whose trial was held at precisely the same time?",
  "I agree with that.",
  "You've adopted Justice Scalia's approach through your silence, and I'd ask you whether -- whether -- whether there isn't just a simpler explanation that doesn't require us to go into Spinonza, Immanuel Kant, or even Aristotle. And the simpler explanation would be simply what Justice Stevens started with, that Teague is about remedies, and that we assume that the law was the law at the time of Crawford's trial, at the time of Smith's trial, and at the time of Jones' trial. But Jones is knocked out because he went to habeas. And that's what Teague is about. Habeas. And, therefore, if the State wants to apply Crawford retroactively, let everybody out of jail, that's their problem. Or their virtue. That's up to them. That's where Justice Stevens started, and that's what I would like to hear an answer to.",
  "Let me take the other point here, which is Justice Scalia's, which I think I understand now. Imagine that the Crawford begins to take effect as of the day of decision. No law like Crawford before. But for practical reasons and reasons having to do with courts, we let certain people take advantage of it. We let person A take advantage of it, Mr. Crawford. We let person B take advantage of it, who is on direct appeal. We don't let people in habeas take advantage of it. Why don't we let the State take advantage of it in its collateral proceedings if the State wants to, for reasons of federalism, for reasons they can do what they want, for reasons if it is going to be the law in the future any way?",
  "The reason that they do that is because none of these methods comes even close to working out what the company is really worth because, if we had, we wouldn't be here. We'd be out in Wall Street. We'd make billions.",
  "All right. So they don't know, and they use all these different methods sort of as checks one on the other. Now, the railroad simply wants to say: Look, you had an expert here and he went and used a method, and it comes up with a certain number, but if you look at a few other methods, you'll see that's an outlier. Okay? Now, why shouldn't it be able to do that?",
  "They're not going to do that. The State has enormous leeway. Anyone who valued a railroad running through the center of this city, of what it would be worth if the property were sold on the private market, you'd get an astronomical number. So the chances of this number being higher than the sales value of private property is not great. So, if you've come in with some method that puts it higher than that, well, why shouldn't they be able to come in and say: Look, look what they've got with this method, which in our opinion is not a fair method. Now, why not? Because after all, if you're going to say they can't, then there is no check on the State working out a method that discriminates, as Justice Ginsburg said, seriously against the railroads.",
  "What they're going to do is they're simply going to let people present the evidence as you've heard, which will have 15 valuation methods if they want, all serving each as checks on the other. There's no single method. So why would you end up with that result?",
  "Suppose that you -- and I have the same hypothetical for both you and your brothers on the other side with some adjustment here, because I'm finding the case quite difficult. And the, the -- for you, imagine we have some milk producers in Kentucky. They are farmers. And they go to the legislature and they say, you know, we can sell a lot more milk in Kentucky if you will pass a law imposing a tax on Missouri farmers who want to ship milk into Kentucky. That's the classic unlawful -- all right. It's unlawful, unconstitutional, right.",
  "All right. Now, what is the difference if a city in Kentucky that wants to finance its schools says now to the legislature, we're going to find it easier to sell bonds in Kentucky or elsewhere, in Kentucky, for our school system if you'll only put a tax on similar bonds that Missouri is offering to finance their city schools? That will help, just like the milk. Now, what's the difference?",
  "We have consumers in the dairy products that are suffering loss. They're all the voters in the States. Everyone drinks milk.",
  "So they are suffering a dollar-for-dollar loss, because their milk becomes more expensive. I don't know if that's analogous. I think it's a pretty strong analogy. As to the first, that's of course the point that's worrying me. It is true that this is a public matter.",
  "Would it make a difference in the first case if it happened to be some dairy farmers who -- there are so few in Massachusetts now, unfortunately, that they all work on State-owned dairy farms that are put up for, you know -- does it make a difference?",
  "It would make a difference?",
  "Then of course you win as soon as we say the commodity is the same as milk. Obviously to me you would, but that's the issue. And in United Haulers what the question was, I thought, is if it is a traditional governmental function, anyway - - say, like producing electricity, or cleaning the streets -- there they discriminate and say you have to buy in State -- well, it's different, and indeed it may be okay. So what you've just heard your brother - - brother argue is if this is a fortiori, because here it's not even making electricity; it's not even collecting trash; it is financing the most basically governmental of all governmental institutions - - libraries, schools, streets. Now, why isn't it a fortiori from United Haulers, given the nature of the task that they are raising the money to finance?",
  "You're arguing -- but can a State do this? It produces a service or product; it sells the service or product to in-State people at a price 50 percent less than it sells to out-of-State people.",
  "No, no, you're saying if the State owns cement, it can sell 50 percent less to its in-State citizens than out-of-State?",
  "Fine. Then could it do this? Could it say that if you buy cement from out of State, the answer is no, right?",
  "All right. Suppose what they are selling is education? Can the University of California say that when you send your child to the University of California, you will get a thousand dollars back on your income tax. But if you send the child to an out-of-State school, you don't?",
  "Well if that's fine, then what they say is we sell you participation in the financing of the project.",
  "And if you buy -- we sell you the participation. It's called a bond, and if in fact you give the money to us, and you are in-State, you get a thousand dollars back. But if in fact, when you do the identical thing, and you buy a similar thing from out-of-State, you do not get the money back? How is that different from what you just said was okay in respect to the University of California?",
  "No, I'm sorry, then I wasn't clear in the hypothetical. The hypothetical was that you get a thousand-dollar rebate on your income tax. So I was trying to make it exactly like this case. You pay a lower State tax.",
  "Well, you have a perfectly good remedy in respect to that. If the States don't like this race to the bottom, they need only create a compact or go to Congress.",
  "You know, I was only -- I was only addressing your point that there was a practical problem. Insofar as there is a practical problem, it seems to me the States have a perfectly good remedy even if they lose this case.",
  "Or win the case, whatever.",
  "However.",
  "That argument cuts against you in context, I think. You're saying in every case of any kind of discrimination one could go to Congress. Absolutely right. And since that's true of every case, now we are back to the more basic question, leaving the practicalities that you were talking about out of it, of whether this case is more like the cows. Is it more like the garbage collection?",
  "Or is it on the far side of the garbage collection, even a stronger case for permission under the Commerce Clause?",
  "That's where I wanted you to begin.",
  "How do you suggest we write the opinion? If you were writing it and then a dissent, say, or someone or we read in the briefs that here is an absolute holding of the Supreme Court right on point, totally clear, says just exactly what the government says here, and it was codified in 1948, and now we say the reason, despite that, you win is?",
  "And if somebody says, well, the Court couldn't have been clearer as to what the statute meant, and Congress reenacted it in codifying it. So what do you want?",
  "I mean, what could be clearer? Are they supposed to actually -- in the recodification in 19 -- or is it that the recodification changed things or what?",
  "But even all those cases which you're going back to, what you're talking about, I think, in those cases is general statements in the case. The cases themselves, except possibly for that Franconia, which has a different problem because it was about accrual, the cases themselves don't involve this statute. It's simply general statements. I thought, and I'd like your response, that in this Court's opinion as in statutes, as in life. When people make general statements, they don't mean every possible situation in the universe; rather, there are always circumstances to which the statement doesn't apply. And so why don't we just read those statements as incorporating a prior explicit holding of the Court as inapplicable to that prior explicit holding? I mean, that's what you'd normally do with a sentence like that, isn't it?",
  "No, that isn't -- I don't think it's quite -- putting the argument as I understand it, you would say let's look at Irwin, and we read it, so it's in your mind. Now think of that set of statute of limitations, the Federal ones, the Government ones, that are either just as ambiguous as Irwin or even more ambiguous. Think of that set. Now, in Irwin the Court says in the absence of special circumstances that whole set is going to be interpreted as nonjurisdictional. That's what it says. So you say, well, what Irwin didn't talk about is suppose there's a member of that set where previously the Court had held it was jurisdictional. It doesn't tell us what to do. Shall we read it as an exception or shall we not? And so what they are saying is, don't read it as an exception. There's no need to do so. Congress probably never really thought about any of this stuff. Read it, Irwin, as including that one, too. So what do you think of that point, whether it's theirs or not, leaving aside the argument about whether this particular statute does or does not fall within that set? Assume it does.",
  "Absolutely right, and then the question is does the simple fact that we previously held to the contrary count as a rebuttal? Does Irwin mean to -- see that's the same question I had before, so what do you think about that?",
  "Because?",
  "But if they do that why can't -- and you don't -- if they don't give you the notice, well, then you can complain, they didn't give us the notice.",
  "But if you're not hurt by it, what difference does it make?",
  "And if you don't get it, you can't complain, if you actually knew about it.",
  "If you didn't know about it, then -- then you have a complaint.",
  "Well -- well, then you'd have the complaint if you didn't, et cetera, but so what? In other words, if the EEOC wants to have a very broad definition that turns 90 percent of its - - whatever this thing is called, the statement -- I forgotten the name, sorry. What's the name of this document? The intake questionnaire.",
  "Yes. If it has a broad definition that says this counts as a charge, so what? Let it do it. Who's hurt?",
  "And if they don't, you complain about that.",
  "You complain just as you're doing now, in court. You just the same words, but instead of using the words as against the word \"charge,\" you use those same words you've all said in your excellent arguments, except you attack the fact you didn't get the notice, and there you're really hurt. Or if you're not, it doesn't matter.",
  "Well, all right. So what's wrong with that?",
  "Suppose they made a mistake here.",
  "What I think Miss Lensing, one of her more basic points is this: There is a statute. And the statute says the EEOC shall send prompt notice in part to the conciliation. And she adds, if we get the notice, we also start getting evidence and preserving it and talking to people. There are a lot of things they would like to do with that notice.",
  "Now, I replied to that, well, okay, they complain about the lack of notice. But her response is, sure, they sometimes don't give notice when they file a charge. That's just a mistake. But if you start calling these documents charges, well, they never give notice, so they will never do it. It will be a big problem, so, therefore, don't call them charges. Now, I want to know what your answer is to the first part of what I said. My -- I was assuming that if the employer is really hurt, there is a statute and a rule and the statute and the rules say you have to give notice and if they are hurt by that, they can complain about it.",
  "But they must make mistakes in their history when they file charges and didn't give notice. So what does the law tell us? If you found it any case ever where the EEOC didn't give the notice, now the complainant files a lawsuit and it's not the complainant's fault, her response is work out some kind of equitable tolling. But there must be law on this, because this couldn't -- this is a big agency and they must have sometimes in the past forgotten to give notice.",
  "What does the law say happens when they don't give notice?",
  "Well, it wouldn't be a defense. I mean, it's not this complainant's fault. It's the - -",
  "You'd have to work out some kind of equitable tolling or something. I think she's right about that. There is no law to your knowledge or what is there?",
  "And the practical problem: I want to know where do I read what the definition of a \"charge\" is in the EEOC rules. The three criteria that it has certain information in it can't be the rule. It can't be the rule because we already know that it isn't a charge if the person says I don't want it to become public. So, where do I read the rule that you just said? That it -- an intake questionnaire that satisfies these three conditions becomes a charge if it reflects the manifest intent of the person who files it that it be a charge. You said that. That's a pretty modestly clear rule, except it isn't totally. And they qualify -- where do I read that?",
  "We use the word there \"manifest intent\"?",
  "Ah. Well, I read those regs, and those regs had a definition that can't possibly be right as applied to \"intake questionnaire,\" because they make it a charge when the person says I don't want notice. So we know that isn't the thing. I also know what you just said does sound like a rule. I just want to know where to read it, because I don't think you'd refer to a rule of an agency, though normally we do -- but you don't refer to a rule that doesn't exist; you don't refer to a rule that nowhere can be found; you don't refer to a rule that is internally inconsistent. So, before I defer, I would just like to know where the clear rule that you stated can be found.",
  "No, I just want to read it somewhere.",
  "So that if I were not here having you in front of me, as many people don't have you in front of them, where I would go to read just what you said.",
  "But you said there were going to be four places. I want to write them down.",
  "One is 48 Fed. Reg. 148?",
  "138. Now, the other three.",
  "Well, that's on the notice point. Going back to the other, more important point, your words that I found quite useful are the \"manifest intent,\" that shows a manifest -- are those words going to be in these four sources that I look up?",
  "No. I suspect not.",
  "Therefore -- I'm - -",
  "On that point -- the reason I think you're -- there's a little chaos here is because you said -- your question is phrased, does the FAA preclude enforcement of your arbitration agreement? And you're going to say: We answer that question, no, it doesn't preclude it.",
  "It doesn't require it; it doesn't preclude it. But then would we have to go back and say what is the source? There has to be some source of law that authorizes this contractual agreement, and there could be two possible sources. And my question here is, is it clear that in fact either of these two sources does? The first source is State law. I gather the difficulty is that the State of Oregon has an act just like the Federal Arbitration Act, so we'd have to ask the Oregon courts: Is this a legitimate contract under Oregon State law. The alternative source of law is the Federal judge's case management authority. And there we have a statute which clearly gives the judge some kind of authority, but not for your case because your case exceeds the jurisdictional amount. Therefore, in the absence of that statute, is there inherent authority in the district judge? Now, I don't know the answer to either of those questions.",
  "My temptation is to say they're open questions and they'd have to be argued on remand, which makes this case the case of the century, I guess, in a certain respect. It's quite a difficult case.",
  "All right. Well, in a certain area. I overstate. But the -- is there any light you can shed on those two questions, or is there some third possible source of law?",
  "Have you ever argued that this is a matter governed by Oregon law and it is enforceable?",
  "Have you ever argued that?",
  "Yes, under Oregon law. Have you ever argued Oregon law?",
  "No?",
  "Well, then it's not surprising they haven't argued that Oregon law doesn't apply.",
  "That's why just what you said is actually what's worrying me about the case. Because what Justice Ginsburg said makes me think that there could be situations, a lot of situations, where Federal judges do want to peel the case off. And you say send it to a master. Maybe some would lend themselves to a master; maybe some wouldn't. I have no idea. And are we going to have to hold in this case whether a judge or when a judge, a Federal judge, does or does not have authority to do such a thing? That's why I say -- I was actually thinking the case of the century, because it's going to take a hundred years to finish. But the fact is there are those issues there once we say Section 9 doesn't apply. Then you're going to have to say -- suppose we were to say it's just State law. Well, suppose the State doesn't allow enforcement of this kind of contract? Then we have the question of the authority -- of the inherent authority, not statutory, of a Federal district judge to peel off bits of cases and decide them in different ways. I don't know the answer to those questions, but I think they are quite important. So what do I do?",
  "Oh, no, because there is a holding in the whole Ninth Circuit, which accounts for a large percent of the country, that the district judge can't do this. And that's quite a significant holding in that circuit, and we ought to review that.",
  "Oh, if there is, then let's think -- suppose that in the middle of a trial, the parties say, judge, this is so complicated factually, we have a way that we can get an agreed statement of facts. They walk out the door; they have a friend who has a sign called arbitrator; and they come away from that friend with an agreed statement of facts, which they agree to submit to the judge to apply the law. Now, there is nothing wrong with that, I imagine.",
  "We know -- I'm sorry. I'm not even going to tell the judge how I find this. I go to a crystal ball; I go to any way I want. I will come in with an agreed statement of facts, and is there anything, if we have that agreed statement of facts, that would will stop the judge from saying I take this agreed statement of facts; there's a difference about how the law applies to it; I will resolve this case?",
  "Well, no -- I just say - - well, I'll ask you the next question. I take the answer to the first question is there's nothing wrong with that.",
  "I'm sorry. I thought that, if in fact parties come in with an agreed statement of fact in a case, I've never seen a situation where the judge couldn't say, fine, I agree; that's the -- the judge would say I'm sorry, even though you agree, I insist that you go to trial and?",
  "He can?",
  "All right, so there are public policy limitations.",
  "Well, is there anything wrong here? My question basically, obviously, is, is there anything wrong in this case if they had come in with an agreed statement of fact?",
  "All right. I'm trying to get to my question; I'm not asking it very well. What they agreed to is an agreed statement of facts, subject to Section 9 standards, Section 9 and 10.",
  "What I'm driving at, whether I've asked it well or not - -",
  "-- is is how is it any different from coming in with an agreed statement of facts?",
  "Has that been a nightmare -- has it been the nightmare you suggest in labor arbitration? Because I think labor arbitration falls outside the act, doesn't it?",
  "And has that turned into some kind of terrible nightmare where there are dozens of rules and they have a long complicated labor set of regulations on it? I don't think so, but has it?",
  "Well, if we run that pretty well, why wouldn't you run this pretty well - -",
  "-- given a back-up, looking at it as a default?",
  "Well, why? Why? That's the question, it seems to me, in the case. Why? I mean -- imaginary example -- a plan, a thousand members. The trustee invests in a thousand diamonds. He puts it in a bank deposit vault. One day he takes all 500 diamonds and runs off to Martinique. We catch him enjoying the sun. We can sue him under (2), right? That's what (2) is there for, right? Right. Okay. Now, everything is the same except each of the thousand diamonds was put in individual safe deposit box with the participant's name on it. Everything else is the same. Why should it matter?",
  "Well, I'm sorry. I'm not interested in that question. I'm interested in my question. Why isn't it available under (a)(2)? In both cases, the trustee took 500 diamonds that belonged to the plan and went to Martinique. Now, if you can sue him when the plans are all put in one big safe deposit box with the diamonds, why can't you sue him when they're put in 500 small safe deposit boxes?",
  "I want to go back to amend my example. He only took one diamond. It was a big vault he took it from -- one diamond. You still have the claim, right?",
  "It's a big vault. He took it from one big safe deposit box -- one diamond.",
  "No, this is just there in the big vault.",
  "Well, of course. Well- - no, no. I'm going to, of course, ask you, since you seem to be turning this thing on how individualized this loss was, well, it was just one diamond, out of thousand. Now obviously I'm going to ask you, because I haven't yet heard the answer -- at least I didn't seem to hear it -- what the difference is whether that one diamond came from a big vault or from one little safe deposit box with the participant's label on it.",
  "Exactly, the same kind of loss. And what we have here is the footnote that was alleged in -- written in the opinion -- we assume the defendant's conduct amounted to a breach of fiduciary duties. So therefore all of the discussion you have, that maybe it didn't -- well, maybe you're right. But we better send it back so that they can decide that question. And I just don't see what the other difference is. It can't be a difference in the size of the diamond. And people are saying, well, why -- well, you see the question.",
  "I've read the legislative history, which shows to me, anyway, precisely no light whatsoever. It's -- the only relevant sentence, which is the third sentence, simply repeats the statute. And, therefore, I thought that what Congress is trying to do is say, treat trusts like individuals, except in respect to special expenses. What are special expenses? Those that are related to the trust and that an individual wouldn't have occurred -- incurred. I can't say it much clearly than that. But I have an absolutely clear idea what it means. To me it means that if this is an expense that the trust is saying is special, I would say, would a reasonable person who did not hold these assets in trust, would such a person be likely to make that kind of expenditure? And if the answer to that question is yes, well, then I would say it's not a special expense. And if the answer is no, I would say it was. And then the IRS and you will come and say that isn't precise enough. And I'd say the IRS has plenty of authority in its regs to give lists of examples which they do in such instances. Now, I'm posing that, not because I bought into it, though I'm tempted to, but I'd like to know what your response is.",
  "There's nothing that I could find anywhere that talked about pass-throughs in respect to the special situation of trusts and estates. In the first sentence it speaks to it in respect to individuals. It all makes sense. And what they seem to be saying is just what I said initially. We do agree trusts do have a special claim, but only in respect to special trust expenses. And which are they? They're the ones an individual wouldn't have incurred. And I'll put a gloss on it, like we do in law. I say a reasonable individual. I say wouldn't reasonably have incurred. And then I leave it up to the IRS to say which are the expenses that an individual would likely incur and which ones he wouldn't likely incur. Now, that runs throughout tax law, doesn't it, that kind of list, what's a necessary expenditure, what isn't. I mean, they do that all the time, don't they?",
  "Not buying into they're thing with \"could.\" I mean, that isn't my problem.",
  "A glass - -",
  "Before -- I mean, we have lots of good examples. I mean, I could have colored my room at home, painted it with light green plastic, but I wouldn't have done it. I mean, endless examples.",
  "Well, what would -- that's why I made the suggestion I had earlier. I was doubtful about the wisdom of trying to turn this matter into a purely factual one. And so suppose you said, which would come to about the same thing, that expenditure would be incurred in this instance by someone who didn't hold these assets in trust. What that means is would a -- an investor not in the trust, not holding it in trust, reasonably have been, or a reasonable investor have been likely to make this expenditure? That turns it into a more quasi-legal question where people -- and then it's a matter of judgment, which these things do come down to. That's what judges are there for, to judge. And thereby we avoid the burden-of-proof problem. It comes to about the same thing. Is there any objection to it? What's the reason not to do it?",
  "But are you - -",
  "You would be, of course, exactly right, that there could be trusts, very big trusts. Children get into fights trying to split up the assets. Millions is paid on lawyers and investment advisors to see if each share, figured 14 different ways, is going to earn this money or that money. And that kind of thing exists. And there the investment advisors are likely to be special. So you can't say investment advice is always special or never special. Now, again, this seems to me not unknown, this kind of problem, to the Internal Revenue law, and therefore there tend to be methods of allowing exceptions, of putting burdens. I mean, is this case somehow -- am I wrong about that?",
  "I'm looking really for a form of words to write that does not use the word \"could\" but which gets at what I think the statute was after, which is: Let them have this no floor for their special stuff but not for ordinary stuff that others would have incurred regardless. I want to know what form of words. I find it difficult to go beyond the statute, frankly.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's right. That's right.",
  "If I reject this word \"could\" and \"uniqueness,\" now what form of word should I write?",
  "If had you to choose between that and getting the idea of the reasonable taxpayer who didn't hold this in trust, which would you choose?",
  "The answer to that is it may be a very good idea, so convince Congress to pass a law. It's just that if every State does it differently it's going to be a nightmare. And I don't know what the answer to that point is. And I don't know what the answer to the point is about banning things. I'm amazed if that's what you mean. I'm not sure what you mean. I mean, North Carolina could pass a statute that says the following: Everybody in North Carolina over the age 16, say, or maybe everybody including small children -- I don't know what they want to pass -- can smoke to their heart's delight, can buy as many cigarettes as they like, but you can't ship in a single cigarette from out of State. You think that wouldn't cause -- raise a Commerce Clause problem?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, that's why I'm just not certain about bans that forbid people to ship things inside from outside the State, while allowing people to buy those things produced by people inside the State. That's why I'm uncertain about the concession you're talking about.",
  "I mean, what is this New York law that does this?",
  "But the thing I'm concerned about is -- is assume it's perfectly legal to do what you said. I guess it still wouldn't be legal for Maine or New York to say the following: We really want to discourage people from smoking, a noble goal. And, therefore, whenever an interstate shipper ships tobacco into the State, he has to charge double the price, just double the shipment price or ten times the shipment price. Could they say that?",
  "All right.",
  "All right. But could they say you have to carry it in special packages which the sticker -- which maybe you should do, but which the sticker puts skull and crossbones on each of the packages? Could they say that?",
  "No. All right.",
  "If they cannot say either of those things because of the statute, why can they say: What you have to do is you have to ship it in a way that makes certain that the person who receives it, the addressee, is the person who bought it?",
  "May I ask you this question, which is where I'm having a little trouble on your side. I think I would agree and you would agree that if the State were to say, to protect the consumers in our State, anyone who ships in goods must do so in special padded cars -- use whatever shipper you want, but you have to have special -- that would be illegal.",
  "Can California say, anybody who ships lettuces into our State has to use refrigerated equipment? One product, not all products, and a good public health reason?",
  "So you'd say that would also be preempted?",
  "If that's the way to do it, you didn't do it that way, did you? I mean, as I read it -- they put in here, on 163a, the motion that you made to the district court said that you have to be \"similarly situated\" -- \"Plaintiff has to have been 'similarly situated' with other employees\" -- and you put that in quotes -- \"similarly situated.\" And then you say \"employees may be 'similarly situated' only if they have the same supervisor.\" Period. Not -- it wasn't a period actually, but the rest of the sentence isn't important. And then you cite Aramburu, which is where the Tenth Circuit said that. So I don't see how you can say this wasn't a 401 case. You were saying that weren't similarly situated, period. And then the district judge virtually quoted those words.",
  "Well, that may be, but the -- I don't see -- I mean, that may be, but this is the argument you made, and this was the argument the district judge adopted. Is that not so or is it so?",
  "That's why I don't understand your answer. I'm confused here. What I said, and you seemed to agree, is different from what was just said, which you also seemed to agree. I thought that you said in your brief that you have to have been -- quote -- \"similarly situated.\" All right? \"Employees must be similarly situated to Plaintiff.\" That's true, isn't it? I'm quoting the brief, from page 163. And then you say, \"Employees may be similarly situated only if they have the same supervisor.\" Then the district court says that plaintiff may offer evidence who are \"similarly situated\" to her and then -- quote -- \"similarly situated employees\" - - quote -- \"for the purpose of this ruling requires proof that Paul Reddick, his supervisor, was the decisionmaker.\" That's why I thought it was fairly clear, since he used the same words and substituted the word \"Paul Reddick\" for the same supervisor, that he was taking that right from your brief where you made that general argument and said nothing about the particular case in those sentences.",
  "All right. So what should we do then? Sorry. Go ahead and conclude. But I want to ask this after you finish answering Justice Souter.",
  "And finish your answer to Justice Souter.",
  "Well, that's exactly what's sort of bothering me. You are the trial lawyer.",
  "And I'm not. And what's worrying me most about this is I will say something that will muck up quite a lot of trials. So, therefore, the sentence that jumps out the page here was where the court of appeals says that Rule 403's exclusion is an extraordinary remedy that should be sparingly -- used sparingly. Is that a general rule? Because my impression was -- and this is why I asked you as a trial lawyer -- is that if you take 401 and 402 and read them literally, we'll have trials that last a thousand years. And, really, the way a trial judge keeps the trial under control is to say: Well, maybe there is some slight tendency here to make a fact more likely than not; but, even if that's so, this is a waste of time. And I thought that kind of decision is what trial judges are there to make.",
  "And, therefore, I thought this court of appeals is trying to second-guess that trial court judge unless that trial court judge is making an absolute rule, which he may have been. But as soon as we get into this case, I thought we might do quite a lot of harm by trying to let the court of appeals second-guess trial courts on this kind of thing. Now, I would appreciate your response to that.",
  "Well, then, how are we going to -- I'm not arguing about what it says so much as I'm arguing about who has the right between the court of appeals and the trial court to decide?",
  "And all I'm worried about -- and you tell me if that's the law in the Tenth Circuit or elsewhere. I was an appeals court judge for a quite a while. And I think we have never -- not \"never,\" but hardly ever second-guessed a trial judge on that kind of question.",
  "Now, you tell me if the rules are different in the Tenth Circuit? Do they out there second-guess trial judges on this kind of question all the time?",
  "All right. If they don't normally, why should they here? If this kind of rule is -- as you say, this kind of evidence is like any other evidence, any other evidence at all. It may be relevant, or it may not be. It depends on the case. A waste of time or not depends on the case.",
  "I got your blanket part. I got that.",
  "Oh, no, not -- I'm saying -- well, you got my point, but you're just not answering my question.",
  "And I don't want to repeat it. And I'm not talking about whether it is hearsay or not. I'm not talking -- I'm talking about whether it comes in 401, 402, 403. That's the issue.",
  "How could ut have been? What about the date problem he just mentioned? You said -- your opponent said that when you filed this motion in limine on December 15, 2004, by that time, there hadn't been any fact-specific things at all brought up in the trial that were relevant to this, and there's certainly none in the notion that I could see.",
  "But where does it say? I can't find in the motion, although there is something on disparate impact, anything that says well, you see, I don't know about the general mine run of cases, but in this particular case, it's not sufficiently material, it is a waste -- it's not -- it is a waste of time. Now, I just can't find that.",
  "Did anyone argue that before December 15, 2004, that we don't know about the mine run of cases, but this case, in fact it's a waste of time? Did anyone argue that before December 15, 2004?",
  "I'm asking yes or no; did they or didn't they?",
  "Okay.",
  "Can I go back to Ms. Scott?",
  "Could I go back to Ms. Scott?",
  "Yes. If you look at the top of 367 and then you look over at 366, the format, I think, is that the prosecutor is posing a general question. And then he poses his question -- or she - - and goes around and gets an answer. Here is Mr. Lindey. So they start out with the death penalty. They have some ambiguous thing at the bottom of 366. Then the prosecutor says, \"Mrs. Alvarez -- Ms. Alvarez, you said you could not impose the death penalty.\" \"Mrs. Goff -- Ms. Goff: I could consider the death penalty.\" \"Ms. DuPont: I couldn't hear.\" Prosecutor: You could consider both?\" \"Yes, I would consider it.\" \"Ms. DuBois: I could consider it. Yes.\" \"Ms. Archonie: I could consider it.\" \"Mrs. Alvino: I could consider it.\" \"Ms. Scott: I could. I could.\" Now, that doesn't seem too ambiguous for me -- to me. It seems that what they're talking about, each of them, is the death penalty because that's what, by the time they got to the top of 367, they were talking about. Maybe there's ambiguity there.",
  "But I haven't noticed in anybody's opinion, so far, making that point that you just made.",
  "No -- well, there's -- I just read you what it was, so I guess people make up their own mind about that. But by -- what I don't think you can make up your own mind as ambiguous is when this prosecutor met with an answer that he considered not - - call it strictly kosher, when he found that, like Mrs. Calligan, she said, \"I'm not sure.\" That's more ambiguous than Mrs. Scott. And then he goes on, for three pages of additional questioning, and then 26 pages later, he doesn't excuse her yet and he doesn't excuse her until she volunteers, \"I could give a verdict -- I don't think I could give a verdict to take someone's life.\" And it's at that point that the prosecutor excuses her. Now, compare that to Ms. Scott, who started out saying \"I think I could\" and then, as I read it, said \"I could.\" Now, that's the kind of comparison here. No follow-up. At the worst, minor ambiguity.",
  "And a slight hesitation. Now, what do you say to that?",
  "And that, of course, is a problem I have generally in this area. We can always imagine that things that are not in the transcript, perhaps what she said spokenly not in the transcript is \"I hate the death penalty. I'll never -- I'll never apply it under any circumstances.\" And I grant you, if that's the law, we are never going to find that there's any prejudice. But I just don't see how that could be the law.",
  "Well, of course -- sorry.",
  "Exactly. He's entitled to a fair trial without prejudice.",
  "So I think you have two instances here. One is Mrs. Scott, and the other is Mr. Brooks. And with regard to Mr. Brooks, what I've read in the transcript is that he was nervous and unhappy, because he's learning to be a teacher, and he's afraid he's going to miss some student teaching time which will count against him.",
  "What it says is the clerk called the dean and the dean said it he won't, don't worry about it, which Mr. Brook is then told. He's challenged for that reason. He might still worry about it. But Mr. Laws is not. And Mr. Laws is a self-employed contractor who announced to the court, I have a big problem this weekend; two houses are near completion, the owners are supposed to be moving in; my wife has just had a hysterectomy, she's supposed to be taking care of the children back home, and I -- she has nobody to help. Okay? He's not challenged. So we're not worried about Mr. Laws worried about his wife and his business which going down -- you know, serious. But we are worried about Mr. Brooks, who has been told by the dean you have no problem. Now, that's a little bit of a problem to me.",
  "If you add them up, we have Ms. Scott we have Mr. Brooks, we have the mention of - - and three others -- three others, the only other three black people are challenged off, and we have the -- no black juror us on and we have the references to O. J. Simpson beside. Okay? All right so, there you are. Full case against you.",
  "No, she means the dean. The dean - -",
  "-- said no problem at all. What better arrangement can you want?",
  "I don't know the answer to this at all but how this is supposed to work? A defense attorneys -- the jury selection, and he sees that the prosecutor doesn't challenge for peremptory or any other reason one black member. Let's call it five. And then they start challenging black members. Obviously, he didn't at the beginning impose any Batson claim. He had no Batson claim. There were five people on the jury who were black. What claim could you make? And then after you begin to get suspicious and start to make them, now they do this thing called black strike and they get everybody off the jury. How is it supposed to work?",
  "They don't know.",
  "I'm speaking reality.",
  "That was my question.",
  "Can I ask you one other question. You are the only one who will know the answer to, this too. I noticed in looking at the opinion of the Louisiana Supreme Court that they start out by saying we have conducted another review of the voir dire transcript and find nothing there to disparage the Batson claim. In reading that opinion in several places they refer to their having gone back and having read the whole transcript themselves. And then they have two full pages, or one and a half anyway where they seem to be talking about what happened in a pretrial conference and they refer to that prior review and covered a factor favorable to the State's use of a peremptory challenge. They went back and found a factor of favorable to. Now, was that factor argued to them in the brief? Do you remember that?",
  "I thought that's why you might know.",
  "I thought that, in reading it, it seems as if they are not, and I was thinking about how a judge can't think of everything. But if they're going to think beyond what the briefs tell them, they ought to think of it for both sides, and not just for one side.",
  "I thought that was something a little different than that. The question that I have which might be helpful to me, if you can answer it, is -- that's being serious about it -- I'd be helped by knowing what the specific design defect is that you claim? That is, in what respect was this catheter -- and I'd like you to refer to the details of the catheter -- in what respect, what material or what shape or what -- what it is about this catheter that you as the plaintiff think was designed defectively, if you can tell me?",
  "I know. But you must have a theory.",
  "What is it about the design that you are saying is not safe? That is, you can't go into the court without having in your mind, as the counsel, that some kind of specific thing that was wrong with this catheter, other than just using the words \"design.\" I mean, how was it designed badly? What part of the design is not right?",
  "You are saying the material of the balloon should have been of a different material or a different thickness; is that right?",
  "What does that mean? How do you design something to burst?",
  "If you don't know how to design the balloon, what are you basing the design claim on?",
  "Let me tell you why I asked my question, because I don't want to leave -- you to leave with an unfavorable impression in my mind on your issue without your having a chance to see. What's worrying me is that, of course, it's a terrible thing when somebody is hurt in these kinds of accidents. And the lawyers are trying to help. So the lawyers will think, look, there's a problem here. There must be. My client was seriously hurt. And he's not supposed to be. And then they'll work backward from that and say well if he was hurt, there must be something wrong with the design. So every time there is an accident or something bad happens, the lawyers assert a design claim and they gear up discovery. And in my mind, could Congress have intended that kind of thing when what they're trying to do is have a group of experts really look into this and decide whether it should marketed or not. That's what's bothering me. And that's why I would like you to respond to that.",
  "How are they not conflicting? Go ahead; go ahead -- elaborate.",
  "Going back to Justice Scalia's question on the precedent, suppose -- and I'm going to be -- I'd like my mind to be clear on this. I thought that the question asked was for you to find an instance where there was no sovereignty of the country and they issued the writ, and it was turning on a technical thing. Whether that was how the question was met or not, what I read here in these different briefs is in 1759, Lord Mansfield, the case can issue -- a writ of habeas corpus, no doubt the power could issue it where the place is under the subjection of the crown of England. Then Lord Sellers in Mwenya said subjection is fully appropriate to the powers, that's habeas, irrespective of territorial sovereignty or dominion, in other words, non-technical. In our case in Rasul, both the concurring opinion and the majority opinion say things like the reach of the writ depends not on formal notions of territorial sovereignty, but on the practical questions. Then they both list practical questions. Now suppose we take that as the definition. Now, can you find instances where the writ has been issued by Britain in history to people who were not citizens and who were not actually held in Britain?",
  "They are --",
  "The Spanish doctor, the Swedish doctor, the Spanish sailors, the British spy, they're all in this case.",
  "They get additional process. The question, I guess, is whether it is an adequate substitute for having withdrawn the writ of habeas corpus. On that question, suppose that you are from Bosnia, and you are held for six years in Guantanamo, and the charge is that you helped Al-Qaeda, and you had your hearing before the CSRT. And now you go to the D.C. Circuit, and here is what you say: The CSRT is all wrong. Their procedures are terrible. But just for purposes of argument, I concede those procedures are wonderful, and I also conclude it reached a perfectly good result. Okay? So you concede it for argument's sake. But what you want to say is: Judge, I don't care how good those procedures are. I'm from Bosnia. I've been here six years. The Constitution of the United States does not give anyone the right to hold me six years in Guantanamo without either charging me or releasing me, in the absence of some special procedure in Congress for preventive detention. That's the argument I want to make. I don't see anything in this CSRT provision that permits me to make that argument. So I'm asking you: Where can you make that argument?",
  "Exactly.",
  "If he cannot make that argument, how does this become an equivalent to habeas, since that happens to be the argument that a large number of these 305 people would like to make?",
  "I thought we were here talking about -- I see that you have a strong argument and they'll have a strong argument in reply. I think both are pretty good, how you interpret these cases. I thought we were talking about what the availability of a forum in which you can make your argument and they can make their argument, and that's why I'm back to the question of this is remedy that's given in the statute sufficient to allow you to make your argument and their to make their argument? And what you said was, when I thought I produced an example of an instance they wanted to argue quite strongly, and you said no, they couldn't. Then you said well, neither could they in England. Well, that I wonder. That's where I'm back to. After all, England doesn't have a written constitution. So it is hardly surprising if they concede everything away in England, they're not going to be able to make any argument. There's nothing left. But let's image in England you had a statute and that statute said the government cannot hold an alien in Beckawannaland for six years without either charging them or releasing them. Or except for -- and we have some very detailed preventive detention. Suppose there was a statute like that. And then our friends in England in whatever year conceded every argument but that one. Now, are you going to tell me now that the habeas courts would have said we won't even listen to your argument?",
  "Correct. And you told me in this statute the court of appeals will not listen to that argument. And as I read the statute, I agree with you. Because I can find no place where they could make that argument since it does not concern how well this tribunal did, nor does it concern the constitutionality of the procedures of the tribunal.",
  "It wasn't cleverly redrafted. I wanted to say that the people I'm thinking of are not challenging those procedures. What they say is you could have the best procedure in the world, and they're totally constitutional -- we'll assume that -- they're assuming it. They're not going to concede it. They're assuming it. On that assumption, we still think that Congress, the President, the Supreme Court under the law, cannot hold us for six years without either trying us, releasing us, or maybe confining us under some special statute involving preventive detention and danger which has not yet been enacted.",
  "They are arguing it.",
  "Well, on that -- and you just mentioned remedy. Suppose, contrary to what you hope for, that the Court were to say that this is -- we have a minute or two. Suppose they were to say that this is an unconstitutional suspension of the writ, and that the remedy here written in the statute is not adequate in respect to many claims that might be made. On that assumption, the habeas would lie. Now, it has been six years, and habeas is supposed to be speedy. And, yet, people have serious arguments, anyway, that they are being held for six years without even having those arguments heard. Is there anything in your opinion that this Court could say by way of remedy that could get the D.C. Circuit or the others to decide this and the CSRT claims, there are 305 people to do this quickly within a period of months rather than six more years? And if so, what?",
  "Are we faced with this problem, and I don't want to put you right on the spot, what approximately would you say in respect to this? Because it is a serious problem.",
  "Is there appeal? I mean, what happens? They file a motion to reopen, denied. Now, can they appeal that?",
  "Okay. And how much time does that take?",
  "Right. But how -- do they then appeal the motion to -- they appeal the motion - - the denial of the motion to reopen or how long -- where do they go? Do they have -- this is the Board, so they go right to the court of appeals?",
  "And how long do those take on average?",
  "I'm not interested in the problem. I'm interested in how much added time it actually means. So let's go -- if you win, how much additional time in a typical case would the alien have before he has to leave?",
  "And then, and then do you in addition ask for cert or is it not in addition? Are you including that within the 13 months?",
  "Or would you just guess on the basis of your experience? I'm not holding you to it.",
  "All right. What I'm wondering here, and this is because I see two contrary things, if for to you win it means that you are adding an average of, say, 400 days to a stay where Congress said we want you to stay no more than 60 days or 120? That's pretty hard for me to reconcile, to tell you the truth.",
  "Well then, that's the answer to my question.",
  "I'm having a lot of trouble understanding the case, because it's so complicated. If you -- could you track it through for a minute? I mean, as I understand this, this probably doesn't concern people who want to voluntarily depart before their case is finished, right? Where they don't reopen because there is nothing to reopen?",
  "Okay. So we're at a person who is before the Board or before the hearing examiner and he wants to -- he is now got a final order against him.",
  "Okay. So now you say to him I'll tell you what we'll do to you: You leave, go, good-bye, and we'll let you pursue your appeals anyway, but from out of the country. That's true? Just tell me if I'm getting it right.",
  "I'm not talking about reopening. I'm talking about appeals.",
  "And can you go to court, too?",
  "Okay. So no problem. You say go, good-bye, and we'll give you some good deals here if you'll really go, but you pursue your appeals.",
  "That's what I'm asking, I'm getting at.",
  "I'm not talking about motions to reopen at all.",
  "Okay. But you can go to there? You go to the BIA?",
  "Okay. Now, why wouldn't you treat - -",
  "Cannot. Okay. But you can go to the BIA? Leaving the country?",
  "You can't go anywhere.",
  "So you lose all your appeals, not just your motion-to-reopen appeals if you leave the country?",
  "Oh. Okay. So you say - -",
  "So your basic is -- don't tell me if I'm right if I'm wrong, please. The - - the -- what I'm thinking your basic problem or position is and why you've got into this, is because you think any really meritorious case where there should be reopening will be pointed out to the Board before there is a final order in effect and before voluntary departure becomes an issue?",
  "And if we decide against you, then you're thinking, well, what will happen in every case is after there is a final order, the alien will move for a motion to reopen because he will get a few extra days.",
  "He gets a -- several - -",
  "Have I got it right, what your point is?",
  "Well, if they don't provide for it, and they don't say you can't do it, why isn't it arbitrary not to let him do it? I mean -- what -- if it's -- if it's arbitrary - -",
  "It sounds almost arbitrary to say to a person, look, if you think you have some new evidence and want to reopen, do it. But Congress wanted you to get out of here in respect to this 60 days, so you have to give up that. You're not getting those benefits. Now, it's a tough bargain, but it seems reasonable.",
  "What I don't see is to say once you ask for this you can never get status adjustment.",
  "So why not apply them to this person?",
  "So what about this? I'm just trying this out. You don't have to respond if you don't want to. But you say, look, the AG in his rules here, really tried to reconcile the two interests that we talked about in our prior conversation. Now hypothetically, I suppose you say that was a reasonable way of going about this, and we remand for consideration about whether this prior situation that you couldn't do that was arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion, or your failure to apply it retroactively to a certain class of people was arbitrary, capricious, abusive discretion?",
  "What are they? That is, I was -- I can't find -- what should I read? Because I've read the studies. I've read that Lancet study, which seemed to me the only referee for it said it wasn't any good. And I've read the Zimmer study and I found in there an amazing sentence to me which says that The Netherlands Information Task Force concluded it is not possible to administer so much of it that a lethal effect is guaranteed. They're talking about thiopental. So I'm left at sea. I understand your contention. You claim that this is somehow more painful than some other method. But which? And what's the evidence for that? What do I read to find it?",
  "But that's what they're - - they're giving a three gram dose, I take it, and if - - or two grams or three grams; I thought it was three grams here. And I ended up thinking of course there is a risk of human error. There is a risk of human error generally where you're talking about the death penalty, and this may be one extra problem, one serious additional problem. But the question here is can we say that there is a more serious problem here than with other execution methods? I've read the studies. What else should I read?",
  "What do we do with the euthanasia -- instead of talking -- I looked; I found it more important to look at what they do with euthanasia than to look at what they do with animals, frankly, and I was therefore taken aback with the sentence I just read to you. What am I supposed to do about that?",
  "Well, what do we do about the point -- the point that the doctors or the nurses say it's unethical to help with an execution? I mean, if we are going to talk about the constitutionality of the death penalty per se, that isn't raised in this case. And what the other side says is, well, you're just trying to do this by the back door, insist upon a procedure that can't be used.",
  "You have to, I mean, I can't, I don't know if \"substantial\" is the right word to capture it. Perhaps the right word is is there a significant risk that can be easily averted and what I'm worried about here is do we or do we not send it back, I'm quite honestly disturbed by the fact that in this - - I can't report they both recommend pancuronium and that the sodium thiopental doesn't work not even in grams of three doses in all cases but they think the contrary and if there is uncertainty here should we send it back for consideration of all these things in a more full hearing under a standard that does allow comparisons with other methods not to find a comparison not too fine a comparison but at least a practical comparison.",
  "Well, it depends on what you mean by that. The Ninth Circuit said, quote, about what he has to show, that he has to show not merely that the funds could have been a return of capital, but that the funds were, in fact, the return of capital \"at the time of transfer.\" Then, they go on to say, since there was no evidence that they were considered, intended or recorded on the corporate records as a return of capital at the time they were made, then it isn't a return of capital. Now, I thought everybody thinks that's wrong, because you might have an absolute distribution that absolutely counts as a distribution to every shareholder in the corporation. And at the time they all think the company's going to make a billion dollars, but it just turns out that they have a loss of a billion dollars, in which case at the end of the tax year that would count as a return of capital if the basis were high enough, and it would not count as a dividend. Am I wrong?",
  "All right, fine. So if we do not know, that's the end of the Ninth Circuit test, isn't it? Because the Ninth Circuit test says: What we want to do is to look at the books at the time of the distribution and see if it is entered on those books as a return of capital. That's how I read it.",
  "No. No. It was not. What they thought at the time they distributed it was fabulous dividends because we are going to be rich.",
  "My example was they just made a little mistake. Instead, the corporation is close to bankrupt, so there are no earnings or profits. Is it then a return of capital or not?",
  "The basis? He has more than enough basis. He has a $14 trillion basis, okay? So there is no problem about that.",
  "All right. And so it is a return of capital. So, therefore, the test is wrong.",
  "Can I try a third example? Because I think an example might help. Let us imagine that the company distributes $10,000 on June 1 to every shareholder. Let us imagine that every shareholder has a basis of a trillion dollars in his stock. There is no problem about basis. There is no problem about the nature of the distribution. Let us imagine they put in the corporate records on June 1: This is a very valuable corporation; we are going to make a fortune; and this is a dividend. They write it down. Now, unfortunately, four weeks later the bottom falls out of the market, and it is not a dividend for the reason that they have no profits that year. Now, is it not under ordinary tax law a return of capital?",
  "Okay.",
  "If that -- once you say yes, then the Ninth Circuit must be wrong because the Ninth Circuit said we do not look to see what happens.",
  "A month later, we look just to see how it's characterized by the corporation at the moment of the transfer.",
  "Well, that's what they said.",
  "But we don't -- we are not certain on that one, I think, because of the cases he said before would this be a possible holding. If it was a distribution in respect to the stock, and if he had sufficient basis, then if there were no earnings and profits in the corporation during the year, it would be treated as a tax deficiency -- no tax deficiency or it would be a return of capital. Insofar as as the Ninth Circuit says something to the contrary, it is wrong. Now, if we remand to decide whether the - - whether he intended to prove and produced enough to show they didn't have the earnings and profits and also to consider the question of whether this was a distribution in respect to stock.",
  "Does the Government have any objection to what I just said?",
  "But those are different. Those are whether that's a corporate purpose. I think the question here is, as I started, I thought that this expert was going to testify that there were no earnings and profits in the relevant year. Having read it more closely, it seems to me that that is not what the expert is going to testify. Rather, he's going to say if there were no earnings and profits, then it is a return of capital if the basis is high enough. He's going to testify to that legal proposition. So, my question is, is there any proffer of evidence here where the taxpayer says I want a chance to show there were no earnings or profits?",
  "Where is it?",
  "So what did happen there? I've been looking at page 62 through 66. They are dancing around the issue. It's fair to say that they wouldn't be having these four pages unless they are thinking of return of capital as a defense, but they don't actually say it.",
  "They would have raised it.",
  "I guess the part that they are saying is arbitrary as I understand it, and I appreciate your correcting me if I don't understand it correctly, is that you get double your pension at 55 if you've worked 20 years as opposed to 10. Is that right?",
  "A worker who has been there, he's qualified, he has only worked for 10 years and now he's 55 years old. There is a chart in the SG's brief, and as I read that chart, he got amount \"X\". He started at 45, he ended up at 55, he gets \"X\". If he started at 35 and worked for 20 years, he would get much more than \"X\".",
  "You would get \"Y\", because he worked for 20 years rather than 10; is that right? I'm not talking about a disabled person. I'm talking about anybody.",
  "So if a person works for 20 years, he gets more than if he worked for 10 years; is that right?",
  "Now he is disabled. And when he's disabled, if he's disabled after working only 10 and he is 45 years old, they pretend he had worked the full 20?",
  "Now I understand it. Now, this individual says, I was working there after the age of 55, I only worked for 14 years, now I become disabled. If I become disabled before I was 55, let's say I had six years to go, they would give me six years extra. But because I was disabled after I'm 55, I get nothing extra. Nothing is imputed. Is that right?",
  "I didn't ask you for the reasons. I want to know if I'm factually right.",
  "Where am I factually wrong?",
  "You're giving me reasons. I'll ask you in a second for the reasons. I want to know if what I said is factually true?",
  "And not after?",
  "Okay. Now I'll say that I think is the discrimination of which he is complaining. And now what he would like to know is what possible reason is there for that difference? Now I'd like to hear what the reason is that justifies that difference. You give him six extra years when he retired after 14 years and though he was only 49 years old, and you don't give him even one extra year when everything else was the same but he retired after he was 55. Now, explain to me what the reason is for that.",
  "No. He says now, what he says to that, I take it, is fine. He is 49 years old. He has six years to go to qualify for retirement, so let him retire. If you let him retire, and you gave him 14 years of credit, you would be treating him just like you're treating me. But in addition to letting him retire, you give him six extra years of credit, which at two and-a-half percent per year. Good, I'm glad you do that. Give me the six extra years at two and-a-half percent as well. Treat us alike. What's your response?",
  "But that's the point, right?",
  "There -- that's what the complaint is, I think, that you say it's the second part that you just said. What you do when the person is disabled and he is not yet 55 -- he hasn't qualified yet -- is you both qualify him, and when you qualify him you give him credit for years he hasn't worked. Now, the older person who is still working and is also disabled says: Fine, you let me retire, but you don't give me any extra years. Now that's the complaint, I think. So that if you had a person who had started at 45, eligible to retire at 55, works for 4 years and becomes disabled, he is credited with 14 years; while the person who started at 35 and at 45 becomes disabled, he is given 20 years. He is given the 10 extra years. So the first person, older person, says: You gave him some extra years; you didn't have to give him those extra years in order to qualify him to retire. You could have just said you can retire, but you gave him 10 extra years and you give me no extra years. Why not?",
  "You don't need anything to bring you to normal retirement. You could rewrite the plan and say when a person becomes disabled you get retirement, right at that moment. You could say that. And what the plaintiff is saying is, why don't you say that? Though it's a bit mean. But I think what he would probably like is you would extend the extra years to him.",
  "See, that's why I think the result in this case is just terrible. I think it takes disabled people and cuts their benefits with no benefit. I cannot believe for two minutes that Congress would have intended that result. But the reason I asked you the question was I want you to tell me how to get to that result under this statute.",
  "Let me ask you this sort of basic question: Does it use age any differently than it uses years of service?",
  "What is wrong with using that as a benchmark? If you can fire a person when he is 55, why can't you use it as a benchmark as to how much you're going to give a disability person on pension?",
  "The lesser or greater - - this would be an instance where greater includes lesser for the reason that this lesser business has no stereotypes. All they're trying to do is to help people who are disabled at a time when they are younger and probably have fairly good expenses, and everybody gets this kind of insurance. And this man who is the Plaintiff here had it, too, while he was there. So it's true you are really using in a minimal sense age, but you are doing it in a statute that permits you to do it because it's a lesser version of that.",
  "It doesn't say it's inapplicable. I wasn't saying it's inapplicable. What I am worried about -- and this is a perfect example of people using absolutely mechanical rules, and particularly when you talk about pension systems, which, of course, age is relevant to a pension system, and what they do is find comparisons; and, before you know it, you are in the kind of a -- of a hamburger situation where it's so chopped up that perfectly worthwhile things are forbidden. And this would seem to be a number 1 exhibit.",
  "No, because what you are looking at is to see whether the purpose of Congress is somehow implicated, a purpose designed to prevent stereotypical thinking from being used to put older people at a disadvantage. And there is no indication that this is so in this case.",
  "Now, what's the response?",
  "What about this idea, which is -- would this wreck the statute? You say we're talking about age, which is not an immutable characteristic. Everybody goes through it. Everybody is younger, everybody is older. And therefore we take the word \"discriminate\" and the word \"discriminate\" in this context, when considered in terms of pension requirements, which inevitably are age mixed to a considerable degree, means that if there are plausible justifications and no significant reason for thinking that it reflects stereotypical thinking, that it does not fall within the scope of the word \"discriminate.\"",
  "I started out by saying, that's why I said that this is not an immutable characteristic, and it is -- that's why I put all the qualifications in there.",
  "Would it be the same as - - I mean it seems to me now -- I'm thinking the problem is we are going into the package; we are starting opening up the package that the 55-year-old retiree normally gets. Suppose they said this: here's what we'll do to the disabled person. We'll treat him just as if he retired at 55. He is only 35; and, moreover, at 55 when you retire in our police force, we give you a big party and a gold watch. Well, we don't do that if you retire later on. Same kind of claim. Why not? Over 65 years old, he retired. Hey, you didn't give him the gold watch. Why did you give the other person the gold watch? You said the reason is we treat them all like we treat them when you retire at 55.",
  "That's fair, that you don't understand.",
  "You don't really -- I mean, that's what I wonder if there is no such evidence. How could you get evidence? It used to be common maybe urban legends, but of political bosses voting whole graveyards of dead people. All right. Now, that would be almost impossible to catch, I think. Someone walks in, saying: I'm Joe Smith. He doesn't say: I'm Joe Smith dead. He says, I'm Joe Smith, and he signs something. And the poll worker looks at it and the signature looks very weird. Well, what's the poll worker supposed to do? He's not going to go disrupt the election. And is there going to be a policeman there to follow this person home? Of course not. So that's their claim. Their claim is that we have a lot of anecdotes and there is a certain kind of fraud that you really just can't catch at the poll.",
  "Now, what's your response to that? Because that's their argument on the other side.",
  "I know there are arguments on both sides. But at the heart of this is what was Judge Posner's claim and others that this isn't the kind of fraud that you can just dismiss and say it never happens because the person would walk into the poll later and try to vote. What they are talking about is what Justice Scalia was talking about, and I'm simply trying to focus your answer on that part of the question.",
  "Well, they say that's because you can't catch it.",
  "How would you catch it, which is my question.",
  "Well, if you're worried about fraud - -",
  "If you're worried about fraud, what I don't understand, and I'd like to track it through with you, is the registration system. As I read the Indiana voter registration application, all a person has to do to register is to write in, enclose a utility bill that has his name and address, and if he doesn't have a photo ID, he can write the four numbers of his Social Security; and if he doesn't have that either he doesn't have to do anything, and they will give him a number -- and you mail it in. And you're registered. So all a person who have to do if he wants to be fraudulent is make out a fraud one of those, and he has a photo ID; he can go to the polls. So my question to you is this: given that system of registration, focusing on the issue before us, why don't you just say and we'll give to you -- you put on -- if you don't have a photo ID, we'll give you one. Now there it would not stand as an obstacle; that apparently is what Georgia has done. And it doesn't require people to go out and spend $10 or $5 or something digging up their birth certificate, which if you tried to do, is quite a job for many people. And therefore, you'd have all the things you want. All you would do is with the 43,000 people who don't have the IDs, you'd say we'll get you one. No big deal. You have a photo machine there when they come in to register; they have to go down; you take a picture of them and you hand it to them. And I would think that that less restrictive way would satisfy your anti-fraud interests far better than the way you've chosen, but I leave my judgment out of it. I just would like you to talk through why that isn't a less restrictive way, which is far better in achieving your anti-fraud interests, or at least as good.",
  "We are going to give -- all we are doing is, we will give you the photo. It has nothing to do with validity. That photo proves that Mr. Smith who comes in and asks for it is the same Mr. Smith who registered to vote. And that's all your system does in the first place. So what is the answer to that?",
  "I'm not arguing about that. I'm saying your whole -- I'll repeat it once more. I'm saying your whole system is a system designed to assure that the person at the voting booth is the same as the person who registers. I accept that, absolutely right. And I'm simply saying given that, why didn't you say Mr. Proto -- Mr. Likely, like to register: \"Come in. If you don't have a photo ID, we will give you one.\" Now, what's the objection to that?",
  "Did you -- excuse me, sorry, General.",
  "The particular illegal arrest here, to bring this down to earth a little bit, is I take it they arrested him because he had a suspended -- he was driving without a good license?",
  "Okay. So that Virginia law says if you stop somebody, arrest him -- if you stop somebody, you know he doesn't have a license to drive, you can arrest him if you think he's going to continue driving? Can't you?",
  "Okay. So the policemen here, according to you and I guess the Virginia court, made a misjudgment. He thought this guy might still drive somewhere or he might have thought it or a policeman in similar circumstances might have thought it. So Virginia says if, in fact, policemen, you stop somebody for suspended -- for driving without a license, and you make a mistake, you arrest him, we don't think that's a big deal, because who knows if he's going to continue to drive. We don't even suspend. We don't even suspend. We don't even suppress the evidence. That's Virginia. So if Virginia isn't going to suppress the evidence because they think it's not a big deal to make, for the policeman to make a mistake as to whether a person who's driving without a license will keep driving once the policeman goes away, why do you think Thomas Jefferson and everybody else thought that that was such a big deal that the evidence had to be suppressed?",
  "What is the difference between this and Whren? That is, in Whren the arrest violated a D.C. regulation that says a plainclothes officer cannot approach a car except in immediate cases of immediate danger. And in Whren we said that isn't such a big deal and we don't think the Fourth Amendment turns on that kind of triviality. All right. If it doesn't turn on that kind of arrest procedure triviality, is how we characterized it there, how is this any any different?",
  "Can we go back for a second? Because, the reason I asked my question is I was thinking about this very differently, and I just want to have an answer, and I want your best thinking on this. My thought is that the answer to the question of whether it violates the Fourth Amendment when a State - - when a person is arrested in violation of State law, the answer is: it depends. Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Obviously, if there is no probable cause or if there wasn't a crime at all, as just defined, the answer is yes; but then I look at Whren and it says if all that was at stake was a kind of arrest procedure State law, herein -- there embodied in a rule, the answer is no. So I look at this one. And this one it seems to me there is probable cause; it is a crime; moreover, it is a crime for which the State permits arrest where the officer subjectively thinks he's likely to keep driving. So it seems to me that's maybe much more close to what we had in Whren. Now I want you to say -- I want your comments on what I -- it's hypothetical, my statement, because I want to get your reaction to that point of view. I'm not saying I hold it. But I'm putting it forward so that I can get your reaction and argument.",
  "Putting cases aside for the moment - -",
  "I mean if we reach this question, you must have lost on the first question. I mean you win -- if you win on the first question, you win. If you -- all right. If you have lost on the first question, this is not an unreasonable search -- arrest, rather, under the Fourth Amendment. And, moreover, it's not enough of a big deal, so the State makes it suppressible. Otherwise, a -- and so now we're talking about minor things under State law that is secondary at the least. And there, when the policeman make a mistake about that, the reason we let him search is he might be hurt, the policeman. There's danger involved. And so I don't see why at the moment that rationale wouldn't apply just as strongly with a reason for it being unlawful under State but not Federal law is a violation of one of these subsidiary rules whether he, you know, thought the guy was going to keep driving under the suspended license or, you know, might be risky or might not show up.",
  "What is it -- I should know this, but I don't. Imagine that Jones and Smith, civil engineers, builders, enter into a contract. They have an arbitration provision suspiciously like this one. It says we promise to arbitrate everything, any dispute, including a dispute about whether this agreement is legal or not itself. They have that. They go to the arbitrator. Jones says: You know, Mr. Arbitrator, you don't know that much about civil engineering, but there's a judge here who does. So I think what I'm going to do tomorrow is file a lawsuit in the superior court in California making the same claims I'm making here and maybe that judge will decide it first and then you'll be really helped. Now what stops him from doing that in the law?",
  "The Federal -- the Federal Arbitration Act says what that makes it clear he can't do that?",
  "I mean, I grant you if he can do it you might as well tear up the Federal Arbitration Act and throw it out the window. But I just want to know what is it in the law specifically that stops him from doing that.",
  "So even though it's not - -",
  "Well, but that -- that's what I'm driving at, and I think that's interesting, that there's an implicit -- because it doesn't say it explicitly -- there's an implicit promise not to undermine this contract by running off to court.",
  "All right. And so you can't -- no case comes to your mind where anybody has tried that little end run? And - -",
  "I agree, I don't see how they could, but I just want to get to the bottom of it.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, the question is obvious. The question just follows from what I said. You were there nodding your head when everybody seems seemed to agree that the Jones versus Smith, they can't go run off to court. So you're just about to address this, and I hope you'll include the answer to the question, which is if they can't run off to the Federal -- to the State court judge, the superior court judge, to get his opinion on the matter, why can they run off to this man, namely the talent agency expert - -",
  "-- who happens to be an administrative agency? Why does it matter?",
  "It sounds as if you made the argument -- well, you say we cited a case.",
  "Okay. The answer to Justice Souter's question is no, we didn't raise it below. Is that right?",
  "Could California law do this? I mean could they say, you know, we have a problem. By the way, this is just a hypothetical. We think that our judges in the Superior Court don't know very much about building disputes. Now, I say it is a hypothetical because, in fact, Superior Court judges in California are excellent judges. But California thinks, no, they don't know enough about it. So here's what we do. We say when Jones and Smith enter into an arbitration agreement, if it happens to concern a building dispute, they have to go to Federal -- they can go to the Superior Court. In fact, if they want to, if one of them wants to, the other one doesn't. And everything is delayed while the Superior Court judge decides all the issues in the case. And then after they can go back to arbitration, if of course they still want to. Could California do that?",
  "I've read the agreement, and I don't quite find their -- here - -",
  "In my mind is what they do is they have the same standard arbitration clause. So I'm asking not about the parties; I'm asking about California.",
  "No. The answer is no. I thought so. And so now you explain to me how this is any different than what I just said, other than substituting the words \"Labor Commissioner\" for \"California Superior Court\" and substituting the words \"talent dispute\" for the words \"building dispute.\"",
  "Well, I guess that would be a question for the arbitrator.",
  "Right, this is -- this is -- actually now we are getting to the bottom of something here, I think. Now, I am beginning to understand where you are coming from; and Volt does offer you considerable support, as I -- as I agreed.",
  "All right. Now, Volt, however, is a case, I take it, in which the stay that was entered was a stay staying the arbitration pending the resolution of a judicial dispute that was not subject to arbitrability.",
  "Therefore, it seems to me that the question here concerns the meaning of this contract, and that's where we started.",
  "Does this contract mean that the parties who entered have promised, one, not themselves to go to court? Answer: Yes.",
  "Two, not themselves to bring a proceeding before this administrative agency? And that's where he says yes, and you say no.",
  "And then is the proper resolution of that to say: Well, you can raise that, too, before the arbitrator?",
  "Why not?",
  "Regardless of the -- I now understand better than I did what I take as a pretty strong argument. I'm not saying convincing, but strong. And that would be this: If you go look at Volt, and in Volt the Court said that the California Code meant that the individual who'd entered into the arbitration contract could go and can ask a superior court to stay an arbitration while some unrelated - - some unrelated -- I mean directly related but not the same parties -- litigation took place. The Court didn't in Volt say that that question of interpreting this contract is for the arbitrator. I don't know why it didn't. But it didn't. Now here he's making a parallel argument. He's saying that the California Code says that people should first go to that Labor Commissioner and that you can stay arbitration while that goes on. Now -- and I say well, why don't you go to the arbitrator? He says I don't want to go to the arbitrator on that one, but he points to Volt. And so the puzzle is this: if the Court in Volt didn't say this is a matter for the arbitrator, whether the contract really means that you promise not to go into court and make a motion to stay, why here is it a matter for the arbitrator whether you implicitly promised not to go into court and asked him to stay pending the outcome of this administrative proceeding? What do you think about that?",
  "Well, I -- I accept that. I see a lot of common sense on your side of it. But imagine I'm writing an opinion in your favor and now I come to the following paragraph which I have to write: \"Your opponent says that Volt controls here; but that is wrong because\" -- and now fill in the blank for me.",
  "Now, I'm just saying I have to write. I see all the common sense of your position. I -- absolutely. But to get -- you only need one really good argument. And he's saying whatever the other ones are, here Breyer or somebody is going to have to write the words, and Volt is different because -- so I would like some help on that one.",
  "If you're quoting that, then this is what's now bothering me. I'm not saying I have an answer one way or the other. Let's take two crimes and imagine that the same number of people injured or killed is identical for the two. One let's say is burglary and the other is driving under the influence. Now, let's imagine exactly the same number are put at risk, exactly the same number hurt, exactly the same number killed. When I wrote that opinion, it seemed to me that there still is an important difference between the two crimes that is controlling here. But if you look at what I wrote, I didn't articulate that difference very well. So I would like you to tell me what I should have said in order to have said very clearly just what that intuitive difference was.",
  "So there is no State where speeding -- even if maybe you hurt somebody or something -- there is no State where speeding is under a statute that you could be imprisoned for more than a year?",
  "Well, a felony as defined here. I just wanted to be sure you're focusing -- it's defined here as \"subject to by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\" Now is - -",
  "Okay, I just want to be sure we're on the same wavelength. Fine.",
  "Then they could have turned it just on dangerousness. I'm back to Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg's question, and I'm simply sort of repeating those in a sense that make it quite specific. Imagine a universe of crimes. Every member of that universe we concede has precisely the same degree of danger as arson, explosives, burglary. So there's no argument about the risk to human life. It is identical. And now we write a statute, and the statute's object is to take people who are felons in possession of a gun and those persons whom it is particularly bad that they have a gun are going to go away for 15 years minimum. So what we're looking are people who are particularly bad that they have a gun. Now go back to our universe, and in that universe we have some things on the one hand like arson, but on the other hand -- I have to name a few, environmental crimes committed by negligence or recklessness, where somebody flushed a toxic substance down the drain or -- here's a good one I found -- if you are a steamboat captain or an executive of a steamboat company and you fail through negligence or simple inadvertence to stop somebody from not inspecting a lifeboat, well, felony or worse. And there are quite a few dozens of these things: Failing to stop at an inspection station if you are a trucker. You know? There are quite a few, where what's at issue is negligence, thoughtlessness, and maybe even recklessness, but it seems to have nothing -- and it's dangerous -- but has nothing to do with whether, when later on you want a gun, you are a greater risk for having a gun, you're more likely to pull the trigger, you're more likely to aim it at somebody and shoot him. Now, that's I think what we are trying to drive at.",
  "Is a person who deliberately burns down buildings, is a person who if he had a gun might pull the trigger? And I will suggest that's a reasonable inference. I also will give you this: That a person who's so careless as to go drunk driving is a person whose gun might go off carelessly or he might leave it around the house. So I'll give you that one. But my instinct is that Congress, in this Act, is not worried about guns going off carelessly around the house. They are worried about a person being the kind of person who will point a gun at somebody and pull the trigger. Now, is there something you can say that disabuses me of that instinct?",
  "Well, going back to what you first said, suppose with your own children: I told you half an hour ago not to interrupt your sister when she is doing her homework. This is the second time you've done it. Wouldn't you, with your own child -- I would with mine -- think that the second time he did it was worse behavior than the first time? I just told him not to.",
  "Well, if it's absolutely right I don't see why we hold Congress to some kind of weird -- not weird, but more picky standard than we do with our own children.",
  "Because their behavior is worse.",
  "That isn't what I tell my child. I say you behaved worse.",
  "Well, does the word \"offense\" -- I haven't come across it, but does the word \"offense\" have some kind of special technical meaning that doesn't just mean the behavior which calls into play all kinds of circumstances?",
  "That's the part I'm not getting. I mean, that's why it doesn't help your client. In general, if you did read the word \"offense\" as applying just to the act of selling drugs, let's say, then you go on and it says, for which a maximum term of 10 years or more is prescribed, you'd say, well what is the maximum term prescribed for the offense of selling drugs? And the answer would be 10 years. Now, how do you get out of that?",
  "You're saying because - - because fewer people are likely to get the 10-year sentence than get the five-year sentence?",
  "What is -- what is the distinguishing -- how do you get out of it? I know you're trying to say this and I'm just not getting it.",
  "So it's bank robbery - - bank robbery, force or threat of force guidelines. If you have a gun, eight years. If you brandish it, four more years. If you take, you know, $10 as opposed to $50, two years, eight years, six years. The statute, by the way, says a max of 20 years. Now, what's the - - what's -- does this fall within it? Doesn't it? Does it depend on whether he brandished it? What does it depend on, in your view?",
  "Or what he actually faced -- that, I agree with you, that won't work because of the guidelines, if they were mandatory. But what they're saying here is it's right in the statute. You just look at the statute that has the definition of what the offense is.",
  "No, I'm back to the same question then. I mean which one do we pick?",
  "You see that my question is going in the exact opposite way. What I am finding hard is once you distinguish offender and offense characteristics in the way you do, why not jump to the max for the offense? And so I'm asking you, how is it you get out of that? Which is the same question I had before. I'm not so worried about your case as I am other cases.",
  "Am I thinking about that part correctly? I -- I found this difficult. I go back to the railroad; that seems the easiest case. You have a railroad in 50 States, and Illinois finds it very hard to evaluate its -- evaluate its value, its railroad property in Illinois, because the value of that depends on service everywhere. So the court says that's the unitary principle; and really what you're supposed to look at is whether when you look at the supposedly separate part of the business, does that separate part of the business contribute to the whole thing? So that if you were in fact trying to say what is Illinois doing without considering that separate part, it would be tough to do. I mean, that's the underlying theme.",
  "And if that's so, there is no second test. I mean, I grant you there is language, but really what people have done is they've said, we are here in a special situation because we have an interest in another company, and that's a special part of our business, and has nothing to do with the rest of the business. And then the argument is no, it does have something to do with the rest of the business. And if it does, like it provides you with working capital, it's just like the railroad track in California vis-a-vis Illinois.",
  "And if it doesn't, it doesn't. So now, if that's right, then it's the form of analysis rather than the result that's wrong in the court below. Because they start talking about two separate tests and then people argue whether the second should swallow up the first, and at that point I get totally lost. It's fairly long, but I'd appreciate your evaluating what I've just said.",
  "That's not the question. I thought that the -- I agree with the same question Justice Kennedy had. Suppose that I'm a Massachusetts company that sells tables, and I sell some tables in Illinois. And one day I take some of the money, and I buy an iron mine in New Mexico. And then I sell the iron mine. And Illinois, not Massachusetts, wants to impose a tax. And suppose there is no connection whatsoever between the iron mine and anything else but for four, which are the four listed on page 13a: One, that I have contributed capital support to the iron mine. Two, I approve the major capital expenditures of the iron mine, sitting in my office in Massachusetts. Three, sometimes -- and this is a tougher one -- I call the iron mine a division of my table company. And, four, I sometimes retain tax benefits and control over the extra cash of the iron mine, but I'm not using it in my day-to-day work. Now, are those four things alone sufficient for Illinois to tax the sale of my iron mine? That, it seems to me, is the way they presented it. Maybe it is a unitary business really, but I guess we have to send it back for that.",
  "All right. Then why isn't that the end of this case? That's what they said it was. That's what they said, perhaps wrongly, that this isn't a unitary business. And, therefore, we are left with those four facts, and why not send it back and say you haven't reached the unitary-business question; go reach it?",
  "What? What? What could it be? That is -- as I read this, I thought, well, there is no separate test. It's just there's a certain situation that comes up fairly commonly where someone claims that an asset of a company was really quite separate, and therefore when they get income from it or they sell it it has nothing to do with my business. And the answer is: It did have something to do with your business, you used the working capital and so forth, in which case it's part of the business. So how -- how is it -- how is it different from that?",
  "Well, if you agree with that, do you really agree, because if you agree with that there's no such separate test, this court was wrong to consider it separately, the lower court, and they should have reached the question they didn't reach, which was is this whole thing one single business, which is normally called the unitary business test?",
  "Good. All right.",
  "But you couldn't put in - - you are authorized to sell the bicycle pedals that I have patented only if you impose a restriction that will tell the bicycle user that he must send me a check for $15 in addition to whatever he pays you. That sounds unlawful under contract law.",
  "Or you are going to have - - I mean, there's a doctrine that you cannot impose equitable servitude's upon chattel.",
  "That's a contract law doctrine.",
  "My thought is that the reason that these things are important and you can't just draft your way around them is because there are antitrust doctrines, there are contract-law doctrines, that also limit in significant ways what you can and cannot write into a contract.",
  "Well, there's a reason, I guess, that would be so. Imagine that I want to buy some bicycle pedals, so I go to the bicycle shop. These are fabulous pedals. The inventor has licensed somebody to make them, and he sold them to the shop, make and sell them. He sold them to the shop. I go buy the pedals. I put it in my bicycle. I start pedaling down the road. Now, we don't want 19 patent inspectors chasing me or all of the other companies and there are many doctrines in the law designed to stop that. One is the equitable servitudes on chattel. Another is the exhaustion of a patent. And now you talk about implied license. I would say, why does it make that much difference? What we're talking about here is whether after those pedals are sold to me under an agreement that the patent -- you know, you have a right to sell them to me -- why can't I look at this as saying that patent is exhausted, the patent on the pedals and the patent for those bicycles insofar as that patent for the bicycles says I have a patent on inserting the pedal into a bicycle. Call it exhaustion, call it implied license. Who cares?",
  "Ah, but I thought - -",
  "Yes. Of course, I think the answer to that is no, probably no, but, but, but, but. Now you can clarify this because I may be off on a wrong track. I thought we're talking about using the sold item in those mechanisms which account for virtually almost the only logical use of the sold item. Thus, if you took the bicycle blanks -- not the bicycle blanks; they are eyeglass blanks. I'm mixed up between bicycles and eyeglasses, there we are. But if you took the eyeglass blanks and you use them for the purpose of growing plants instead of inserting them into eyeglasses, I guess we'd have had a different case.",
  "And I take it here they are using those chips in those mechanisms that the chips are almost exclusively designed for and there isn't much else to use them for. Am I right or wrong?",
  "All right, now if it should be protected -- and here I'm not sure I'm understanding it, so correct me. Let's suppose we have this contract. So everything is identical except we've got my bicycle example in here because I'm more comfortable with that. I know how to ride a bicycle and I don't know how to work the chips. So what I do - -",
  "But you see the analogy I'm making.",
  "So what I do I go to the shop and I buy this, this mechanism with the pedals on it, and then I insert it in my bicycle. Now, actually I need help in doing that, but I do it. Okay. Now I start pedaling off, and now what is it for all these things here that would stop that original inventor from catching me and hauling me into court, and say, what you've done, Breyer, is you've put my -- my mechanism here in this bicycle and I happen to have a patent on the system. And now you start talking to me about, well, the patent was exhausted on the bicycle - -",
  "-- pedals, but not on the system.",
  "And you agree that shouldn't happen.",
  "But if I follow you and I write an opinion just for you, what stops it from happening?",
  "Then why isn't it in your case?",
  "Why doesn't it mean that? Why isn't it in your case equally?",
  "You mean that they just got it all wrong? You mean it should be that they got it wrong?",
  "Oh, so if I go in the bicycle shop, I go in the bicycle shop and I buy the pedals and then they give me, you know, one of these pieces of paper that has all of the 42,000 words on it and there in these 42,000 words it says, and now you are put on notice that once you put it in your bicycle and you pedal away, they're going to get you and you're going to be hauled into Patent Court, then -- then that's okay?",
  "Then explain -- now this you might know because it's just following up on what Justice Souter said better than I did. I think from these briefs I've gotten the impression that at least some people think that where you invent a component, say, like the bicycle pedals, and it really has only one use, which is to go into a bicycle, it's the easiest thing in the world to get a patent not just on that component but to also get a patent on the system, which is called handlebars, body, and pedals. And since that's just a drafting question, all that we would do by finding in your favor is to destroy the exhaustion doctrine, because all that would happen, if it hasn't happened already, is these brilliant patent lawyers, and they don't even -- they can be great patent lawyers, not just fine lawyers, and just draft it the way I said and that's the end of the exhaustion doctrine. And that's why it is preferable to say it is exhausted. What is exhausted? One, the patent on this component and, two, the patent on any system involving this component where that system is the only reasonable use of the component, rather than using the terminology \"implied license.\" Now, I think that's an argument that's being made in some of these briefs, and if so I'd like to you reply.",
  "The answer is that it doesn't exclude them, that they have all these collective bargaining rights; they have the civil service rights; they can go and bring their same claim with other remedies. You could make the opposite claim: Why should they have two rights? Everybody else has one. I mean, that seems to me what they're argument is underlying this. Then when you go to Title VII -- and this I don't understand fully. Look at Title VII and Title VII in 16(e) has a basic ban. Is that right?",
  "And then, in 16(d) it says certain of those things govern Federal suits, suits against the Federal Government. Then it incorporates some provisions. And it says that you get that certain relief against the Federal Government where there is discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Then it says \"or in violation of 3(a).\" And then 3(a) refers to retaliation. So it looks like Title VII does give you a remedy, in 3(a), for retaliation. And it's rather specific, and that suggests that those other words don't pick up retaliation. It's rather that specific thing. Now, what have I missed?",
  "Well, you could say that, but you could also say, well, look here in Title VII Congress has some words, and these words give you a specific -- if you're a Federal employee and somebody's retaliating against you because you went and complained about race or something, just read those words; you can bring a lawsuit, right? Am I right about that?",
  "No?",
  "You go to the EEOC?",
  "Well, I'm not totally certain what I'm talking about either. So we could go on.",
  "Or in violation of - -",
  "Well, could you proceed with that? That is, a very simple way of thinking of this as one possible way of reading it is that Congress says: When private employers discriminate, there can be whistleblower's, and they need protection; so let's put some in. When State officials discriminate, say, on the basis of race, there can be some whistleblower's. Maybe they protect them in some States; maybe they don't protect them in others. We better put some in. When Federal Government officials discriminate against on the basis of race, whistleblower's should be protected. But we have a whole system here to protect them. And so let's just use that system and treat all whistleblower's alike, and that's the end of the matter. We don't need any special protection for whistleblower's here. Now, the answer to that is what?",
  "Am I right now in thinking, just as a matter of practice, where there is retaliation, a claim of retaliation in respect to race discrimination, Federal Government, that the person making that claim can go to the EEOC and then to court? That's right?",
  "The same thing in respect to age, they can't, and what they have to do is they go through the civil service system or the collective bargaining agreement; is that right?",
  "No, not what they do if their claim is a retaliation claim.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. And now, do you have -- two things: A, do you have any evidence one way or the other that one of these two systems -- the civil service plus collective bargaining, on the other hand; or EEOC plus the court, on the other -- works better, works the same, works worse?",
  "No. So we don't know.",
  "Yes. Now what reason - - okay. So we don't know.",
  "But that's drawing something from where you don't know. Okay. So that's fair enough. But is there any -- what is the best reason, in your opinion, that Congress would have wanted to make this distinction? What are the best two or three reasons? If you were just starting with a blank slate, why would Congress have wanted to send the one to the one route and the other to the other route.",
  "For the people who complained about race.",
  "But I'm asking you, and if you were sitting there writing it, my -- my thought - - the conclusion that I would reach from what you're saying is you can't think of any reason why you'd treat them differently.",
  "Who -- who is such a person?",
  "Why can't they -- why can't they go to like the Merit System Protection Board?",
  "So they are outside the Civil Service, and they don't have unions?",
  "They don't have a union?",
  "So they could be fired for anything.",
  "What happens in just a basic employment case? I'm trying to remember from law school. Somebody's contract with another man, he's the employee, and he says -- the employer says: I'm firing you because you won't help me rob the bank. Or the employee goes and he finds some money in a wallet or something on the street, and he says, I'm going to return it to the rightful owner, and the employer says, I hate rightful owners, so I'm firing you. Now, when the employee goes to court, I take it -- my vague recollection is the employer can't do that.",
  "The State law, is there some kind of policy against that from the State law, he couldn't do it?",
  "Well, here we have a Federal statute that says that a black person shall have the same right to make a contract as a white person. But if nobody ever can report on that, that they're not, it's not going to be the same right; it's going to be zero right. So, why by parity of reasoning wouldn't this provide for the same kind of thing?",
  "Oh, no. It would make no difference whether you're a thief in my example, whether you're good-hearted. It doesn't matter who you are. You could even be somebody from another country. You don't have to be American. You could be anything. But the State law tries to follow out that -- that policy of not having bank robberies and of returning money to rightful owners. Well, here we have a Federal policy, and the Federal policy is that black people shall be treated the same as white in respect to making a contract. But were the law to allow you to fire anybody who complained about it, then black people wouldn't have that right. And therefore the policy is that you can't do it under this statute because otherwise the written policy is ineffective. I'm just remembering that from my written - - from my policy arguments that were in contract law.",
  "Does it say anywhere, by the way, in that statute that a black person who is discriminated against can go to court and file a lawsuit?",
  "Does it say that?",
  "Yes. Does it say is in that statute, 1981?",
  "Yes, correct.",
  "No. Okay.",
  "And have we developed a policy here in creating a right of action under this 1981?",
  "Which is the statute that does -- is there a statute that specifically gives you a right to sue under 1981? Is there a statute?",
  "It has established it. Yes, that's my point: That the Federal court implied from the statute a right of action. Now, if they're implying a right of action from the statute, why wouldn't courts also imply those rights of action necessary to make the statute effective?",
  "That isn't the word I was looking for. The word I was looking for in 1981(a) is the word \"and can bring a lawsuit in Federal court.\" I don't see that written there.",
  "No, correct. So we've implied that. And therefore, if I can imply that, why can't we imply a lawsuit on behalf of those who need the lawsuit to make the right effective?",
  "That was my basic question.",
  "Why not? Because the legislative history does say, when they passed this, that the new law will involve a claim, allow them to make a claim of harassment, discharge, promotion, transfer, retaliation, and hiring.",
  "So when they write that in the House report, isn't that some evidence that they did look back and see Sullivan, and they did think that in 1982 there's a retaliation action, and therefore in 1981 there is one? Isn't there at least evidence that there were people in Congress thinking that?",
  "And that someone - -",
  "Well, I think we're familiar with that debate. But if we can look -- look at the statute, if I ask you why isn't this an enjoyment of a benefit, a privilege or term or a condition of the contract, is your answer that this was an at-will contract?",
  "All right.",
  "All right, because I don't think that's is a good argument. Why isn't this a benefit or a privilege that's been denied?",
  "But is the rationale of those cases -- and it's important to get the right rationale. If I say this and I'm wrong tell me I'm wrong. And I thought that the heart of it is not that the retaliated -- the act of retaliation is discrimination. It isn't. What they say is when the white man helps the black man from being discriminated against, it falls within the statute, not because you've discriminated against the black man, but because if it didn't fall within the statute it would seriously erode or destroy the black man's right. That's what it seemed to me Douglas said in Sullivan.",
  "And so then we're looking very hard in a place for a word that couldn't be there.",
  "Maybe I should ask you this now because you've probably thought about it and I can't work it out. I don't see any problem with the word \"location.\" I thought what you would say is it isn't the transportation in this instance that concealed the location, it's the method of transportation that sealed the location.",
  "And if you read it that literally, then there is no problem in getting to your interpretation of the statute, or is there? Because since you didn't advance that argument, I thought maybe there's something I've not seen here.",
  "I still don't see why isn't what the Chief Justice said absolutely right? If you are transporting this money to get it out of town so the police can't find it, you're transporting it to conceal it. That falls right within the statute.",
  "If you're transporting it simply to pay some courier somewhere else, you're not transporting it to conceal it. And if in fact the transportation is done in a way that conceals it, that's beside the point because the statute is interested in transporting it in order to conceal it.",
  "What is wrong with that?",
  "You go back to Justice Alito's question. I agree with you that you could read this as including a prohibition against a method of transportation which method is to hide the money. You could. But you could also read it the way that the question suggests, to refer only to the transportation. So you transport it physically in order later to hide it. Now, the difference between the two is if we accept yours, which is the broader, this statute includes everything that has nothing to do with the common word \"money laundering.\" Any time you hide something, for whatever reason you hide it, to take it to pay the couriers, you're money laundering. Any time you run a gambling operation and the people stick the money in the wad of their shoe, they're money laundering. I mean, why would you think Congress would want that narrow reading when it can be read to focus much more closely on money laundering just by reading it literally for what it says?",
  "He purposely puts it in his shoe, okay.",
  "It's a design. He knows he's going to do it. So -- and you're saying, I take it, 100 percent of the time that's illegal. If you're not saying that, I don't understand what you're saying.",
  "If you are saying that, I don't know why they call this statute \"Laundering of Monetary Instruments.\" Why didn't they call it \"shoe hiding\"?",
  "How does that show what you want it to show? I mean, what I just heard you say is that Senator Biden said if we make it very tough to launder money in the United States, then criminals will send their money abroad to be laundered.",
  "They'll transport it abroad in order to launder it. How does that help you?",
  "In order to launder it. Were they not talking about money laundering?",
  "Or were they not talking about it? I'm just going back -- I didn't read Senator Biden's statement, so I'm just curious.",
  "Let's just say you use something like primary jurisdiction said that they actually have to -- to withdraw it. Now, if the FDA - - this is what Justice Stevens said in his concurring opinion, which I thought had a lot to be said for it - - that if you had a system where the FDA did withdraw it and found fraud, you could ask them, and then nothing wrong with the plaintiff going ahead there.",
  "You don't have any problem.",
  "That's not - -",
  "All that makes -- makes it worse, in a sense, because what you're saying to me anyway -- and you can explain why I'm not right -- that all of the three things that you mentioned are only aspects of something much more fundamental that underlies all these cases -- Medtronics, drugs, all of them. You came up and began and said this drug has side effects that hurt people. And that's a risk when you have a drug, and it's a terrible thing if the drug hurts people. There's a risk on the other side. There are people who are dying or seriously sick, and if you don't get the drug to them they die. So there's a problem. You've got to get drugs to people and at the same time the drug can't hurt them. Now, who would you rather have make the decision as to whether this drug is, on balance, going to save people or, on balance, going to hurt people? An expert agency, on the one hand, or 12 people pulled randomly for a jury role who see before them only the people whom the drug hurt and don't see those who need the drug to cure them? Now, that it seems to me is Congress's fundamental choice, and Congress has opted for the agency. And that's why we're here - -",
  "-- because you want the jury to do it. And it seems to me, reading Buckman, that Buckman says the agency should do it. So that's what underlies all my reactions to this, and I might as well get it right out so that you can answer.",
  "Ms. Zieve, it doesn't object to a system where the -- a court -- the State would come in and give you your tort suit if it's really true that the agency would withdraw this drug. But what you want is to be able to convince the jury that there was fraud in a situation where the agency doesn't say there was fraud. So what you're doing is removing a drug from the market that they want out there. Now, that's the theory of Buckman. The theory of Buckman is - -",
  "-- they want to save people whom you say they shouldn't because the drug shouldn't be there. I overstate it slightly. So, explain to me why.",
  "Yes, but it will lead to the drug being withdrawn, in which case there may be just as many people on the other side who are dying, dead, no breadwinner, et cetera, because they didn't get a necessary drug. And that's why what worries me is what happens if the jury is wrong? You are absolutely right when you say you cannot make the FDA go into this matter and withdraw a drug; and they are absolutely right when they say we cannot promise you that juries will be right.",
  "So the the question is: Who is more likely to be right?",
  "Then you think they should be able to litigate a claim where the FDA has approved a drug. Now, is that the law in most places? Where the FDA has approved a drug for use and the doctor follows the label and the label is all okay, is it the case that somebody can come in and say, despite that, this drug is on balance harmful, and I get compensation? This is a serious question. I'm not sure how it works.",
  "So - -",
  "That's the next issue.",
  "I see.",
  "Why? That's where I am missing you. Why, then, does Michigan even have this thing? In other words, why -- you are saying if they didn't have it at all, you would go ahead and bring your tort action.",
  "Thank you.",
  "So to me, which is a good answer, is you are saying: Look at the basic tort system here. And if you can do that, you can do this. Is that -- do you see where I'm - -",
  "I must be just missing something here. Tell me what I'm missing. What about the definition of \"claim\"? It says a claim includes a request under a contract for money or property, and the request is made to the contractor if the United States provides any -- any of the money. Is there an issue here as to whether some of the money provided -- are you saying there was no money provided by the United States or maybe there was no money provided?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well -- so why doesn't that end it? Why doesn't -- how do you win, then, given the language I just read?",
  "\"Claim.\" And there has to be a claim.",
  "That's right, that's right.",
  "But that's why the definition -- it seems to me at the moment -- that's why I'd like your view -- that the language is perfectly ambiguous, the language of \"knowingly makes a false statement to get a false claim paid.\" Now, the \"false claim\" is the claim that they made to the contractor, because that's the definition. And you are saying: Well, they made this statement to get a false claim paid by the government. Now, you could read those words \"paid by the government\" to say \"and there has to be a causal connection,\" which is what you're saying, that you have to make the false statement, make the claim, and that led the government to pay. But you could also say it's paid by the government when the money to pay it comes out of government funds, because it was paid by the government even though the government gave the money to build the school 100 years ago. But it's there in the bank account, and then the contractor took the money from the bank account that the government put in and paid it. In such a case, linguistically, you can say it's paid by the government.",
  "It was a false claim. That's there.",
  "Well, it doesn't say that. It says it was a false claim, which it was. It's false, and it is a claim to the general. And was it paid by the government? Yes. It was paid by the government, even though everything you said is true, because the money to pay it came from government funds. So that's why I'm having a problem. I can read those words \"paid by the government\" either way.",
  "That's true.",
  "What you are saying is covered, I take it -- and this is -- I want to know how this has worked out -- what is covered is -- imagine government grant programs. And suppose there are vast numbers of grant programs now that go to all kinds of entities throughout the country, and a large portion of which are just grants. They're paid and the government is not going to get a penny back. Now, there are instances of frauds in such situations of subs against the person who gets the grant. And in -- I can't imagine a case -- maybe imagine, but it would be imaginary -- where the Government couldn't say: But we got less than the grant was supposed to pay for. And you're saying all those are covered. Is that right?",
  "To get less than it was supposed to get.",
  "And so this is what surprises me on your side. It's 20 years later. And if all those things are covered, given the vast extent of government grant programs in the United States, has your interpretation worked to bring within this statute, and lots of qui tam cases against municipal frauds of all kinds, things that they just never thought of at the time of the Civil War? Do you see what the question is?",
  "Have there been a lot of such cases?",
  "The difference is that government money today is in everything. So if it's in everything, then everything is going to become subject to this False Claims Act. And of course I exaggerate by using the word \"everything,\" but only a little.",
  "Suppose -- you just said to Justice Scalia -- if you have one minute; I rather missed that -- that your point was if you lose on that point you just made and it isn't \"with Federal funds\" and it is that the government has to pay the claim, you still win. That was your point to Justice Scalia, I guess.",
  "Well, what was that argument? Because you said it wasn't in the brief, and what is it? How do you still win?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Do you want to get - - looking at this case of Lake Shore, as I read -- as I read that case, I'm thinking that they looked back to the admiralty case, but they're saying this isn't an admiralty rule. It's a Federal rule. And the Federal rule is that to make the corporation liable for punitives in the absence of bad conduct by anyone in the corporation but for the lower executive, you can't do it. But if it were a higher executive, the president and general manager or, in his absence, the vice president in his place, then you could. So they are distinguishing among levels of corporate officials. Now that seems to be the Federal rule, right?",
  "All right. Now, what happens to that Federal rule? One thing we know happened to it is that time passed; Erie v. Thompkins came along; and most of the relevant cases left the Federal courts or Federal law and were decided under State law. Was there anything left in the Federal system besides admiralty where this Federal rule might apply; and, if so, what happened to it?",
  "Well, what happened? And the reason I think I'd like to know is because it seems to me it makes a difference from the point of view of stare decisis whether the Federal rule, as Federal rule, has always stayed the same or the Federal rule has eroded so that in place X and Y it disappears, remaining only in admirality, in which case you have a genuine outlier. And I don't know what the history is.",
  "I know. That's beside the point to my question.",
  "But the -- I mean, the obvious kind of thing would to be say that the standard would depend upon the reprehensibility of the conduct of the officer of the corporation, including the captain, if you lost on that. And where we said roughly before zero to 10 -- and you are quite right that this is a huge amount of money -- you'd say zero to five, up to five times. I mean that would be rough and ready. But the idea would be to impose enormous deterrence upon large firms involved in your industry that you are representing not to make certain the officers on the ship behave in a reprehensible way. It's crude, but I mean that's the kind of thing that we said in the due-process cases.",
  "Then why wouldn't you - -",
  "Why wouldn't you - -",
  "You're going to say - - you're going to hear in two seconds -- they're going to say this is the company that makes the most amazing profit, et cetera. And so you're trying to deter them. So we know what, you know -- so, what do you say to that?",
  "That's -- that's why I'm interested in the same question I asked on the other side. As I read Lake Shore, it seemed to me my first reading of it that it picked up this distinction that Justice Story made, and it said quite right, you could impute punitives or exemplary damages to a corporation where its managerial official is the one who causes - - who behaves recklessly. But wait, we don't mean quite that. We mean some managerial officials. And they seem to refer in the admiralty case, I'll tell you one who he isn't, namely, the ship's captain. He's not in that category. And then in this other case, they say -- they talk about a superintending agent authorized to imply, employ, and discharge the conductor. And they give that as an example of a managerial official where there would not be exemplary damages assessed against the corporation in light of his conduct. So when I read that, I thought that this Lake Shore case is just picking up the earlier case; and that's the Federal law. And you've given the examples where the State law has changed; and I have no doubt you are right. You read the cases very well. But is there an example where I could say that the Federal law has changed, too? And you started down that track, but the reason this is of probably more than inordinate concern to me is that I wrote the case in Sand, I wrote a dissent in Legion, I looked into stare decisis law and made fairly clear views of what it is. So what would you say to someone who has accepted certain legal principles that we have had in prior cases? And you want to say nonetheless you win. Okay. Why?",
  "And so it differs from Sand, for example, where they are like two cases?",
  "It differs from Sand? You say it is not -- I'm interested in your last remark. In the Sand ways I found -- you know we went through it, public policy was on the other side. But -- but we had several cases, it wasn't a thousand; it was more like two; and the Supreme Court had said in two cases, one very clearly, you know -- you see the point there.",
  "Why do you say there is no stare decisis problem?",
  "That wouldn't -- you might win on that one. I mean if you show that. They have - - we have to assume that that isn't so, don't we - -",
  "-- for purposes of this argument?",
  "Yes. Okay, that's all.",
  "That's fine.",
  "On the second and third, this is what - -",
  "-- some time available. I would like you to address at some point at your convenience what should the standards be if, in fact, the captain of a ship, or responsible for conditions, for example, negligence or recklessness is now going to be not only imputed to the corporation but subject for punitives. Now, what I'm interested in, in the back of my mind is: This is a very dramatic accident. It involves oil spills, and they cause a enormous amount of trouble. But there are accidents every day, and ships are filled with accidents like automobiles in other places. And there are all kinds of things that go wrong. And if, in fact, it has not been normal in admiralty until now to assess punitives against the corporation on the basis of the activity of, say, the ship's master, failures of responsibility, then it will be a new world for the shipping industry and for those who work on the ships. What happens when a sailor slips and is hurt, and it's very serious to that sailor, et cetera? What principles do you have to suggest, if any, for creating a fair system that isn't just arbitrary?",
  "Why? What's even the theory of that? Because the theory of punitives is that the individual who's receiving the money wasn't hurt one penny's worth?",
  "And that really the money ought to go to the people generally in the State or it ought to go to other people, rather than those people who have already been compensated. That's the theory of it.",
  "That exhibits the difficulty for me of trying to figure out how to do it.",
  "What is the relevance?",
  "What's the relevance of the leg that we're assuming Exxon, other than the captain, did bad things?",
  "You seem to be now talking about the evidence that they did bad things. But that's the leg that they did - -",
  "Well, doesn't that show, then, that there had to be a finding that they did the bad thing?",
  "I thought the issue in the Philippines is the question of whether the money that went into the stock certificates eventually belonged to the people of the Philippines from the beginning or belonged to Marcos personally?",
  "And you're saying that there's no possibility whatsoever that a Philippine court could say that this money initially belonged to the people of the Philippines?",
  "I'm saying whether they - - I don't care what the name of the proceeding is. I'm saying could they decide that?",
  "All right. Now, if they decide that, why should your clients, terribly treated as they were, get the money ahead of the victims in the Philippines, who also were terribly treated?",
  "I thought Justice Souter just answered that. He said that the stock certificates might be held to belong to the people of the Philippines, in which case the stock certificates represent stock in a company that has a claim against Merrill Lynch, and so they will say, this certificate belongs to the people of the Philippines; the people of the Philippines would like you, Merrill Lynch, to pay back the money that the company gave them initially. And Merrill Lynch I imagine would pay it. Now that I think is as I understand it. Is there something wrong with my understanding?",
  "I didn't see that finding in the court of appeals decision. I thought the court of appeals thought that they belonged -- they couldn't possibly belong to the Philippine Government or the people there, because there is no way that the Philippine Government could win in a suit in New York in trying to recover them. But the Solicitor General has provided about two or three ways, in which and so -- and so have the Petitioners -- and that seems to me the heart of the issue. They have said: No, no, there are two or three ways in which the Philippine Government might well -- it might well ask a court for the money and the court would say, yes, you're entitled to it. So that it seems to me, that's the heart of it. What is your response to that?",
  "Yes, well, that isn't what they say. I think, if I understand it, that they say that were the share certificates in the hands of the Philippine Government on the ground, that the money used to create those had been taken from the Philippine people unlawfully, if that's what they decide, at that point the owner of the certificates, the government, would say to Merrill Lynch: We own the company, the company has the assets; please send us the money. And Merrill Lynch would do it. But if Merrill Lynch didn't do it, then they would file the judgment saying, these are our share certificates, in the New York court and say, will you please enforce the judgment. Now, there is something there that I'm not quite getting and that's why I want you to respond to the line of happenings that I just suggested.",
  "There is a huge change. The change would be that they'd a judgment of that special court over there that this company and the assets understandably belong to us, not to the Marcoses. And so this time, they go with that judgment to Merrill Lynch and say: Give us the money. And if they -- if they don't -- if Merrill Lynch says no -- Merrill Lynch might say yes, but you'll say, no, it belongs to us, so they might not. And if they don't, then the Philippines are never going to get the money, unless they bring the lawsuit. And once they bring the lawsuit, then you have them, because then you go right into the court in that lawsuit and intervene and they have waived all their sovereign immunity, et cetera, they can't get the money.",
  "With a difference.",
  "Do you have -- I mean I don't see you have a claim there as opposed to the - - the worst that would happen, not necessarily good for your clients, but the worst that would happen would be that the assets would be devoted to victims and their families in the Philippines. I mean, namely to the Philippine people. So I don't see some kind of fundamental unfairness here, unless you can point one out.",
  "I mean they'll treat you like another creditor and you have -- but is there some terrible unfairness going on?",
  "Is there -- is there something special going on, specially unfair, in respect to the delays where you are treated differently than other litigants in the Philippines?",
  "Is there any law on that? Is there -- suppose there's an indictment and the defendant finds out about it; he's never arrested; nothing further happens; weeks pass. Now, is there any law that tells me -- it's an indictment, that's clear -- and is there any law that tells me, when he requests a counsel be appointed, when they have to do it?",
  "So the answer is no.",
  "What happens -- what happens if -- the part that's worrying and I don't know how people handle it -- a riot. A big sit-in. A big demonstration, 500 people arrested, they are brought down to the station, bail is posted the next day, the U.S. attorney or the D.A. thinks: I'm going to indict the ringleaders, and the rest -- you know, the rest we are just going to let go; they will forfeit their bond. How is that handled? How is it handled under your rule? How is that handled generally? How should it be handled?",
  "No. No. That's easy.",
  "I mean -- I'm talking about the people who nobody ever intends to prosecute. What's going to happen, as I think happens quite often, they are brought to the station, they are arrested, they are released on bond, and then everybody forgets about it.",
  "Or they're -- or the D.A. says, you know, forfeit -- like a traffic ticket or something -- forfeit your bond. And I want to know how that's handled under your rule, how is it handled now, how is it handled in the -- discuss it, please.",
  "Well, you see what I'm doing. I'm trying to make it comparable. What happens there is that these 500 people brought down to the station, they are required to put up bail; they are given a warning because people might question them; they are given a warning; they are then released. And nothing further is heard. Maybe three months later, they come in and they agree that they'll forfeit their bond. Now, that's what I'm wondering. That must happen, because I think there are lots of demonstrations; they occur sometimes. I suspect it happens. How is it handled, if you know?",
  "What happens in Texas?",
  "But they didn't -- they don't --",
  "What is the law here in Texas in respect to this particular magistration proceeding? I noticed what happened is that the magistrate tells the person arrested, he says precisely: \"I find probable cause to believe\" that you -- \"that there was probable cause to arrest you.\" That's what they say, right? It said: \"I have determined that probable cause existed for the arrest of the individual accused therein.\" All right. Now, what happens -- and I think it would be helpful to know the answer to this -- in what might be a rare instance, but the truth of the matter is there was probable cause to arrest that individual when he was arrested, but there isn't now. So because he came in -- you know, he said here's 14 cousins, I was somewhere else at the time, they all agree. I mean, everybody agrees on a certain fact that means there isn't now. And what I'm driving at is does the magistrate here -- is he required, does he have the power to commit someone, even though he honestly believes there is no longer probable cause, in which case he is making the decision, the magistrate, not the policeman?",
  "I could -- I can think there would be tremendous constitutional significance and it would make a difference if all that's really happening is a policeman is arresting someone, in which case we might have liberty interests and others at issue. But what's happening in this proceeding is that the magistrate is deciding that there is probable cause to hold him, in which case it's more like, not completely like, but more like what happens in an indictment or an arraignment, et cetera.",
  "No, no. But I want to know what's Texas law, if you know it, in respect to that question?",
  "So we have a magistrate who has to find that there is -- no, to make the arrest or to hold him now? Do you see what I'm doing?",
  "Do you see why I'm doing it? So, what's the answer, if you know?",
  "No, I know there may not be, but what about in general.",
  "Okay. That's what I would think. In which case we have before us bringing this person before a State official who himself has the power to decide if there is probable cause to hold him, and he is saying, yes, there is probable cause to hold him. That's -- that's what's happening; is that right?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Suppose you were to say that where the State arrests an individual, brings him before a neutral official and intends and does impose a significant restraint on his liberty for the purpose of bringing that individual to trial, there is a presumption that that -- forget the presumption. If that happens for the purpose, the primary purpose, primary purpose of bringing the individual to trial, at that point the Sixth Amendment right attaches. Now, the State would not have to give him a lawyer if there was some other purpose primary, for example, as in Gouveia, keeping the prisons safe. For example, it's quite clear under the circumstances, there are 14 people accused, they couldn't have all have done it, they want to investigate further. Or maybe there are other examples. But, for the primary purpose, then the right attaches. So you pick up Gerstein and add to Gerstein that additional requirement. What about that? What harm would that cause? What inconvenience would it cause, what difficulties, et cetera?",
  "And you couldn't -- you couldn't because of the fact that bail -- if you're going to insist on bail, that in effect is incarceration. But the reason I asked the question, which I would ask you the same, is there are a lot of States, we're told, that do have counsel attach in circumstances similar to this. So they must have some way of dealing with the problem that I raised if it's really a problem. And I want to -- and that's -- and I want to -- if we're going into this, I think I need to know how this is dealt with.",
  "You see, you would have given him a counsel. I mean, in fact, if he had wanted one, Texas would give him one. So Texas must have -- it must not be a problem. The problem, I just --",
  "Yes.",
  "So the problem I raise can't be a real problem.",
  "Could you go back to the - -",
  "I just wondered if you could say in a minute. One possibility is that the amendment gives nothing more than a right to the State to raise a militia. A second possibility is that it gives an individual right to a person, but for the purpose of allowing people to have guns to form a militia. Assume the second. If you assume the second, I wanted you to respond if you -- unless you have done so fully already, to what was the Chief Justice's question of why, on the second assumption, this ban on handguns, not the other part, of the District of Columbia, a total ban, why is that a reasonable regulation viewed in terms of the purposes as I described them?",
  "You're saying that this is unreasonable, and that really is my question because I'd like you to assume two things with me, which you probably don't agree with, and I may not agree with them, either.",
  "But I just want you to assume them for the purpose of the question. All right. Assume that the -- that there is an individual right, but the purpose of that right is to maintain a citizen army; call it a militia; that that's the basic purpose. So it informs what's reasonable and what isn't reasonable. Assume -- and this is favorable to you but not as favorable as you'd like -- assume that we are going to decide whether something is proportionate or apply an intermediate standard in light of the purpose. All right. Now, focus on the handgun ban. As I read these 80 briefs -- and they were very good, I mean really good and informative on both sides -- and I'm trying to boil down the statistics where there is disagreement, and roughly what I get -- and don't quarrel with this too much; it's very rough -- that 80,000 to 100,000 people every year in the United States are either killed or wounded in gun-related homicides or crimes or accidents or suicides, but suicide is more questionable. That's why I say 80,000 to 100,000. In the District, I guess the number is somewhere around 200 to 300 dead; and maybe, if it's similar, 1,500 to 2,000 people wounded. All right. Now, in light of that, why isn't a ban on handguns, while allowing the use of rifles and muskets, a reasonable or a proportionate response on behalf of the District of Columbia?",
  "Well, I didn't read -- I read the two military briefs as focusing on the nature of the right, which was quite a pretty good argument there that the nature of the right is to maintain a citizen Army. And to maintain that potential today, the closest we come is to say that there is a right for people to understand weapons, to know how to use them, to practice with them. And they can do that, you see, with their rifles. They can go to gun ranges, I guess, in neighboring States. But does that make it unreasonable for a city with a very high crime rate, assuming that the objective is what the military people say, to keep us ready for the draft, if necessary, is it unreasonable for a city with that high crime rate to say no handguns here?",
  "Now, why?",
  "Well, you want to say yes, that's correct, but I want to hear what the reasoning is because there is a big crime problem. I'm simply getting you to focus on that.",
  "That brings me back to the question because Blackstone describes it as a right to keep and bear arms \"under law.\" And since he uses the words \"under law,\" he clearly foresees reasonable regulation of that right. And so does the case not hinge on, even given all your views, on whether it is or is not a reasonable or slightly tougher standard thing to do to ban the handgun, while leaving you free to use other weapons? I mean, I notice that the militia statute, the first one, spoke of people coming to report, in 1790, or whenever, with their rifles, with their muskets, but only the officers were to bring pistols. So that, to me, suggests they didn't see pistols as crucial even then, let alone now.",
  "What's your response to the question?",
  "Why -- now, when say \"keep\" and \"bear,\" I mean you are -- I think you're on to something here. Because you say let's use our common sense and see what would be the equivalent today. Fine. If we know that at the time, in 1789, Massachusetts had a law that said you cannot keep loaded firearms in the house, right, and you have to keep all of the bullets and everything and all of the powder upstairs, why did they have that law? To stop fires because it's dangerous? They didn't have fire departments. Now we do -- or they weren't as good. We now have police departments, and the crime wave might be said similar to what were fires then. And, therefore, applying the similar kind of thing, you say: Fine, just as you could keep pistols loaded but not -- not loaded. You had to keep powder upstairs because of the risk of fire. So today, roughly, you can say no handguns in the city because of the risk of crime. Things change. But we give in both instances, then and now, leeway to the city and States to work out what's reasonable in light of their problems. Would that be a way of approaching it?",
  "Not self-defense being the harm. And I agree with you that this, the firearm analogy, floats up there, but it isn't going to decide this case, the Massachusetts statute. I agree with you about that. What you've suddenly given me the idea of doing, which I'm testing, is to focus not just on what the kind of weapon is -- don't just look to see whether it's a cannon or a machine gun, but look to see what the purpose of this regulation is, and does it make sense in terms of having the possibility of people trained in firearms? Let's look at those military briefs. Let's say that the generals have it right, there is some kind of right to keep trained in the use of firearms subject to regulation. We have regulation worried about crime, back to my first question.",
  "Thinking of your exchange with the Chief Justice and think of the trigger lock in your view and what the question was, do you want -- I don't know how well trigger locks work or not -- but do you want thousands of judges all over the United States to be deciding that kind of question rather than the city councils and the legislatures that have decided it in the context of passing laws? I mean, isn't there an issue here and a problem with respect to having courts make the kinds of decisions about who is right or not in that trigger-lock argument?",
  "Whose judgment is that to - -",
  "I would not say no one else, but not everyone else places the importance on legislative history that I do, but I do. And I saw here that the Senate Judiciary Committee considered all these arguments, they wrote a report; and they sided with the government.",
  "And I know it was there, but it doesn't matter to me it was on a bill that was later not passed, and then unless there is something different - -",
  "-- for that reason, because in my own mind I'm thinking there were a group of people on the committee, they went through the issue, they reflected views of their principles, they work it out, and unless something changed that makes me think that isn't the working out of it, I would put a lot of weight on it.",
  "And now you're going to tell me what there is, I hope.",
  "I don't think it is a problem with legislative history.",
  "I think that the people in Congress who hired their staffs pay attention to what the staffs say in precisely the same way that any other executive - -",
  "I mean that wouldn't be surprising would it, that wouldn't be surprising because you have, in fact, very complex bills that have 14 sections and section of the B bill could have been vetoed -- been vetoed because of problem with Section 14 and repassed without Section 14, in which case the legislative history for the other 13 sections would be highly illuminating as to what they mean.",
  "The question that I had in respect to this statute is -- is that my impression and here -- I'd like to know how they bill secretary's times. I'd like to know how they bill rent. And my thought is -- and I want to be either verified or told I'm wrong and explain it, that when you have no cap, the lawyer and the client want to shove everything possible into the rubric attorney's fees, including the kitchen sink, if the plumber is there in the kitchen of the law firm.",
  "That's fine. No problem. There is no other way to get paid for them. But where you have a cap, you should shove everything the other side, if expenses are going to be paid for it, because that cap means that the lawyer will not get his full pay back and therefore, the lower the cap, the more you want to be sure it's covering only that lawyer's time. And everything else goes into expense so that you can pay the lawyer adequately and he will recover his expenses elsewhere. Was that the theory of this bill? Is there any evidence that that was the theory? If you did it that way, would anything get mixed up?",
  "Say: Speak, go ahead, speak, speak. Just not on our nickel.",
  "And they also say -- by the way, that you answer this, I'd keep this in mind -- you may be right about it being too much of an administrative burden, the treble damages et cetera, but they've made major concessions here, and they say that's a matter to be worked out on remand. And it may be that they have to be very careful about inhibiting your speech. So let's go back over those administrative provisions one by one. They are suggesting to us, as I read it, don't do that now.",
  "If you have -- you have a park service of the State and have you a hotdog stand there, it runs the hotdogs, it's private, but the State pays for everything. The State pays for everything. And it happens that, in the grant, they have no place for talking about the union. You're saying they are required to add to the legislation, a special grant, so that the employer can speak of the union?",
  "Why? Why? Because they say here we are talking about 100 percent money that comes out of the State treasury and all we are saying is use that money for the State purposes, and those purposes do not include talking one way or the other about the union.",
  "Would your answer be the same if -- if -- and I hide contrary to fact, perhaps, that a magic administrative scheme were invented so that there was no administrative problem, we could identify with the greatest of ease each penny that came from a State and which did not? And then the State said, you know, we do have a policy here. We actually favor labor unions in our State, and some other State might have a different policy. But we think it best that the State officials involved when their company -- when their department is being organized, to say nothing. We think it best that the employers that we pay a hundred percent to, given their -- their strong funding by the State, that they got to find some money elsewhere, and those we pay 50 percent to better use the private money, not use our money. Now, no administrative burden whatsoever, but that's the policy. Now, is there some rule or statute that would make that unlawful or pre-empted that policy?",
  "No, on all these things which I think they are asking us on the other side to leave for another day, none of them exist. They all work perfectly. It's only the magic system has been developed to, without any extraneous burden, segregate the State money from the non-State money. And the only rule is don't use the State money when you speak. That's the only rule.",
  "By the way, other states have exactly opposite rules, they are right-to-work states. They give you extra State money. So -- but one State has this rule and - -",
  "Ah, well, if it's a very different case, then why aren't they right to say this is a facial challenge, leave that very different case which raises all the issues to be worked out when we discover whether this is - -",
  "Is my right-to-work example equally -- equally pre-empted?",
  "So, they could not say in Utah, to take a State at random, the -- here we have government grants and there's overhead, and we would like you to spend this overhead; indeed, you're certainly free to spend this overhead in speaking as much as you want, should there be an organizing campaign. Don't worry about spending the government part. Can they do that? You say no, they couldn't?",
  "No.",
  "So you did on that point on page 27 and 25 and 29 of the AFL-CIO brief, I took the statements there, where it would say \"organizations,\" namely organizations, even those that receive a hundred percent of their money from the State are free to use their profits?",
  "If there are any, or any other non-state moneys they had?",
  "So if you sell them tables and they write you a check, the State, for the tables, at that point the check is yours?",
  "All right.",
  "What is your recommendation as to -- we've heard today, too, in the briefs it's there, I put the thing that I've heard as -- well, the example with the tables is an example of it. When does the profit actually accrue? Is there treble damage provision that makes this much worse? Are there administrative requirements that in practice make it impossible? Is it administered in such a way that the employee we heard about would just not know what to say, the employer's representative? All those things could be problems, and you say, well, they haven't been dealt with yet. And your recommendation as to what we should do is what?",
  "And if we did that, how would all these problems be worked out? I mean, how would the arguments that you -- they think are far too burdensome, you think they are not and can be done properly, how does that get worked out?",
  "Is the following true, that if you are right the reason Congress passed this new definition was it wanted to take those handful of States which have felonies as a year, the ones Justice Alito is talking about, and make clear that they are not covered?",
  "All right. But if the government's right, then the reason Congress did this is that it recognized what I think is the truth, that felonies and misdemeanors are defined differently in many different ways under the laws of many different States and, in a matter where so much prison time turns on it, wished to create a single, uniform definition. Now, if that's right, I'm asking myself which is a more plausible purpose.",
  "No, it doesn't, because if you're right, then you first have to look to the patchwork quilt of laws in all the different States to see whether those different States define the conduct as misdemeanors or felonies. And then, having solved the patchwork problem, we add on the requirement of one year. And so the bite of the new definition would be what Justice Alito said and nothing else. Now, that's -- and, yet, on the government's interpretation, the bite is to create a single, readily applied, uniform rule. Now, if I ask myself which of those is most plausible, I hate to tell you which answer I get.",
  "Am I right? Am I right? I mean, I put that out to give you a chance to say. I'm not sure I am right.",
  "Can you explain one thing to me? I take it that they -- everybody says they went through all the right IRS hoops to get back three years' worth of damages, i.e., they get their payments back and they get interest.",
  "Now, what they want is they want three years before that.",
  "And they're too late under Title 26. So what you're saying is, one, you can't get any interest and, two, you can't get your money back at all.",
  "I'm saying for three years they're home-free. They get their payment back and they get their interest. Now let's go to the three preceding years. I'm a little confused about that because I can't work out -- I suppose that the government is saying: You get nothing, you don't get your money back, and you don't get your interest. Or is the government saying: You get your money back; you just don't get the interest? Which is it? And I don't see how it could be the latter.",
  "Okay.",
  "Your point is that you don't have to go through the refund requirements of 7422 if the government was -- although it did ask for the money as a tax, they are really out to lunch? I mean, the trouble -- is there any authority for an argument like that? I mean, the trouble I guess that I would have that argument is, one is linguistic, because it goes on to say \"or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected.\" And then the other thing is just common sense: Suppose you have an insane tax collector. You know, I mean, that could happen. And the insane tax collector they discover some years later has been assessing all these penalties for no reason and people have been paying some of them because, terrible tragedy, terrible thing. But I guess they'd be stuck, I'd always thought, with the three-year statute of limitations, so even those it's really nuts. Now, is there -- is there any authority for us making a distinction between an insane -- to get an extreme, an insane assessment of a tax and just a wrongful assessment of a tax?",
  "Okay.",
  "What about the \"any sum,\" \"in any manner\"? You know, what about that language?",
  "\"Any sum in any manner wrongfully collected.\"",
  "No. No. Their argument is, I'm terribly sorry, that if the way you're hurt is you paid a tax you shouldn't pay and you want to get a refund, go through the administrative procedure.",
  "In looking at your argument, I see it now, I think, if I'm right. You're -- that it would have very broad reach. It would reach -- it doesn't just concern the constitutional claim; it concerns any claim you'd have against the IRS. And there's authority that says if the IRS' position is too far out, you can go get an injunction. That's what you're pointing to. And then you're argument is, because of that authority, that kind of an exception for the far out IRS claim also applies to the statute of limitation and administrative requirement. And your problem is the latter has never been held. And the reason that that's a problem, I take it, is because when you're talking about injunctions, you're talking about basic equity, but when you're talking about later on administrative requirements, there's really no reason they couldn't have filed the claim. And if we were to accept an argument on the -- to the contrary and analogize it, it's going to cut through rules, regulations, statutes, constitutional claims, everything, really making a hash of their provision there -- of the administrative provision. So, what is your response to that thought which - -",
  "What do you want to do about your argument, as I hear it, has nothing to do with the nature of the claim that you're asserting to get the money back. It has to do with the nature of the IRS's defense and -- well, can you do it that way? Can you say the word \"any tax\" or \"any claim\" -- I can't remember that other. What was it? It was any -- \"any sum\" -- \"any sum\" or \"any tax.\" Can you say, well, it means one thing if they are saying that the reason they want it back is that it violates the Constitution, and those words mean a different thing if the reason that you want it back is it violates an IRS reg; it violates an IRS statute.",
  "Well, if it doesn't mean anything different and then if the very far-out claim to a tax is so far out it isn't a tax, that would be true in the regulation context, in the statutory context as well as the constitutional context. Am I missing something?",
  "Right. Is the government's view that the money that they are seeking here, if you look at 7422, that it falls within the language of any Internal Revenue tax alleged to be erroneously or illegally assessed or the language \"any sum alleged to have been in any manner wrongfully collected,\" or both?",
  "So when I decide this case, I should forget the words \"any sum\"?",
  "But it means that if, in fact, it is not within the scope of the word \"tax,\" then it is not within \"any sum\"?",
  "In Enochs -- she is quite right, your opposing lawyer -- it says the exaction is merely in the guise of a tax. And when it says it is within the guise of a tax, then it doesn't fall within the Tax Injunction Act. And there it says if it is clear that under no circumstances could the government ultimately prevail, the central purpose of the Tax Injunction Act is inapplicable. And then it's just in the guise of a tax. And that, she says, is the test we should apply here. So that's where I think Justice Ginsburg began. What is your specific response to that?",
  "What happened -- I have a factual question. In around July, Mr. Sam Jones is sworn in and now he is in office until sometime after, I guess, September 1988, a little over a year, and then the Governor appointed him. Well, he must have gotten paid during that year.",
  "And then when the Governor appointed him, what does the appointment look like? Does it say it's retroactive? No. I would be surprised. I mean, you're not going to tell me it is. So my guess is he's appointed as of -- let's say he's appointed by the Governor. It must have said as of when, and it probably said as of September '88.",
  "Well, I think it's important to me because, for this reason: I would guess they don't make it retroactive or you'd know it, and therefore we -- we have more. We have the facts, the following facts, as to whether -- and this is what Fordice says; it says this is a practical question. It's not some theory about whether it's unconstitutional or not unconstitutional. The question is as practical matter was it in force and effect? And, as a practical matter, one, there was an election under it; two, somebody was elected; three, he took office; four, he held that office for a year and was paid for it. All right? Why, as a practical fact, as a practical matter, we do not say that special election law was in force and effect for about a year and two months?",
  "Yes, their registering is a precondition of voting. Not one person had ever voted. Moreover, they all had to register again. So the net practical effect of the election, of plan two in Young v. Fordice, was null, zero, zilch. And the practical effect here is that somebody is elected under the law, holds office for a year and two months, and is paid. It seems to me quite a big difference.",
  "All right. I mean, that's what I wanted to know. I mean, maybe it's different if this was a retroactive something or other, but I - - you're not aware of that.",
  "So I assume it wasn't.",
  "Yes.",
  "All right. Suppose I reject that on the ground of what I said. I'm not saying I would, but suppose I did. Isn't that the end of this case? Because then, if I reject that, there is a plan. The plan is called \"the special election plan.\" It is in effect for a year and two months. People hold office in election and they're paid. And then a new plan comes along, the governor's plan. Now that seems to me a change, and the statute says that if you have a change, which this would be, you've got to preclear it. End of matter. Now, what's your argument about that?",
  "No, I'm just using that as shorthand, the shorthand for a system under which the officeholder is appointed by the government -- by the governor.",
  "And I'm saying if we start from the base that the plan is special election which was in force and effect for a year and two months, then for whatever set of reasons there is a change, and the State has to preclear the change. Now, what's the answer to that?",
  "All right. So you're saying that if the cause of a change is a court decision, then you do not have to preclear. So that if in Mississippi in 1975, there had been a ruling of a court which said segregationist plan number one here is no good, so we're going to go back to the even worse plan that was before, that that wouldn't have had to have been precleared?",
  "You see where I'm going, and I'm not phrasing it correctly, but you can answer it anyway.",
  "But what my question is, is there any authority for the proposition that between 1964 and today, it mattered whether the cause of a change in a State plan was a decision of let's say five members of a court -- of a State court -- or whether it was a legislative decision. Because that's what I think you're arguing, and is there any authority that supports you on that?",
  "Well, is it? Because -- I mean, what they're saying is let's use a little common sense here. And you look at Fordice and there it was an instance where it just didn't take effect at all as a practical matter. And then we cited those two cases you're talking about, but I can't tell from the Fordice opinion -- there was a ward system that was in fact in force or effect. But I don't know how long that ward system was in effect. It might have been for a long time, and people might have taken action under it. And the same thing is true in City of Lockhart. I can't tell. You may know. But my point is they are saying: Here we have a middle case, and what we want is to use enough sense to say, look, it wasn't really in effect. People challenged it the minute they could. They -- everybody knew it was unconstitutional, or a lot of people believed it. And the Governor then did something to make up for it. If you're going to say that that little bit counts as putting it in force and effect, you know what we're going to have? We're going to have every municipality all over the country that doesn't always know what the rules are, and they pass something, and people challenge it immediately, it's obviously wrong, and they're stuck with it as a matter of Federal law. That's going to be a mess. They're saying something like that, so I'd like to hear your response.",
  "Well, Young versus Fordice, that's Young versus -- I mean, if it never went into force and effect, of course we don't reach questions like republican form of government or 1964 safe harbors and so forth. And so I think it's an important matter. And as I read Fordice, we have over here an instance where nothing happened. You know, some people registered and then immediately they were told the registration was no good. So it wasn't in force and effect. When I looked at Perkins v. Matthews, that was not a case where the law was challenged immediately. Rather, what Justice Brennan said is that this has been in effect from 1962 to 1965 at least, and in 1965 they had an election under the ward system. So even if it might have been unconstitutional or it was, it was still in effect for three years. In the other case, City of Lockhart, Justice Powell says this statute has been in effect, we assume, from 1917 to 1973. That's not exactly a fleeting matter. So -- so here we have a case where they challenged it instantly, where it was litigated as fast as it possibly could be, where in fact, as Justice Ginsburg just said, a different decision of the circuit court would have led to the opposite of it never would have even had it. So what harm does it do to the enforcement of the civil rights laws of the United States if the holding of this Court were, well, under these circumstances, where challenged immediately, et cetera, it never took force and effect?",
  "One more -- I'd like -- on the first question, in reading through this, my impression was that the government -- and the green briefs, you know, the dark green briefs against you from the Military Justice Institute and the national security specialists really don't disagree. That is that everybody seems to agree, to use the words General Casey said, that U.S. soldiers in Iraq are subject to the authority, direction, and control of the commander of the U.S. Central Command. And you say in your brief that really this multilateral force operates subject to a unified American command, and the chain of command ultimately runs to the President. So as a practical matter it's the President and the Pentagon, the Secretary of Defense, and the American commanders that control what our American soldiers do. I take it there's agreement on that point, but where there's disagreement is that you say, well, the same was true with that tribunal at issue in Hirota. Am I right about that?",
  "Yes. So we're not -- we're not -- I take its you say that, as a practical matter and as a matter of the chain of command, it runs through American officers to American commanders to the Secretary of Defense to the President of the United States. There is no disagreement about that, or is there?",
  "There is not.",
  "Yes. Okay. Then if there is not -- if there is not, am I right in thinking the issue is whether, because the words -- there's some connection with foreign governments, absolutely. There's some, but it doesn't interfere with that chain of command. And now your point is: But the same was true with the tribunal at issue in Hirota.",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "The same was true. It was General MacArthur.",
  "Well - -",
  "But that's because the President, I take it, would follow what the UN says, not because the chain of command would change.",
  "And if that happened, these people would be released?",
  "But the relevance of that is General MacArthur was an agent of several allied powers.",
  "Then, to me, it's a matter of Hirota at the moment, and the only distinction you haven't addressed is at that time, I think in 1946, the basic habeas rule was that you wouldn't question a judgment of a tribunal, at least not a foreign tribunal. And it was just beginning in the issue -- to question judgments in American tribunals. And, therefore, the obvious question is: Well, doesn't that explain Hirota?",
  "But you have only the - - the citizenship to stop the floodgate. What I'm wondering is -- when I read the briefs, I put in my mind a spectrum and on one side is the military occupation of Japan, where there is basically peace but it's a military occupation. On the other side, it's a hot war or a guerilla war where the U.S. forces are rounding up troops, nightly perhaps, and rounding up guerillas. And I had put this case quite close to the military occupation in my mind because of the nature of these particular individuals' offense and treatment. But was I wrong to do that? Should I assimilate this case to either a hot war or at least a guerilla warfare, where troops are actively engaged in rounding up those who want to shoot them?",
  "The question is, look, suppose the government comes in tomorrow, or in the district court, you're back there. And the government says you want us to release him. At noon tomorrow, we will take him to the front gate and release him. Do you want us to do it? Yes or no?",
  "Yes?",
  "Okay.",
  "You need all that to win this case. That is, as I started the case I thought this involved an American being held by the military for over a year pending the resolution of criminal charges in Iraq, which are charges of kidnapping in respect to which whatever hot war is going on over there has very little to do with his being held.",
  "Well, you've been arguing for all sorts of things that seem far broader than that. So I'd like to focus you for a second on that matter.",
  "But am I right to assume the underlying situation to be that of Hirota?",
  "Yes, but you see what I mean by that? I mean, these issues of the war zone and so forth are not really there in this case; that we're talking here about a person whose being held in a manner that's comparable for habeas purposes to the Japanese or aliens who were held in Hirota. They're being held by the Army, which is in part, which is in relevant part serving as an occupying force, to be turned over to a different tribunal.",
  "Okay, thank you.",
  "General, that is -- my question would be the converse. Suppose I agreed with you to this point hypothetically that, of course, there's a relationship here. In this case, there's a relationship. He wouldn't have lied if he -- if he hadn't had the explosives. Suppose I accept that. Now, if I interpret the statute that way -­ there has to be a relationship, but including that -­ then what are the other cases you want to prosecute? In the other briefs they list every funny or comical or absurd example they can find; and so I don't believe you want to prosecute those, but tell me if you do. And if there are some other ones, what are they?",
  "Fine. So suppose, in other words, if we -- if, hypothetically, I were to say, well, here there's a relationship; after all, it is a necessary condition for the lying that he was carrying explosives; and it is foreseeable that he would lie on his passport, because he was carrying explosives illegally. So that's all you need. In other words, if that were the decision, you would say fine, that's the end of it.",
  "No, it didn't facilitate it, but it caused it.",
  "Well, if it didn't -- all right. Would you be satisfied with a result that says, look, if this carrying of explosives is related to the felony in the sense that it is a necessary condition and foreseeable that a person would do such a thing, that's sufficient?",
  "Why should we agree with that?",
  "That's exactly what's bothering me. The issue in this case doesn't seem to me to be these weird hypotheticals. Of course it requires a relationship, in my mind. But I don't see why the relationship couldn't be exactly the one Justice Alito was talking about. I mean, imagine a person has a packed car filled with explosives. He's going to blow something up. A policemen comes up; he shoots the policeman. The reason he shot the policeman was because he had his car packed with explosives. And if this -- if this provision -- I mean, I can't understand why this provision wouldn't be aimed directly at that kind of thing.",
  "All right. Suppose I don't agree with you about that -­",
  "That may be, but I don't know -- but you could say that. You could say that. But the problem is I have to answer the question -- I have to reach an answer that I believe should be sensible.",
  "So what should I do -­",
  "-- if I think that shooting the policeman because he's going to catch the criminal filled with explosives is within this statute? And similarly, lying to a customs officer so he won't catch me when my car is filled with explosives is within the statute? Suppose I believe that, but I also think the statute is not meant to govern those odd hypotheticals that you come up with? There has to be a relationship, but the one I described falls within the word \"relationship.\" Now what do I do?",
  "I understand that argument. But suppose I don't accept the argument? Then what do I do in this case? That's what I'm asking.",
  "Why shouldn't the law track medicine? I mean, we're not -- we're interested in a person having a fair trial.",
  "Well, I didn't think this case has been decided by prior precedent. I thought there was some opening here. Going back to what I think I said in Martinez and Justice Kennedy said, we were - - I was interested in, and perhaps he was, in a few empirical facts, because we'd heard lots of complaints from trial judges who said this makes no sense at all. Very disturbed people are being deprived and end up in prison because they're disturbed rather than because there guilty. Now, I wanted to know the facts. And it seemed to me we have a excellent, really fabulous - - that this has happened, and Professor Hashimoto seems to have gone and written, done research, which we have in front of us. As I read that research, I first learned that actually the pro se defendants don't do a bad job of defending themselves. And by and large, they do surprisingly well. And so perhaps that eliminates some of the concern. But the other thing that it tells me is that there is a small subclass of pro se defendants who may in fact do badly. And we have in front of us one of those individuals and that, therefore, a rule which permitted a State to deal with this subclass of disturbed people who want to represent themselves, who could communicate with counsel, but can't communicate with anybody else, that if we focus on that subclass and accept the State's argument here, interestingly enough, we've gone a long way to deal with a serious practical problem, and we've advanced the cause of seeing that individuals have a fair trial. So I'd like you to comment on that, and that was my reaction after reading that study.",
  "Your response to that, as it was to me, I take it to be: Well, focusing on this subclass, the judge has other ways of dealing with the problem. My thought about that is, first, I don't know. Maybe the damage is done by that point before the jury or elsewhere. And my second thought is, because I'm not certain about whether your answer is right or wrong, nor are any of us really, this is a perfect instance where the States should experiment.",
  "There isn't on this, but of course part of the job of being a psychiatrist or a psychologist or a doctor is continuously to evaluate the accuracy of studies. So if it's a general question, I guess the question is of course there are.",
  "I don't understand that. If it's never confirmed, then I guess the tax is okay, isn't it?",
  "But so what? Isn't that - - I mean, I assume that's totally illegal, that you get - - I thought we're talking about this provision where everybody agrees that it has to be under a plan confirmed under section 1129. So if there's no plan confirmed, I don't know how you would fall within this exemption.",
  "Fine. If it's your point exactly, then I guess I must agree with that. I'll hear from the other side. Except I thought your point was it makes it difference whether the transfer takes place before the plan is confirmed or after. So I may be just confused about that.",
  "Oh, no, I'm asking you this. You then concede -- let me for my own point of view; forget what the -- maybe I'm confused about the facts or maybe I'm not. But let's suppose there is a plan and it is confirmed. The transfer, however, took place a month earlier where a private group of creditors came together, every creditor, with the debtor and they worked out a sale tomorrow, and they transferred the assets tomorrow. Four months later, the plan that includes every word of that goes before the bankruptcy judge, the bankruptcy judge thoroughly understands the situation, and he says: I confirm the plan. Now, under those -- in that circumstance, I guess you now are -- are you prepared to concede that Florida cannot tax?",
  "Of course not. So then - - then the fact that there is no plan seems to me irrelevant, that situation, from the present case. So now let's look at this case, where there is a plan and it is confirmed. My question, going back to what I thought the facts are, is this: Imagine the situation I've just described -- thorough investigation later by the bankruptcy judge; plan including it is confirmed. And you say if the transfer took place first you can assert your tax, but if the transfer took place second, after the plan, you can't. And my question, if I'm right on my assumption, is I'd like you to provide a reason why any human being, a reasonable human being, would want to make that distinction? Why would anyone want to say we want to give all the money to the creditors and not let Florida get some if it takes place, the transfer, after the confirmation, but would think differently about it and would want Florida to get some if the transfer takes place before the confirmation, which confirmation describes everything in depth, is thoroughly investigated, et cetera? What reason could there be for such a distinction?",
  "I'm not speaking of the language for the moment. I want you to forget about the language and assume the language is ambiguous. That's a different question. My question is, assuming that the language is ambiguous, as every lower court has found, assuming that, however, is there any reason why a reasonable human being would make this distinction? That's my question. And there may be an answer, but I want to know what answer is.",
  "That is not an answer.",
  "I would appreciate an answer to the question.",
  "That's the problem? If that's the problem, I thought that there had to be a filing for bankruptcy before any of this kicks in.",
  "Okay. Then the answer can't be you could go back 50 years. The answer would have to be you go back until the filing for bankruptcy.",
  "What? That's what I want to know. And I'll add a qualification. I'd say I would read into this a context, and the context is the whole section that gives the exemption from the State law only kicks in when you file for bankruptcy. So, I -- now, it's my question. I guess I could make the hypothetical the the way I want to make it, and the way I want to make it is that this section applies once it kicks in, the bankruptcy filing, and it does not distinguish between the pre- and the post-confirmation, you know, where the confirmation takes place after the transfer or the transfer after the confirmation. You're arguing to the contrary. And what I want to know is what reason there is? Do I have to repeat the question?",
  "What is the reason? That's what I want you to focus on, for making that distinction.",
  "And it's not the litigation. What you've said so far is, at least as I have taken it in, that the practical harm is the following: There will be a certain number of transfers that take place after the filing, but before the actual confirmation; and in respect to those transfers, the State is left in a position of uncertainty. You don't know if you can assert your tax or not assert your tax until that transfer is later confirmed as part of the confirmed plan or not. That's what I take it as you're having said. And then I think I'll hear in a minute somebody say, but that kind of uncertainty is rife in the tax laws. It often occurs that a taxing authority is not certain about how to characterize a transaction until later events take place which are part of, or related to, the transaction; and the IRS and all the State tax departments survive. So if I'm right in guessing that, discuss.",
  "That's all I can say.",
  "Why can't you just say that? Why can't you say, you want to record this taxation, pay the tax. And when you come in later, because it was confirmed, show us the paper. We'll give you the money back. How does that interfere with -- with anything?",
  "Why is it an administrative burden? The burden is entirely on the people who want their money back. They come in. They file a piece of paper. It says Federal bankruptcy judge signed, plan confirmed, and it would take, I guess, a few minutes to read through it to see they're telling the truth, which you always have the problem in a tax, and then you give them their money back.",
  "Of course, you can't file it if they don't tell the State. So if they're not going to tell you, they're not going to have their transfer recorded. I mean, look, we're going into this, and on the other side, of course, there is the following consideration: That there are creditors who are owed a lot of money; and all these creditors are in a room; and they think, if I can sell these assets tomorrow, I'm going to get a lot more money than I will if I have to wait for six months. That's why we want to go through with this. Now isn't that an important bankruptcy interest, to make the creditors more whole?",
  "So there is no case, to your knowledge -- not millions of dollars, but there is no case, to your knowledge, where, in fact, people transferred the assets; they thought there would be a plan confirmed; there was no plan confirmed; and then the State was not paid?",
  "It's on page 38, the last line, the next to the last line.",
  "The red brief.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, no. I'm sorry. Doesn't the rejection have to take place prior to the plan being confirmed?",
  "Does it or doesn't it? Prior to in your opinion or not prior to?",
  "I'm sorry. I don't understand how that would work. I have a contract with Boeing for $500 million. I decide to reject it. Now if that breach doesn't occur until the plan is confirmed, how does the trust -- how does bankruptcy judge know how to treat Boeing as a creditor?",
  "I understand that. But I'm sorry -- doesn't the plan which its confirmed have a list of the creditors and how they are treated?",
  "All right. How do we write the plan if, in fact, no breach has occurred and he hasn't become a creditor until the plan is, in fact, confirmed?",
  "Well, I don't think it's because there's no common-law equivalent. I think it's simply because the word \"conspiracy\" is a -- the substantive violation under 19 -- under 1962(c). \"It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire.\" And we have to interpret the word \"conspire,\" and we say we give it its common-law meaning; whereas, for a violation of the general racketeering statute, there's -- there's no equivalent reference to a word that we have to give content to. It just says -- unless it's the word \"indictable.\"",
  "Well, why is the 32(h) obligation relevant? That is, looking through the history of it, I see that in 32(i)(C) it says that the government has to allow the parties' attorneys to comment on the determination of the probation officer and other matters relating to an appropriate sentence. Then, in a case called Burns v. United States, this Court says that that right to comment includes a right to notice. And so all that 32(h) did was to take what was already the law and make specific that it includes a right to notice. I take it that was what they were up to. But even if you didn't have 32(h), you would have precisely the same right once you got 32(i)(C) together with the case of Burns. So I don't know where that leaves me, except thinking it doesn't matter, because the defendant has precisely the same right either way. And I guess it's easier just to say \"departure\" means generally all kinds of departures including not applying it. That's not a stretch of the language. It is quite right it is not consistent with what they thought they were up to, but not -- it is -- maybe before -- if they had passed this before Hawaii became a State, you could say: Well, they didn't think it would apply in Hawaii. So what? I mean would you decrease that, General?",
  "What happens if it's just the converse case? The same thing, I take it.",
  "We have a government appeal. The sentence was 10 years. The government thinks it should be 20. On appeal, the appellate court thinks the government is wrong, and moreover, the appellate court discovers an error: It should have been one year. And you're saying, well, according to you, not only is the court of appeals helpless, but the district court is helpless. So this person is in jail for nine years where he shouldn't have been. That's your position here?",
  "Well, that's a pretty tough position. It -- it seems to me there could be errors - - and I guess if he's sentenced to death, it's the same. I mean, the -- the -- it's a pretty tough position, isn't it? That there is no authority in the courts of appeals, or in the district court, or anywhere in the system to create -- to correct a serious error where a person could, in fact, be in prison for a long time contrary to the law.",
  "How is it supposed to work in your system that we get those errors corrected?",
  "Wait, (2)(a) and (b) I thought -- do I not have this right, (2)(a) and (b) say the same thing as (1)? It says if the sentence is too high says the defendant's appeal, then what you do is you vacate it and send it back with such instructions as the court considers appropriate.",
  "Subject to (g), which has to do with the district court. Then the other part says if it is too low and it was the government that appealed, the court shall set it aside and send it back with such instructions as it considers appropriate, again subject to (g). So all three say the same thing.",
  "That's what - -",
  "That's right.",
  "Yes, do you. If it's too high -- wait. Wait. If it is too -- ah.",
  "I see.",
  "The way to do this then is -- is -- I see -- this section foresees basically what the other side is saying. It foresees it, because it's a very unusual case what happened here.",
  "So the way you should handle it, given this section, is the court of appeals would send -- I'm trying this on -- the court of appeals says, well, it's the defendant that appealed, who appealed. He says the sentence is too high. Given what we have in front us in the issues, he's right; now we've noticed that there's is other problems here. So what we do is send it back for resentencing. And, Judge, when you resentence, look at it. And see if maybe we're right. That would be a perfectly fair way to handle it, and a normal way to handle it. Is that right?",
  "But you don't have - -",
  "Well, could do you this? Because this is quite helpful to me. Reading, I started out where Justice Scalia was at the beginning of this argument. I thought the district court normally has it open, to the judge, to resentence. Resentence is resentence. You can't be vindictive, but that's the limit. That's how it works normally, I thought. And given -- if that's so, then you look at the three sections we just saw, try to read them together, and say they certainly are written with the notion that the noticing of a plain error on the other side is going to be few and far between if ever. So the normal way to handle it is just what we said: The judge decides on the record and the appeal -- I decide this for the defendant here. But I've noticed something, says the writing judge. And of course it's open on resentencing to go into that.",
  "So if you were going to do something other than that, in the court of appeals, you'd have to have a reason, and it would have to be a fairly good reason. So you don't close off the escape hatch because we can't all foresee the future perfectly, but you say it's going to be few and far between. Now does that work?",
  "All right.",
  "There is no -- there is doubt in my mind that this particular kind of crime has not been the subject of a Supreme Court opinion. My problem is I can think of many, many awful, truly horrible circumstances that categorized in many different -- under many different criminal statutes; I'm not a moralist. I'm a judge. As a judge, I look at the law. It seems for 43 years, no one has been executed but for murder. Moreover, this Court has never approved the execution for any crime other than murder in those 43 years. Right. If I accept your argument, since I'm not a moralist, since I can think of horrible things all over the place, have I then opened the door so that, in fact, States will find lots of different crimes which are seriously horrible; and suddenly, we will be in the business of creating under the Constitution some kind of highly complex categorization, really a moral categorization of crime, method of commitment, method of, et cetera, et cetera.",
  "So the answer is yes? Your answer is if we take your position and that's -- I'm not saying it's not a good argument, just take your position, but if we take your position, I can think of instances of kidnapping; I can think of instances of torture. I can think of instances all over the place which are truly horrible. But then to take your position, what we're going to do is we are going to say legislatures all over the country do have the right under the Constitution to go, try to categorize horrible by horrible, not just death. Not just murder.",
  "Perhaps at the time, 200 years ago, that's true.",
  "And it's not true -- I've read the definition of section 41 of rape under the Louisiana code. I won't repeat it but it's very broad. And it can broad in the sense that rape itself can include a vast number of instances of child molesting, each of which is bad; but there are degrees. So I suppose that child molesting of all those kinds that are listed in 41 (c) (1) and (2), which you know I'm sure, would count as rape if committed on a person under 12. Some are absolutely horrible. Some are just bad. But that's what the other side means when he says it gives tremendous discretion to the prosecutor to pick and choose who should be executed needs further narrowing. What's your response.",
  "Those are the only two. So these other things don't count.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Can you -- can you give me one second on my own error here, but I just traced the statute through. What I did was I looked at section 42. It says, \"aggravated rape is a rape committed upon, et cetera,\" and then it says \"where the victim is under the age of 13.\" Right. So it doesn't say what rape is. So I assumed it picked up the definition of rape from section 41. And section 41 defines rape as anal or oral or vaginal sexual intercourse, and then in section three it defines oral. Now am I right; is that the correct statutory thing, or is there some other statute?",
  "All right.",
  "Then I go back to my if that is the right statutory thing, because it seems to cover, particularly in its definition of oral intercourse, a very wide range of child molesting, all of which I agree is quite bad, but it's still a very, very wide range.",
  "I didn't say it wasn't.",
  "No, I mean, my question relates back to what Justice Souter was talking about, about the narrowing of the statute.",
  "You started out by saying it's the worst cases of child abuse, and that's -- child rape -- and that's why I was interested in the definition. It seems to me this definition simply covers all instances of some kind of physical intercourse with a child, including oral, vaginal, anal. I can't imagine one that wouldn't be covered if the victim of this is under the age of 13. Now, am I right in thinking it's not the worst instances; it's every instance of rape defined that way?",
  "Thank you.",
  "So the amendment - -",
  "Thank you. I see.",
  "Will you give us one sentence or two on the response to all the professionals who've commented in the briefs in saying the death penalty here will make this situation worse?",
  "That sounds like - -",
  "What about he didn't like him? I'm the supervisor; I didn't like him.",
  "All right. Now, you say related. If the truth is I don't like this person, good-bye, now, is that rational? When you say -- I mean, you know as much about the case now as I do -- not this case but, you know, that's all we know. Is that rational or not?",
  "All right. Now that seems to me to be the problem, that either -- going back to Justice Scalia's point, you're either going to say rational in these circumstances, which means you go into it whether the time sheet was this or whether it was that or the other; or you say, hey, it's always rational because he could have fired him because he doesn't like the person. That's -- and I don't see some intermediate step there. To put the question differently, every government has a, State and Federal, has an administrative procedures act. That forbids unreasonable, arbitrary action. But why do they need that if the Constitution does it by itself?",
  "I don't know if that's -- that's why I started this. I read through, at least briefly, the circuit cases in this area. I was trying to figure it out. And it seemed to me that those circuit cases just really are finding some reason to dismiss the employee's claim, that they are not taking this seriously, that is -- I mean, I don't want to criticize them because I don't know the facts of the case; but I couldn't figure out a standard. And then I thought, well, the standard has to be the APA standard, and if it's -- I know that standard. And the reason that you don't have a million cases under that standard is because States have civil service systems.",
  "So it seemed to me that's the standard you want to apply. You want to bring all those cases into Federal court, and I'm not sure they are doing it now, really, in practice. Now what's wrong with what I've just said?",
  "No, but you could -- you could take sentiment -- I thought you could break the cases, for the most part, into two parts; one, what Justice Ginsburg said, and that's where the real reason is some kind of general characteristic, of a disfavored group. The second is the instance where the -- where the body that's acting is a body whose business it is to classify. That's zoning, taxation, and it means really classifying in fact, not some theoretical thing where you say, oh, well, they're classifying it employment because they put you in the class of such and such. But those two seem to me to handle the bulk of the cases, which, if I'm right about that, would leave your client out in the cold. So I assume you'll tell me why I'm not right.",
  "Well, you think the answer is yes, I mean, because --",
  "-- because the Administrative Procedures Act forbids arbitrary, capricious action. So you're saying the Constitution --",
  "-- does not constitutionalize all --",
  "-- arbitrary, capricious behavior --",
  "-- of the Federal Government --",
  "-- or the State government.",
  "Yes.",
  "So the answer is yes. Okay.",
  "Ma'am, the reason that we didn't say that same thing in Oleck is because in the taxation area or the easement area we simply don't have the great number of cases and also because animus is more easily established.",
  "Well, I wondered if I was right, you know; that I thought that maybe, looking back, that there is something about zoning and taxation where it normally is alleged that it's rule-making activity. And that perhaps you would apply all of these things you are talking about where what the -- even if it is employment, where what the employer is doing, or anyone else is doing, is creating rules, is classifying. And not a made-up classification like you put me and one other fired person in the fired- person category. I don't mean that. I mean like taxation and zoning and legislation. Is there anything to that?",
  "Can you back to Justice Kennedy's question, where as I took it he identifies a problem that he sees in this portion of this act which, should the limit be exceeded by our opponent, then we can go to the party and the party can give us more? Now, assume for the sake of argument that he has correctly identified a problem with that. Now, my understanding is that once the limit is exceeded and you have this extra amount, three things happen: One, an individual could contribute two or three times the amount to the party directly. A second possibility is an individual who has exceeded the global amount now gets a bump up and can contribute. And the third thing is the party thing. So focus on that statute where this is written. In your opinion, if, for the sake of argument, there were a problem with the party, would that particular form of words in the statute be severable from the rest of it?",
  "How much are we supposed to follow the common law, in your opinion, as it was in the 18th century or 12th century, or something? I mean suppose, to take a fanciful example -- I mean -- but suppose there was a common-law rule. And I know there wasn't, but suppose there was a common-law rule that said in cases involving witches you cannot admit any evidence because either the witch, the accused witch, came up out of the water when they were dunking her, and, therefore, she is guilty, so there is no need; or she is under water, which shows she is, you know, guilty, but you can't cross-examine a person under water. Now if there were a rule like that, would we now incorporate it into the Constitution of the United States? The answer is meant to be no.",
  "Now, let's get more realistic. There are all kinds of rules --",
  "Okay. So there are all kinds of rules of disqualification of witnesses in the 17th and 18th century. You couldn't testify. In this case there would have been no admission if she had been married to the man instead of being his girlfriend. You couldn't have a spouse; you couldn't have an interested party; you couldn't have a child who didn't understand the oath; you couldn't have a person who was an atheist; you couldn't have somebody who was a convicted felon. So now are we supposed to incorporate all of these things into the Confrontation Clause?",
  "It doesn't have to do with the Confrontation Clause that you couldn't cross-examine person who didn't understand the meaning of the oath?",
  "So what about a person who -- the same facts that he could not -- wasn't eligible to testify? At common law you never could have gotten that person to testify in court, no matter what. And, therefore, what? That's what I'm asking, if we are supposed to follow all of the contours of that rule.",
  "All right. But, now, does that make sense? For example, if this woman had been married, she could not. She -- her testimony -- whether your client deliberately procured her absence, accidentally procured her absence, whatever he did, that testimony could not have come in, is that right, if she was married to him?",
  "I'm trying to drive at what the contours are. Which ones do we ignore, and which don't --",
  "I don't think I did --",
  "I joined Crawford, and Justice Scalia would like to kick me off the boat, which I'm rapidly leaving in any event, but the --",
  "Right. But my question -- I want to go back because what I'm finding difficult is -- well, let's take the specific case. Suppose they had been married. If they had been married in 1789, I guess, or 1750, or 1400, or whenever, her testimony would not have come in regardless. I think I'm right on that.",
  "Yes, as a spouse. And, therefore, whether he procured her absence or not is beside the point. Now, do we follow that rule under the Confrontation Clause today?",
  "The reason, I think, is -- I think, if I understand Justice Scalia's question, take ordinary hearsay?",
  "Okay. There's a reason for keeping it out, though there are many exceptions. Now take that subset of ordinary hearsay where it was a statement made purposefully to go to trial. Now there is especially good reason for keeping it out, so like a double reason. And I think he finds it odd that we, under the common law, putting us back then, would say there's an exception where there's especially good reason for keeping it out, see, in the testimonial case, an exception where you go get the person murdered, but you didn't do it purposefully. But -- but there is no exception in just where there's only the ordinary reason for keeping it out. It should seem to work the other way around. Now, to me that suggests that maybe we shouldn't follow completely the common law as it evolved in evidentiary principles. Maybe we have to assume an intent to allow the contours of the Confrontation Clause to evolve as the law of evidence itself evolves. Otherwise, we get caught up in these logical contradictions. What do you think of that?",
  "Do you see what my question was? My question is the same question I asked your fellow counsel. My question is, since I led you to the point where you were willing to say maybe there is some flexibility here, what? That's where I'm having the trouble. What precisely are the principles I should follow to prevent my going back to look at they dunked witches, but allowing the heart of Crawford to be maintained. How do I do it? I don't know if you can answer that question, but that's the problem that I'm having.",
  "I would think these cases come in -- this problem comes in with spousal abuse. Now, I don't know what the numbers are, but I bet you could find numbers. I suspect, but I don't know, that in many cases where there's a death in that kind of situation, maybe it is accidental. Maybe the -- maybe the man who is beating up his wife didn't really want her to die.",
  "All right. So that to me, I guess, suggests that that's in favor of your rule, I think. Isn't it?",
  "And so that would be true, whether it was intended or whether it isn't intended.",
  "Whether it's -- I mean, I'm not sure how to even administer even a criminal/civil distinction.",
  "That's exactly my question.",
  "I'm going to let you answer this question - -",
  "But I want you to work mine in if you can. The problem that I'm having is what to say in the opinion. Now, could I say this? Firestone, yes, that's the way to put it as a standard. You can also teach through example. So I look at this case, I say: You want to know what that means, read the court of appeals opinion; it's perfect. Okay? So I've got Firestone -- my opinion so far is two words: \"Firestone, perfect.\" Okay? Now, what do you want me to say other than that?",
  "But I don't know what to look to in trust law. I mean, all that's happened here, every life insurance -- every company, every life insurance company has the kind of conflict that you're talking about. Every company has the kind of conflict you're talking about. And an automobile company might make shoddy merchandise so it can make more money in the short run. How does trust law keep that kind of conflict? Now, it can't be and it isn't, because I've looked it up, I think, that trust law says that every distribution by a trustee whose own fee depends on the size of the trust is conflicted.",
  "I doubt, since banks are trustees, I doubt but I'm not sure here -- -",
  "-- that banks are trustees -- suppose you were to say, look, the bank has an interest in maximizing the amount of money in its account and therefore every decision of a distribution of such trustee is subject to some special thing. Now, the problem for me in this case is what in trust law do I analogize it to, not -- I don't doubt for a second the 26 law professors, et cetera -- though I do really sometimes, but not in this case.",
  "The -- the -- so what do I look to? And where I ended up was I'd like an answer to what I asked the other side. I ended up, I can't do better than Firestone, I ought to write two words in this opinion, and the standard, perfect; from the opinion below, perfect. You want to know what I mean, read the opinion below. Okay? Now, what's your view on all of that?",
  "I overstated.",
  "Take the examples that I gave. It's an ordinary insurance policy.",
  "But that's, you see, their point. Their point is this is just an ordinary insurance company, an ordinary policy, and it's really like a bank that's a trustee that in fact takes money that hasn't been distributed and puts it on its own account. They make money for that, from that. So there is a conflict.",
  "You have that kind of conflict. What do you say about that?",
  "The bank makes its money by putting money in an account, paying interest and lending it at more money.",
  "Yes, and Chase Manhattan bank has $14 trillion in trust accounts, and if they just put in for three days money into an interest-bearing account and lend it out for five minutes, they will make $1 billion. Okay. You see, they are finding these kinds of conflicts everywhere. And that's what I'm asking you. What I think if I were to add something I'd say, look at this carefully, judge, look at it carefully; but if all you find is an ordinary insurance company doing ordinary work and there is no ground for suspicion, proceed to step two. What about that?",
  "Well, is there an example in trust law where, say, a bank's a trustee and they self-insure in some area? Is there ever a case in trust law that found that to be a conflict.",
  "Well, I mean, you can easily transpose this to other -- trusts are run by banks often that are trustees. They're huge, and they might self-insure in simple -- in certain circumstances, in which case you reproduce something like the conflict that's at issue here. And so - -",
  "And I think that -- my guess, but I don't know. That's why I'm so nervous. Is there any example where that kind of thing has ever been held to be a conflict of interest?",
  "Then what analogy? I agree with your basic point. If I encapsulate it, you may or may not agree with my encapsulation. This reminds me a lot of the argument between Learned Hand and Felix Frankfurter under what \"substantial evidence\" meant. And like Learned Hand, your side, I think, or the first argument, wants to find an absolute standard, a perfect analogy, which Frankfurter said you can't do. Very well. What's worrying me is what is the analogy? Because you're not saying it's just conflict-of-interest law. You are analogizing it to a trustee who himself is a remainderman. And it's at that point that I begin to get off this boat because I'm not sure that's the right analogy. Now, you've looked through lots of cases. Your colleague knows it better than you, and he hasn't come up with something that's a better analogy. But do you see what's bothering me? So, therefore I'm back where I started: Two-sentence, two-word opinion. We did our best in Firestone and this decision below is a good illustration of how to do it. What can you add to what I just said?",
  "So, in your view, it says in Cipollone that this -- that the four people said in Cipollone that this statute does not pre-empt State law where it's based on a prohibition of making a false statement of material fact. For example, to make a funny example, somebody could advertise smoking 42 cigarettes a day will grow back your hair.",
  "That's totally false, and in your view, that would be pre-empted, if Congress attempted to pre-empt a state law that says you cannot make a completely false statement of material fact - -",
  "-- if it's based on -- has something to do with smoking and health.",
  "Well, I was trying to produce an -- I mean, it will build strong bodies eight ways.",
  "Excuse me. The reason I think the plurality wrote this, I'm guessing, is that when you read through this statute it seems as if what Congress had in mind in the statute was not setting aside State law, which is tradition, about not making false statements, false and deceptive advertising law. It was concerned with a different thing. They said, to the cigarette companies: You have to put on the label \"Smoking is dangerous to your health.\" We don't want States telling you to put other things like that on the label, and we don't want States forbidding you to put a picture of the Marlboro man or Lauren Bacall with her cigarette. We don't want States to tell you that you can't do that. That would be focused on the object of the statute, which no one said had as its objective setting aside traditional unfair and deceptive advertising law. I think that's the argument.",
  "Well, why -- why would Congress -- I mean the difficulty that the other side raises here is just what Cipollone said. I can understand totally why Congress would not want 50 States telling cigarette companies what to say about health and smoking or taking off pictures of the Marlboro ad. I can understand that. What I can't understand is why Congress would want to get rid of, in this area, the traditional rule that advertising has to tell the truth. Now, what you said was you could end up with different applications of that in different States. Of course, every national advertiser faces that situation at the moment. Everyone who advertises across the nation could find deceptive -- anti-deception laws differently administered in different States. Yet, they'd survive. There is no evidence even that there is a problem. So why would Congress want to get rid of that particular statute?",
  "Well, why couldn't you say exactly the same thing about a State mode seeks to protect consumers, and they have a -- they have a rule, and the rule is not only the cigarette company do you have to say cigarettes are dangerous to your health, you have to put skull and crossbones? That's the state law. And you say why? They say because we are trying to protect consumers. And then you would be up here saying, they are not trying -- the duty there is not the duty to put the skull and crossbones. It's the duty to protect consumers. Now, that argument would get nowhere, as you understand. And they are saying you're making just that kind of argument here, except substitute the word \"deception\".",
  "That's what I want you to get you to talk about just for me for 30 seconds. I can't deal with this conceptual thing. It was hard for me to see it conceptually. I can't understand -- and that may be enough to any other person here, but I can't understand somebody saying yes, this language is very absolute but it doesn't mean to cover everything that it literally applies to. For example, it probably doesn't cover a requirement about workers smoking who put up billboards. And another thing you say it doesn't cover is traditional anti-deception law. That would have to do with the purpose of the statute not the text. I'm not making your argument for you. I'm giving you an introduction, and I want you to give 30 seconds dealing with the purposes that either says there is something to that line or there isn't.",
  "Isn't the point, it doesn't pre-empt rules about location; it pre-empts rules about content?",
  "That's the government's position. Now, if that's their position, isn't it just one additional step to say depending on what the history of the statute is, that it pre-empts regulations about content that don't have to do with lying about the content?",
  "What I don't understand about - -",
  "Finish because there's something - -",
  "That's the part I don't understand. It's not your fault. I don't understand it in the cases either. What First Amendment right are we talking about? There is an individual who, under the agency shop, pays dues to a union. Now, suppose the union uses some of that money in a way that has nothing to do with politics, nothing to do with speech, but it doesn't happen to benefit that particular member. For example, you can have a central union headquarters 4,000 miles away where there's a librarian who's doing research on a matter that will help lots of people, but nobody in this area. Or you could have a program to commemorate the people who were hurt in the State of Hawaii at a union uprising or strike of some kind where nobody in this particular area is ever going to go. Now, both of those activities are totally legitimate union activities that have nothing to do with politics. But this particular place won't benefit from them. Okay, what in the First Amendment prohibits the union from paying for such an activity out of general union dues assessed on everybody? And why would the First Amendment prohibit such a thing?",
  "Fine. If they are chargeable because they have nothing to do with politics, perfectly legitimate, why isn't it also chargeable to pay for the costs of a lawsuit which has nothing to do with politics, totally for a union purpose, it just doesn't happen to benefit that person who's miles away in a different local?",
  "I don't want you to tell me about cases. I'm abstracting from -- I want to know the reasoning. I want to know why.",
  "I said there is no politics in any of these expenditures. 42 bishops would swear there is nothing here that has anything to do with politics.",
  "But that's the reasoning that you seem to accept and I guess all human activity is banned. Because to my knowledge, all human activity takes place through speech with a few exceptions that are not here relevant.",
  "Is there a rule or a reg somewhere in the Labor Department that says if the national union takes its money from its local, spends it in a way that has nothing to do with politics whatsoever, zero -- but either wastes it or they build too big a building, or they do something that doesn't benefit Local Number 432, does 432 have any remedy?",
  "There is no remedy at all.",
  "So union members who are being gypped, they just have to put up with it.",
  "Right. Are you saying you could bring a lawsuit or not?",
  "So either -- in these cases everybody in the union whether they're forced or not, has this kind of remedy or nobody does? That's your - -",
  "And the case -- the case that says that a union member, person forced into the union agency shop -- and I guess a lawyer who has to pay to be an integrated bar and I guess a doctor who has to join a medical association -- the case that says that these people have a First Amendment right to get back money that's being wasted, is what?",
  "So unless it's political in your view, you don't have that right?",
  "There is a dispute between people. You look at their underlying dispute, the underlying one, and you say: Is there diversity? What's the problem?",
  "Why -- why wouldn't you do just what I said, just what we started with? You take out the arbitration agreement, and then you look to see what this dispute is about. And if it's about something that happens to involve all people from one side in one State and from another State on the other side, there is jurisdiction. Why is that a problem? I don't understand.",
  "Why?",
  "Why?",
  "So your theory -- I mean basically I think you concede that the other side has a point in sometimes it will be difficult to say what the dispute is precisely and, therefore, difficult to know if precisely this dispute does or does not -- one that you can get into Federal court on. For example, it hasn't even arisen. You know, there is no lawsuit. And I guess what would happen, what the judge should say is they should say to you you'd like to have this in Federal court, wouldn't you, this dispute? What's it about?",
  "And once he says what's it about, both sides will say, well, basically it started off -- it's just about collecting some money from in-state parties. So that's not Federal.",
  "So that, you know, something could happen here. It could happen that they could decide they want to sue in a big class action and get huge amounts of money under usury laws of the State which don't exist, so they have to proceed under an FDIC reg, and then it could be Federal. And the judge might say to you: \"What? You're just imagining.\" And that would be up to the judge.",
  "It's a kind of a defense.",
  "But you'd say then it might be the case that it wouldn't be so hard to decide.",
  "A real suit. And - -",
  "And in a real suit, there is a class action brought not just on behalf of the one you're trying to sue but on behalf of everybody, where they have to proceed under a Federal reg, and they are going to get a huge amount of money, and you say that's what we want arbitrated.",
  "So this one is not so hard to figure out.",
  "There might be some that are.",
  "Well, in his case, in the Chief Justice's case, wouldn't you say they don't get into court, probably don't because they are bringing this under a State law?",
  "Is this right? I'm asking if it may sound favorable to you, then I'll get a good response in rebuttal.",
  "If you read it the other way -- if you read it the other way, the way the Petitioners want to read it, then is this so or not? That then you look to see if there is Federal jurisdiction of the arbitration agreement; is that right?",
  "Yes, under their interpretation.",
  "So, what you could have is you could have two parties sign an arbitration agreement that lasts for a year that governs all disputes between them, and one is from Vermont; the other from California.",
  "So there is jurisdiction. And all the disputes happen to involve just pure matters of -- that never could come into Federal court. I mean there are such matters you could argue about.",
  "But nevertheless, we have a Federal court issuing this injunction, under their theory.",
  "Assuming they are right.",
  "Oh, I see. The arbitration agreement has to meet the amount in controversy.",
  "All right. So then probably no arbitration agreement in itself meets the amount.",
  "So if you didn't look through, then this would apply to nothing?",
  "If the arbitration - -",
  "The arbitration agreement has to -- they talk about the arbitration agreement, then you could have really important Federal questions in substantive issues - -",
  "-- that couldn't come in because the arbitration agreement doesn't? Or you could have State questions that would suddenly come in because the arbitration agreement does. The arbitration -- but now you're saying, well, that second case is never going to arise.",
  "Probably not, because no arbitration agreement has -- so then it becomes a nullity of the statute?",
  "Except to overcome the ouster. Okay. We've got your side of it.",
  "That's your view, but I mean believe me, I think I can keep that problem under control. That was your original point. I see the point, it's going to spread too far; you'd have to have some rules that cabin it. Assume I got that under control; maybe I don't. This is a case of \"well, his brother was worse.\" What do you want to say about the criticisms of the horrible things that happen if we adopt your position?",
  "Why, if there is no negligence? Why do you need to argue that and why do you argue that? I mean doesn't there have to be at least negligence on somebody's part?",
  "Well, either of those things are negligence or worse.",
  "So what I didn't understand is why you would charge the police with anything or suppress a warrant where there was a mistake but no one was negligent or worse.",
  "But what you argued for - -",
  "-- you said, it should be suppressed even if no one is negligent or worse. And I have trouble seeing why you're suppressing a warrant where no one does anything wrong at all.",
  "I mean, I don't know what the underlying law is here. I mean -- I guess it's little weird, but what happens if the policeman arrests the wrong person, but it's nobody's fault? You know, the person was pretending to be his brother.",
  "Or the mother said it's John and it's really Joe. And so, the policeman wasn't at fault. They arrest the wrong person. I guess that's happened in history - -",
  "-- but do they suppress things then? I wouldn't think so - -",
  "-- but maybe they do.",
  "But do we suppress?",
  "We do not? Okay.",
  "So there's no reason then, if we don't suppress when there's no error in the part of the policeman, none, it was just a weird circumstance, then I don't understand why we would suppress here. And nor do I understand why you have to argue this because I thought it's clear here that there is error, and it was negligently caused. There were four months that went by without anybody doing anything about this mistake.",
  "There is one question I have in my mind, and it's the only factor I thought of hypothetically that cuts against you. This is the argument and I'd like you to respond to it. I take everything you said as so. I'll assume all that. And so I'd still say the rule, the basic rule of suppression, putting Leon to the side, basic rule is -- the opposite of Holmes: If the constable blunders, you suppress the evidence. Okay. Now, our prior case -- here we have a case where the constable blundered. I grant you, not the arresting officer. It was a different policeman, and it was a different form of error. But five months this thing -- this warrant had been recalled five months earlier and you agree that it was negligent. Therefore, the constable blundered. And the virtue of our earlier case where we said don't suppress, it wasn't the constable who blundered. So I see an absolutely clear line: If the constable blunders you suppress; if it's somebody else who blundered, you don't. Now, every time I've tried to think of a substitute for that clear line, I've run into trouble. I've been sitting in my chambers with my law clerks and we've tried out five substitutes, and I can't find one decent substitute that isn't filled with problems.",
  "What is your substitute?",
  "Right. Well, I'm overstating my point. What I'm really driving at and trying to show you is you, if you want to have a different rule than within the prior case, remember the one where it wasn't the police that blundered, you have to come up with some rule. And I want to know what your rule is.",
  "So now we have -- let's think about that. The special rule is now we have the Leon exception and now we have a new exception, and the new exception is called for isolated police clerical errors. Well, that's going to be interesting, I suspect. The first thing you'll have when you try to impose your rule is you will have the defense attorneys throughout the city going in to see if it's an isolated error. And they will, of course, have a right to decide whether or not this is the only such error, whether there are other clerical errors, how often they occur, what the -- is that an administrable rule?",
  "One other question. Suppose that the error here consisted not of a computer, but rather Joe, who is the policeman, has a partner called Sam, and Sam told Joe that this is Harry Smith, when negligently it wasn't Harry Smith? It was Joe Smith.",
  "Well, I mean does that count as a clerical error if, in fact, it's the man's partner who tells him this negligently?",
  "Negligent. It's Negligent police work.",
  "That's negligent error. You mean we don't suppress the negligent errors of the partners who, after all, say, let's arrest this man over here, and through negligence they have got the wrong man? We don't suppress?",
  "There must be millions - - not millions, but there must have been cases where two policemen or one policeman goes off to arrest someone and negligently arrests the wrong man. And when he does that and does a search, we don't suppress.",
  "That's Leon. I'm not thinking that.",
  "I'm not thinking of a warrant. I'm thinking of a policeman who has a warrant for Jack Smith and he goes to arrest Jack Brown because through negligence he went to the wrong house. Now, under those circumstances would we suppress the drugs that happen to be found in Jack's house.",
  "Well, there must have been a lot of cases.",
  "But what about the lower courts? What have they done?",
  "Can I use 30 seconds of your eight minutes because I want some clarity on this.",
  "Divide in your mind two separate things: The nature of the bad conduct: is it negligent, reckless, deliberate; and the other question is who engaged in it -- a police department official or some other official? I thought this case was about the second question, but now I'm confused about the first question because I suppose a policeman, an arresting officer makes a negligent error. He goes to the wrong house. And he never looks at the number; and he arrests, starts to arrest the wrong person: Is the evidence suppressed? If the evidence isn't suppressed, frankly, I don't see why a clerical official should be held to a higher standard; but if the evidence is suppressed then quite possibly the clerical official should be held to the same standard. So you've heard the government say well, the answer isn't clear; very often a negligent official -- a negligent officer would not have that evidence suppressed. Well, what is it?",
  "He was not.",
  "I want to know if he is negligent.",
  "Excuse me, because I think I'm getting a different view from the government.",
  "All right. So we've got this - -",
  "Where -- where is it? I mean, if you want to -- if you want to search, you can impound the car. If you want to search, you can ask for consent, which you probably won't get. If you want to search, you can look in the window. There's no problem there. It's just under the seat and in the glove compartment we're talking about. If you have probable cause to think that there's evidence of a crime even in the glove compartment or underneath the seat, you can look at it without a warrant. Why do you need this as well? You say we need this as well because the guy who's locked up in back of the squad car might take off the handcuffs, open the door, run out, and grab a gun from under the glove compartment. That's a little thin. And then you say, well, the rule is it needs to be administrable. And then I say, okay, the rule is administrable if you've got him locked up in the squad car and all you want to do is have a good snoop around, take it in and impound it. That's administrable.",
  "I got that point. Are there many people, by the way, they arrest but they leave them standing outside the squad car?",
  "I mean are we going to have one of these spectrum things?",
  "Well, that's actually a serious point, maybe in your favor because it -- what was worrying me about this is, if you lose the case, there would be policemen who would then let dangerous people stay in the car so they could search it. But you haven't made that argument, and, you know, that would be the - -",
  "No, nobody would.",
  "I -- I mean I don't know if it can go off on that. The -- it seems to me I -- I thought when I looked through this, which was quickly, it seemed to me everyone was assuming that it's contemporaneous. Of course, if it isn't contemporaneous, that's a new world, and maybe you would win on that. I don't know. But don't we have to for present purposes take it as a contemporaneous search, which I think is what the lower courts found?",
  "Well, I'm sure there are, but what is your opinion? I mean, is there some reason what I have been doing -- you can tell me -- I am finding this case very, very difficult. And I am not at all certain in my own mind, and I am being quite frank with you. And the reason is that although I don't think Belton is very logical, it has been the law for 27 years; and I take they seriously, as we all do, the principle of stare decisus. That is why your response to Justice Alito really sort of shook me. Because I was thinking, one, I have to take this as contemporaneous; and I have to run squarely into the problem that for some period of years Belton has been the law and maybe even before Belton. I don't know about Thomas Jefferson's automobile. But, nonetheless, no disaster has occurred, and so why would we overrule an earlier case? Now that's -- that's exactly my problem. And so if you were interested in that, you have to give me an answer.",
  "Well are you saying do you have any in my own mind perhaps differently from you I think that the stare decisus is really brought into play when you think the earlier decision was wrong.",
  "And at that point I'd still need a reason why you should depart from that earlier decision at the moment what the other side says is we tell our police a simple thing. We tell them when you arrest somebody who is in a car you can search the passenger compartment of the car okay. Simple. And we've trained a hundred thousand police officers to do that and they do it. Now, is there some indication that that's turned out to be abusive? Is there indication that there are other problems with the rule as it turned out to be complicated? What kinds of things you could say that will overcome what I'm putting forth as a kind of reluctance.",
  "At the end of your argument, could you just spend a minute because my state of mind is I'm sorry we limited it. You've sort of briefed this question pretty fully.",
  "And I'm tempted to try to decide it. I know you want to make your four points. Go right ahead. But at the end, could you possibly say, why shouldn't we just go ahead and decide the substance, not as a technical matter. Are we really going to get something out of remanding it that we don't already know? But don't do that now, but whenever you want.",
  "Well, could we do this? I mean, what's bothering me about this is -- is you have a very strong argument following the plan documents. They have had some chance to reply to it, but not a full chance. It seems a little unfair, and the Fifth Circuit had -- would probably know what they say. Okay. Can we, say, grant the question now and ask that people file an additional brief if they want to say something? It just seems to me an awful waste of money and everybody's time to send it back and have it make another trip. So what's your suggestion as to how we proceed?",
  "You see, I want to be fair to them. I mean, we want -- you want to be fair to the other side to be sure they have a chance to say everything they have to say. That's what's worrying me.",
  "Well, that doesn't make too much sense, does it, where all that happens is it's just waived. The wife waived the amount because when she waived the amount, she doesn't give it to anybody. She just doesn't take it. So it goes to the beneficiary - - it goes to the person who made up the plan. It's a little hard to pay to him, because he is dead. So I mean if you read it literally, it doesn't seem to apply, these (ii) and (iii), to the case before us, which is a case of waiver. And of course the argument, yes, she makes is that throughout the law, waiver is treated differently. And if it weren't, you'd have to pay gift tax, for example, when you waive a benefit that's given to you by someone else. And so let's interpret this and make sense of the language you quoted, and consistent with the rest of the law to say a waiver is waivered. It's not giving something to somebody else.",
  "The argument is against you and I would like to hear what you have to say.",
  "I'm -- I didn't follow, I'd have to admit. I think -- and you perhaps can explain it to me -- but, I thought the things that you are quoting are QDRO is about an effort to alienate some property that would otherwise go to the person who was setting up a QDRO, in other words, the wife here, in other words Liv here; is that right?",
  "Okay. The one person who couldn't be an alternate payee is the payor. And so, in fact, when you waive something, it isn't that it necessarily goes back to some alternate payee, as it didn't here. It simply went back to the payor. And so the language of this prevision you're quoting just doesn't deal with this case.",
  "I know you do, and that's what I need to ask.",
  "I'm sorry. It says, if it's not, the issue to wit is not resolved, then the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts to the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order.",
  "Now, you think that includes the giver, the payor?",
  "Well, that's where this goes if you waive it.",
  "I'm five minutes behind. I just got your point on the (iii)(1). I see it.",
  "Okay? I get it.",
  "Let me go back for a second because, while I got it five minutes late, if I have it right, I still don't see why Congress would have done it literally. I think what you're saying is: \"Read the full four pages. What those four pages say are, Judge, you have an order, a divorce decree. It's defined as an order. Look at it. It's qualified or it isn't. If it's qualified, pay the money to the person it names. If it's not qualified, pay the money to the person, namely Liv, who would have been entitled to the amount if there had been no order.\" Okay. You read that literally as you want and what it says is: \"Liv, you're being divorced. You want a divorce; your husband wants a divorce; you're going to be divorced. You cannot waive the benefit under the plan.\" Now, why would Congress not want her to be able to waive it? Why?",
  "I can understand an anti - alienation provision. That's some guy who is going to come along and grab this money when you want to take care of a widow, and you want to take care -- but -- but this isn't that. It's just -- she just wants to waive it; she doesn't want it. That's the widow herself. Okay, so why would Congress - -",
  "I see.",
  "Is the -- is the wife -- I'm thinking of the Chief Justice's question, too. If your -- the woman is Wife X, and her ex has a pension. Doesn't something vest there? She is in California. Doesn't she have some vested right to some of that pension?",
  "Suppose she's married for 40 years to Joe Smith, Joe Smith earns a pension and then he wants a divorce. Doesn't she have some right to some of that money.",
  "Does she get some of the money he saved?",
  "So it's not exactly that you could have just changed the beneficiary. If you just changed the beneficiary, you'd have to give her something else.",
  "But in the divorce proceeding she's going to get some of the money, which is now just the inverse point, to which she is entitled. So obviously she will get something, but she's entitled to it.",
  "Why don't you follow what the EEOC says? I mean, the EEOC, as I understand it, has said the very fact the employer has initiated an investigation of an alleged discrimination is sufficient to demonstrate the reasonableness of the employee's belief that by providing information relevant to the inquiry she is opposing an employment practice made unlawful by Title VII. And then they go on. To be absolutely clear about it, they say an employee who assists her or her employer in the endeavor, i.e., you go and testify; so the sun was shining on that day; you are assisting your employee by telling the truth-- is by definition -- is opposing practices made unlawful by Title VII. So here we have a difficult question, quite an interstitial question, defining precisely \"opposing,\" and here we have the EEOC doing it. So why don't we just follow what they say?",
  "Is this a real problem? I mean, let's suppose the opposition clause protects everybody in the internal investigation who could be at all interpreted as favorable to the complainant. It also protects everybody who could possibly be viewed as neutral. Then you have a problem about what about a person who loves sexual harassment? This is the hypothetical: he comes in, testifies: I love sexual harassment; it's wonderful, and they fire him. Now is this a real problem?",
  "The problem with that is that I -- while I have the EEOC with me, say, on - - assuming your thing -- on, from what I read, on the opposition clause, when I looked into what the EEOC actually said here on the participation clause, I don't think I can characterize it, except for their litigation position.",
  "I can't characterize what they've said in their compliance manual as being with you on that.",
  "And they could easily change it. They could easily change it.",
  "Yes. It's not in their manual.",
  "Well, that isn't even - - look, the best way to oppose a crime is to cooperate with the police when they investigate individual instances. The best way to oppose sexual discrimination in the workplace is to cooperate with the employer when, in fact, he investigates individual instances. Is what I've just said English? Does it make sense? And indeed, I'm just quoting the EEOC's own definition.",
  "It is your opinion. The EEOC's opinion is, as they state, the best way to oppose is to cooperate. Now, what are we to do with, at least ambiguity, giving you that, I'll give you ambiguity. But we have the agency charged with the enforcement of this taking the side of it that is the opposite side that you are taking.",
  "It is a mix. I mean, you know, a lot of plaintiffs might be afraid to bring these cases because they'll be accused of doing all kinds of bad things. They don't want their reputations ruined. They have lawyers who take contingent fees because they have to pay for it. Oh the other hand, you have problems with your costs and you have problems dismissing people who should be dismissed. Everybody has problems in this area. That's why we have law and lawyers. They try to minimize it. This doesn't seem fruitful to me.",
  "Suppose you have to do it. Given all your work so far, how long would it take? You had several months already, so how long? When could you do it by?",
  "So we're talking about two months.",
  "That's exactly what Justice Kennedy started to ask. I mean, I said why doesn't this thing go away after two months. I mean, you've done it anyway, and Justice Kennedy said because you want a holding from the Court that will help you in other cases because you think what the court below did here was wrong. And you said \"three reasons,\" and you got out the first one, and I would like to hear the other two.",
  "Well, I wouldn't -- look, you have an EIS for the reason that the agency itself, once it reads it, might decide to do something else. That's the whole point of an EIS. So if the agency goes ahead with the action before reading the EIS, it becomes committed to that course of action, and the chances that the EIS will lead it to back up are the same as the chances that any big agency will back up once it's committed to a course, namely a lot lower. And that I always thought was the whole harm that the EIS is there to stop.",
  "I didn't see evidence to the contrary on two important points. The first was that the Navy had affidavits which says -- they say -- I read them. Maybe I just missed the contrary. But they said that: You are requiring us, judge, to turn the sonar down to six decibels or up to six, whatever, whenever we had to run into a situation called layering of different temperature levels. And we tell you, as naval officers, that that's just where submarines like to hide. And we also tell you that if we can't train people to do that they will miss out on an important part of how to find these submarines. I saw no answer to that. The second thing they said was that: We're willing to turn off the sonar if there's any marine mammal that comes within 500 yards, which is a quarter of a mile, about. But you insist that we turn off the sonar when any animal comes within a mile and a quarter. And that's quite a big distance more. A lot of animals come in there, and if we have to turn off the sonar all those times, we are not going to be able to get much training done. Now, those two things seem to be quite important. And I just might have missed, which I might have, which is why I'm asking, what the response was by equivalent experts to those points.",
  "What do you mean, despite the complete absence?",
  "That's the whole point. That's why I thought they didn't prove anything. Fine, they went on some exercises and they didn't run into these layered things. So obviously they couldn't have training.",
  "Now, what they are saying is, when you do run into that situation you've got to train people to deal with it. It doesn't prove much that when you didn't run into it they didn't train people to deal with it. How could they have?",
  "That's what I can't - - look, I don't know anything about this. I'm not a naval officer. But if I see an admiral come along with an affidavit that says -- on its face it's plausible - - that you've got to train people when there are these layers, all right, or there will be subs hiding there with all kinds of terrible weapons, and he swears that under oath. And I see on the other side a district judge who just says, you're wrong, I then have to look to see what the basis is, because I know that district judge doesn't know about it, either. So, the basis so far I'm thinking on this one is zero. That's -- because what you have told me is they completed some exercise where they didn't find any layering.",
  "Generalities. You see - - of course, I agree with you as a generality. What I am missing here is the specifics, because I am nervous about it, as you can see. And what I am nervous about is that there just wasn't enough on the other side, on your side.",
  "This is -- I want to give you a chance to say what's so terrible about what they're doing. I will express a little frustration. Not your fault. But why couldn't you work this thing out? I mean, they are willing to give you quite a lot of conditions, and you say, well, we have got to have more conditions. And you are asking us who know nothing about whales and less about the military to start reading all these documents to try to figure out who's right in the case where the other side says the other side is totally unreasonable. And the issue at law seems to be something that is going to last for two months. So -- so, why? What is so -- what is the important thing here?",
  "How does the basic thing work? Because to a layperson, when I think of the armed forces preparing an environmental impact statement, I think, the whole point of the armed forces is to hurt the environment. I mean - -",
  "I don't under -- I don't understand how it's supposed to work. Of course they are going to do something that is harmful.",
  "You see the point, I am trying to give you a -- overstating it.",
  "You go on a bombing mission, do they have to prepare an environmental impact statement first?",
  "No.",
  "How does it work?",
  "I don't see why you backed down on this.",
  "Standing itself, I mean, it's a little unusual. Suppose -- I mean, Congress here has passed a statute and the statute specifically aims at a class of litigants. And it says to the class of litigants, if you are a member of it, we are telling you what we want the agency to do and that is to promulgate a certain appeal procedure. Now, if you are a member of the class that frequently litigates and you frequently take advantage of that procedure, why aren't you heard as a litigant, at least enough for Article III? And we know as far as prudential standing is concerned, Congress wanted to give you standing, so I think would it take care of that. Are you saying no matter -- that just normal litigants in the courts who reappear time and time again in certain kinds of cases, don't have standing to challenge a procedural rule, if Congress under Article III and Congress specifically tells them they can?",
  "Let's imagine that Congress did, Congress did say: By the way, lawyers who have handled 17 tort cases in the last year where the value has been more than $500,000 and who will sign an affidavit saying they intend to continue in that branch may appeal from the court's promulgation of the following general rule, dah, dah, dah. And that Constitution prohibits Congress from doing that?",
  "Right. Those who -- fine, forget that, yeah.",
  "You mean Article III and at Westminster -- at Westminster, when Westminster, whatever they had, they must have had some procedural rules, and sometimes they had general procedural rules -- I don't know what the history is; I could look it up. But I would be amazed if the lawyers at that time or the clients who had certain cases were not permitted to challenge those rules as contrary to some other rules. Do we know the answer to that?",
  "No, no, no. Generally. Because you have a special procedure, here's what you can generally challenge our rules.",
  "Okay, then your answer is, if Congress says you can do it, have a general challenge to people who generally appear, your answer is if Congress says they could do it, Article III doesn't stop them?",
  "Ah. What's the answer to that different question?",
  "Ah, but - -",
  "And I am pursuing this, but I'm actually having a hard time with this. Suppose - - suppose Congress passes a statute; the statute says every citizen of the United States has a right to receive notice of a certain set of Forest Service actions. Everybody. We want everybody who wants it to have notice. Now, if somebody really wants that notice and they don't get it, can they sue?",
  "Yes. Sorry.",
  "In any case, I'm trying to make it look like FOIA.",
  "That's just what I am trying to do, and you say yes, they probably could, at least if you are just supposed to get a piece of paper that says \"Notice.\" Now suppose Congress says, if you can show you are the kind of person who regularly asks and needs such notices, and if a regulation is promulgated interpreting this statute, you can challenge that reg prior to enforcement. Now does that violate Article III?",
  "Suppose they did this. Suppose they said each agency has the legal power to promulgate regs interpreting FOIA as to when you get the thing, and when you don't, and moreover people who are regular FOIA requesters can challenge those regs prior to enforcement; what about that one?",
  "I am looking for a principle that is going to help me.",
  "The problem they are asking you on this -- it was at least a problem for me -- I think it's tough on rightness is because the government is saying here: Look, you want to challenge it outside the context of a particular action that you don't like. Well, there's never going to be an action, never going to be such an action that we are going to take that you won't find out about, that you will not be able to challenge in that context if you are really hurt. There isn't one. You can't name one that's ever been or imagine one that ever will be, okay? Now, is that so?",
  "You see where they are going next. And if you -- suppose that the thing you just told me, too, has problems or suppose it's pretty hard to find one, then the -- why this has never been decided and why it's difficult. Because I would start with Abbott Labs and say there are three considerations. How easy is it now to solve the legal problem? Here? Perfectly easy. Nothing's going to change. Factor two, how likely is it that they will work with this legal rule and change it around here? Zero. But three, what kind of harm is it going to cause to the plaintiff if you were to deny him relief now? And they are saying here that's also zero or next to zero. So what do you do if the factor that cuts one way is zero and the factor that cuts the other way is zero, or near zero? Now, I have to admit I have never seen a case on that. I don't know if there has been one before, and I don't know exactly what to do. And if you can go read the appendix, maybe I can escape the zero.",
  "Can I go back to standing for a minute.",
  "You may have looked this up and may have found something here. Suppose an organization that has a purely ideological interest, so it can't get into Federal court, nonetheless can go before an agency; but they are not going to get into Federal court. Now, suppose that agency then has a reg that they think is lawful and makes their life more difficult. I guess that the fact that they suffer a procedural injury would not get them into court. They are already somebody who doesn't; they don't. So I can imagine cases saying that. Contrast that with the case with a person who has a very concrete specific injury, a terrible allergy to chemical X, and they often litigate that there is too much chemical X, and now they are before an agency and they frequently complain about chemical X, but they don't have a particular case, but they will often be there. Now, the agency promulgates a procedural regulation that hurts those people who normally have a concrete injury. All right? There I wonder if that purely procedural injury cannot serve as a basis for standing. Now, do the cases ask -- so I am contrasting the two kinds of questions, and I wonder what you found in the cases as to the second kind, as opposed to the first kind; and you are free to answer this as one word \"nothing; go look it up yourself, which is a fair comment.",
  "You think you are like the second?",
  "I don't see how those claims could possibly succeed, but I thought -- let's go back to sort of step 1. My mind turns a little confused when I start thinking of these cases. Are we talking about a case of -- where the claim is normally vote dilution? Is that yes or no?",
  "Section 2 -- does vote dilution mean we who are a minority group, let's say a black group, could have elected a candidate of our choice more likely than the white group, but because you are engaged in vote dilution, that isn't going to happen anymore? Is that the form of the claim?",
  "That's the form of the claim. Then, it's our problem here that to see whether that's so, you have to see whether the black group did really vote as a group. Did they used to have a good chance to elect the person they want, and does the white group tend to also vote as a group and swamp them? Is that what we are trying to find out?",
  "There are a lot of reasons that can happen. But is the evil we are trying to get at, the evil of a black group, when they stick together in polarized voting, having less of a chance of getting their candidate elected than when the white group does the same?",
  "That's what we are trying to prevent? Okay. If that's what we are trying to prevent, then haven't we learned that putting a threshold, because you can't even get in the door -- you can't even get in the door -- unless the black group accounted for 50 percent of something, the voters or the people who turn out, that that doesn't make much sense for the reason that Justice Scalia started with. It doesn't make much sense because sometimes they account for 51 percent, but they can't elect anybody, because they all divide on four different people, or maybe they didn't turn out. On the other hand, sometimes if they account for 43 percent, they could elect the candidate of their choice. So it looks as if that 50 percent is pretty arbitrary and we're looking for a better criterion. Is there anything wrong with what I've said so far?",
  "Here what we've -- could we look to see whether the three Gingles factors, whatever they are -- one was, is the black group numerous enough to elect the candidates of their choice? Reasonably compact, politically cohesive? And then you look to see, does the white group tend to vote as a bloc to stop them?",
  "That's what we should do?",
  "Then I'm back to my problem, that sometimes the 50 percent criteria just doesn't measure that first part. And so you say, well, any other matter would be worse, but I bet we could invent some that were actually better. Suppose you wouldn't have to go to 20 percent; suppose, for example, you started looking in the 40 percents, and you said, you know, if the black group is going to elect their candidate with 40 percent, or 45 percent even, they're going to need a lot of crossovers, because they may only vote -- you know, only 80 percent may turn out. They are going to need a lot of crossovers. And the more crossovers you have to have, the harder it is to say that that white group is out there trying to beat them. So there's a kind of natural stopping place. When I worked out the numbers, it seemed that natural stopping place fell around 42-43 percent. It sort of fell -- as you said, that the black group -- you insist that the black group had to be twice as many as the white group that crossed over. A little arbitrary, but at least we were getting to the same -- to the right thing. I mean -- respond as you wish.",
  "If you want an absolute, arbitrary rule, which is what you were heading toward which will just -- - the question is whether they get in the door. If they are in the door, they have to prove the three factors. And you want to keep certain people out. Okay. Suppose you say, well, 42 percent. That gives you down to 40, with your two back, instead of 50. But you are out anyway if the crossover vote from the white majority is more than half of what the whole vote is with the black and white together on that side. So you have a two-to-one ratio. Now, the only virtue of that is that there was an effort to try to get an arbitrary rule, which you have with your 50 percent, even -- only a little bit more difficult than that to -- to administer, and is likely to get in more cases that are justified. But they still have to prove their three factors.",
  "It takes into account the realistic fact that in every group, including lots of African-American groups, there is -- it is not 100 percent African American at all. There are -- there are a few others who will come along, and -- and that's still the candidate of that community's choice.",
  "So we want -- a little flexibility here is all that I'm suggesting.",
  "You can't get below 42. I'm not going to get below 40 no matter what, even with your thumb on the scale.",
  "They are -- they are finished at 40, and they are not even in at 40, if they have to depend more than two-to-one on the crossovers.",
  "The rule I suggested, though there are arbitrary aspects is a better targeted, more administrable -- or equally administrable or not much worse administrable arbitrary rule.",
  "There must be somebody there to get you over 50 percent.",
  "Thirty-three plus 11 is 44. So where does the rest come from?",
  "That's 40, and then -- oh, I see, 39 plus 11.",
  "If they vote cohesively.",
  "It is quite difficult. I mean there -- we don't know quite a lot about whether they would have gotten a warrant, how -- how dangerous it was, whether the drugs were likely to be hidden. And I was thinking of it, and that's why I am saying this, is that it's a perfect reason since constitutional questions in this area are -- are like the stars in the sky. There are so many. Rather than having the judges answer each one and getting everything mixed up, why not just have them take whatever is the easier path? As a judge I like to take what is the easier path.",
  "And if it's easier to deal with the qualified immunity, deal with it and forget the rest of it.",
  "I see that, but unless we do that here, they are never going to get the right message. And so what we will have is 1,000 judges trying in an average in a year 50 or 60 cases each with multiple facts, and we will have approximately over a 10-year period hundreds of thousands. I've exaggerated, but there will be many, many -- many, many conflicts, many, many confusions. And unless we say, no, we are not doing it ourselves, how will they ever get the message?",
  "We don't always have to do it, but I mean once.",
  "-- to the question. I mean, look, if I have to answer the constitutional question -- and what bothers me is this consent at one remove. What? You are saying a drug seller who lets in a disguised policeman in order to sell him a drug because he thinks he's a druggie is suddenly consenting to the entire LAPD coming into his house? I would think that is the last thing he would have thought about wanting, not the first.",
  "Well, maybe they both should be the same. I - -",
  "Imagining -- you are imagining different cases. We can imagine a spectrum of cases. In some cases the policeman or the confidential informant will be there, and he really couldn't have gotten a -- a thing in advance -- a warrant in advance. It wasn't certain, and they are in there and they see a lot of drug behavior going on, and the drugs are going to be hidden, go, disappear the second he leaves; and if he tries to arrest them, everybody is going to jump on him and kill him. Okay? So there are a lot of cases just like this one, but with a few changes, which are -- he needs to call the police, and there will be others where he doesn't. So that's why I am so uncertain about what it is we are deciding here on the merits. We would have to say on the merits this is a case where there are no exigent circumstances. Can we say that? I -- would not want to \"never are there.\"",
  "Am I right in -- I just want to get the facts right. Am I right, you did this historical research, and if you start with Apprendi we can go all the way back to Nebuchadnezzar and you haven't found a single case ever where it was a jury rather than a judge that made this question of how you put together sentences for two separate crimes committed on the same occasion? Is that right, or is it an overstatement?",
  "I didn't say how far you went back. I said as far as you went back.",
  "I don't know what Nebuchadnezzar found, but I take it you did look to see what was true at the time of the writing of the Constitution.",
  "And at the time of the writing of the Constitution, which sometimes some of us feel is relevant, in that instance they did have the judge, not the jury, decide how to create a total sentence where the person had committed two crimes on the same occasion.",
  "What about the -- what about restitution, forfeiture, taking a child and having him tried as an adult? What about probation? What about alternative drug programs? What about diversion? I mean, I can think of five or six where there might be a factual finding necessary to proceed to a situation where the total amount of punishment is greater rather than less.",
  "And doesn't the sentencing -- doesn't the Federal law define a sentence to include restitution, to include what is the equivalent of probation? I mean, there is a broad definition of the word \"sentence\" in the law which includes some of the things that I mentioned, though not all.",
  "In Oregon traditionally if a burglar had broken into a house and while he was in the house commits a rape, traditionally in Oregon that would not be considered two crimes?",
  "Can you cite me an Oregon case which says a burglar who breaks in and commits rape is only guilty of one crime?",
  "How are you to prove these? I am always curious as to the defense policy as to why. Stricter and stricter rules here, and I have a hard time figuring out why. If you have an actual case and you have to go to trial, are you prepared to put on all the evidence that although you want to say that your client did neither of these things, that if he did do them, in fact they were just one thing and weren't separate things? I mean are you prepared to go into all that detail in front of the jury?",
  "No, you are saying that the standard they use here for a separate sentencing, that it has to be a separate crime and so forth, has to go to the jury.",
  "Okay. So I wonder if you are prepared to put all those facts before the jury, say, in a case where you want to say that it wasn't my defendant who did it.",
  "That way, you have to have two - -",
  "And in addition, it must be true too that the defendant is entitled not to pay restitution if the facts show that there was no money taken. And you needn't, by the way, convict the person. You can convict him without finding that. So the same would be true of restitution. We would have another jury to decide restitution, another thing that has never been done; is that right?",
  "No, couldn't impose restitution without making a finding as to how much money was taken. So I don't -- I don't -- I can't imagine the legislature - -",
  "All right. The Federal courts have not and I guess the same rule would apply. Or what about forfeiture of a car used in the drug - - again, forfeiture, I guess, would take place with another jury being impanelled to try the question of whether there was a car; is that right?",
  "It's a punishment.",
  "Maybe not. Maybe it would just be an in rem proceeding. What about the -- what about the proceeding -- what about the determination that a person who is going to trial goes to an adult court rather than a juvenile court, the difference being the extent of the punishment? You are not entitled to -- a complete defense to the punishments that they could impose. Do you see where I am going?",
  "I'm not sure which of these things would actual follow from your rule and which wouldn't.",
  "But they will say no one can get this lower punishment for the juvenile system unless the person is indeed a juvenile. Who makes that factual finding?",
  "If we are going to depart from what the Framers did in fact foresee in this kind of case and we do accept Apprendi as something different from what they did apply, does that require us to depart as well in all these other cases which have the kinds of differences that you have listened to?",
  "Counsel, don't -- well, the case that I mentioned on my account. I'm thinking about it -- it's not going to make any difference.",
  "But you should have said \"no\" to the question, I think. Because I thought the question -- whatever it was, you are saying that there isn't a reasonable likelihood that its error influenced the outcome. You are not saying that?",
  "Yes.",
  "I agree with that. And my question is going to be -- at some point, both of you seem to agree with that so -- pretty much, it's a harmless error standard of review. I think a wrote a case on that, which says that - -",
  "Right. So why don't we just send it back and say apply the standard?",
  "You're saying that I should have grave doubt myself and any judge would have to. He made an argument here I think that wasn't such a bad one. He said look at page 14 and you'll see the mistake, you know, in the joint appendix.",
  "There it is. And it's absolutely wrong. The basic instruction under the law says you have to be engaged in the crime and you have to have a certain state of intent. You have to have committed this murder in order to help the crime or at least in order to escape.",
  "And that's wrong. Put them together, but then look at the instruction on page 13, which he actually gave, and the one on 13 really does seem to say that, or more so. It says, you can only apply -- jury, you can only apply this special instruction if two things are true: First, in lines 9 through 12 of that instruction, it seems to repeat that you have to be engaged in the crime. And then just before that, it says, and you have to have one of two states of mind. You have to either intend to kill the person or at least be recklessly indifferent. And since that's what we said on page 13, the fact we made a mistake on page 14 doesn't matter that much. That's one of his arguments that I'm sure they have a lot of evidentiary ones and a bunch of other ones.",
  "I'm sure that would be -- I mean, what worries me is proliferating arguments among judges. Why not just say, you know, apply Brecht. I'd like it with the O'Neal clause because it seems to me the O'Neal clause applies.",
  "Just go do it. And then they can say \"we already did it,\" or they can say \"we didn't already do it, but we'll do it now.\" Let them say what they want to say.",
  "Can you help me with this? Suppose I'm a trial judge and I instruct the jury in a technical matter, an important but technical matter, and when they have questions about it I say read the instruction. Suppose I'm right as far as the instruction goes. But say the prosecutor gets everybody mixed up. Now, I guess if the prosecutor gets people mixed up enough, that could becomes a due process violation. But I suspect that it has to be quite a lot of mix-up, that intuitively is what I suspect. Are there any cases I should look at, one that would tell me how mixed up the prosecutor has to get everybody before it's a due process violation?",
  "In Brown, in that case did they find that he did get them too mixed up or he didn't?",
  "He did not. So unless in this case the prosecutor got everybody more mixed up than in the Brown case, we should just reverse.",
  "That's exactly what the instruction said. My problem is, I guess different people, I understand, can read the same words and come to different conclusions. But I have read the instruction and the statute, probably over a dozen times by now, and I can't find the slightest ambiguity. It seems to be absolutely clear. What it says is you're instructed that a person is guilty -- I would say what crime is the jury considering -- of a crime. Namely, second-degree murder crime, if it is committed by another person for which he is legally accountable. Then it says you're an accomplice -- an accomplice -- it says a person is an accomplice with certain knowledge when he aids another person in planning or committing a crime; the crime, second-degree murder. What is the problem?",
  "That's a different argument. I want to know first -- in my mind in two different categories. Category one: Is there an ambiguity in this instruction? And my answer so far, which is what I was asking you, is zero. Why not? And then the second question is, could the prosecution get people so mixed up about something, a typical thing like this, that it would violate due process? That's why I asked the question before. And I said, obviously the answer is sometimes they could. And then the question is, did they here? And what he referred me to was Brown, which I've looked at, in which I said the prosecutorial and problem in that case did not rise to a federal due process question. So, I guess -- though it's only one person - - you would have to convince me that this is somehow worse prosecutorial conduct than existed in Brown.",
  "All my questions from the whole case.",
  "No. But what I mean by that is that the prosecution would have had to have gotten the jury more mixed up than -- I was using shorthand for that - -",
  "-- more mixed up than they did in Brown, where I thought it was pretty bad.",
  "In my -- it it doesn't mean either. It means jury you are instructed that the person is guilty of a crime -- in other words, the jury is sitting there and they are asked the question: Is the person guilty of second-degree murder? Now they are to apply the instruction. A person is guilty of second-degree murder if da, da, da, da. And when it gets to \"the crime\", it is referring to second-degree murder. I don't know how -- anything else it could be referring to.",
  "You're convincing me that different people can reach different conclusions. What I'd like you to say is something that would change my mind on my initial conclusion that there is no ambiguity. I think you could say something like that, because as you quite rightly point out, other people have reached other conclusions.",
  "So, then, what I take is authoritative on that are two sentences from the Washington Supreme Court opinion, though people -- other judges have been all over the lot. The first sentence it says: The trial court correctly instructed the jury that it could convict Mr. Sarausad of murder -- they mean second-degree murder -- as an accomplice only if it found he knowingly aided in commission of \"the crime\" charged, which was second-degree murder. That's their interpretation, which I could understand. Then the second thing is, it does not offend the principles of accomplice liability to hold responsible one who knowingly aids such conduct; namely, conduct that creates a substantial risk of death when the substantial risk of death results in actual death. So that would seem to be hornbook law. If you engage in conduct that might well cause substantial or -- substantial risk of death and you know it, you know, you know you're engaging in this conduct, that's the Washington view, that's it. You've had it. And here they go on to say that he knew there was plenty of evidence that he knew that he was engaged in a drive-by shooting. And then to put every dot on every \"I\", they say a drive-by shooting does run a substantial risk of death. Okay. Now that's what I read and at that point, I said I'll ask you that, because then I can hear the best answer.",
  "The prosecutor, I mean I thought, though I'm not -- this really is ambiguous, I think, but if you do hold somebody's arms behind his back and punch him in the stomach, that does perhaps - - at least might run -- I can see a person saying that that runs a substantial risk of death. I mean Houdini died that way, apparently. So maybe hitting somebody in the stomach does create a substantial risk of death. Do you know anything about -- one way or the other on that?",
  "They intentionally hit somebody in the stomach, you say, knowing all about - -",
  "I realize that but what the State supreme court holds. I think correctly, that if the person conscious of the risk knows that a particular individual is engaging in certain conduct for whom he is responsible, he is -- he is guilty of the -- if the event that you know there is a substantial risk of comes about. I would be amazed that a State would say the contrary.",
  "Washington -- in the State of Washington you think the law is that if Joe Jones helps Dead Eye Dick shoot his gun right at somebody's leg and then accidental -- then, you know, he doesn't aim quite right, the guy dies; then it's a good defense to say well, I knew he was Dead Eye Dick. I thought he'd just hit him in the leg. I mean, that -- we know that isn't a good defense in Washington because the Supreme Court of Washington tells us that.",
  "What's the difference between that and punching him in the stomach?",
  "This argument -- I'm beginning to get your argument. The statement is -- the prosecutor never suggested Mr. Sarausad could be found guilty if he had no knowledge that a shooting was to occur. You're saying that's absolutely wrong. There's no support for that in the record. In fact what the prosecutor was arguing is that, even if a shooting didn't occur, he's still guilty because of other gang activity, and when we read the record, we find that's so wrong the statement in the supreme court opinion, that habeas was right. Is that the argument?",
  "But what he's saying, I think now, is if there was no gun in the car -- suppose the jury thinks there's no gun in the car, then he didn't even know there was going to be a shooting, but that the prosecutor in the context of the trial had given the jury the impression that they could convict this person even if the person did not know there was going to be a drive-by shooting. And he's saying that the finding to the contrary, the statement to the contrary in the Supreme Court of Washington is wrong. When I look at that, I will find, he says, that the prosecutor gave the impression, as I just said, that even without a gun your involvement with this gang is enough to convict him of murder. What is your response to that? You know the record. I don't.",
  "Why isn't -- why isn't the fact that some certain number of people are getting gangrene, why isn't that new information?",
  "That was all passed long after the events here took place, I think.",
  "So at the time, you read the regulation, I think a person would think that he was free drug manufacturer if he learned something new to strengthen -- strengthens the contraindication, put it in.",
  "Why wouldn't that be new?",
  "If you get a certain number of cases.",
  "That's because nobody brought up this new information point. So if nobody brought up the new information point at the trial and if the burden is on the manufacturer to show that it's pre-empted, isn't that the manufacturer's fault, because if you simply read the regulation, you wouldn't find any of all this complicated stuff about certain kinds of new information.",
  "Yes it's a legal question.",
  "But we are not making an advisory opinion. We are deciding this case. And this case here you say new information of a certain kind would be okay, nobody argued it. You read the reg, and it doesn't seem to make all these distinctions end of case. Since the manufacturer has the burden of going into this, which apparently it didn't do. So, now we have decided this case, and we go on to the next one.",
  "What's your response to that?",
  "The --the part I'm trying to figure out is this: Suppose it was before trial. I don't care, before or after. The plaintiff comes in with a claim. All right. Manufacturer: That's pre-empted. The claim is that you should have told the FDA and added something to your label. Manufacturer: That's preempted. Plaintiff: Well, you haven't read this reg here. The reg here which has been in existence since 1965 says that we can go and add something. I mean you can go and add something to show a contra indication, and that's the end of it. Now, in fact, 30 years later, I guess, without the horrible things happening that Justice Scalia mentioned, or maybe they did -- I don't know. But 30 years later the FDA makes another mention of new information. I take it that's in 1982. That's the first time that happened. Now, if I'm right about that, what happens when no one says a word about that? Of course, if the manufacturer had said something about that, then maybe the plaintiff would have said: And it was new. It was new, but the manufacturer doesn't say a word. Are you following what I'm saying?",
  "I mean, I'm wondering still what happens. I believe what happened here is that in the argument in the lower courts, in the trial court, nobody said anything about the FDA's claim that the information necessary to just go ahead and change the label had to be new. Am I right about that?",
  "So what I'm trying to figure out -- and I don't know if \"burden of proof\" is the right word -- where nobody says a word about it, who wins? If they had said a word about it, you need new information, maybe the manufacturer -- the plaintiff could have shown that the manufacturer had new information.",
  "What about a poster that says \"Give blood now.\"",
  "They put up a poster that says \"Give blood now.\"",
  "It doesn't mean when it was printed.",
  "Do you think -- do you think the meaning of that -- the words specifically that were added were \"now under Federal jurisdiction.\" The word \"recognized\" was already in the statute. So, it looks like the \"now\" applies to \"under Federal jurisdiction.\" Now, my law clerks, in doing research on this, came up with a number of instances where the tribe wasn't recognized until 1976. I think that was true of something called the Stillaquamish Tribe.",
  "And it's recognized in 1976, but then they go back and they say, well, was it under Federal jurisdiction in 1934? And that seems a rather loose term that includes the fact that you are under Federal jurisdiction if, for example, the Federal Government has a treaty with you that requires the Federal Government to do something. Suppose that's the right reading of this. Then should we send this back?",
  "Well, I'm saying I'm agreeing with you on the meaning. The meaning is \"now,\" but it's \"now under Federal jurisdiction.\" So, there would be a question. This tribe wasn't - -",
  "No.",
  "I'm not sure he was, because when I looked through that whole thing it seemed to me what they were worried about -- Senator Thomas was worried about remnants of tribes, and they were talking about an example of the Catawba Indians in South Carolina, and they had a discussion about that; and then it seemed everybody on the committee agreed that these Catawba Indians should not be included if they were only one quarter Indian. They should be included if they were half Indian. And that meant that they had to fall within the other phrase, not the phrase that we are talking about. So then they say how do we get this result? I mean, because they are a tribe. Because they are certainly a tribe and they are recognized, the Catawbas. And then the answer to that was -- what's his name - - the Collier -- Collier. Collier says: I'll tell you how: We add the words \"now under Federal jurisdiction.\" And he thought what he was doing was ruling out the Catawbas and only allowing the half Indians to come in. Now, ironically, later on, in the '40s I think, the government decides that the Catawba tribe is in fact under Federal jurisdiction in 1934 because a treaty exists. Anyway, that's how I read it and the California Indians were quite secondary to what they were talking about. They didn't -- they didn't know whether they were under a tribe or not a tribe or anything.",
  "I thought it was fairly clear.",
  "Yes, but they -- I mean, Senator Wheeler was worried about the Catawbas. Then Wheeler decides, okay, the half-Indian Catawbas fall in, but the quarter-Indian Catawbas don't.",
  "I'll go back to it.",
  "You learn a lot at hearings, actually.",
  "What do I do about - -",
  "What do I do about the fact -- I was looking this up -- Collier and Felix Cohn, the world's authority on Indian law, both write at the time: this means under Federal jurisdiction in 1934; and they write it and they rewrite it and they rewrite it. They say nothing to the contrary. I mean, they are the ones who did it, so I have to admit I'm pretty much moved by the fact that they thought that's what it meant.",
  "I could only find one instance, which is that Biloxi tribe, where the - - something, you know, the ones in Louisiana -- aside from that instance, I have not found one other instance that is inconsistent with the words \"now under Federal jurisdiction\" meaning Federal jurisdiction in 1934.",
  "If you want to list them, I'll look them up.",
  "I believe that's organized or recognized, because what they did in several cases, I found, like the one, the Stillaquamish or whatever, they said, yes, we recognize them now. They weren't recognized in 1934, but they were under Federal jurisdiction in 1934 because there were treaties that applied between the Federal Government and the Indians which gave these Indians rights then. And that -- that seems consistent with what -- what Collier and the others say.",
  "I wouldn't know that that's so, because the -- the question I ask myself on that is: Were I in Congress, is this the kind of thing I would have delegated to the Secretary to decide. And it's very hard for me to think that Congress wanted to delegate the power to the Secretary to decide whether \"now\" happens to mean 1934 or \"now\" means any time in the future. Well, I mean that's something Congress would decide: They meant by \"now\" 1934, or they meant by \"now\" any old time it's applied. Now -- now, you could argue that both ways, but why would you want to delegate? What human being would want to say: The meaning of the word \"now\" is something I'm leaving to the Secretary?",
  "I'm not -- I'm not saying it unambiguously means it. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying it's totally ambiguous, but what the Secretary has to say about it is enlightening only insofar as the Secretary knows more about it than I. That's fine. But not insofar as it delegates power to the Secretary to make up his own mind.",
  "I have difficulty with the \"tribe\" thing. I think it's a very difficult case. I have a hard time. But the difficulty with the word \"tribe\" is that either that tribe has some people in it who are Indians, or it doesn't, right? That has to be true. Now, if it has some people in it who are Indians, i.e., a person who falls within the definition of \"Indian,\" then, of course, the Secretary can take land for that because the whole thing is for the purpose of giving land to Indians. But let's imagine a tribe that has no Indians in it within the definition of the Act. You are saying that this Act would give to the Secretary the power to take land for an entity that has no members within the Act. Now, that is pretty hard for me to accept.",
  "Well, there is one thing. It says it's for the purpose. We -- we give the Secretary the power to take land for a tribe for the purpose of giving land to Indians.",
  "And now we have assumed a tribe that has no such members because \"Indian\" has a special definition.",
  "Then Collier, himself, would have been wrong. Because Collier in this great famous colloquy says, when he adds these four words, he says to the Committee: That would limit the Act to the Indians -- the Act would be limited to the Indians now under Federal jurisdiction except that other Indians of more than one-half Indian blood would get help. So what he is thinking in his mind is if you have any kind of entity or a person who is more than one-half Indian blood, fine. The Secretary can act. But suppose we have an entity that has only people who have less than one-half Indian blood. Then they are out of luck unless they are now under Federal jurisdiction.",
  "But if in fact there is a charity, which charity in Idaho is a charity that makes all of its contributions to help support right-to-work laws. All right. So that charity goes and says, could you -- we'd like a payroll deduction. Can they get it, or not?",
  "You don't know. Okay. So, then, we do know this. We do know -- what I'm wondering is: Isn't this case, to me, quite confused about something fairly simple? The question would be: Look, one, do you or do you not in Idaho allow anybody to have payroll deductions for anything? And I take it your answer to that question is: Yes, we do allow some payroll deductions for some things. Okay? So then we look at this one, and it says: No payroll deductions for union activities that are political. All right? Now, you either do have or you do not have a justification for that difference. If you have a reasonable, or whatever the sufficient test is, justification for the difference, you win. And if you don't, you lose. And, indeed, whether you are the State or the county could have to do with the plausibility of the justification. Here we are, end of case, traditional. You just -- you didn't argue it that way, I guess, below. What's wrong with that?",
  "There certainly, I would think, would be a problem if the right-to-work people can get there. And you are not going to let the unions get there. But I don't know the facts. So shouldn't we just send this case back and say: Please look at what the situation is? If they have to treat some people one way, some people another, bad; if they don't, everybody is treated alike for good reason, probably okay.",
  "It's at that part, just where you are, that I've always had a hard time not for lack of trying. I don't understand what the word \"content-based\" means, and I know it's all over the law, but I've never understood it and maybe since you're relying on it 15 times you can explain it. And the thing I don't understand it about is it seems to me government engages in thousands of different kinds of activity, and there isn't some special test. When they say that in the jury room, the jury room is there for juries; it's not to show movies of Steven Spielberg. And there isn't some special test when you say the purpose of the biology class is to teach biology, and we don't want people coming in here teaching some other thing. I don't understand what this special test called \"content-based\" is, and that's rather a deep misunderstanding on my part, but since you're depending on it, why don't you take 30 seconds or 45 seconds to see if you can help me?",
  "It doesn't -- for example, in biology class, the school board says: You know, biology teacher, I want you to teach biology; I don't want you to teach politics. And then there is some special scrutiny about how the biology teacher is to teach or -- but they say just face it. The jury room is for juries. It's not for politics. All that is subject to some special First Amendment test?",
  "They might. They might. But you know a lot of them, you know you could show movies in jury rooms in the evening and people might find it much better.",
  "Are you saying -- is it your view that heightened scrutiny applies whenever a government tells any group that wants to raise money for political purposes in any way they want involving the government that it can't?",
  "No. Okay. I thought the answer would be no. Then, will you try to say in a sentence or two if the answer is it heightened scrutiny doesn't apply to any kind of an effort to raise money for political purposes where they say to the government you got to help me, when does it apply and when doesn't it?",
  "But then you are making - - say it always applies except in a few little exceptions. I mean I know there is one for government speech and so forth. But you're saying whenever the government tells a person you can't, for example, go to the city hall and raise money, you can't do it in the jury room, you can't raise money here, you can't raise money there, dah, dah, dah, or you can't speak there, you can't -- it's always heightened scrutiny?",
  "You cannot -- you have to use heightened scrutiny when the FDA, for example -- you know, the case I wrote in -- the FDA says you cannot advertise on a label for a drug. We don't want advertising. We don't want advertising on the label. That's heightened scrutiny.",
  "And regulation of government employees is the same?",
  "I can imagine you could have a grain mill and they have lots and lots of grain absolute identical one to the other. And the farmer takes his grain up and they operate on it, and then he drives away with the grain, milled. Now, it may make no difference to anybody whether the identical molecules are the same; and I think in such a case you'd say they are processing it; they are not buying and selling it.",
  "You are saying if we have that, in fact, if the -- if the exact situation, if some farmers up in North Dakota send their grain just to be milled -- it's their grain -- up in Canada, and they come back, and it -- you know, it may not be the identical molecule, but it's identically the same; they have done this for 100 years -- now suddenly this -- the Commerce Department is going to say, that's a sale, and the antidumping statutes apply?",
  "Well, would it or not?",
  "I agree with you, and I just wonder, what I would like to know, is if any businessman involved in any of these or related things before this decision of the Commerce Department would have thought that that is how the Commerce Department would have treated such a transaction?",
  "I don't know. I'm asking -- the question is the same as the last case, to me: Not whether they could have done it; sure they could have done it. My question is based on my question of whether they had a rule that any reasonable person would have thought that is how they treated it - -",
  "Because after all, you have three precedents in related areas, not the direct area but in related areas, that suggest that they wouldn't have treated the millers that way.",
  "You know what, I'm thinking of those things, they're something called \"tollers.\" I don't know exactly what tollers are. They seem to be like people who give haircuts. They're sort of servicers of some kind. They're talking about tollers and -- and subcontractors. And that is a related area.",
  "What -- what do we do about the question that is bothering me? Maybe at some point -- maybe it's not a relevant question -- but I will assume for the sake of argument Commerce does have the power to classify it either way. What is bothering me, and maybe that's not in this case, is that as the -- as your brother lawyer just said, this statute has been around for 90 years. There has been trillions of dollars worth of foreign commerce during that time. Yet I don't find cited here any instance in which Commerce ever before said that when you have title to a good, and you send it abroad, for even a big change in it, and then it comes back, that that is a sale. Now, I might -- I don't know all the Commerce cases; maybe they did. But what I found here is like a blank on that side, and on the other side the tolling cases, Florida Power & Light, the pizza case, to the point where I thought, if I was a lawyer advising a client, and that client said if I keep title to the good, am I home free, I would have to say, yes, you are.",
  "Now that's the -- the question I want responded to in the legal context of, has Commerce made a significant change in its policy?",
  "And I read -- at what page do I find all these cases?",
  "Well, roughly. I'll find it. I will find it.",
  "But I will see a lot of cases where - -",
  "That is pretty important. Tell me -- this is a hard area, obviously. But the - - imagine -- think of all the toller cases that they've had. Now -- now, is this right: That in every one of those cases there were two companies, A and B; and in every one of those cases A sells a finished product into the United States. And also A sends the product to B to have some major thing done on it. In every one of those cases the Commerce Department could say: We can take A as a Respondent; i.e. we think A might violate the law, because maybe it's an Italian company, or we think B might violate the law. Is that true of all those cases?",
  "All right. Now, if it's true of all those cases, then I think what the opposite position is, what Mr. Farr said, I think -- I think, you know, I will -- he will say: Look at page 40 and 41 of their brief. When I look at those pages, I am going to see a lot of cases. And I bet, when I look them up, those Commerce cases are all going to use the word \"substantial transformation.\" And he will say: You see, that's what they did here. Then he's going to add -- I don't mean to put words in his mouth if the words are wrong, but - - but he's going to add: Look at those tolling cases. Those are all cases where Commerce had a choice of which to consider the sale. It could have considered the sale from the processor A to -- to B to A, the sale if it wanted to; or it could have considered the sale into the United States if it had wanted to, to be the sale for purposes of calculating the price. And so in choosing between those two, either of which it could have chosen, it chose the latter sale, the final sale, because that's how they could calculate the price. But in your case there is no such person A, because the utilities are not people who could be respondents. I mean they are not in the same position. There is no sale onwards that they could choose. So we will go to the other guy, the party -- the person who does the processing. Are you following what I am saying?",
  "And what is the answer to that?",
  "Yes. But, remember, they are saying in the tolling cases, in my words: Hey, we could have gone after the processor if we wanted - -",
  "-- if there had been a substantial transformation, because the key to this concept of \"sale\" is the word \"substantial\" transformation.",
  "In which - -",
  "Is there any point in time from the time that the -- the processors get ahold of the uranium until the time it leaves their control that if they went bankrupt, anyone other than the utility could get ahold of the product?",
  "No. Okay.",
  "Can I -- can I ask? You can go ahead. Are you finished?",
  "I just have a practical question. I'm just curious about this. What are the networks supposed to do, or the television stations? They cover a lot of live events. They're not just sports events. They're also like but the Golden -- you know, the Emmys, the Oscars, and you deal with a cross-section of humanity. And my experience is some parts of that cross-section swear.",
  "So, what is it -- what are they supposed to do when the event is live, and lo and behold, they have a few people in front of them who swear, using these words? What is their -- what can they do?",
  "So, what they -- what they now -- they now do this? In other words, whenever they cover a baseball game, whenever they cover anything live, they have to have some kind of tape system or for the Emmys, everything is on tape and it's all delayed five seconds?",
  "I'm not talking about breaking news coverage. I guess I'm talking about, you know, any one of -- they cover the wrestling matches, they cover -- you see what I'm driving at. And I would like to know what is the state of the art? You are saying the state of the art is right now when I turn on my television set, they all use a delay.",
  "Or are you saying they all have to use a delay?",
  "Did the FCC explain all this in its opinion when it said, we understand that now we're going to have to -- every incident is going to have to be -- have a 5-second delay and they will have to have tapes, and we think it's worth the cost? Did they explain all that?",
  "I didn't see it.",
  "Could you review me to one thing in the record if it's there, or just tell me. I did find an explanation for the agency deciding that \"fleeting\" is not going to be an automatic exemption. They've talked about that. What I didn't find is an explanation for a second thing, which had to do with their first prong of their former test, and that was the distinction that used to be made between using these words as swear words and using them as descriptive words. Now that, I think, showed up in their former policy because they said if they were used as a swear word we are not going to go after them, at least not immediately. So that had to do with prong 1, not prong 2.",
  "So is there an explanation why they made that change?",
  "It hasn't?",
  "And you were -- you were pursuing the practical thing about the tapes, and so forth, when you got on to a different subject, which was the -- the nature of the program. I just wanted to be certain you are finished with what you wanted to say there. I -- because I am interested in the practical question of: Do all the stations have tapes? And leave sports events out of it, and leave news out of it. Are there other events that these small stations might want to cover that don't have the tape or that now don't use the tape; anything else you want to say about that?",
  "I am interested in the practical problem as part of this. Where do I look to find out some facts?",
  "It explained -- I mean, the change I saw was that previously the use of these words as a swear was treated differently from the use of these words as a description. And that after the event, it's not treated differently.",
  "What happens -- just out of curiosity, a prisoner's lawyer doesn't take the appeal, the time expires, bong, the year begins to run. Within that year he files federal habeas. Then he discovers that he had a right to a state appeal. So he goes, just like this man, goes back and, sure enough, he gets his direct appeal, and three years later or a year later they finish the direct appeal. Bong, he can file again. Is that his first habeas or his second habeas?",
  "Yes.",
  "No.",
  "Yes.",
  "I doubt that one -- I mean, one may never arise but - -",
  "The first one is proper and on your view so is the second one proper. So they are both proper, and there are two of them. And - -",
  "No, nobody knows about this.",
  "No, but nobody knows that the State made a mistake in not giving him a direct review.",
  "Oh, forget my hypothetical. They're never going to come up.",
  "Why -- why is it a strain? I mean suppose that Texas decided to give every criminal defendant convicted one thousand years to appeal. You know, if they did, I guess they would have one more year after that to go to Federal habeas, right?",
  "Okay. Then what's the difference between that, giving them a thousand years, which I doubt they will do, and what they have said here? They said for purposes of the Texas rules all time limits shall be calculated as if the sentence had been imposed on the date that the mandate of this court issues. There they are. The Texas Supreme Court gave him all that time, it's whatever it was, and said that's the time you have. How, how is that different from the legislature decides to give him one thousand years?",
  "But it works. Your system, I think, works in that instance, as I understand it. Don't tell me I'm right if I'm wrong, please. But the -- as you understand it, he finishes -- he doesn't get his appeal, you know, and time passes; doesn't take it. Then, five years later, he learns for the first time and the first time he could have learned that his lawyer tore up the notification. At that point, (1)(B) comes into play. So the year begins to run. Then, in your idea, he has -- he has a year to go to Federal court. But wait, it's tolled while he goes to State court. So he goes to State court having just learned it. And now he's under (2) and he files a habeas in State. Now the remedy of the State habeas is to reopen the direct appeal. But we should count that, since it's a remedy of a habeas, as if it were a continuation of the habeas and therefore it would fall within (2). That's your argument.",
  "And it's -- correct? I do not think there is any case ever considered that to my knowledge.",
  "-- and the only difficulty of it is that you have to take a sort of leap of faith of some kind in attaching what everybody's calling the direct appeal as if it were actually part of the State habeas proceeding. That's I think the hardest part of your argument.",
  "It's not (B), it's (D).",
  "But I think it's a good point.",
  "Between your response to the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia, I stand enlightened.",
  "I am quite curious why -- I am curious, why did you answer Justice Alito's question \"yes\"? I -- I would have thought that if you win this case, the Attorney General would still have tremendous leeway in deciding where, when, under what circumstances, the duress defense applied. Why isn't that so?",
  "If that's right, then why do you not -- why was your answer yes?",
  "Why not any statute? I'm mean, starting where Justice Kennedy left off, you said a hundred years. It's thousands of years. You could go back into the history of the human race - -",
  "-- and you will discover, of course, that your word \"involuntary\" is never something where the action is involuntary that we praise or blame people. Rather, every action where we praise or blame people must be a voluntary action. The classic example is: \"The wind blew my arm.\" Now, you are saying that if this person's arm was blown by the wind, that this statute prevents him having asylum in the United States or having -- you know, withholding. How could one assume that involuntary actions are covered by this statute -- are not covered?",
  "Are covered.",
  "All right. Then once you say that, then let's talk about intentional actions.",
  "And are you going to have intentional actions?",
  "Because praise or blame typically involves a voluntary action, an intentional action, and an action where there is a degree of freedom, which is to say that the choice is not too skewed. And we see that in the criminal law by a reading into statutes that say nothing of the word \"intentional,\" and by the use of the duress defense. Now what reason do we have for thinking that Congress didn't mean these words here in exactly that way, which traces back at least to Aristotle?",
  "Oh, but Aristotle doesn't say criminal law. He says praise or blame.",
  "That's absolutely right. But do you think Congress intended that this absolute bar should apply where the person is in no sense blameworthy?",
  "People use that word \"intent\" in the course of the human race to encompass the notion of duress. I mean, that's -- that's sometimes done, sometimes not. They are part and parcel of the same thing, which is whether you can blame the person for what he did.",
  "In criminal law they were not, I agree - -",
  "-- because that's - - because we've seen the need for specificity. But the question, I think, Justice Stevens had, and certainly I have, is why do you read some aspects of what it takes to hold a person responsible into the statute, but you don't read other aspects of what it takes to hold a person responsible morally into the statute?",
  "But I would like to follow that up a bit by saying, one, I'm not sure what this difference between what you are arguing now and what you are arguing then matters. I don't understand it, frankly. I don't actually understand it, because I agree, when you were in the Ninth Circuit, with what you said: It's a failure to disseminate information. And then you said: And it's a failure to train and supervise. You did say that. Now, why that matters, I don't know, because the problem that -- maybe it does matter, maybe it doesn't. So I have to say I don't understand it. Now, help my understanding.",
  "All right. I know you don't, but I'm not worried about that. I'm worried about my understanding of your argument, and that's what I am trying to get to. Answer this question, please, because it will help me: The obvious response is the response the Government made. You can take any -- which is what Justice Alito said. So I would just like to you elaborate on it. You can take anything that the D.A. does that is wrong in the case, you know, some horrible thing he did. And maybe he shouldn't be immune, but he is, okay? Or maybe he should be. There we are. So, here I know I can't bring this suit, but here's what I claim: You failed to have a system that did... and now we fill in the blank. And whatever that blank is, it's going to be something that would have stopped him from doing this bad thing. In your case, it happens to be an information dissemination system. In other case, it would be some other kind of system that would have the effect of stopping this bad thing. So, their point is that, if you can go ahead with yours, so can anybody else go ahead with theirs, and that is the end of immunity. Okay? Now, what is your response? That's what I want to know.",
  "Sure, it's easy. What the prosecutor does is he makes the most horrendous prejudicial argument you'd ever see. So we say: What you need in the D.A.'s office, since this happens all the time, are classes, or what you need is a special section of the library where they have horrible arguments underlined, okay?",
  "And so, I can do that. So can you. You are very good at it. And any good lawyer can do that. And that's their point. So, if your only response, that's your response, your point is that a good lawyer, while he can do yours, couldn't do others, I understand the response. I'm not sure I agree with it.",
  "I suppose the distinction he's trying to make maybe -- I'm not sure I've got it right, but you see there are certain kinds of systems that maybe administratively an office ought to have. And where it turns out that this is really an administrative system, a lot of offices do have it, some don't, but where it was negligent not to have it and the very presence of it would have prevented the -- the individual in the courtroom from behaving the way he did, well, that's a separate kind of a claim. That's an administrative claim. Just as if, for example, suppose you had no secretary or assistants. He says, look, everybody should have secretarial assistance. And if only you had secretarial assistance, these people would not have misread everything the way they did or would have gotten the phone calls or would have done something like that. That's the kind of line -- so he's trying to draw a line there between something that is pretty purely administrative and -- and something that is really supervisory and training. And he is not saying supervisory and training. He is saying that was a separate claim.",
  "Training in today's world or he wants to say in that day's world, whatever it was. They have information systems. They existed, and every office ought to have them. And now he says I might lose on that claim; but, nonetheless, it's not the kind of claim that falls within Imbler. I think that's his point. I'm not positive. He doesn't have to take my - -",
  "What one are we to do with -- Justice Stevens -- I think you should address the statistics in the sentencing report.",
  "As I read them, they put together -- if you put together failing to report and failing to return, you get 160 cases in their sample. And the number of those cases, whether you looked at the time when he had left or whether you looked at the time he was apprehended, in which force was involved is zero. The number of cases in which injury was involved is zero. The number of cases where he had a dangerous weapon is five.",
  "All right. So now there we are.",
  "You had every opportunity, when we have 160 cases out of the universe -- I guess I don't know what the universe is, but sampling proceeds through a small amount of cases. And you could, of course, criticize the Sentencing Commission effort if you have the statistician or someone who will tell us that that sampling was not an appropriate method to proceed. Is there any such person?",
  "No. Why -- that was my question. Why take into account the sample size in the absence of a statistician who would tell us that the sample size is too small to reach the conclusion that the commission reaches?",
  "Is there anything else? I -- I think you're quite right that -- that, look, I can't find anything in the history that suggest lab reports would be admitted because they would be considered being prepared for trial. But business records are kept out. So we have here a source that's unlikely to be particularly biased, the University of Massachusetts labs. And we have the checks of the discipline, the scientific discipline. On the other hand, it's being prepared for this trial. So it seems to me some things go one way; some things go the other way. I don't know exactly what the predominant things are. That's what I'd like you to address as much as possible. And when I look at the definition of \"business records hearsay exception\" today, it seems to me that the \"hearsay exception\" does cover today some of the things under \"business records\" that would be prepared particularly for trial. You could have a company that goes and measures lines on the street, or tread marks, or a variety of things. And I guess they come in under the \"business records exception.\" Do they? I mean, is that right?",
  "Well, of course, it wouldn't.",
  "And that's why -- and maybe you have nothing else you want to say on this point. It's the same as Justice Kennedy raised.",
  "It seems like there are some things going one way, and some things going the other on the issue of whether to call it \"testimonial.\"",
  "There have been bad instances. You are absolutely right.",
  "But what -- what I'm trying to work out in my mind is not necessarily what happened in the year 1084. I'd -- I'd be quite interested in your views on what's a workable rule. And when I look across the country on this, it seems most States have worked with a rule that has allowed the defendant to call the witness if he wants. There is not a particular unfairness to that. If he can get ahold of the witness, no problem. But they said: We are not going to make the State do this because it's a waste of time, for the most part. It just delays the trial, and there is really nothing at issue.",
  "That's true.",
  "But if I assume -- I'm really uncertain as to whether it has covered \"testimonial\" or not. And also, I'm not enamored particularly of seeing on a close question what happened in ancient history.",
  "All right. Now, is there anything else you want to add to me on those assumptions?",
  "I absolutely see that point. So that - all right, go back to the plea bargaining, which is your first thing, which makes me a little nervous for the reason that I see this bargaining system as a system where the prosecutor makes a charge, the prosecutor controls the sentence, then the defense bar would like to have an added weapon, and this added weapon is if you actually go to trial, I'm going to insist that you call these people. You don't even know where they are. I'm not going to accept the lab report. And then maybe the prosecutor will lower the requirement or maybe the prosecutor raised it in the first place because he thought you would say something like that. So I'm not -- is there anything you can say about how this works in the presence of plea bargaining? Do we know any -- do we have any information on that?",
  "How can we administer something like that? His point I think is, look, you can't make any distinction either of something that is evidence was prepared with an eye towards trial or it wasn't. And if it was prepared with an eye towards trial, well, then call the person and have him testify. That's it. And if that encompasses every test under the sun, so be it, because there is no way to draw a reasonable line. You start talking about reliability and their amicus brief is filled with horror stories of how police labs or other labs have really been way off base and moreover really wrong. And you say, oh, distinguish between a police lab and University of Massachusetts? Try going down that road of which one is reliable, which one isn't reliable. How do we know?",
  "That's his point. No workable way to do it. There can be horrors on both - - in both areas, and so follow what the history was where there was no history on this being admissible.",
  "Aren't there some things I read in the paper all the time, about these laboratories in various places, and they lost the results, they got it all wrong? That just doesn't happen?",
  "Well, you make me think the public certificate. Let's imagine birth and death records. There is a whole building full of them; they are on microfiche. Now, I am not sure how Massachusetts works, but I suppose if you want to introduce one you call up the -- the keeper and the keeper looks it up, produces it, and has a separate piece of paper or maybe written beneath it which says: \"This is a true copy of the,\" and you don't call in the keeper. Now that statement on a piece of paper, \"this is a true copy of the birth certificate of John Smith,\" that was prepared specifically for this trial.",
  "So I take it that has nothing -- I mean we'll find out, but if they win, every one of those cases, every document you have to bring in the person to make clear that the document that says that this is a copy of the document - -",
  "Is that what -- is that the point?",
  "You're going to work either. Because the person -- Sir Walter Raleigh's accusers wanted to testify about something that was nontestimonial: what happened on the day. So what we are looking for -- I mean, I agree with you that it is a very peculiar result that's going to have every public document in the United States suddenly have the keeper of that document having to come into court. On the other hand, I'm having a hard time figuring out what the distinction is between that and all these other things.",
  "No, no, there's a hearsay -- there is a hearsay aspect. I'm not saying it's the only thing. There is a chain and so forth but, there is a hearsay aspect to that which you see, okay. The certificate says this is Joe Jones' birth certificate. That's what the -- now, that's that person outside of court who made that little piece of paper for purposes of this case. And moreover, the statement that it certifies to is directly relevant; indeed, the whole thing falls without it. So, are you going to say the same thing applies, your rule, and you have to call the recordkeeper in or not? And I think you're going to say not. And if you're going to say not, I want to know what the distinction is?",
  "You are going to calling in -- you're going to - -",
  "As I read this old one - - as I read the first one, Senator Lautenberg put in the language, and his language in the first one was to say I'll tell you a group of people who shouldn't have guns. The people who commit a crime of domestic violence. Now what's that? In the statute he says it is a misdemeanor crime of violence committed by a person in a family relation with the victim. Then he says after, I changed that language a little. I'll tell you why. Because somebody told me misdemeanor crime of violence is too broad. It could include cutting up a credit card. So I'll define it more specifically. And he defines if more specifically to say that it is a crime that has as an element the use or attempted use of physical force or threatening people with a weapon. End of the matter. They substitute those words and they did another thing the drafter as he breaks out the thing it says: It is a crime that is a misdemeanor and, you see, and that's where the problem is, because if you put in a \"that,\" then you have to have an \"is.\" So he left out the \"is.\" Okay. So I say what did Senator Lautenberg want with these words? I see. How did he change it? I see. I can't find a word that supports the reason that you have. Now, maybe they are there. That's what you'll tell me. And then I say it's the fine language consistent with what he wanted. It requires putting in an \"is.\" I don't find that too awful. Okay. That's your argument against you. What is it? Your argument to rebut that.",
  "That's the conclusion. You're reaching that conclusion. What I need from you is something that would tell me, no, Congress didn't just want to clarify in the way Lautenberg said. What they wanted to do was, in fact, restrict the scope of this so it only applied in 17 states. Okay. I'm open to that argument. It could be a good argument. Just point me to the things that suggest that that is what Congress wanted to do, rather than by what Senator Lautenberg said.",
  "No, I've got the words. If the best you can do is point me to the words of the statute, I'll take that into account. I'm asking the question to see if there is anything at all more?",
  "I don't want the text. I want something for my purposes.",
  "Okay.",
  "I'm sorry. Are you saying that Senator Lautenberg did not change the words \"misdemeanor crime of violence\" to the words \"use of physical force\" or \"threatened use of deadly weapon\"? That's what he got up on the floor of the Senate and said that he wanted to change.",
  "I'm not -- we're in -- the question specifically is where did the words come from? I thought that the words came from Senator Lautenberg. The reason I thought that is because he got up on the floor of the Senate and said that's what he did. Now, if you're telling me they came from a different place, what is there in anywhere? I'm open to hearing it, but I couldn't find anything that said they had come from a different place.",
  "So the -- the -- the language on physical force came from the House? That's what you're saying? I'm just trying to be clear.",
  "It might have. I'm not criticizing. I want to know.",
  "Making progress. And you're saying that in the House there were some people who didn't want it to extend to beyond 17 States?",
  "And how do we know that?",
  "For that, you'd have to assume that the GS-12 who drafted this, or whoever the equivalent was in the Senate, put the \"that\" in the wrong place. If he had put the \"that\" after the (i) when he broke it down, it would all read as a sentence. The \"that\" would be for the first part, and you'd say \"felony committed\" for the part that interests us. Does that work?",
  "All right. So I'm trying to figure out how the statute works.",
  "And it seems to me that the way it's supposed to work -- have you read, by the way, the facts of the case for December in Bell v. Cohen? No? Okay. Forget that. I was going to shorthand that because it's similar to the hypothetical I'm thinking of. What happens is that the -- the State court now says, okay, I assume all the facts in your favor and you don't prevail. All right. Now, he goes into Federal court and he has some new facts. Now, either they are such that they transform the claim and it's a new claim. I mean, in that case there is an argument for that, maybe not in yours, or they aren't. Now, if they aren't, then what he is supposed to do, the judge, is go look and decide on the basis of what they presented to the State. That's the end of it. Now, if they are, he is supposed to exhaust. You go back, you exhaust this new claim like any other new claim, and if the State bars it, then you go and see if there was cause and prejudice. And that's how it's supposed to work. And if there was cause and prejudice, then you have the hearing. Okay? That's how it's supposed to work factually. I have no idea if that's what went on here, but if it -- it didn't seem to me -- there was some confusion about whether the procedures are adequate in the State. Then there is some other thing that this might be the same claim. I mean, I don't see how we get to the question we took this case to decide, frankly, without knowing what the basis was and whether it was correct for the district court to give him any hearing at all.",
  "That's the first step. The first step, I'd go and see -- but at any rate, you go ahead.",
  "Well, why wouldn't you say right off the bat, new claim, go present it to the State court, and exhausts it?",
  "Why not?",
  "No, no, no. Suppose we have -- that's what I want, not these facts, but I want the facts where really, he couldn't have discovered this, because the first time that the district attorney opened his files for the Brady claim was 140 days after. So we now have some totally new, which he couldn't have gotten; no one disputes it. Where, that kind of thing -- I think he would have to present it to the State court, wouldn't he?",
  "Well, you must have been assuming then that the State would not give that person a -- a new opportunity to consider the new evidence.",
  "Suppose it were really new.",
  "Yes, but so is it in Tennessee, and in Tennessee there is an exception where you could bring the thing up because you couldn't possibly have gotten over it.",
  "So in Virginia a person discovers for the first time, 140 days later looks at the D.A.'s files, and discovers something that shows the whole trial was a farce -- I mean, something unbelievable, and there is no way for the person under Virginia law to bring that up in a State court?",
  "I might say the new claim -- okay, so it's a new claim. I don't know if yours is, by the way, but suppose it's a new claim. Then what you ought to do is go back to the State court and exhaust. So now what you show is that that's futile. Now we get to your question before us. Okay. So it's an imaginary case. It's less imaginary in December than here. But, anyway, the -- the -- you get back to the State court. Now, what is supposed to happen? At that point I guess the statute leaves the judge free to develop the facts. It doesn't say you can't. Okay. So then you do it. Now we have the question, which when we took this we thought we could reach, but I don't know if we can -- now we have the question: When the judge makes the decision on the basis of those facts, if they have never developed any of this in State court, fine. Then have -- then just do it. If it is a regular case, don't defer it. But suppose some of the things have been in State court related to this but not others. Now what do we do?",
  "I mean that's not an obvious answer to that one.",
  "What it's going to do is it's going to be finding facts on the basis of certain evidence. And what you will have gotten your new claim granted on is the fact that you found some new evidence that's very significant, and you couldn't possibly have found it before. Now what do we do? Do we defer in part; do we defer -- I mean now what does the district judge do?",
  "I'm still trying to understand the statute. I think their point is we get around (d), (d) doesn't bar us because the district court here, the Federal district court, found that it was an unreasonable determination of the facts, not unreasonable on the substance, but unreasonable because of the procedure. In other words, the State that barred this evidence was having an unreasonable procedure and therefore the determination of the facts is unreasonable. So you're saying that isn't what those words \"unreasonable determination of the facts\" mean.",
  "You mean you're saying that (d)(2), \"unreasonable determination of the facts,\" means the factual outcome. In other words, if the factual outcome is reasonable it doesn't matter if the procedures are inadequate; is that your claim.",
  "No? I thought you just said that in answer to Justice Souter.",
  "And not whether their procedures are correct?",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay. So that's the first thing we have to decide to get to the question. If your wrong on that -- and I doesn't know the answer to it - - if you're wrong on that, then they're rid of (d). So they say then, we're rid of (e) because it falls within (a)(2), the factual predicate and due diligence, okay. They say we are rid of (e) because of that. Now, how they get around capital (B) I'm not sure, but that isn't in the case.",
  "They're arguing due diligence.",
  "(I). You mean of (e)(2) - -",
  "Okay. So we also get - - they get around that because they say the due diligence. You also have an argument about how (2) applies. And if you're wrong about both of those then we get to the question, which would be: If the -- if the hearing's properly before us and it's a new claim -- it's also saying it's a new claim -- if it's a new claim it has to be exhausted. So under Virginia law, under Virginia law, is it really true that -- suppose, not this case, but suppose a Defendant 140 days after discovers the DA says, makes some remark. He couldn't have known about it. He goes to a special file. He couldn't have found out about. And lo and behold, it's the worst thing you can imagine, and you can imagine some pretty bad ones but this is even worse. Now under Virginia law are you -- is it your view that Virginia courts would say you're out of luck, good-bye?",
  "No matter what, it's goodbye?",
  "No excuse? Even if - -",
  "Okay.",
  "So they are right about, they are right about the exhaustion being futile.",
  "The first time he discovers DNA evidence in the DA's file that shows he couldn't have done it, there is no way to get relief under Virginia law?",
  "Not in State court.",
  "Okay, then they're right about that.",
  "Okay, then let me ask you on the merits. If he's right there and it's exhaustion and it really was a new claim, then wouldn't we apply a decision that does not defer to the State court, because after all the State court never heard this issue?",
  "Okay. There is no real argument between the two of you as to the -- as to the issue that we thought was presented.",
  "But there's certainly an argument - -",
  "If it's really a new claim, you're going to say they applied - -",
  "That seems to be the problem here. And what I have in this is the -- the problem I have is that we seem to be applying these subcategories in a very absolute way. Why can't we call this what it is -- it's a mixture of private speech with Government decisionmaking -- and ask the question, as we do in election cases, is the restriction proportionate to a legitimate objective? I know how you're going to answer that question. You're going to say: Of course, it is. But what's interesting me is, are we bound in these cases to apply what I think of as an artificial kind of conceptual framework or are we free to ask what seems to me to be at the heart of the matter? The answer to Justice Stevens's hypothetically is: Of course the Government can't do that because it's disproportionate.",
  "So what is the answer to the -- what is the answer to Justice Stevens's hypothetical? What is the answer to the homosexual hypothetical? What is the answer?",
  "Because that tests the theory.",
  "But suppose they only accept Democrats who are sculptors, and they reject all the Republicans?",
  "Now, what in the First Amendment -- are you saying the First Amendment would not stop that?",
  "What do we do -- is this monument suspiciously similar to the one in Texas? And so if the history is the same, you would know that there was -- a big element of this was Cecile B. DeMille trying to promote his movie, The Ten Commandments. So he gave money to the Eagles, and the Eagles put Ten Commandments all over because it would be good for the morality of people, and also it would help promote the movie. All right? Is that true -- is that the actual description here?",
  "Okay.",
  "So -- so if that's the history of it, what does that mean? I mean, where do we go with that? Then this is in fact partly an attempt to promote morality, partly an attempt to be civic, partly an attempt to promote a movie. So, what do we do with that?",
  "Why not? Why not? Why - - suppose that there -- there are certain messages that private people had like \"eat vitamins\" - -",
  "-- and so they say -- you know, whatever those are; and then somebody comes along with a totally different content, \"ride the roller coaster,\" and they say this part of the park is designed to get healthy children, not put children at risk. So therefore we like messages to eat vitamins, and we don't want messages, \"ride the roller coaster.\" This is all private. It's the -- you know -- now what?",
  "So in other words, they - - the - -",
  "They can't do either.",
  "Is there any case that says -- can they have playgrounds in the park?",
  "Okay, so we have right in the playground, we have \"eat vitamins,\" \"eat your - - clean up all your -- all the food in your plate,\" \"don't throw food at your brother,\" okay? So -- I mean - -",
  "Yes, all private.",
  "Because there are various groups that feel that's important; the city says yes, it is; and we don't want things like pull the dog's tail, or - -",
  "-- whatever. So -- so what's wrong with that? Where does the First Amendment forbid that? You promote -- they want in this corner, promoting in the playground good things that they like and not bad ones. Where does it permit it? What's the case that says that the Government couldn't do that?",
  "Give one and I'll read it. Give me three; I'll read them.",
  "But the children's playground isn't the public forum.",
  "I see where you're going. Thank you.",
  "I ask you -- let me ask you a naive question possibly that may -- may reflect a misunderstanding. But my understanding is that suppose you are -- you are an employee. You believe your employer discriminated against you, say, on gender grounds. You have to go to the EEOC. Now, the EEOC looks into it and very often what they do is they don't really resolve it. They just give you a letter that gives you a right to sue. So here Congress was so worried about this kind of thing that they said our specialized agency, you know, won't be the bottom line. People will go there and then they have a right to sue later. Now, that's how Congress felt about this particular statute. Why would they want the union to be the bottom line when, in fact, the employee himself hasn't agreed? I mean, the employee might agree in the first place. He might say I'm going to take that letter, I'm not going to bring my suit. That's up to him or her. But here the employee wants to bring her suit, just like the EEOC letter.",
  "Exactly. That's my point, is that the statute as a whole reflects a considerable effort not to let this employee get cut off at the pass and an employee who is reasonably determined to get to court probably can do it. It's not definite. The EEOC doesn't have to give them a letter giving them a right to sue, but probably can do it. And if that's a situation where you have this whole expert thing cut in, it seems to me there is a parallel here that Congress then wouldn't want the union and the employer together to be able to cut that right to sue off, at least not very easily.",
  "Is also true -- is that also true with an ordinary tort or any other kind of suit?",
  "A tort suit. It says, some -- the union -- the same thing here, but we are not concerned with discrimination; we are concerned with workplace safety. Somebody is hurt as a result of machine improperly functioning, or there isn't adequate notice or so forth. Is your view the same there?",
  "Why?",
  "Doesn't this allow discrimination -- doesn't this refer to discrimination by the employer?",
  "Now, you say section 30 doesn't say anything about union discrimination particularly; it just talks about discrimination.",
  "Fine. So you think sometimes unions do discriminate?",
  "All right. And sometimes unions also would rather have the more effective machine or sometimes unions feel their workers are stupid not to read the machine label properly or -- I mean, I can replicate anything you might think. We can think of tort suits, the two of us, which could put unions and employees on opposite shores, just as we can think of discrimination suits. Most unions don't want discrimination. I mean, most of the time. And most unions don't want dangerous machines most of the time. So if I decide for you in this case, am I also saying that they can't arbitrate ordinary tort suits or contract suits or just whether or not the workplace which is made of wood is filled with termites? I mean, you know?",
  "That's the only reason? Because, in other words, if I think I see no more reason why a union today, whatever was true 40 years ago, that I see no more reason today why a union would like discrimination, then I can see a reason why they would like a dangerous machine?",
  "If I think that, then I should decide against you?",
  "Very helpful of you.",
  "Then I replicate my question because what I'm thinking is simply that there are thousands, maybe tens of thousands, kinds of claims that people go to arbitration over. And what I'm wondering here is if you win here, what is the set of such claims that I have now said that a union, through a collective bargaining contract, can force the employee against his will to go to arbitration over? I don't have a feeling for that from the briefs. I don't have a feeling that you want to say that discrimination claims are special in that regard, that there's no line in that regard, or that there's some other line.",
  "Well, can you give me a hint as to the principle?",
  "I -- I just want to be sure that at some point you answer this question, if you can. I -- I -- the -- the issue in front of us, as I see it, is just what you said: When can a union require the worker to accept arbitration rather than a court case in an instance where the union member has not signed a special waiver? That's the question, right? Okay. And what I think some of us were struggling for here is: If we say yes to you they can force them, or no to you they can't, what's the principle? Now, the easiest kind of case where you tend to think they can force the worker into arbitration is where the right grows out of the collective bargaining agreement, period. Then we have what we were talking about with Justice Souter, a common law tort claim. Then we might have a State law giving a claim. Then we might have a Federal law like this one giving a claim. And we just heard -- I would assume if Justice Scalia thought of such a case, then the response",
  "That's why I am asking you for the principle.",
  "You're right. They are all different. They did a lot of work on that. I -- I know they did a lot of work on this. Congress has a statute, and the statute is: We don't care if the witness is Albert Einstein, Steven Spielberg, or the local zookeeper. Okay. We don't care. We don't care if they did a lot of work or a little work. We want them to be paid $40 a day, period. It's too much trouble to figure out how much work they did. That's what we want. That's the law. Now, Justice Alito said: I agree with you for argument's sake; we are not bound by that rule. But I take it his question, which I heard no answer to, is: Assume you are right; we are not bound by the law; still, why shouldn't we follow it?",
  "Have do you any example where Congress had a statute which says every court in the United States must pay da-da-da, whatever that number is; it's $382.50, okay. Now, despite that clear statute, this court for exactly the same thing paid a different amount. Is there any such case?",
  "Okay. And is there anything in the -- in the nature of litigation? And there might be. I'm not asking it as a rhetorical question. Is there anything in the nature of original jurisdiction lawsuits that, as a general matter, would call for higher fees to be paid for witnesses, or to make a distinction between expert witnesses and others, or to do other things that would complicate it? I'm not speaking of your case. You have a wonderfully strong case in your case. I want to know about in general, in original actions.",
  "If anything, the parties are in a better position to pay the money than the average person.",
  "It's not unfair to have a rule which says each party pays his own experts, win or lose. That's the rule, isn't it?",
  "If you lose this case, if we were to follow Congress, we would have adopted a rule where, because the $40 is trivial, each party pays his own experts. Is that right or wrong?",
  "Well, can we do this then? I think maybe in many cases that are technical in nature it might be quite a good thing for the losing party to pay the winning side's lawyers.",
  "Well, should we do that, too? If we are going to have them pay the experts, why don't we have them, the losing side, pay the lawyers' fees? That would be quite a revolution.",
  "It is -- I mean, if you want to really get a little complicated, the -- you have -- you have 11, and 11 talked about the Supreme Court fees and then we have 20 and that talks about all the other fees, right? Okay. So the thing is, you can't pay money in the United States unless have you some authorization, but 1911 gives the Supreme Court some authorization to fix fees. Now we look back at 1821. And 1821 tells you how much mileage per diem and subsistence will be. It says he will be paid an attendance fee of $40 per day. Doesn't say you couldn't pay him more. Just says that's what he is entitled to. Now of course, in the lower courts, you can't pay him more because there is no authority to pay him more. But in the Supreme Court, there is authority to pay him more. That comes out of 1911. I mean, I grant you that this is -- what I'm actually doing here is I'm trying to avoid this problem of whether Congress can start legislating the details of original jurisdiction rules and so forth. Just -- there is some desirability here constitutionally to prevent ourselves from going down that road. That's -- I'm deliberately being gimmicky, but what do you think of this gimmick?",
  "That's fair.",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "Which part did they think limited it? Was it 1821 they thought limited it?",
  "In an ordinary case, if a witness -- doesn't -- never does go to court, but just goes to a deposition, that's the only thing, he goes to a deposition, does he get paid the 40 dollars? He goes to a lawyer's office; he's never in attendance at a court. But Do they count that as being in attendance at a court?",
  "Then where is his - -",
  "What?",
  "If that isn't attendance at a court, where did these witnesses show up?",
  "Where? Where do they have this proceeding? I don't know; it wasn't here; it wasn't in this - -",
  "Where?",
  "In the courthouse?",
  "Well, what about -- I mean now, as long as I'm starting down the road to outer space, why not -- could we say, look, they were very impressive models these people did; on both sides they had terrific experts, very expensive; and would we have the authority to say to the master, although you didn't treat them as your experts, you should have done, for purposes of paying them.",
  "I don't want to be unreasonable about this.",
  "I'm sorry. I got mixed up on my dates. The words \"in any court of the United\" - - what the words are now is \"in any court.\" It says \"court of the United States includes\" in 451 courts. When did that language come in?",
  "In '48?",
  "So the inclusion wasn't there till then. Now, normally, in the '48 revision, the rule is they intended to make no substantive change. When they did intend to make a substantive change, they said as much. So is there anything in the history of that that suggests they intended to make a substantive change here?",
  "No?",
  "So, in other words, the language \"in addition to the courts listed in section 451 of this title,\" that -- those words I just said have no appearance in the statutes before 1948? Yes or no.",
  "They do appear before?",
  "No, they do not.",
  "First time in 1948. So they were put in there by a revisor.",
  "And there is no indication the revisor intended to change the meaning that pre-existed.",
  "Okay. I got the argument. Thank you.",
  "I mean, could you have brought a claim that they didn't let the female students play hockey under your complaint? I mean, that's additional discrimination.",
  "Didn't it have to be related to the particular facts?",
  "And you talked about you wanted some additional discovery. What? What is it that you could go to a district judge now and say, Judge, I have a basis here for asking for discovery on a different but related theory? What words would you use? What would you write in that request?",
  "The reason I ask is obviously if this case happens to be a case in which, because of the finding that there was no intentional discrimination and the school board behaved properly, that if that's the finding and therefore you have no claim under 1983 in respect to that, it becomes very theoretical to say that they went too far and said you might have no other 1983 claim because you would have some other 1983 claim, but we should dismiss this as improvidently granted and wait until somebody does this again.",
  "Is that request here in the record?",
  "Is that request here?",
  "Do I have the request in the joint -- in the a -- do I have it in the appendix here?",
  "So, we don't have it in front of us?",
  "How do we know that the First Circuit wasn't just thinking about the facts of this case in front of it when it said that there's no 1983 action. I mean, they didn't think there was no 1983 action for search and seizure. They must have had some idea of what the limitations of their saying no - - no -- no 1983 action was. So why do we know that they went beyond what they had in front of them in this case? I'm not saying they didn't? I am just wanting to know what we -- how we know that?",
  "But you see, the question presented, I guess is -- I'm trying to get the exact words, but it's whether the Title IX replaces the - - what is it, it's whether -- I'm sorry. You have it right in front of you there.",
  "You think they're - - they're referring to all of Title IX, no matter what the claims, whether they are overlapping or not?",
  "Are you saying -- are you -- is this what you are saying: We imagine that we have a institution that is receiving Federal assistance, okay? And we also imagine that somebody is claiming that on the basis of gender they have been excluded from participating in, or denied the benefit of, or have been subject to discrimination. Are you saying that it is impossible for anyone to imagine a circumstance in which it would be held the defendant did not violate Title IX, but in which the court held it did violate the Equal Protection Clause? There is no such circumstance; no one can imagine one. Is that what you are saying?",
  "You cannot imagine one. And you think no one can imagine one. So the obvious question on rebuttal is, since we have limited it to that universe, it would be the other side must imagine one?",
  "That's simple.",
  "Does a disparate-impact claim violate section -- Title IX?",
  "If it's an individual, under Title IX you can't bring the suit.",
  "All right. But you could under 1983?",
  "Okay.",
  "So your point then is - - and that's why I have had trouble with this case -- is that if you look at the First Circuit opinion, it sort of seems to say, \"if there is a difference, of course you can have a 1983 suit, but if there is no difference, you can't.\" I mean, everybody here seems to agree to that, I guess. So I'm not certain what to do, because Selya started his opinion by saying this isn't a case where Title IX doesn't apply; it does apply; they have the funding; but he doesn't talk about the exemptions and he doesn't really talk about the -- a difference between suing an institution and suing an individual. So maybe what we should say is, maybe he meant it, but he didn't say it.",
  "So you were saying if it's an individual acting in his official capacity, you cannot sue him under Title IX?",
  "Yes. Okay.",
  "Then their answer to that which is now say, look, we want to sue an individual in his official capacity; that's why we want to bring our 1983 suit. And then you reply, but there are bars here of collateral estoppel. Claim preclusion, whatever it is.",
  "They all have new names.",
  "The -- the -- okay, so that's your argument. So why don't we just send it back, say that's right; this suit is not precluded by 1983; indeed, that's the only place can you bring it; it's not precluded by Title IX, and now court, you go decide whether claim preclusion exists, or whatever they call it. Collateral estoppel, or -- you understand what I mean.",
  "Well, the -- the -- one question I have on this is if I look at the two standards -- and the first one is \"best practical\" -- it talks about cost-benefit. It says you shall consider the total cost of application of technology in relation to the effluent-reduction benefits. Then you look at \"best available,\" and they've changed the phrase. It doesn't get rid of cost, but it simply says you shall take into account the cost of achieving such effluent reduction.",
  "So they both use the word \"cost.\"",
  "Then you look at what Senator Muskie said at the time.",
  "And what Senator Muskie said at that time is the object here is when we move to better -- to better technology, we -- you know, when you get past the practical and you get into the other, it says -- stop considering costs? Not quite. He says: \"While costs should be a factor in the administrator's judgment.\" So he is not against using costs. He says that you have to do it under a reasonableness standard where you are taking into account all the goals and so forth. Now, that's ambiguous. But, as I read it, it says: Of course you can't avoid taking into account costs, but don't do it too much. And, therefore, you would say: Don't apply one of these big formal things when you reach your final goal. There are other ways of getting there. Of course, see that it isn't absurd. And for 30 years the agency has had a way. It has talked about \"grossly disproportionate.\" Now, that's the whole background to the question. My question is, of course: Why not let sleeping dogs lie? Let the agency take it into account the way it's done it to prevent absurd results, but not try to do it so that it's so refined you can't even take account of what a fish is worth unless they happen to be one of the 1.2 percent that goes to market.",
  "Okay, fine. Then what are you arguing? Are you arguing that you should take costs into account? Because I don't think -- or I don't think you should reach much disagreement on that point, that sometimes you take them into account the way that Senator Muskie suggested.",
  "Well now, what they are going to argue, I guess, is going to be up to them, and I would be very interested in hearing it.",
  "And then you would be satisfied with the following ruling: The Second Circuit went too far in saying that you can never take costs into account.",
  "Of course, you can sometimes take account of them, and the standard that we think is there -- I'm just imagining this -- is the one they have used for 30 years. Is it grossly disproportionate? Are you -- is it feasible? Is it practical? Are you using costs along with other things? How do you feel about some slightly vague thing like that?",
  "You are happy with that?",
  "All right. So it's simply saying the Second Circuit was wrong, the use of the word \"cost\" is meaningless without some idea - -",
  "-- of what the costs are relevant to, but a -- but a vague, grossly disproportionate test is okay with you?",
  "Is it or not?",
  "The one they used for 30 years at EPA, is that all right or not all right?",
  "I don't see how you can do that. I just don't see it. It's -- I mean, suppose that the cost of this machine is $100,000. Now, if you say I'm talking about using that machine for an entire industry, you would say, my God, that is certainly available. But here I have just one part of the industry here; I have a little plant; and you know, to hook that machine up is only going to save one paramecium. Neither of us wants that. And so the logical thing to say is to say well, it isn't available for that. And I would be with you there.",
  "But to be honest about it, I would have to say the reason it isn't available is quite -- it isn't available for minimizing the -- the harm -- that particular adverse impact which is killing a -- a water animal. The reason it isn't is because it doesn't kill any water animals. Well, let me be honest; it kills one, or it kills two - -",
  "Or it kills three, and don't tell me de minimis, because as soon as you say de minimis, I'm going to add one, okay?",
  "But what I'm trying to show here is that -- that there -- it isn't meaningful to talk about cost being available for an end, without some -- about something not being available for an end in light of its costs, unless you take into account what that end is. I mean, we'd spend trillions to make America secure so not 50 thousand people die, but we won't spend trillions for a road accident. And -- and of course you take those things into account. So that's -- that's exactly the point I wonder about. Are you really saying pay no attention or are you saying, which I could understand better, but you have to say what you want, I mean, that what we mean is, yes, they can take costs into account. That's what they do under the comparable standard, best available technology, but just use your head, don't do it too much, don't use it -- like take other things into account, too, don't do a formal cost-benefit analysis; don't try to evaluate the paramecium. Do the difference between the -- you know, the two standards: Best practical, best available. Do \"grossly\" or \"wholly\" or something.",
  "No, no, no, but best available says take costs into account.",
  "Now, there is a way of doing that which is what I'd call a commonsense way that they have some discretion over, that doesn't involve some enormously elaborate thing; and that's what I am searching for. I don't -- I am not sitting here with an answer. I'm trying to find a way of making sense of this.",
  "Those two things seem contrary to me. I don't see how you could -- do you see why?",
  "But how is it -- how is it feasible if it has no benefits at all?",
  "Then we are going to reach our insane results.",
  "Can't make any other judgment. So imagine the consequence of that environmentally. They can't make any other judgment. Suppose the EPA is right: it's going to add 20 electric plants, huge plants, purely to save the fish; and the result is the cost of electricity goes up, and the result is there are no electric cars, because people make the comparison with oil, and now they have to have petrol. I mean, it's very hard for me to believe that Senator Muskie would have written a statute that would have foreseen such an effect.",
  "That's exactly where I agree with you. So I go back to page 170 of the legislative history, which I have read now six times, and I agree with you that it is not totally clear. Maybe you think it is. But it seems to me what he is saying there is just what you've said: Don't go into this with some elaborate thing, but remember costs are still relevant. And what I've been searching for throughout is a set of words that would help me translate that thought into a legal reality.",
  "Well, what about the particular case? What they said here is that, if you require the closed circuit for everybody, we are going to have to build, we are going to have to pay an energy penalty of 2.4 to 5.3 percent. You will have to build 20 additional 400-megawatt plants, which is huge, many, many, many billions of dollars, and the -- just to replace the capacity you have lost. And the result, which seems quite logical, would be to increase by a lot, not just a little, the consumption of fossil fuel. Well, now how are they not -- you seem to be arguing that they can't take that into account, which, for an environmental agency, I would have thought, \"But they must take it into account.\"",
  "So if they did exactly the same thing they've done, which I've just read you, and they put a label on it, instead of saying \"thinking of benefits,\" we were calling it now \"taking into account environmental impacts,\" then they could do it?",
  "I see that thought, and this is what's concerning me, but there may be a very good answer. A lot remains to be done with EPA. They have an enormous job to do. And I wouldn't want to get them tied up in unnecessary red tape, where everybody is suddenly taking them to court on rather technical things. So if this \"grossly\" or \"wholly,\" or whatever you call it, read out of the Muskie page 170 -- read it out of the \"available technology\" definition, you can take costs into account; just don't do it in this other way. I can see how they could work with that.",
  "Now, I'm worried about what you are saying that may make it so difficult for them that they won't be able to do the job.",
  "I agree.",
  "And the page -- the page of the legislative history or the page of the text of the statute that says what I think is a -- I mean, try it with your son. It costs $100.",
  "Your son says, \"It costs $100.\" You say, \"That's too expensive.\" He says, \"But I didn't tell you what it was for.\" What? I mean - - you see? Now you tell me the page, and I have read a lot of it; tell me the page of the legislative history or the phrase of the statute where it says what you just said -- that you cannot take into account what you were buying for that $100.",
  "What page? I will read it again.",
  "I know 316(b).",
  "Well, that was the House side, which the House side was against that. And the - - the question I have from your point of view is the - - the obverse question: if you look at this particular cost-benefit analysis, I mean, it goes through all these things which, they don't know what the numbers are, nobody knows what the values of the fishes are, which 98% are never even eaten, they are fast swimmers or whatever.",
  "But the -- the -- you see the point here. That all of his fears, your -- your opponent, brother here, seem to be manifest in this kind of a document which, if you do read Senator Muskey, seems to be the very things he was against. So -- so what is -- I am still left with your suggestion of what to do, other than just, \"well, it's all fine.\"",
  "Is there something you add -- you add to your statement of your rule? A neutral rule not related to substance, but related to the administration of the courts?",
  "Don't just be agreeable to be agreeable. Do cases actually say that?",
  "But what is the neutral reason related to the administration of courts that leads the State to close its door to a damage suit under 1983 against correctional officers?",
  "-- taking as the assumption exactly what Justice Ginsburg said. I mean, I can't find any reason that's neutral and administrative other than what Justice Ginsburg said, which is neither: namely New York does not like 1983 actions for damages against correctional officers. What other reason is there?",
  "But Testa v Katt was a case in which the Court found that the State allows some State action that are analogous to the Federal action and you can't discriminate against a Federal action.",
  "This is not that case. This is a case where the State doesn't allow -- doesn't allow -- damage actions like the Federal action - -",
  "-- and this Court has not decided to my knowledge how we apply the basic rule in such a situation. So I would think that the way we would apply it is take the standard and ask the State, what is the neutral administrative-related reason? Because what they are saying is, if you look at this, from an administrative point of view, it's that red-haired, one-eyed man with a limp.",
  "So what you have now is you have one reason, I think, would be clearly wrong; I think, I assume that. But if the State closed their doors to this kind of suit because they say we think our correctional officers should be immune from damages, now we know they can get money under the Federal law, but we want nothing to do with this. That, I think, would be discrimination against the suit if that were their reason. Now, there is a neutral reason, and it's demonstrated, and it is, well, you see, there are just too many -- there are just too many lawsuits by prisoners against prison officials. And we don't want all that business in that court, and here's how we deal with it. One, we take away their cause of action, that's what we do under State law, and then we -- the feds -- we throw them back to Fed court? Without - -",
  "You don't offer them a court of claims, because what you offer in the court of claims is an action against the State. And you can say that isn't a big deal because after all, most of these really are actions against the State anyway, because they get compensated. Okay, so if I treat that as neutral, I have one bad reason and one good reason. And how do I know which is which? That is, is it really true that there are a lot of suits brought in State courts in places with prisons under 1983 for damages rather than Federal courts? I don't know what the numbers are? Have you looked them up at all?",
  "-- 1983 actions, but maybe they bring them mostly in Federal court.",
  "Okay. So one way to test this out would be the following: If we had numbers and knew, you know, about how many State -- how many damage actions against prisoners were being brought in State courts in districts that have prisons there, and then we saw how much New York was really hurting and then we asked another question, maybe there is some Federal security actions, you see, where there is no State comparable action and we found out, well, the State lets them bring these actions in State court. So, there are ways of dealing with this empirically. Have you any sense of it?",
  "They are saying -- they are also saying there is a neutral reason. The neutral reason is the State sees there are just too many cases in which prisoners are suing correctional officials. So then they say: Here's what we are going to do about it. First, under State law, we will wipe out all the suits and give them instead an action against the State. But we know there are still some Federal cases about the same thing. So what we are going to do is we are going to say bring them in Federal court. Why bring them in State court? So now we've dealt with our administrative problem. So that's their neutral administrative reason. Now, people would like to bring 1983 actions still in State or Federal court. It may be more convenient. They get attorneys' fees, and the attorneys' fees you don't get under the State law. So why isn't -- or why is -- I guess that's the question for me: Is this an adequate, neutral, administrative reason or not?",
  "Well, forget all of the characterizations. If we could look into the motive, maybe we would have a different view. But all we have is the statute on the books. And, as in many cases, the people who are charged with defending those statutes think of very good reasons which are very plausible that could have motivated the people involved, and they have come up with the one that you have heard. Now, what's -- what's wrong with that one?",
  "The reason is, you see, there are so many cases in which the person is suing - - the prisoner is suing the prison official that our courts are clogged. So what we are going to do is: One, give the prisoners a good remedy under State law in a different court; and, two, close our doors to the comparable Federal case.",
  "But -- but the -- the problem that I am having at the moment is that they did -- from your point of view, is that they -- the other side listed 28 cases in which they said the Oregon courts have followed this rule that the instruction has to be good as a whole. Now, I have looked up those 28 cases, and they do -- they do say that. They do say it, or they imply it, or they apply it. They are not completely on point, but they are not completely out of point, either. And -- and so I suppose what happened is that the judge there just looked at this instruction on 32(a). It looks like sort of it's all together. It really does look like it's all together, the (1) and the (2). And he ran his eye down the page and he said, well, here are two other ways in which it's no good, and so that's the end of it. You can't raise your objection. Maybe you should have had four instructions instead of one, but you did just have one. And under Oregon law, unless every part of it is right, the judge is correct in not giving it, even if he never mentions the other part. And that 28 -- it does seem as if that's what those 28 cases do say. So what do we say about that?",
  "Well, I mean -- please, I -- I don't want to appear skeptical, but I am. And - - and that's because I have looked up in some of those cases, and then I sort of looked at the -- which doesn't -- most of them don't give you the instructions, so it's a little hard to say. But then I looked on page 32(a) of this appendix and looked at what your instructions looked like. And -- and if I were sitting there as a judge, I would think, well, gee, that looks like a single thing there. They have it indented, and they have a (1) and a (2), and it just looks like it's one ball of wax. So can I really fault this Oregon court for just doing what I said?",
  "Well, they had some other handbook that says beware of that.",
  "Because you are going to run into this rule that says if there is any part of a single instruction that is wrong, goodbye, even if the trial judge never mentioned it.",
  "I mean, it would be pretty odd. Did the person who wrote that read these 28 cases or some share thereof? And if you were going to do that -- it wasn't you, I know -- why -- why wouldn't you just, if you have one instruction, copy the -- the model instruction? Then you won't make errors in the other parts.",
  "True, but you could add that to the pattern.",
  "I'm not speaking of this from the point of view -- I mean I -- when I read that petition for cert, I thought this is a run- around, and I'm not sure that I think that now. That is, the reason is because I put myself in the position of not the trial judge. The person to put yourself in the position of is the Oregon Supreme Court justice. And what he is doing is he's reading that instruction. And -- and what can you say in response to what -- what he might have thought? He knows this rule. The rule is if the instruction is -- is unfavorable in any part, if it's wrong, you are out.",
  "He knows that rule, because there have been a lot of cases on it. And then he reads your instruction, and as I looked carefully -- I didn't know this the first time when it was here, but he said because it's right in paragraph 1 -- I mean it's wrong in paragraph 1, where he was wrong -- I don't have to go to the rest of it.",
  "Now we send it back, so he says: Okay, now I've got to go to the rest of it.",
  "The best you have come up with -- and I think you have researched this pretty thoroughly -- and the best you have come up with to find a case where they didn't apply the rule is that George case, right? \"George,\" I think, is the name of it. And there, there is an alternative ground which is that the judge had to -- had to give the instruction himself, and it's a criminal case. And we Shepardized it and it has only been cited twice. And - - and so I'm slightly at sea, to tell you the truth. And -- and what is the standard I'm supposed to use to decide whether that State ground is adequate as a matter of Federal law or not?",
  "The State interest in the rule in general, I take it, is to require the lawyers, if they are going to object to the instructions that the judge is going to give, to produce an instruction that is a correct instruction of the law. That's -- that's why, I guess, they have this rule.",
  "And -- and you'd better get it right, because if you don't get it right, you're going to lose your ability to claim that the judge was wrong in refusing to give any part of it. Now, if that's the reason they have that rule, that would seem to apply as much in this case as in any other case. Why wouldn't it?",
  "I would say the 28 cases are not quite as clear as I suggested. That is, I couldn't find in those 28 cases really a comparable situation.",
  "In each instance it seemed as if one of two things was the case: Either, A, where the instruction was in error, it really was the matter brought up in the first place, or the court said, but he gave the essence of the instruction he wanted anyway. Now, which of those cases do you think -- I am leading up to, what of -- what of those cases do you think is your best support, because I couldn't -- they are not perfect.",
  "What -- what you can't tell from that is what was the part of the sympathy instruction that they thought was wrong, and was the part that they thought was wrong really part and parcel of the part that the -- that the appellant was complaining about.",
  "But I remember that, because they said on that one -- some floor covering thing, wasn't it, that they had some liability for bad floors or designing the floors wrong - -",
  "If that's the case, what they said was: Don't worry about it because basically he did give you the instruction that you wanted, though in a different way - -",
  "-- and besides that, they added - -",
  "You're right.",
  "In the last one, what I have here is that the court said the so-called requested instruction was never requested at all - -",
  "-- at all.",
  "What is the -- what is the -- I will go look at that again. But what is the standard? I mean, remember, I think what your brother said at the end is correct. Imagine that yours is a death case and we have said as a matter of Federal law that this execution is unconstitutional, and then we send it back. And the court then says: Oh, we forgot; there are a couple of matters of State law here that bar the Federal consideration of the death question. And here they are. And then they come up with just this. Is this -- is this a situation where you would be equally -- that's my problem. And so, put yourself in my shoes and -- and tell me what you would do if this is the death case and not the case that you have?",
  "I'm just imagining that what has happened is that the instruction that they have given for the defendant in the death case violates Federal law, and then we send it back, and what happens is that the State court says, oh, it may violate Federal law all right, but it's -- the Federal court is blocked from considering it because there are these two other State grounds that mean that the lawyer - -",
  "Okay.",
  "What are the elements? Imagine -- I'm trying to get help, if I were to try to put pen to paper on this. Suppose they win in this. Then we will be back at the State law issue that I thought was going to be there, which was the issue of - - you are talking about the colloquy. Did they give the essence of the Federal mandated instruction, or didn't they? And then look how cooperative the judge was, et cetera. But that isn't before us now. What is before us now is something that blocks our consideration of that or anybody's consideration of that. And imagine this is not your case; imagine it is the most, you know, striking case, that's why I used a death example, and we go through exactly the same thing. And then the court does exactly the same thing, the State court, that happened here. And now what are the words that distinguish whether the court is in essence, to be colloquial, giving everybody the runaround or whether the court is applying a -- an absolute, clear, you know, fair, standard of State law? Which really they should have gone into first and saved everybody a lot of trouble.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, what they say is - - look at the two errors they found. One is in saying \"may\" instead of \"shall,\" and the other is in saying \"illicit profit\" instead of \"profit.\" And they are pretty picky. So, this is very picky, they say. And not only are they being picky, but they are being picky after the event. And they could have raised it first, and they have 28 cases supporting them, but none of these cases is right on point because the subject matter is, you know, closer bound up. And so they put all this together and say it's an unreasonable application of a rule that was there. And you say - -",

  "And I think in that case they also said, \"By the way, you've got basically the instruction that you wanted, and you overlooked\" -- no, that was the case where they said, \"You overlooked in your instruction an important allegation of fact,\" which allegation was that the guy had been rehired as a broker.",
  "We didn't say it was in error. I mean, there is nothing wrong with that.",
  "What is your response to the Chief Justice's suggestion that maybe we should reach the issue of due process on the amount?",
  "I mean I will tell you my subjective reaction going through these 38 cases is they are not quite in point, but they really take away the idea of the bad faith, particularly because the first time what the judge said, which I didn't understand its significance then, but the judge said: Well, since the first part of that paragraph was in -- was in error anyway, I don't have to reach the question of whether there were other mistakes under State law in the rest of the instruction. They did say that the first time, I think.",
  "That's in O'Neal. It says that, but most of the court joined and the reason it says it is it just confuses everybody, at least me, to talk about \"burden\" in this context. I think if O'Neal is right, it says what this is, is not involving a jury, not involving -- it's just what Justice Alito says, and following that, what you have, you say to the judge, \"Judge, your job is to decide this. Decide. Decide whether you think that the one side -- whether there is error or whether the error is harmless or whether it isn't. Decide it.\" Now, it could be in a rare instance the judge just can't decide. He's in grave doubt. And so what we are talking about is what to do in that -- what should be a very, very rare instance. Now, when I read this case, I thought the Veterans Affairs is absolutely common sense on this. It says, well, when you really don't know what to do, Judge, if the veteran got no notice at all, then probably the error was harmful. But if he got the basic notice, and all that's at issue is who should produce what or whether he thinks that he didn't know that he's supposed to produce a lot of information, well, there, it would be pretty rare that it was harmful. So then you'd better say to him, veteran, why did this hurt you? That's all common sense, and it seemed to me that that's what the Veterans Court was saying and then the Federal Circuit unfortunately, like I might have done, too, got it all mixed up with this burden of proof language. Now, you tell me, legally is that result which I am talking about sensible, and if so, how do I get there legally?",
  "I'm not criticizing you for that. I'm not -- it's not a criticism. I'm just really trying to figure out to get to what I see as common sense legally.",
  "The theory is he didn't know anything about this, got no notice whatsoever, so he didn't know that he's supposed to produce more information or he'll lose. That's the theory.",
  "But if you connect it by saying normally a veteran who isn't that knowledgeable -- not everybody is a genius in law -- when he doesn't get a notice that tells him you got to produce something more or you lose, he might forget to produce something more. That's the theory.",
  "Which is fine. If I get that record and if it is the way you describe, I'm not in grave doubt. No problem. The record's the way you described it, she knew everything she was supposed to know, so there's no harmful error, okay? We are only talking about cases where there is real doubt in the judge's mind about whether this failure of the agency did or did not hurt the woman or man. Now, when in doubt, we have the Veterans Court telling us the best way to administer this stuff is when they get no notice at all, and you are really in doubt, judge, you don't know if it was harmful or not, here's what you do: Assume it was harmful. They're the ones who know. I don't know.",
  "Suppose then we look at our rule, we read the first paragraph, what this court said, and we all held it, and therefore, we say, those are the cases we're talking about, where you are in doubt, and when you are in doubt, go proceed as the Veterans Court told you in terms of who has to show what.",
  "And so, why not just say that? What's the big problem of saying, judge, and then you say just what you said? And then the judge again won't be in doubt any more. So there's no need for this case because, either -- either -- either the veteran's agency will say, look, I walked that veteran through the process, I walked him through the process, walking him through the process he was told everything he needed to know, and there is no real problem here. It's just a formality that he didn't get the notice. And if that's true, I'm not in any doubt, unless the veteran tells me that that's wrong, and here was something, okay? On the other hand, we have your case. Your case, she didn't go to the doctor. If she went to the doctor, maybe she would have found something out. Again, I have no doubt, there is harmful error. So this case is a theoretical law professor's case that is never going to come up, because there is never any doubt. Either the VA did walk him through it and it's no deal -- big deal, because she can't come up with anything, or she can come up with something.",
  "It certainly does because it makes sense to tell the government: Government, you have to come up with every possible conceivable factual scenario and prove there wasn't a man from Mars who came in, and -- you know, that doesn't make sense.",
  "I know all this and why don't you just tell the judge that and say: Look at my client, judge, look at my client. My client obviously isn't going to understand what to do unless the client is told. And here my client wasn't told. I'm the judge, I'm not in any doubt, you're going to win, okay? So what I can't figure out is how to deal with this case, which as I said strikes me as a law professor's case that shouldn't make any difference in any real situation.",
  "Well, it seems -- what I was trying to get to, which I don't see how to quite get there -- it seems to me that if something really went wrong, if there -- there's no notice, that \"veteran, you have to put in some material, or you are going to lose,\" if there is no notice of that, and he really didn't get any notice during all this cooperative process, then I think the Veteran's Court is right. At that point I think it's fair to assume that he's hurt. But if he got the notice -- and there'll be a few cases where he had nothing to produce, but a lot of them he would have had something to produce. They know it, we don't know. The Veteran's Court knows. Now the other three matters -- who is supposed to produce what, and do you have general knowledge, can you produce whatever you want -- I would think it would be very rare that a veteran was hurt, if he knows the first, by not knowing the second, third and fourth. And therefore, I think he better come forth to explain in the brief, in the brief, why this matters. Now, that's what it seemed to me the Veterans Court set up. They know about it. They set that up. It's common sense. So, how do I get to a legal result that says just that? Or can I or should I?",
  "Why is that such a tough thing to do? It sounds like it's sort of -- is there some law out there that stops you from saying in the brief in a paragraph that, we would just like you to know, Judge, that we had some evidence here, or we have some now that we want to present to them. That's all. And then if I see that, I would say, my goodness -- and you describe it in three sentences. Now what is -- the Constitution doesn't stop you from doing that, does it? What stops you from doing that?",
  "They stop you, but the Veterans Court said to do it. So -- and they are the one who know this area and they said you should have to do it.",
  "Between me and the Veterans Court, as to who knows best how to work this system, it's ten to one it's not me.",
  "What they decided there is if there's no notice at all, no, you don't have to have a proffer, because it's up to the agency to do just what you want. But if it's one of these other three, far more technical things, which occur far more rarely, on that one, you better tell the judge in the brief how it makes a difference. That's their conclusion. What's wrong with that?",
  "-- but I don't understand that. I mean, let's suppose, contrary to your wishes, that the client was not hurt. He was hurt by some other thing, nothing to do with the bazooka. That's not your client -- that's the imaginary client -- but everything else is the same. Well, does that mean because they forgot to tell the client that the client has to go and produce some evidence, and she thought the Veterans Administration would produce all the evidence? Because they forgot that, your client wins and gets the money?",
  "That doesn't seem - -",
  "I know. Now you are going to be back in the remand and you now have to produce some evidence, don't you, or you lose?",
  "So then why is it a big deal that you summarize what you're going to produce in the brief? We're back where we started.",
  "I might have called them a proffer. I just want to say it's a description in the brief of how you're hurt.",
  "So there is regulation involved there. I mean, suppose you had no regulation at all involved. Why couldn't you have a monopolist at the primary stage, say, ingot, and what that monopolist wants to do is to extend its power into the secondary stage, say, fabrication, in order to make it less likely that there would be a new entries to attack its primary monopoly? That would -- suppose you have those circumstances? Perhaps they would be rare, but if you have them, wouldn't that set forth a Section 2 violation?",
  "Well, that's it -- I mean, now maybe you can get me off what I am thinking, but now it sounds that the answer to Justice Stevens's question is yes. Now, I have, yes, overruled Judge Hand's opinion in Alcoa. I always thought there were circumstances, whether true of Alcoa or not, where that did make out the claim, namely, the one I suggested. Well, it's quite a different battle if, in fact, the person whose injured, namely, the fabricator who is complaining, has a place to go, such as the FCC or the Alcoa regulatory agency, because under those circumstances, he has a place to complain that these prices are out of line. But if there is no place to go, well, I'm suddenly -- I'm a little hesitant to overturn Alcoa under those circumstances, and the reason the duty to deal doesn't deal with it is we could come into an existing world where duty or no duty, there have been independent fabricators who for a long time have bought their ingot from this monopolist.",
  "Then I would say that shouldn't be the law. The reason it shouldn't be the law is because that ingot may, by either withdrawing or, in fact, raising his price way above a competitive level and charging just no room to remain in business, is trying to drive out possible new entrants into the ingot stage of the business. And the fabricators are a number one out there as possibilities to break down the monopolist in ingot. And if that is the motive, as shown by the behavior, there should be a section 2 claim. If you want to argue that straight on the merits, what's the answer to that argument?",
  "Just out of curiosity, is there a place where in this case the plaintiffs could go, a place which has a label \"regulator\" under it?",
  "And that place is - -",
  "So we needn't reach the issue in this case?",
  "Well, why -- why can't we just say Trinko is a case, as is this case, where there is a regulator? So, in fact, if you, Mr. Plaintiff, are upset about this, and feel you are being very badly treated and squeezed out under circumstances where competition might be hurt as a result, then you go to the Commission, and you say: \"This is an unreasonable price. \" All right? Now I thought Trinko was a case where that was involved.",
  "But it -- it -- it said that the issue in that case was a duty to deal. That's not the issue in this case. And it was about Aspen, and whether you had a duty to deal. And the Court said no, you don't have a special duty to deal. Here we are dealing with quite a different thing. We are dealing with someone who has chosen to deal in the past, and they are setting a price such that the plaintiff thinks he is being squeezed out. Now I can't find anything in Trinko that tells me I can't say, we're at least not worried about this where there is a regulator that you can go and complain to. And if that's so, I don't have to reach the question of whether Judge Hand is right or wrong. What's wrong with what I just said?",
  "So can we write this following, we say: In the district court, as of this moment, there is no complaint that alleges the price squeeze theory of the majority of the Ninth Circuit. There is a complaint that alleges a price theory under Brooke -- a predatory pricing under Brooke Group. That is what is there. Nothing else is there. Therefore, that issue which the Ninth Circuit decided has no bearing on this case. We therefore vacate their decision, leaving it up to the district court to proceed as it believes appropriate under the law with the Brooke Group claim?",
  "Is that a possible thing to say?",
  "Yes or no, please.",
  "Is it, yes, we could do that, or no - -",
  "Yes we can?",
  "Isn't it - -",
  "-- that - -",
  "If we vacate, you would be in favor of vacating their decision?",
  "So why couldn't you -- why wouldn't you -- couldn't you go to the FCC or the other regulator and say: Regulator, they are selling me this widget or line at a dollar. All right. That's considerably higher than their costs of producing it. And, in addition to that, they sell the same service I do for $1.20, even though it costs me or would cost any human being at least 60 cents to provide that added service. So we are asking you to tell them that if they continue to sell it at $1.20, they lower their wholesale price to us so that we only have to pay at most 80 cents, or whatever the right number is there. I mean, they have someone to complain to. They could make the same complaint. I'm quite surprised that Vickers has written that under the circumstances I have outlined that there is a valid price squeeze antitrust claim or that the British Commission has held that. I would be very interested to know the citation of that. Because he may have done. I don't read everything.",
  "I'm not saying the European Commission. They have done all kinds of things. I am saying the -- the - -",
  "I am saying the British Monopolies or Restricted Practices Commission of which Vickers was the head. I agree with you that he is very knowledgeable, but I would be surprised if he had written contrary to what I just said in that example. But I am often surprised and willing to read it.",
  "Blankman, that isn't the concern. The concern is simply this: If they're correct, that this whole trial revolves around whether this individual is suffering post traumatic stress disorder with these amphetamines. They have two expert witnesses who say that he's in very bad shape, everything the defense wanted them to say; that's it. That's their evidence. On cross, the prosecutor gets both of them to admit that they're basing their testimony on what the defendant told them about his drug use. At which point the prosecutor says, let's talk to Mr. Roby, who is the arresting officer, did you see he was on -- when you arrested him, was he on -- did he look like he was on drugs? No. Let's talk to Mr. Flynn. When you processed him, did he look like he was on drugs? No. And then let's talk to Ms. Blankman, okay? So, now the case is submitted, and at that point the prosecutor says, there is no evidence that he was on drugs. He said that. Two, those two expert witnesses, and it's baloney. There's your case. Now, in fact in the files is evidence that Mr. Roby, that very day of the crime and the next day, sent out all-points bulletins saying he was a dangerous drug user. There is evidence in the files that Mr. - - that the FBI man sent out similar all-point bulletins. There are three witnesses who have described the behavior of the day as frenzied, and we have heard the descriptions. And you're saying that the lawyer, the trained lawyer for the government, who knew this information and knew the defense just what? Just overlooked it by accident? Just what?",
  "You also had cross-examined the two expert witnesses in order to show that they didn't really know that this man was a drug user, because their only basis for that was he told them. So as I've read these briefs, I've come away concluding yours with a strong impression that this was a relevant issue. That the prosecution did not concede that he was on drugs at the time of the murder. Indeed, that that was all that was at issue. And so I just don't see, like Justice Souter, how you can say that this wouldn't at least be useful information if -- even for cross-examination, and I think more than that since you have three direct witnesses. But leaving that aside, there's another part of this case that equally bothers me. It seems to me there was a lawyer for the State here that twice told the courts that this matter had never been raised. Is that so? Or maybe he said that the courts had decided it because the State has taken absolutely inconsistent positions, first saying that the trial courts decided it, and they did decide it, but by accident. They thought that paragraph 41 referred to this claim when it referred to an earlier claim. So first they tell the courts -- and you wouldn't know that unless you are pretty familiar because there were a lot of words written. They tell the courts: It's been decided, judge. Don't worry. They decided it: Adequate State ground. And next they wake up to the fact that it wasn't decided, and then they announce: Oh, he waived it, despite the fact that there's a case called Swanson in Tennessee that says that you can raise a later claim if you have grounds for not knowing of it in the first place. And he didn't know of it until 1993. So I see the State taking opposite positions, and -- and what seems from the briefs inconsistent with the State law, and I'm confused. What is it that happened in this case?",
  "Well, \"waiver,\" my goodness. First, I don't think it's impossible to say \"waiver\" since he wrote the words in paragraph 41 that make absolutely clear that they aren't waiving it. He is raising it. Then, aside from that, the paragraph of the district -- of the court of appeals's opinion says they were already decided or waived. So it's ambiguous, at best, for you. So let's go back and see what the State district court held, and I think that the State district court held that it had been decided, not that it had been waived. Am I right?",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay. So there the cases in this Court would say if a State appeals court writes a matter -- something -- a sentence that is ambiguous so you don't know whether it was decided: For example, they mean it was waived or mean that it was decided, then the next best thing to do, which makes sense, is look to the lower court to see what they actually did. So we follow that rule, and we get to exactly what justice Alito said: That what they did was they were holding that this has already been decided.",
  "Don't you think at this point the Petitioner is saying in -- in his briefs: I've been getting the runaround. First, they tell me it's one thing; then they tell me another. All I can tell you is this: No one has ever passed on the merits of this Brady claim, which is a substantial claim.",
  "So you choose the procedures, but be sure that that's the outcome.",
  "Could the explanation of this language in the opinion be due to the fact that the State first argued that it had already been decided; then in later courts the State changed its theory and announced that it had been waived?",
  "Isn't that why they're writing about waiver?",
  "What are the facts that show that a reasonable person in the passenger's position would have believed himself free to terminate the encounter?",
  "What are the facts that show that the person who was searched, which is Mr. Johnson -- is that right?",
  "Well, what are the facts that suggest that he thought he was free to terminate that encounter with the police?",
  "All right. I would say we've held a lot that that's just beside the point. If you stop a car for a traffic stop, you can search it for all kinds of things. You can do all kinds of things not related. So if that's what they're relying on, I suspect that that's not right, that it had to do with a different subject matter.",
  "Say I was lawfully stopped. All right. Go ahead. I want to get all of them in front of me.",
  "The question is, how did she do that?",
  "She said, \"You can leave whatever time you want\"?",
  "No. No.",
  "So you're standing there and the policeman is in front of you, and they have stopped the car, and the woman who is the policeman says, \"I want to search you.\" Do you think you're free to leave?",
  "Okay, then. So now we have got two of them. What's the third?",
  "No, it was on the highway.",
  "It was in an urban area. Okay. You're stopped in an urban area. The policeman says you are stopped, and you are stopped lawfully. Will you get out of the car? Yes. The policeman begins to search for the -- the gun. Fine. You think you're free to leave?",
  "What's the fourth? What's the fourth? I just want to get them all out here. Is there anything else?",
  "Okay. So, what they say is a reasonable person would have found -- felt that he could just say good-bye, and he would have felt this even though the car was stopped lawfully, she asked him to get out of the car, and she began to search him for a gun.",
  "I say, can we not reverse that?",
  "No, I'm saying if the question is whether the person reasonably thought at the time of the search he could leave, there's certainly a strong claim here that he could not reasonably or he did not reasonably think he could leave. As long as that is so, the issue in front of us is when you stop a person, a policeman in the course of your duties, and that person thinks that he cannot reasonably leave, and you believe reasonably that he's armed, can you pat him down? Well, asked that way, certainly a strong argument, the answer is yes, if you don't want to be killed.",
  "Suppose we go beyond. I mean, once we go beyond, I become a little at sea as to what the answers are because policemen do things other than investigate crime. A policeman is on protective duty. The individual he is protecting is approached by a member of the Crips gang, who has a bulge in his pocket. Can the police, with reasonable grounds to think that that person is armed, pat down that person? Or is he supposed to wait until the gun comes out of the pocket and the person who is being protected is shot? A policeman is on a bridge. Somebody stops the car in the middle of the bridge. Traffic is held up in all directions. The policeman goes to try to remove the car from the bridge. In the back seat is a member of the Crips gang with a bulge in his pocket. Is the policeman supposed to ignore that? I mean, policemen do many things, and once you tell me that we're going beyond the facts of this case, I can think of all kinds of hypotheticals that aren't so hypothetical, and I become uncertain about when the policeman can and when he cannot. So, how do you respond?",
  "Is there any dispute on the underlying facts?",
  "No.",
  "What are the facts? That is, this happened quite close to the beginning of the - - of the stop, didn't it?",
  "We don't know. I -- I read this. But it said -- I mean I thought, from judging it, that it did happen within a few minutes of the -- of the beginning. They were still talking to the driver. We know that.",
  "We don't?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, is there any reason to think it was half an hour?",
  "Is it lawful to possess a firearm?",
  "Was he convicted?",
  "How does -- how does this work in an ordinary case? I should know the answer to this, but I don't. It's a very elementary question. Jones sues the president of Coca-Cola. His claim is the president personally put a mouse in the bottle. Now, he has no reason for thinking that. Then his lawyer says: Okay, I'm now going to take seven depositions of the president of Coca-Cola. The president of Coca-Cola says: You know, I don't have time for this; there's no basis. He's -- he's -- I agree he's in good faith, but he's -- there is no basis. Okay, I don't want to go and spend the time to answer a question. Where in the rules does it say he can go to the judge and say, judge -- his lawyer will say -- my client has nothing to do with this; there's no basis for it; don't make him answer the depositions, please?",
  "Where does it say that in the rules?",
  "In Rule 8?",
  "I thought Rule 8 was move for a more definite statement.",
  "He shows a plausible entitlement. He says -- there's no doubt it's a claim if the president of Coca-Cola did put the mouse in the bottle. It's just there is no basis for thinking that.",
  "So he wants to go to the judge and say: I've set out a claim here; I copied it right out of the rules. All right? Now, what allows the judge to stop this deposition?",
  "Where?",
  "I'm sorry, I just don't have the answer to my question. I must not have said it properly. Imagine, way before Twombly -- these rules have been in existence for decades. So we go back years ago. Certainly, there have been many cases where, for whatever reasons, the plaintiffs included allegations that were just factually very unlikely. I want to know where the judge has the power to control discovery in the rules. That's -- I should know that. I can't remember my civil procedure course. Probably, it was taught on day 4.",
  "Well, I see that. It says a person has a right to go and get discovery. It doesn't say they only control it under certain provisions which don't seem to me to apply to the truly absurd discovery. There must be some power a judge has. And the second question I'm going to ask you, when you tell me what that power is, which apparently I'm not going to find out -- but -- but whatever that power is, which must be there, why doesn't that work to solve your problem?",
  "Well, what -- I mean, my basic question, which I really want to hear the answer to, is the Attorney General is very busy and what he does is very important. The president of Coca-Cola is very busy. The president of General Motors is very busy -- and very busy at the moment. And what he --",
  "What they are doing is very important. There are quite a few people in this country who aren't even in the government, and what they do is very important and they are very busy. And so if there is something in these rules that allows people to bring suits without any factual foundation, even though the -- the complaint says there is --",
  "I'll bet those people are being harassed --",
  "Well, why -- why isn't the protection -- I have the number of the rule I want. Maybe I am not understanding it. But Rule 26(e)(2), says -- says, among other things, that the judge can change the number of depositions you get. He could reduce them to zero if, for example, he decides the burden or the expense outweighs the likely benefit. Can't he do that whether you are the president of Coca- Cola or whether you are the president of Ford or whether you are the President, or you are the Attorney General?",
  "Can he do that or not?",
  "Yes, he can.",
  "No, but they didn't -- that isn't what 96 says. What 96 says, which I think is important, is it says that they knew of and agreed to subject the plaintiffs to these harsh conditions solely on account of their religion, race, and national origin, and for no legitimate penological interest. Because, if they are looking for suspects from 9/11, given the people they found, it's not surprising that they might look for people who looked like Arabs. All right? That isn't surprising to me, because that was what the suspects looked like. So, they want to say, yes, that was part of it, but it's not for no legitimate penological interest; it was for every good reason: We didn't want more bombs to go off. Now, suppose that's their view. Suppose also -- I'm just hypothetically -- they never, and they know this, ever had a conversation where they said, go look for people of Arabic descent alone. They never said that. They said, look for those people who have other connections and had something we reasonably believe is 9/11-connected; they might be dangerous. Suppose that's what they thought. So they read this, and they think, Judge, I want to tell Judge that you have no evidence to show anything other than what I just said, which sounds as if it might be reasonably connected to the 9/11 investigation. What is open to our two defendants, if you win this case? If they're right, how do they prevent lots of depositions from coming in and taking their time? How do they prevent this case dragging on and taking their time? If the facts are what I just said, rather than what you think?",
  "They'll -- they'll deny the facts; then you'll say there's a factual matter. And suppose hypothetically -- not what you think -- but you have no reason at all hypothetically, imagine, for believing that they did this solely for racial reasons unrelated to the investigation of 9/11. Suppose you don't have any information that shows that, and they are going to say everything else is covered by qualified immunity, and you have nothing else. Then what do they do to get out of 10 years of discovery?",
  "And the reason you can't make this argument under 26(b)(2)(C) is?",
  "The judge there is supposed to weigh burdens versus desirability of going forward. And so why don't you make this argument right at that point? If you are right you win; if not, you lose.",
  "And that's also true, I guess, of complaints, and every other legal question.",
  "Btu you -- what about -- I'm trying to work with this distinction where I agree with you that it's hard to see exactly what it is. But if I look at Bazemore, I think there we have a large number of employees. And if you look at a complicated thing, a salary structure, earlier, you see that that salary structure systemically paid black people less than white people. And at the time, for whatever reasons, there wasn't a statute -- we assume that that was lawful at the time.",
  "Then later it turns out that they are keeping that salary structure, although not for racially motivated reasons. They are keeping it simply because that's what it was. And the Court says, you've taken that complex structure, and you are administering it now, and the administration of it now is what is unlawful. Then, look at your case. We had a complicated structure involving seniority, really. And part of that old seniority system was this rule which was legal at the time. It is no longer legal. Now, we move that structure over until now, and we see we are administering the same complex structure today in the same kind of way that was at issue at Bazemore. It's a complicated set of rules that you have to apply today in order to see who is entitled to what, just as they did that in Bazemore. So I began to think, doesn't that, on the key matter, look very much like Bazemore? What is your response?",
  "I take it you are not saying anything that is in effect and is still there, you do retro, you win. I take it -- maybe I am not right, but I take it that what -- what the point is here is that you -- you took a complicated superstructure of rules that was creating boxes and those boxes were created on the basis of discrimination. Then you move it, whole cloth, into the post-new world. And it's the administration of that complicated system of rules that was created out of the discrimination, but it's administration today that makes it like Bazemore.",
  "It does that, but what I can't figure out is does that have a lot of implication for other areas or not? And the other thing I'm not sure of is how it squares with Ledbetter.",
  "Is it the case that there are two other individuals who have attached this judgment?",
  "All right. And is it the case that Iran's position in respect to those attachments is that those attachments, insofar as they are valid and executed, require a setoff from whatever we owe Iran or vice-versa?",
  "No. I'm saying I take it from something I have read in this that Iran believes that if, in fact, it won a judgment and that judgment is from someone like Cubic - -",
  "-- who they thought was prevented from delivering planes because of the embargo -- so it was relevant -- that that judgment, which they get if they collect on it, should be deducted from other money the United States owes them.",
  "-- unless instead of them getting it, the attacher gets it.",
  "The attachee gets it.",
  "Has to get the money for the attaching person. That's my point.",
  "And so that is at issue before the -- and -- and it is at issue in those cases. If the person who attaches it gets the money rather than Iran, Iran will say: We do not have to have a setoff.",
  "Isn't that right or - -",
  "And that is the same question that you think would be presented through this attachment, is that right?",
  "Dr. Elahi is one of several persons, is that right?",
  "What I'm trying to get at is Iran's position vis-a-vis the Elahi judgment is the same as its position vis-a-vis the other two attachments on the Elahi judgment.",
  "That if Iran ends up with the money, you can subtract it from other money the United States owes them. But if the attaching people end up with the money, you cannot.",
  "You would take the same position if, in fact, this money which is owed to Iran by -- by Cubic -- that is, Cubic, which then Iran got a judgment on -- instead of a judgment in favor of Iran, Cubic had written them a check, and they had taken the check and bought a house in Manhattan, or they had put it in an Iranian bank account, and either Mr. Elahi or one of the other two people sought to attach the bank account or the house or the grocery store, which they might have also have used. Am I right - -",
  "-- or wrong?",
  "I don't see why either is the slightest a bit more attenuated. In either case they are owned by the Ministry of Defense of Iran.",
  "Right. So what is the - - it seems at the moment, frankly you could read it either way. Let's imagine that -- that Cubic sold some jets that we blocked and they get some money, and they did it under their contract, and they got 2 million dollars. And suppose they said, we owe Iran this money, and they pay Iran the money, and Iran puts it in a bank account or buys the grocery store. All right?",
  "Now suppose that happened. It makes it simpler. And then what happens is three people, including Mr. Elahi and two others who don't accept money, the other two, attach it, on the ground Iran owes us this money.",
  "We want the grocery store. And suppose, further, Iran then says, if they get their money, you cannot subtract it, United States, from what you owe us. But if we get the money, then you can subtract it. That's their view. The United States' view is different. Who will resolve that question? The tribunal. So they say, what is at issue is not who owns the grocery store; what is at issue is the question of whether we get the money or you get the money. What money? The money that is the value of the grocery store, or the bank account, in which case it's identical. Now I think in that situation it's easy for me to say that money, the grocery store, or the bank account, of course is at issue before the tribunal. For the question is, does Iran get it or does the United States get it, in the situation where the two other people -- leaving Elahi out of it -- can attach it. I can easily read it that way. I can also read it the way you want.",
  "All right? So now, which do I do?",
  "All right. I'll then add that the strongest argument against you, it seems to me, is the whole point of this was not simply to compensate victims of terrorism. That's a worthy goal, and that's one of the points. But it was to compensate them consistent with the proper running, in the interests of the United States, of the Iranian-American Claims Tribunal. And so this is just the kind of issue we don't want to simply take away and let the victim have, because there is a strong risk the tribunal will rule against us, and we will have to pay it twice. Okay. That's the argument against you. Now, what's the argument for you?",
  "Yes.",
  "That's one, but - -",
  "That creates the issue, because the question is whether money that never goes back to Iran, but rather goes to an attaching person, is money that is or money that is not subtracted from the amount that the United States owes Iran.",
  "And that question is the question - -",
  "-- is the question that is before the commission.",
  "They are totally knowable. They are totally knowable. In order to decide what they are all you have to do is to look at the issues before the commission and decide whether those issues concern specific, concrete property; that is, the property that you have an interest in. With my grocery store, with my bank account, and with this claim, it is absolutely specific, and Iran has put before the commission the question of whether if you pay the money to an attaching person, we don't get it, or we do get it.",
  "That's what I gather. Now you can tell me I'm wrong on that if you want.",
  "They are trying to attach the ACMR system.",
  "They are trying to attach the Cubic judgment. The ACMR judgment is in Canada.",
  "And that's one piece of property. The other piece of property that is at issue is the judgment, and the way it's at issue is I take it that two other people are saying, we attach it; Iran says because they attach it, you don't subtract it from the ACMR judgment; and we are saying, even though they attach it, you subtract it, and therefore it's before the tribunal as well. That's my understanding at the moment, and I'm asking you to explain why that's wrong.",
  "Well, the -- the other thing -- and I think this counts against you, but maybe you have an answer to it, that there could be a lot of property that was directly at issue in '79 or '80 that Iran didn't get. And because they didn't get it, all kinds of things happened with property, and you get more of it or you get less of it. And during the interim years all kinds of things happened. And it could be that those transformations at different times are directly before the tribunal, irrespective to how much damages you are going to get, and how much -- we can easily think of cases if we have three or four hours. But you see where I am going?",
  "Now, I can understand Congress in passing this statute having one of two possible things: One is say we are just going to cut an arbitrary line here because it's a compromise, and what we will do is, you can go ahead, victim, and seize anything you want, as long as it doesn't narrowly fit within this. That's a somewhat arbitrary line but a compromise.",
  "The other way to look at it is to say, well, what we that had in mind here is we will pay these victims something; you know, they are going to get something right from Congress right now, because they are hurt. But in return from that, we don't want you taking action that will really affect our liability to Iran. And if it's the second, then we needed broader definition; if it's the first, we don't.",
  "Would we have to reach that question here? I mean, I don't understand three things that you've said. You said it says Federal; I don't see any place it says Federal. It doesn't use that word. Then you say it doesn't say Federal and State; in my copy it does say Federal and State. It talks about 2254 and 2255. So if I just read this in English, it says that once you appoint the person, and it's either State or Federal, 2254 or 2255, that person shall also represent the defendant in such competency proceedings and proceedings for executive or other clemency as may be available to the defendant. QED, end of the case. All right, now why isn't it?",
  "That's right. That's right, because they are referring to people who are under State death penalty or Federal death penalty, and what it says is that they shall get a person to represent them in these later habeas proceedings. And then it adds that that person -- and no point quoting it again; you heard what I just said -- it adds that that person will represent them in clemency proceedings. Now, is there any reason for thinking that Congress ---and contrary to some things mentioned, I believe that probably Congressman Conyers did read what he wrote. He certainly referred to it enough in speeches, and those speeches make very clear to me that that is what he had in mind, what it says. Now other people can read it differently, but I -- I mean, I've read it. I read the language. What's the answer?",
  "He happens to be the person who wrote it, and it's referred to in the Solicitor General's brief, and on page 21, I took what you said, I went back and looked it up, just as you might have suggested I would by putting in the relevant citations, okay? So having looked it up, as implicitly you suggested, I think Conyers knew what he said. I think he did mean those words to say what it says, but you can convince me to the contrary. That's why I raised it.",
  "Yes, they did.",
  "My experience in Congress is that the members of Congress do know the kinds of things that they are voting on; maybe others have different experience.",
  "I think you are wrong about that. The reason I think you are wrong about that is that that language to which you refer is language that Congressman Conyers himself introduced in response to a bill by Representative Gekus, and in Representative Gekus's bill he referred, just like this one, to both State defendants and to the Federal defendants. And the purpose of Conyers' amendment, which was to substitute for the Gekus amendment, was to extend, not to limit, what Gekus has done. And he introduced lots of information, all of which referred almost uniquely to State defendants. That's then picked up in the Senate, and the Senate, which is Levin, is trying to do precisely what Conyers was trying to do in the House, which we know from the fact that he said it. Now, I can't find anything in that legislative history that supports the statement that you made on page 21 that this initially was meant to refer only to people under Federal sentence of death.",
  "I -- I perhaps am missing this. I -- this is in general what I don't understand, how this works. My understanding is that under 404 something is \"fill\" -- they have a definition. And it's \"fill,\" among other things, if it changes the bottom level of any portion of water in the United States. Is that right?",
  "And somewhere I have the idea -- but I can't find it in the briefs now -- that it has to raise the bottom level by 55 feet.",
  "There is some number of feet.",
  "That's the result of this case. But, anyway, it raises the level. I guess it has to raise it some significant amount. All right. So what happens in this situation? Let us think of the worst pollutant you can think of. Think of that. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's saturated fat in potato chips, something absolutely terrible.",
  "All right. We are going to think of that pollutant. And now let's suppose that with the agreement of the Army Corps of Engineers a company takes this pollutant, which is the worst one you could think of, that the EPA would never let you go within 50 feet of it, and they take it, and they fill a lake with it up to the level of 55 feet, or 20 feet, or whatever number of feet. I mean, it just can't be that simply because they poured a lot of it in and it fills up the bottom of the lake that suddenly the EPA can't regulate it any more. Now, that -- that -- since that's so counterintuitive, that all you have to do is take a terrible pollutant and fill the bottom of the lake with it and now it's up to the Army Corps of Engineers and not up to the EPA -- that's so counterintuitive that I assume I don't understand the statute, and you will explain it to me.",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "It is identical. So it doesn't make any difference.",
  "I -- I heard you say before that it was not identical. That -- I mean if, of course, EPA takes all its regs and applies those regs when the Army Corps of Engineers considers a permit under 404 so that you couldn't get an Army Corps of Engineers permit unless you complied with the 402 etcetera regs, then this all could come to nothing.",
  "So there must be something missing in that.",
  "What?",
  "What is the most important thing that is missing?",
  "I think what might be missing - -",
  "Could you go - -",
  "Excuse me. Could you go back for a second to my discussion with Mr. Olson? I'm thinking of it in very simplified terms. The simplified terms is, I think of a pipe and I think of a circumstance where some terrible pollutant comes out of the pipe that would be subject to 306; and if the pipe goes up in a river or a lake, a regular lake, it could fill up the bottom. Seems possible.",
  "All right. So if it fills up the bottom, it's called fill and comes under 404.",
  "Yes, I know, I know that. I see the point. But I mean, it seems to me if it fills up to the bottom to whatever point, it's fill, and now it's the Army Corps of Engineers. If it has effluent in it, it's effluent and so now it's under EPA. In other words, you have both.",
  "It's only been going on for 40 years. I'm sure this isn't the first time they've had both.",
  "And -- and so I don't understand. What I would think of is if you have two sets of standards and it's both, they should satisfy both. I'm not writing these statutes.",
  "Now, I heard from -- and I might interpret Mr. Olson -- he may not have really said this, but the way I heard it was: Well, don't worry, because if it's fill and you get it over to the Corps of Engineers, they are going to apply the effluent standard anyway. And now you are sort of saying: Well, or they are going to apply some standard. And then there was a question of well, what standard, and we got a little vague there. Now, what happens if it goes to the EPA as effluent? Justice Alito's question is, well, do they apply the fill standard? And between my response to these two answers, I still don't understand how it works. It's -- help me.",
  "Okay. So now, if you lose this case, what we are going to have is all the fish are going to be killed by some horrible pollutant, and the -- the Army Corps of Engineers can't do anything about it, and the only reason is we put enough of the pollutant in there to fill it up to ten feet from the bottom. And then if you did it the other way, if the EPA regulated it, it might do something terrible under 404, and they couldn't do anything about it. Now it's very hard for me to believe that that's really how these agencies have been operating for 40 years.",
  "Is it right - -",
  "Is it right -- now, I am back on my hobby horse -- but is it right that this slurry is pushing into this lake 50 feet or 75 feet covering the bottom with some stuff? A lot of it's dirt, and some of it's the worst chemical ever, except it's not toxic? Okay. I guess cyanide isn't toxic. But the -- the -- now I just heard that if the EPA doesn't give the permit, but the Corps of Engineers does, the EPA has the power to veto the permit. Is that right?",
  "Why not? If they have a veto power - -",
  "I know it comes under a different statute, but in any instance where in fact they see that some of their rules that they promulgate are being violated and they think the Corps of Engineers is not paying attention to those rules, they can veto it.",
  "If they don't veto it, then that would be a way of reconciling these two things.",
  "So couldn't they veto it?",
  "And wouldn't an unacceptable adverse consequence be that it puts all this effluent into the water?",
  "If, in fact, you have this mix, and it satisfies -- it goes to an effluent part and a fill part, in your view, what -- if the statute says both agencies regulate, they have to meet both, one or the other? How does it work?",
  "So fill material is only that material as to which no effluent standard applies?",
  "404 material is material such that it is fill material and there is no effluent standard applicable?",
  "Well, they didn't. But what we're going to discover, I suspect, when we actually dig into this record, which is pretty extensive, are two things. The first is the California Court of Appeals does not seem to have dealt with the particular issue in front of us. They talked about a due process issue at the end of their paragraph, they have talked about things that are close to it, but they nowhere say expressly how they are deciding the question of whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel for the reason that he didn't put on this insanity defense. That's going to be our first problem. Then I looked to see, I got the record out to see, if he raised it, and he didn't. So we have the fact that they didn't talk about it, and then we have the fact that of course the Supreme Court of California says just one word, \"Denied.\" Then when we discover round two in the Ninth Circuit, we are going to discover some language which says: We are not relying on this rule, there is no such rule, as a rule of you have to make a defense as a last resort. Here's what they say. Instead of that we say, forget about that, we were wrong the first time, we assume. \"Where the State court has provided an adjudication on the merits, that is, it did say denied, but has not explained its underlying reasoning or held an evidentiary hearing, we conduct an independent review of the record to determine the State court's final resolution of the case, whether it was reasonable or unreasonable.\" So they say: We did conduct that record independent review. And our conclusion is that it was unreasonable, okay? Nothing to do with any special rule here or anything. We just think it was unreasonable. All right; now, what are we supposed to do with this?",
  "What is that deference going to be? I take it what it would be is that the person, the defendant, would have in his petition - - which we don't actually have -- would have said the facts are thus and so, and since they had no hearing, they would have to take those facts as being thus and so.",
  "And then we would have to say, was it unreasonable of them on the facts as they might have taken them most favorable to the defendant. Is that what we're supposed to do? Is it unreasonable of them to conclude for the State's favor in light of reading these facts as most possible favorable for the defendant? Is that what we should do?",
  "Yes.",
  "Then we have to reach this hearing issue because we have to say, insofar as the hearing reached a different result, we should ignore it for the reason that the statute tells us to consider the reasonableness of the State court's decision in light of the facts on the record before it.",
  "So we have to reach a huge number of issues which we've never decided.",
  "Well, then how are we supposed to do it? That's why I raised it.",
  "But there is no hole in the statute. What it says to do, quite explicitly, is it says that you have to see whether the State court decision was unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the State court. So it tells us what to do. It says, look at the evidence in the State court, and like any other instance where there is no hearing, every day of the week, judges refuse to give a hearing. Now, when they do that, they have to assume the facts in favor of the losing party. So the question is, assuming the facts in favor of your client, was the decision that he loses unreasonable?",
  "And you said yes. Is there any finding on that in the Federal court? No.",
  "All right. Now, that's - - that's why I don't know how to proceed because it seems to me to decide that question just as I said it. When I said it, I don't think what I said is clear in the law of this statute. There are two sides to it. We just had a case where there were many briefs on this question. So I'm slightly uncertain what to do.",
  "That's a good one.",
  "That's the law of the Federal Government, I would have thought.",
  "It's summary judgment law.",
  "That's my fault. I'm referring by shorthand to a Rule 56 summary judgment type standard. All those facts are assumed on your side in which they're material, and there has to be in the evidence a reasonable basis for dispute.",
  "That's my mistaken refusal to -- I should have said Rule 56.",
  "Well, what about -- what do you do with the last sentence of the supreme -- of the California Court of Appeals' opinion? \"None of the exculpatory evidence defendant recites, including evidence of his mental disorder, was reasonably likely to persuade a jury that defendant did not premeditate and deliberate the killing.\" And from that they conclude that there is no reasonable probability that, but for the errors, a different verdict would have been reached, i.e., that it does not satisfy the second part of Strickland.",
  "I was just reading from the California court of Appeals. Because I look at that. I think when I go back and see what was the evidence in front of them, I am going to find all of these -- all of these things. Not the last part by the way, not -- not the part about the counsel admitting he was wrong or whatever this argument we are having. We won't find that, but we'll find everything else there. And so they're using that as the basis to say there was no prejudice, and now I guess that the Ninth Circuit and the Federal courts would have to defer to that finding on prejudice. Now, what's your response to that?",
  "You keep saying 29 years. Is it 29 years or is that just a misprint - -",
  "Just to clarify in my mind. Case one, the defendant has no lawyer. He is -- they give him Miranda warning. He says: I don't want a lawyer. Okay. Now, do you want to speak against yourself? Yes, he says, I do. Sorry, strike -- he says: No, I don't; I don't want to say anything, but I don't want a lawyer. Six hours later the policemen say to him: Are you really sure that you don't want to speak? He says: Well, maybe I will, and he makes a full absolutely voluntary decision. That's okay under the Constitution, right?",
  "Okay. Now, it's the same case, except this time he says: I have a lawyer; I hired him yesterday. Now the policeman cannot say, are you sure? Is that correct?",
  "That's the law. So, the law is -- and the reason for that second is because once you have a lawyer, police communicate through the lawyer. Isn't that the reason, basically? I just always thought that was the reason. Once a person has a lawyer, another lawyer communicates through the lawyer. They don't go and talk to the client. I thought that was the kind of rationale for it. Maybe I'm wrong.",
  "Okay. Now, if the - -",
  "I'm not talking about that.",
  "I was trying to give a hypothetical and my hypothetical is a different one than you were just told. In my hypothetical the person has a lawyer, and I thought where he has a lawyer the police are not allowed to go and ask him questions about whether he wants to waive. Of course, he can volunteer it. Am I right about that?",
  "That's correct, that's correct.",
  "Correct.",
  "Correct, that's the conundrum of the case. Now I understand it. The conundrum of this case is he didn't tell the police, I have a lawyer. He had one. Now, if he had hired one and not told the police, it would be the same result as we just said, wouldn't it? If he had one but didn't tell the police, the police could not initiate questioning; am I right or wrong? All I'm driving at is shouldn't the result here be the same?",
  "The same whether you hired the lawyer or the same whether the lawyer was appointed? At least that's what's in my head. And if you can show me that you want the same result in both cases, that would go a long way towards convincing me.",
  "He tells some of the police. Some of the police know. It just happens that these particular ones don't.",
  "Can I ask -- I'm getting a different idea from what you're arguing. I want to try it on you and see what your response is. It's simply this, that there's something backwards about this case, and what's backwards is this, that when they're talking about a prophylactic rule in Jackson, what they're thinking of is the following: Everyone agrees that when a person really has a counsel, at that point, unlike the Miranda point, the police cannot talk to him further, though he can initiate. Now, everyone agreeing, what do we do with a case where a person doesn't have a lawyer, but he requests one? Now, in such a circumstance, we're going to treat it as if he had one. That's the prophylactic part. But here's a case where he really has one. So it doesn't fall outside Jackson. It falls within the basic assumption of Jackson, that the difference between having a lawyer and not having a lawyer is, if you have a lawyer, the police can initiate nothing. You can't talk to him. Now, if that's right, your case -- I mean, I'm afraid, their side, for your point of view, is a fortiori for Jackson, not the borderline of Jackson. Now, explain to me why I've got it wrong.",
  "Accept that, for argument's sake. Accept that, and then same -- same question.",
  "Interesting. I think this is very interesting to me because I'm learning a lot. Suppose -- Let's assume Justice Alito is absolutely right and that when you have a counsel, that's what you've done and that's the reason why you don't talk to the police, or at least they can't initiate. Fine. Take that as the rationale, and now apply it to this case. Since he has a lawyer, whether he said yes, no, maybe, \"I accept\" or not, it would have nothing to do with it. The same rationale would apply or would it?",
  "Because?",
  "I see.",
  "-- with that particular period. The trouble that I have with that particular period is August 1, 2003, to June 14, 2004, isn't that right? That is Donaldson -- or that's Moore?",
  "All right. Donaldson was the first one?",
  "Go ahead.",
  "Well, there -- as I understand it, that that first year the Vermont Supreme Court agrees with you.",
  "They said, we're not counting any of that against you. Now we go into the second year, and the second year had to do with Mr. Donaldson, a lot of it. And it turns out that Mr. Donaldson actually had left the office within a few days of his having been appointed to do this and then he never did anything. So the Supreme Court of Vermont says, as far as Mr. Donaldson is concerned, we do hold that against the State for the reason that it is the equivalent of not giving him anybody. The guy they gave him wasn't even a public defender, he never did a thing. All right. Now we go to the third group. The third group, the State agreed they should be charged. That's Mr. Sleigh. The third one they agreed with it. They said lightly, but they agreed with it. And as to the final group, Mrs. Moore, well, it looks like from the record as if the reason that was held against the State had nothing to do with her performance. It had to do with the fact that the State didn't give certain records to her, which everybody would agree, if it's true, should be chargeable to the prosecution, which is the State. So we have four periods. In one of them you won; in the second one he had no lawyer at all, according to the court; in the third one you agree it should be chargeable to you; and in the fourth one it has to do possibly with prosecution errors, not defense errors. Now, what are we supposed to decide? Are we supposed to decide whether my statement is, in fact, a correct statement? If so, why isn't it? I guess we have to read the record. But what else is there to decide?",
  "And you won that.",
  "Is that point in the case? Where -- where is that in this case? I don't know who -- I didn't see anywhere where the Vermont Supreme Court said anything, said that, except in the instance where you agreed with them. Where is it in their -- where is it -- who are they are referring to when they said that? Is that Donaldson? Because I thought the claim with Donaldson was it -- it was not his attribution, nothing he did was attributed. Rather, it was the State's failure to appoint anyone, because to appoint Donaldson was to appoint no one since he had left the office and since he did nothing. Now, is that what we're supposed to decide: When a State appoints a person who has already left the office and does nothing, under those circumstances is it correct to attribute to the State their failure to appoint anybody?",
  "What about Donaldson and Moore, those two periods? Those two periods, the Donaldson period and the Moore period, seem, as far as I can tell, which isn't that far, they seem to be periods when the State -- when the court below was saying that all that happened here was that the lawyers who were appointed, did a very bad job. You can't say they weren't appointed. It isn't that he didn't have counsel. He had counsel, and they just didn't do very much. Now, why should that be accounted against the stayer? Is Moore special? Was there really a problem of prosecutorial behavior? Is Donaldson the same as Sleigh? I don't know.",
  "Is Donaldson a case where they -- is equivalent to having no lawyer? I don't know how to deal with it.",
  "Could you try something out in your mind, and maybe you can't react to it. I'm trying to figure out how the structure requirement, what to say, and a thought was occurring to me which I am not wedded to, I would like some reactions to it: Is to say that there is a structure means that among this association of people there must be rules, understandings, or behavior that tend to keep the association together over time, other than those which would be essential to allow them to commit the particular crimes at issue.",
  "Well, I know, but I'm trying to work out in my mind, is that a sensible thing to say? The trouble with the word \"structure\" is everything in the universe has a structure, and so it's awfully vague? I'm trying to make it a little bit more specific.",
  "That isn't what I said. I said: Rules, understandings, forms of behavior that tend to keep the association together over time, other than those rules, understandings and associations and behaviors that would be necessary -- \"necessary\" meant strongly -- to commit the particular crimes at issue.",
  "Yes.",
  "When you say \"individual,\" the first part of the definition of \"enterprise\" speaks about any individual partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity.",
  "So then, I've read somewhere that people feel that where that individual is involved, the individual is acting as an -- a legal entity such as a sole proprietorship. Is that right?",
  "I'm talking about a legal entity. And in the second clause, what we are talking about here, specifically, it is \"a corporation, a union, or a group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.\"",
  "Two people -- two people walk along the street and know each other, suppose that's the example, and one of them says I have a great idea. Let's go in and take some money out of the post office. The other says, what happens if a policeman comes? The first one says, we'll bribe him. Okay. Then they do it. That's it. Period. Now, of course that's illegal. But is RICO supposed to catch that?",
  "What is it that keeps them out of it?",
  "Well, here we have two - - two -- two related crimes.",
  "There was between the two.",
  "That is the bribery. What happens if three months from now the postal inspector comes to catch us, we will bribe him.",
  "You are quite right, I agree with you that these are different efforts to try to catch the same problem. And the problem is that I don't think anyone sees that the simple conspiracy in carrying out of two criminal offenses by several people together without more -- without something more should violate RICO. I think your answer to that would be you agree with that, but tell me if you don't. And then if you do agree with it, the very difficult problem is to figure out how to get the people to clearly show a pattern or not.",
  "What did you think -- what did you think of the -- probably not much of it, but what did you think of my effort there? And I am trying to point out, as you see, I am open to anything that will deal with what I think of as a functional problem and the functional problem is exhibited by that Posner example I gave you or by two investment companies that decide, what we will do is we will issue a letter that is going to be shown to two different people; that is their only association; or maybe 100 people, but they know who they are, and they are going to be shown this letter over a period of five or 10 years, and someone later comes back and says there is a false statement in the letter. Well, they shouldn't issue a false statement, but is that RICO? I mean, so -- so the object -- the object is to find a way of not overextending RICO where there is nothing there but a conspiracy to commit two crimes. Pattern is one help. The pattern is pretty vague, so all the courts but one have come along, I take it, with this other help, which is playing on the word structure. Now you have heard what I said as a weak effort to try to do something. What is your best effort to do something to deal with the problem? Or what's wrong with my effort? Whatever you want to say.",
  "That's different. That's -- of course the same evidence can establish two separate elements.",
  "The problem will be conflating the elements so that every single case that you have the first set, you also have the second set.",
  "No, no.",
  "Always, in a case where you sue the investment company because of their one letter used four times, it's the act of the individual. In the case that Posner used, it's always the act of the individual. There's always a criminal act of an individual.",
  "And he has to be associated, however, with an enterprise for it to fall within RICO, and there also has to be a pattern.",
  "That's going back - -",
  "That's right, and our problem is he is doing it with one other person whom he met once, and they agreed to do it, and it's a common law conspiracy; and now suddenly he has done it twice with another person who helped him and they said they would do it, and now we have RICO; and my belief is - - which you may not agree with -- that that common garden-variety conspiracy to say, rob a bank and then transport the money a few months later, that that's all that's at issue. That shouldn't be within RICO.",
  "You might come back and tell me it should be.",
  "Looking at this, why can't we say the following? Some circuits have said that they will never recognize plain error, when it's a breach of a plea agreement. That's wrong. It could be plain error like any other kind of a case, every other kind of issue. Sure. But the error here isn't plain. On the one hand, all they did, the promise was the government agreed to request that his sentence be placed at the lowest end, and they followed it. In the other part they made no promise. They simply agreed that he had demonstrated acceptance of responsibility. And then what they did at the trial, they said, \"we don't want him to get acceptance of responsibility at this point.\" Now, some people could argue that here is an implicit promise in paragraph 1, not to say something at the trial that is contrary to their recognition in paragraph 8. That's where it is. On the other hand, you could argue that there is implicit, also, a promise not to implicitly do the first implicit, if what he has done in the meantime is commit another serious crime. So we have two arguments, one of which says they committed error, and one of which says they didn't commit error; and the argument turns on two implicit readings of paragraph 8. Therefore, it is not plain. End of case. What's wrong with that?",
  "Well, I mean, the government would like a whole lot of questions answered. So what I don't see is how the government can come here because they want a lot of questions answered, and get us to take the case, which I'm not sure was a wonderful idea; maybe it was. But then we take the case, and now they want us to say, no, no, don't take the obvious response to it because we would like you to answer five other questions. So what I want to know is, what's wrong with what I said? Is that a possible outcome?",
  "They can only get -- they can only get your breach if they find an implicit agreement. The implicit agreement is that you will not tell the court that, in light of changes, paragraph 8 no longer describes the situation. You didn't breach paragraph 8, as taken literally. You agree he had shown that acceptance of responsibility. What you told the court was, now we don't think he should have this acceptance of responsibility, which previously he had shown, because he's committed another crime. Those are the exact words you said to the court. Now, he may have made an implicit not to do that. On the other hand, that implicit promise may be negative by, you know, the other implicit acceptance of the fact that this applies only where we don't commit another crime. So I'm just saying this -- I'm not saying you are even right. I'm just saying, having those two arguments, it seems that you aren't plainly wrong. You aren't plainly wrong. So how do I get to the other questions if I believe that? Do I say, \"Hypothetically if the error here were plain, which I think it isn't, then I'd like to tell you where the burden of proof lies.\"? By the way, if I happened to think that that's whatever it is, then I will go into a few other things. That's really what I feel you are asking me to do because I don't think it's plain. Maybe the other people think it's plain.",
  "You fulfilled paragraph 9, didn't you?",
  "Can you say just for me, because I am changing a little bit here in light of that question, but what is it precisely that the government said it would do that it did not do?",
  "What does it say? What are the words that it says the government did not do?",
  "So he did agree. \"We agreed that he does qualify.\" And then when you got to the court, you said, now we don't agree that he qualifies at this point.",
  "I know you want to -- as I point out one other thing to you. I think it's a hard question, burden of proof and these other things, that I just turned the page, after the person, Ms. Simms, she's the prosecutor, and she's absolutely clear to me, others can disagree, that this judge knew just what the government had agreed to, and the prosecutor was saying that now things have changed. And then the judge turns to the probation officer, and the probation officer says, just to reiterate what Ms. Simms said, the new offense, according to the guidelines of the guideline manual, prohibits any acceptance of responsibility. Now, if that turns out to be right, of course, it couldn't matter less whose burden of proof it is.",
  "What is the -- what if the other reasons apply? I take it the words \"self-incriminating statement\" in (e) means any adverse evidence?",
  "Okay. Now, there are a lot of reasons we exclude evidence. You know, I mean -- it might, for example, might not in the circumstance be worth the confusion. It might not in the circumstance be worth the time. It might violate -- I don't know, there is like a whole -- there are many reasons. So in your opinion, does section (a) mean to set aside all the reasons? In other words, if for some other reason this particular piece of self-incriminating evidence, adverse evidence obtained after 30 hours, violated the admission, violated some totally different rule of evidence, as your opinion does (a) mean, judge, it doesn't matter if it's triple hearsay or it doesn't matter if it violates some authentication requirement, it doesn't matter if it violates, you know, it has to be relevant, pertinent, not a waste of time -- it doesn't matter; admit it?",
  "No, of course it doesn't mean that.",
  "So if it doesn't mean that, then why does it mean that we should ignore this other rule of evidence contained in Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure?",
  "Well, there are -- there are, in other words, as you have heard, a number of things that can happen when you hold a person, let's say for 40 hours for 29. I mean, one thing that happens is he doesn't learn how he gets out on bail. Another thing he happens, he doesn't learn exactly what the charge is against him. Another thing -- they are all listed in, in Rule 5. And -- and when you have an exclusionary rule, you enforce not only what you are talking about, which I understand, which is the voluntariness part, but you also enforce all these other things that happen when you bring a person before a magistrate and don't keep him for 70 hours or something. So why should we interpret (a) as setting those other things aside and requiring us to overturn McNabb and Mallory?",
  "No, of course not.",
  "Did it say anything in the legislative history, which interests me, that the purpose of (a) is to overturn Mallory and McNabb?",
  "I wasn't focusing on the word \"confession.\" I was focusing on the words in (e), which were \"any self-incriminating statement.\" And that's why I asked you if you interpreted that to include anything that the individual said after, say, 29 hours that might turn out to be adverse to that defendant's interests. And your answer to that was yes.",
  "And I think you are right. I think we agree on that. So, if the defendant said, if you look under the rock you will find the writing such-and-such, it might not be authenticated for that particular writing. There are many reasons. It might be triple hearsay, what he says. I mean, you know, there are a variety of things, aren't there? Maybe I am wrong.",
  "The reason I brought that up is not to be technical. The reason I brought it up is to point out that there are many, many words that a person could utter in confinement under 30 hours, which in a variety of ways could stab him in the back without it having anything to do with Miranda, without it having anything to do with coerced confession. And similarly, there are many reasons for bringing him forward that have nothing to do with either. And therefore, I wonder if all those reasons could support retaining McNabb-Mallory, a matter about which Congress said nothing.",
  "Wasn't this individual represented by counsel? Was he represented by counsel?",
  "And he was represented by counsel at the time that the informant took the statement, got the statement elicited? Is that right?",
  "I have my memo that I haven't looked through carefully, but I would be quite interested. I thought he asked for counsel. He was given counsel, and subsequent to that, this statement was elicited. I would like to know that because the Sixth Amendment says you have right to assistance of counsel in your defense, period. And I guess, if he had a lawyer, the lawyer could have told him, \"Don't talk to informants in the jailhouse.\" He could have said, \"I'm going to talk to who I want.\" Or he might not have. But I would be interested in knowing, did he have assistance of counsel at the time the statement was elicited? It's one thing to me if he did, and another if he didn't. Don't know?",
  "How can I find out?",
  "So it might be he asked for counsel but hadn't yet received counsel?",
  "I see the problem. I wonder if you have an answer to another question. You may not. I can't find it. It seems to me it's been 20 years since this -- nearly 20 -- since the Court decided the Michigan case. The other cases were decided even earlier. And it's just surprising to me that it has never come up or rarely, rarely come up that the question of whether the State can introduce into evidence a statement made when the State questioned an individual who'd asked for counsel or had counsel out of the presence of the counsel. I mean, does that normally happen, or does it never happen? Why is there so little law on it? Do you have any idea?",
  "That's what I'm not certain about. And this is why I ask -- have been asking these questions and what I can't figure out in my own mind is this. I ask for a lawyer. The State has some period of time to give me a lawyer. Now it's one thing if what's going on is once I ask for a lawyer, the State should deal with me through my lawyer; that's how they are supposed to do it. But that isn't as basic - - that's like a rule of ethics in most States in civil context and other contexts -- that's not as basic as if I ask for a lawyer and then the State just doesn't give me one, though it should. That's a different violation, a different kind of violation. One is a kind of a rule of ethics incorporated in the Constitution. The second is what the case is -- is what the Constitution is really about, give him a lawyer when he asks for one. And which is this case? That -- that's why I'm having hard time. Is it the first or the second?",
  "No, no, no. I will amalgamate that for you. I will say they are exactly the same thing. But what I want to know is what rule is violated, what Sixth Amendment rule. The rule -- you heard what I said, the rule \"don't talk to a guy who wants a lawyer until you talk to the lawyer.\" No communications with a client. It's a communication with the lawyer. That's one thing. And the other rule is he has asked for a lawyer but you never gave him one. Now which is this case? I mean, I first thought well if he didn't have a lawyer at all, then it must be the second; but then I thought they must have a reasonable time to give him a lawyer, and they haven't violated that second. If you have any view on that, it would be helpful to me.",
  "On that particular point, just specifically -- this is awfully complicated and you have had to go through it pretty quickly, and so have I. All right. So, it seems to me, looking at these three sections, as soon as you get to (a)(2), it says certain matter are not subject to judicial review, and it includes 1225(b)(1), which I take it is the case where somebody comes in, knocks at our door, and the immigration judge says good-bye and he says, no, no, I am entitled to be a refugee or asylum. Now, we look at that, it says in there it's subsection (e) gives you judicial review of that. Now we look at the thing you cited which is (5) -- (a)(5), and you read it completely correctly, but you left out these words \"except as provided in subsection (e).\" So now we go to subsection (e). And lo and behold, what is subsection (e) talking about, but just the case I have mentioned. It talks about -- it talks about judicial review for orders under 1225(b)(1). Now, those are the people who knock at the door and they want asylum. And there is some procedures for them. So, now we look at (e) to see what are the procedures for them. And lo and behold, right there in (2), it says you can have a habeas corpus procedure as to certain matters, whether he is an alien, whether he has been admitted as a refugee, et cetera. So it says there are some you can have habeas corpus. So I imagine a person who has been ordered removed under (e). All right. Now it says you can have a habeas corpus and now the judge says good-bye. And they go to a reviewing court, which is going to be a habeas corpus court, and that court decides, the alien is right, I am going to issue an injunction. Now, just in case he's thinking that, in the very next section (f), what we have are two provisions, (f)(1) that says if his case is a case involving mass action against the whole thing, you can't enter an injunction. And then we look at (2), and it says if his is just a normal case, you can't enter an injunction unless it meets this specific standard. So I looked at that. And I admit this is pretty quick, and I thought it's (e) and it's (f), and (f) is dealing with (e), (f)(2). And it makes perfect sense. They don't want a habeas corpus judge telling that immigration judge what to do with the guy knocking on the door and saying \"I need asylum,\" unless they meet clear and present danger -- clear and -- whatever it is, clear and present -- yeah. Okay. Now, I will admit I read that quickly. And therefore, I am probably missing something. And I don't expect you necessarily to be an expert, but can you do your best to tell me what I am missing or if you think I might be right?",
  "What it says here specifically is it says habeas proceedings.",
  "Well, let me add one other thing, because all I am trying to do is find some work for this section (f)(2) to do. And I think I found some. And I think what you say is wait a minute, we agree it's like habeas. But and I think it would be like an exclusion order rather than a removal order. And I did notice previously when it talks about 1225, sometimes it uses the word \"exclusion\" and sometimes it says \"removal.\" But if you were that district habeas judge and you get a thing saying removal, you don't really vacate it. I think what you had do is order an injunction against its enforcement. Here I don't know - -",
  "What are we supposed to do? What would you had do? Suppose you are a district court judge and at 2:00 in the afternoon on Friday a petition comes in and it's from someone who says, \"I'm going to be on the 5:00 airplane to Hong Kong and I have a real case here. I think I am right.\" And he has eight pages attached and you read through that. And you say, \"He has a point. Now how good this point is, I don't know. So I would like to put this -- I would like to have everybody in here on Monday, and then I could figure it out.\" Now, that probably happens. Now what is worrying me about your position on this -- which, although most -- I think every circuit is against you on this, except for this one.",
  "And it seems to me that would make it impossible for the district judge to do, because the district judge cannot honestly say that it's clear and convincing that this man is going to win. All he knows is he has a point and he would like to hear more about it and he doesn't want him on the airplane three hours from now from Hong Kong. So I -- so how is it supposed to work?",
  "Right.",
  "Well, what court would ever do anything else? I mean, why if you were granting a stay, would you not want to do that so you can fully consider the issues?",
  "Was I right or wrong?",
  "Are you sure? Because - -",
  "-- you didn't mention it. If I am right, why didn't you mention it?",
  "So you are saying that 635(a) creates an inference that 635(c) creates a fiduciary duty?",
  "That's the part that I'm not getting. You are saying -- the question, I guess, basically is, does the language of 635(a) that says with the approval of the Secretary, the Indians can, among other things, for business purposes lease the land. Right? That's what it says?",
  "And that doesn't seem much different from the IMLA, to tell you the truth, to me. It doesn't seem different at all. But now you are saying, no, it's really different because look at (b) and (c), that's your basic argument?",
  "I look at (b) and (c) and it says -- when you lease something under (b) and (c) which is not (a) -- (b) and (c) -- you have to have this all supervision, and so forth, or it has to be at a fair value, something like that; is that right?",
  "(B) and (c) say that land is owned in fee but, let's see -- what is -- sorry, I don't want to delay you on this. I thought that (b) and (c), you were saying, create an obligation -- create more of a trust obligation.",
  "So why does that -- why does that mean that this Act creates a trust relationship?",
  "Thank you, but now what of course is at the back of my mind is I'm trying to see, if this -- is this statute stronger for you than the statute we already considered? And I start with some suspicion, because I think if it is a stronger statute for you, you would have argued it the last time. So I wonder why you didn't.",
  "So somebody thought maybe it was a weaker statute, so -- but I will put that suspicion aside.",
  "So anyhow that's the fundamental question in my mind. I look at the language and so forth, but the language doesn't seem any stronger for you, at least at first blush.",
  "That isn't really my question, because I've tried to erase from my mind any suspicion about why you did or didn't argue it last time; and looking at it straight afresh, I think when the Court of Claims got this back, as any judge would, the first thing they do is look at the words of the old statute, look at the words of the new statute, and try to figure out if the new statute that you cited is somehow more supportive of your claim than the old one was.",
  "Okay. So what have we got here in that respect? What we seem to have is two later provisions that say the government shall have no liability when it enters into leases. I mean, maybe that helps you, but at the moment, I am slightly escaping it. And then I guess there is some regs that were promulgated after the lease was entered into and seem on their face to deal with other matters. Okay, now, what am I missing?",
  "Well the regs you didn't emphasize, so forget them. If you don't want to rely on them we won't. The -- but I've looked for everything I could find that would support you on this basis - -",
  "-- and there you are, so I want to you add something to explain - -",
  "Okay.",
  "There could be a thousand reasons why under State law a particular jury is improperly constituted. So you are saying whenever the State under whatever State laws it has says that the judge made a mistake about who to put on the jury, that that violates the Federal Constitution.",
  "Well, why? One qualification is that a jury -- a juror can't be prejudiced. All right. I think it's a very common thing for prosecutors and defense lawyers to get into arguments about whether a particular juror is or is not prejudiced. Okay. So sometimes the judge excuses them, maybe five million times a year; and probably in a certain percentage, maybe 5,000 or 500 or 50,000, the judge is wrong. All right. So the State appellate court says he's wrong. So the jury wasn't made up properly. Now you are saying in every one of those cases that violates the Federal Constitution. I have never heard of this before. It may be there is some precedent for it. I don't know. That's why I am asking.",
  "So that means that held - - we have held in that case -- I had better look at it - - that in any instance where excusing a juror violates State law that that is a violation of the Federal Constitution. Which is the case that says that?",
  "Well, why did they get it wrong?",
  "Why do you say they got it wrong?",
  "Does that mean even if it were Federal? I don't know. I'm asking. Again, I don't know.",
  "Is that clear as a matter -- I don't know. Again, I'm asking. Is it clear as a matter of Federal law that we have lots of Federal trials, and in a Federal trial where a district judge makes an error in excusing a juror -- he shouldn't have excused the juror, there are many, many reasons for doing it, so the jury is not properly as the defense lawyer has the right to have it -- that that requires automatically a new trial? Is that clear as a matter of Federal law or not? And I - -",
  "I don't know the answer.",
  "I am not talking about Magistrates, and I'm not talking about due process. I am asking the question, just what I asked. Now, you heard what I asked. It's about jurors.",
  "All right? What is the answer?",
  "I know. I'm not asking that question. I am asking when a lawyer -- when a - - when a judge makes a mistake and excuses a juror whom he shouldn't have excused because he thought the juror was prejudiced, let's say, and he wasn't. The appeals court says, you are wrong about excusing him. Does under Federal law the defendant become entitled to a new trial? Not under the Constitution, under whatever you want.",
  "Yes or no?",
  "You think the answer is no, okay.",
  "Did -- that's exactly what I can't figure out. I'm trying -- forget due process. All right? Keep that out of your mind. We have approximately 50 State jurisdictions, the District of Columbia, and a bunch of Federal jurisdictions. All right? In those jurisdictions, to your knowledge -- you may not know this, you may not have looked it up -- but what happens in the situation where a juror -- where a juror should have been excused? I guess there's a new trial. The juror should have been excused, but wasn't. I guess there's a new trial normally; is that right?",
  "If the juror is biased. Yes. Okay. Now suppose it's the defendant who wanted the juror and he was wrongly excused. All right? So that's what the appeals court holds. What's the rule? Again, do they go back and look and see if it's biased? If the juror -- if the defendant didn't get the juror he wanted, somebody else took his place, do they look to see if that person was biased? And if not, say, too bad, defendant, you may have been right, but you lost the jury that you want, no remedy? What happens?",
  "So, at least in the case of where he failed to get a preemptory, whether it's Federal or whether it's State, the Federal law and most State law is: You lost your right to a preemptory, one of them. You should have had it, but you are out of luck, if -- if the juror who replaced the replacement, the juror who was there, you know, who otherwise wouldn't have been is a fair juror.",
  "Well, what about the last hypothetical?",
  "What is the law there? That's what I am trying to get at. I mean, my initial instinct would be that if a defendant doesn't get the jury that the law entitles him to, that's an error. And you normally would think it was harmful, because you can't say, in honesty, it was harmless, it's the jury that's supposed to decide. I suspect it would work out that way. I have never looked into it. How has it worked out?",
  "All right. So in other words, they have often said you don't get a new trial?",
  "Okay.",
  "How does that differ from you using your printer, there's an ink cartridge and you replace them after a while, and mine has a little thing attached that says don't put it in your ordinary garbage bin because it's dangerous or whatever it is, put it in this envelope and do something? Now, I'm sure that HP makes those and knows that several million people won't do it. They will throw it in the garbage bin, and they ship to it me. All right. Are they now arrangers?",
  "Because?",
  "Oh, some? No, probably millions. I don't know anybody who does put it in the right garbage can.",
  "Then how is that then different from Shell? Shell here knows that to some degree their people are going to spill this. And, of course, shell arranged the transport. And in my imaginary hypothetical -- I don't really know -- so does HP.",
  "Well, now maybe HP knows that there is a particularly bad customer like Breyer who - - -- because I foolishly admitted at dinner that I dispose of them all improperly. Now are they Shell?",
  "So then, suddenly if HP, in fact, uses -- I guess they lease -- you know, they have a common carrier, imagine -- or suppose it's car batteries, same problem. They have their own trucks, and they -- or they use Fed Ex; I don't know. And they, in fact, put in an instruction, which says: Really do it; really put it in the special now.",
  "I'm trying to find that point. And what I have found you so far to say from the briefs is that what Shell here did -- I'm not saying it easy -- but what they did was they arranged the transport, that seems to me to be common, and they put some instructions in which said the right way to dispose of it. Well, doesn't everybody do that?",
  "Independent but not at the time of the spill.",
  "Then in your view what it is is a company arranges with a transporter for disposal when the company knows that the transporter on arrival may spill some of the product?",
  "I guess then every oil company -- well, I mean, every liquid product company in the United States is going to be -- fall within that because a lot of people do spill things.",
  "No that's at that point, because I think you're focusing on the word. You don't use the word \"for\" disposal, and I think that is the key word, and the question is intention versus purpose. So that in your trash hauler case, it seems to work pretty well for me that when we say that that trash truck of course intended in the sense that it was its purpose to dispose of the trash when it got to the dump, but the leakage along the way, it was not its purpose. So how do we deal with that? The statute tells us that they are an owner of a facility or a vessel that leaks, and therefore they are liable that way. Now, that seems to work. So we get your example. What doesn't seem to work is when you import the notion of intention in the sense of knowing that to the arranger provision, because at that point I don't see how -- and I have to buy that to get your argument. At that point I do not see how you get every thing of Clorox on the shelf on the shelf in the supermarket and don't put Clorox right in the arranger provision and lots of other companies that shouldn't be held as arrangers. That's my problem. Are you following that?",
  "It does say that, but my problem is I can't find in the distinctions that they made useful distinctions that will do that. It will say \"many,\" but it won't say, for example, the car battery manufacturer who sends his car batteries out in his own trucks to places where people will get them, and he knows that they're not going to do it properly no matter how hard he tries. Well, he's not an arranger. He didn't arrange the transport for disposal; he arranged the transport for sale.",
  "Well, we don't suppose that that cost -- that single thing cost $2 million, and you will have to hire that $2 million machine even if there is one drop. So for the cost of that machine it couldn't matter if your client put in one drop and nobody else put in any, or the others put in 40 billion drops. Can you allocate it? It would seem fair to allocate it, but I guess maybe in the restatement there is some law somewhere saying you can't, because it's just one single cost that takes place regardless. What's the state of the law on that? How do you - -",
  "But they don't say that - - there is nothing in the Resolution and nothing in the - - does anything in the Court's opinion or the Resolution say that the claims are valid? We all know they have claims. They have been making claims. Is there anything in any document I have that says the claims are valid claims? Maybe they are valid, and maybe they are not.",
  "Of course, they think they are valid.",
  "So -- so since you have normally one group thinks they are valid; another group thinks they are invalid. Well, here we are. Let them fight it out. And all we can say is that this Resolution of the Apology doesn't really say who's right. And if Hawaii wants to give some more money, or whatever they want to do, to the Native Hawaiians, that's their affair. What's the -- what's the problem?",
  "Could the Hawaiian Legislature pass a law saying that the Native Hawaiians have claims? Those claims, because of the Federal 1950 -- whatever it is -- are not valid any more. But that was pretty unfair to them. And, therefore, what we think we should do is the following. And then they pass a whole lot of things that they think would be appropriate to do in light of what I just said. What stops that?",
  "You concede -- you concede that the Apology Resolution does not say that the Hawaiian people's claims are valid.",
  "Does it say that? Yes or no.",
  "Okay, so if that's so, do you object to a three-sentence pro curiam opinion in this case where we say, to the extent that the Hawaiian Supreme Court could be read to suggest that the Apology Resolution either resolved or cast a cloud, legally speaking, on the title of the trust land, or suggested in any way that land be enjoined -- the sale be enjoined, the Court made a mistake; and insofar as it is resting on State law, that's up to them.",
  "Do you think your draft - -",
  "How could it have done that? I mean, I didn't see anything in here that suggests anything like that. That is to suggest that the Apology Resolution created an obligation on the part of the State courts to enjoin sales until everything was worked out. Now I have read this Apology Resolution about six times, and I certainly didn't see anything like that.",
  "You agree that the Apology Resolution does not say who's right about the claim?",
  "Like what?",
  "What?",
  "If I said that -- just in the opinion -- and said just what you said, and nothing else about the resolution, say we don't see any other way in which the resolution could have supported this, would that -- is that okay with you?",
  "It also, I guess, has a - - there -- in the Admission Resolution, it set up a trust. They hold it in trust, and there are five purposes in the trust, and only one of those relates to the Native Hawaiians. Now, I know from the newspapers -- I don't know the merits of it -- but the trust that has been set up is the subject of controversy continuously. So what I don't see -- and I hope we don't have to get into this -- is what the relation between the trust principles as enacted in the legislature is and the trust principles set forth in the Admissions Resolution. Is there any law going to anything like that?",
  "So what if it isn't? I mean, suppose you had a statute, and the statute says it is a crime to mug a man from Denver. That's a Denver ordinance, by the way, because no one else would pass it. I mean, but if those were the elements of the crime, I guess, we do normally apply knowingly to each of them.",
  "Whether -- even if it isn't ordinary usage.",
  "I was thoughtfully trying to push you on to the next argument.",
  "Well, I think that's what we normally bring into sentencing. I mean, normally, and that we don't impose mandatory. We impose mandatory sentences when the person does something, you know, that's wrong and he knows it is wrong. When harm occurs, and the harm wasn't known or intended, you can take care of it if you are a judge. You increase the sentence. That's the problem.",
  "Well, why not just says \"means of identification,\" then? I mean, it's odd to write a statute that has elements and you put the word \"knowingly,\" and the knowingly is supposed to modify some elements but not others. I can't think of other statutes that do that. There may be some. It's pretty peculiar. You could have left off the last element. I mean, if you are drafting a criminal statute, anyone would know that.",
  "Give me one where what they have done is they have used \"knowingly\" at the beginning, and there are four elements of the crime, and -- I'm not saying there are none, but I would like to know what they are where \"knowingly\" doesn't modify something there is strict liability for.",
  "That's going to be jurisdictional -- probably jurisdictional hooks, like - - there could be -- there could be some. But I don't see -- you tell me.",
  "I could understand your argument if you are saying you cannot tell from the tell simply from the text what the answer is. You can only tell the answer if you say -- know what the answer is if you say Congress had victims in mind, and if we are going to worry about victims, we are not going to worry -- we are going to take a narrow rather than a broad view of \"knowingly.\" If that's your position, you agree that if you simply look at the text of this statute without considering confessional policy, you don't win?",
  "All that is true, and that is actually where I was going. It -- it seems to me where the ambiguity is precisely -- is that none of us doubts, I don't think, that what Congress is after with this extra two-year mandatory is identity theft. And where the argument lies is between did Congress do this by punishing people only who intend to engage in identity theft or people who, while not intending to do so, have that effect. That's the issue.",
  "And I don't thing I can resolve that one way or the other from anything you have said. It is rather hard to say. So, therefore, suppose I use the Rule of Lenity this way, which I am trying out. I am not buying it. In the case of mandatory-minimum sentences, there is a particularly strong argument for a Rule of Lenity with bite. And that is because mandatory minimums, given the human condition, inevitably throw some people into the box who shouldn't be there. And if this person should be there and we put him outside, the judge could give him the same sentence anyway. So the harm by mistakenly throwing a person outside the box through the Rule of Lenity to the government is small. The harm to the individual by wrongly throwing him into the box is great. The Rule of Lenity is, therefore, limited to a very small subset of cases where it has particular force, but this is one of them.",
  "That's why I raised it.",
  "Is -- how many -- how many would you say there are in a typical year, maintenance and cure cases? About, roughly? I mean, say in the late twentieth century, 18 -- 1980, 1990. Have you have any guess at all?",
  "All right.",
  "So how many would you guess?",
  "Uh-huh. And they usually have maintenance and cure aspects.",
  "Can you get punitives under the Jones Act or not?",
  "What about unseaworthiness?",
  "Okay, so if I have about 30 cases -- no, I had, actually, to be honest, I thought we found about 12 in the period around 1980 - 2000 where they do give some punitive damages.",
  "All right. Then I found about 10 cases in the period before the Jones Act where there was something given -- punitive damages being given for something, and there was something sort of like maintenance and cure in there.",
  "Over here, there is one called -- Unica v U.S. The master should have put the -- into the hospital. Given him $1,500. It was partly punitive. Considering -- De Troupe -- I mean, I found some that are sort of -- sort of -- I don't know what to say. I don't know who to make of it.",
  "The Troop gave them $4,000. Considering all the circumstances of the aggravation. Gross neglect, mistreatment. \"It is useless to parade more of the sickening details.\"",
  "Rolf was not a -- Rolf was maintenance and cure and personal injury and unseaworthiness. So we don't know which aspect of the case led to the punitives.",
  "Is it the case that we can't find a single pre-Jones Act case where punitives were awarded and what was sought was maintenance and cure? I -- I found some, but they seem ambiguous to me.",
  "What is your best?",
  "So we have a history all the way back to Catherine of Aragon, and what we've been able to find in these pre-Jones Act cases is really two or three, or maybe I found ten actually, that I couldn't say -- leaning over in your direction, I could take maybe three or four. And they show a little ambiguity. But give them all ten, and that's still ten out of hundreds of years of history.",
  "With attorneys' fees there is a compensatory aspect. The -- the basic obligation is to keep this seaman alive and well, and then you give him some wages if necessary, and you give him medical care. And -- and now he's going to be out that attorneys' fees as a result of his sickness. So I understand that. Punitives does not compensate him for anything. It is a policy matter for the State. He's a beneficiary of a windfall. And it seems a more radical step to make something up out of whole cloth here with punitives than it does with attorneys' fees.",
  "Maybe it would be a good thing.",
  "The -- the problem here is it has pros and cons. I was quite moved by the brief - - the citation that Professor Robertson made of all of those old cases until we looked them up. And -- and then I found they seem to stand for a little bit less than I had the impression they stood for.",
  "So we'd be making this up out of whole cloth, it seems to me.",
  "-- because Miles says don't do that.",
  "What now? As far as I understand, there's a procedural problem. I tried to figure out the Heck line once in Balisok. My impression of it is that if, Mr. Prisoner, you're bringing an action challenging some confinement or the effect of your action is going to be to let you go out of solitary or out of prison, then proceed your habeas. But if what you're trying to get is relief that may or may not mean you get out of solitary or you get out of prison, then you go to 1983. But, by the way, if you're in 1983 you are complaining about an action or inaction by a State official that violates a constitutional right. Now, as I look at this case the prisoner, if he wins, is not going to get out, and he is complaining about the State violating a constitutional right by refusing to give him DNA. It seems to me that second question is the question that's the heart of the case: Does the State have a constitutional obligation to give him the DNA? So I would appreciate your telling me why it doesn't.",
  "Is there any reason to think that if, in fact -- sorry.",
  "I know your time is up, but I really have only one question this morning and I would like to have a chance to ask it, and I am trying to clear away some undergrowth. And the undergrowth first I have cleared away in my mind is this Heck question. The second is the Alaska court decision. And my impression is that Alaska refused the test because, among other things, they couldn't say -- they said the conviction rested primarily on eyewitness testimony, and they have a bunch of reasons. But the Ninth Circuit, as a matter of fact, tried to blow apart those reasons. Okay? Suppose I agree with the Ninth Circuit. Then my question is this: Does the Constitution of the United States require you to give this evidence to the defendant? And one of the relevant points in my mind is I see it would be of significant advantage to the defendant. Even if he's guilty, he can be proved to - - whatever. It is an advantage to him. Okay? Now, why don't you want to give it to him?",
  "I -- I -- there I -- that's the undergrowth I tried to clear away. I am saying I read all that procedure. Suppose I believe that the Ninth Circuit is right about that procedure, namely that the tests that they're using in that procedure are not favorable enough to a defendant who is seeking, as this defendant is seeking, the DNA. He just wants some DNA. He'll pay for it. The odds are eight to one he's going to lose. But he thinks: I'm willing to run those odds. I won't put you at any trouble. Now, why don't you want to give it to him? Because, Your Honor, the State of Alaska has a procedure that would enable him to obtain that evidence.",
  "No. The procedure has the tests in it that the Alaska court -- didn't the Alaska Supreme Court say, we will not give you DNA evidence unless you can demonstrate: One, that the conviction rested primarily on eyewitness ID evidence; two, that there was a demonstrable doubt concerning his ID as the perpetrator; and, three, that scientific testing would likely would be conclusive. Wasn't that their test?",
  "And then -- are different -- then they'd give it to him?",
  "In other words, all he has to do is file a new piece of paper tomorrow, and he gets the DNA?",
  "Okay.",
  "And is it true that all he has to do is file a piece of paper in the court that says: Whatever I said before, I did it under pressure; I am innocent. And if he says those words, \"I am innocent,\" then he will get this DNA?",
  "Why can't you do this? Look at the consensus of the statutes in the States and the Federal Government and say there's a range of appreciation here, and there is a right but it catches only the outliers? And so, the worst that would happen is that the outlying States would have to bring themselves into conformity with the outer reaches of whatever the set of statutes is now in all the other States.",
  "I'm not saying every instance in which there are outliers is unconstitutional. I'm just saying in this instance for other reasons it might be unconstitutional; namely, you have a good way of proving guilty or innocence, and if that's so, the practical problem is not great. You solve the practical problem in the way I just mentioned.",
  "So the constitutional right is bring yourself within any one of them, unless that any one of them is a real outlier, which you can make as an argument that you will never win?",
  "Well, he just - -",
  "Well, why isn't that the end of this case, because I heard opposing counsel say if you go tomorrow and file a piece of paper and swear on that piece of paper you're innocent, Alaska will give you the DNA. Isn't that what he said? I heard him say that, I thought.",
  "Well, if he said it in this Court in answer to a question, I don't see why that isn't binding.",
  "Well, wait. What I heard was that if your client files a piece of paper that says, I am innocent, then under this new procedure, which apparently I hadn't read about because I didn't find it or it wasn't obvious in the brief, that then they will give him the DNA. Now that's either right or it's wrong; and if it's right, I think that's the end of it, and if it's wrong, well, then we'll have to proceed. But I would proceed on the basis that this swearing requirement is not sufficient.",
  "Could you say this -- could you say, suppose -- I'm just testing this out -- that like any other governmental action, this action of refusing the DNA evidence is subject to the Fourteenth Amendment's requirement that there be a reasonable basis? Can't be arbitrary. Now, withholding DNA is a governmental action, and so you cannot do so arbitrarily. If you were to do so simply because the defendant would not sign a new complaint under this new procedure, which I somehow missed in the reply brief, that's a good basis for withholding it. He should be willing to do that. If the reason they won't give him the DNA is because before the parole board he said he was innocent, that, to me -- not to others but to me -- that would mean nothing. Of course, he's going to say he's innocent. He doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison. Okay? So, I -- I would say, but not maybe others would say, that if that's their reason for not giving it, I'd hear further argument, but that would be arbitrary. But if their reason for not giving it is just because he won't file a new piece of paper in which he says he's innocent or there's nothing to lose there, then I think the State's being arbitrary. Okay? Suppose we said that: The rule is non-arbitrary with illustrations, send it back to the States. And of course when they apply their own statutes, by and large they're not being arbitrary.",
  "Well, it does help you win.",
  "Yes.",
  "We would like to know what you do - -",
  "Okay. This is where I - - look. He files a new piece of paper. Now, if you're going to oppose that, on the ground that it wasn't procedurally correct, one; on the ground, two, he didn't ask for this DNA at trial, though he might have met with the charge, what was at issue at trial is something very different; three, that he wasn't guilty -- you know, too much evidence against him, met with the claim, there wasn't much evidence against him -- okay, we have the case in front of us; we'll decide it. But if you're prepared to concede \"I'm not going to raise those things,\" then their client has what he wants -- the DNA. So which is it?",
  "I'm going to just repeat it. He -- His client follows your procedure. \"Please give me DNA.\" Now will you give it to him? Or are you going to meet him with the same defenses that you raise here?",
  "Wrong procedure. You ask -- you could have gotten it at trial, which he says isn't true, and there was too much evidence, which he says isn't true. Okay? So what are we going to have, Mr. Rosenstein?",
  "If the only defense is procedure - -",
  "What are the instances in which somebody who is not a signatory might seem to have a right to enforce it? I can think of one. Suppose he's a third-party beneficiary of the contract. Are there others?",
  "What?",
  "Okay.",
  "I mean, which one applies here?",
  "Estoppel? I don't understand estoppel.",
  "I know what estoppel is in the law.",
  "I know, but I haven't unfortunately had a chance to read all the practice treatises. So could you explain to me quite simply what is the theory of equitable estoppel that allows someone who is not a signatory to an arbitration contract to have it enforced?",
  "In other words, whenever I sign a contract with anybody -- I sign one with Smith, I ask him to buy some wheat, I sell him some wheat, and there's an arbitration clause. And now I sue all kinds of other people, and the contract is part of the lawsuit. Are there many cases like that? Maybe it was a shipper, or something, who they sent the contract to, and he had to figure out what to do on the basis of the contract. Or maybe there was a cousin who told me to go to see Smith in the first place. Maybe -- I don't know. There are a lot of people. So, now all those people have to go to arbitration? Because you're saying whenever I go in and have a contract with X and there's an arbitration clause, then in any future lawsuit where I sue anybody and that contract is an essential part of it, the breach thereof, he could put me in arbitration. Boy, that sounds extreme. I mean, I guess there are -- there'd have to be several treatises on this, but it doesn't sound intuitively sensible.",
  "Oh, okay. That's all I wanted to know is what's the theory in this case.",
  "If that's the theory, I - - unless I think it always applies, I could just say I don't have to decide about a third-party beneficiary.",
  "I just have to decide whether you can enforce it. Now -- so you'd better say some other things.",
  "I wouldn't have asked my question if you hadn't said we have to go beyond the question whether they had jurisdiction and answer the merits, which is whether you can in fact enforce it.",
  "Now you're saying, no, we don't.",
  "I could just rely on my third-party beneficiary example?",
  "Well, I thought the first issue -- I never got past the first issue.",
  "And the first issue was, does he have a right to appeal? And I read the statute, and to me section 16 says yes. He asked for a stay. It was denied, and it says an appeal may be taken from an order refusing a stay. So there's an order refusing a stay; he appealed. Why can't he appeal?",
  "Is there any -- is there any other example in the law -- I can't think of one - - where you say this party has so silly an argument, which is really what you're saying - -",
  "-- that we don't even let him appeal.",
  "It seems to me I've gotten a lot of appeals where the appeal, I don't think, is too meritorious, but nonetheless I never heard of saying you can't appeal.",
  "As to that, if you did that, I got your first point. I understand it. I agree with it. As to the second point, you say -- I was surprised because I hadn't quite taken that in -- that we are now supposed to reach what we would call the merits of the appeal. Now, there you just heard your co-counsel say: Look, you don't have to decide whether my equitable theory is good or not. You haven't read the treatises, I have; which is a fair comment. And - - and all I want you to say is that sometimes, at least, a third party could enforce a contract to arbitration that two others make. The statute doesn't say he can't. The statute doesn't say he has to be the one who signed it. And if you think of a third party beneficiary or an assignment, for example, you would think, of course, there are other people, say an assignee, who could enforce it.",
  "Your proper -- I see this is actually a pretty difficult question to me, and - - because it seems to me sometimes they have to be able to enforce it, the assignee, the third party beneficiary.",
  "And now what I don't know, is what they're doing, it's true that section 3 and all the other sections, they talk about the agreement, but they don't say that the individual who is asking for the stay has to be the same person who signed it, as they couldn't. So how do we know which among all the possible people in the case who hasn't signed it should and should not be able to enforce it? Their argument is look to State law, okay? And your argument is derive some principles yourself. Really.",
  "And so, so -- is it possible to answer this case by saying he's wrong in thinking you always look to State law. It may depend on what the State law says. So that's the answer to the question. You should have had your appeal. Go appeal, and let the courts below work that out first, knowing that the State law is relevant but not always determinative. Then we'll get some -- we'll get some case law on this and we'll be in a better position to figure out what the right answer is.",
  "Well, you see it's a little hard. I can imagine a case where they're sitting in the room drawing up the contract, they put it in the arbitration agreement. There are four other people directly related to the room. The parties look around and say, hey, we have arbitration here, I hope everybody understands everybody is going to have to do this. And they all say, okay, don't worry about it. Now, I would say, hey, maybe they're estopped. And there they're going right through the contract.",
  "So I hate to write the words \"equitable estoppel is never relevant.\" I would rather write the words \"I'm uncertain State law is relevant policy.\" You know, it's not true that it's always relevant.",
  "What would you think about saying that some parties -- some parties to the case who are not parties to the contract can as third parties, nonetheless, enforce arbitration? We have listed a few examples, assignees, et cetera. When considering whether this is one of them, judge, the key question - - we can tell you what the key question is and what it isn't. What it is has to do with the intent of the persons who did sign the contract.",
  "Something related to that. We don't have to be specific.",
  "What it isn't is a case management device. Because what I think the temptation would be for the judge is to -- is to -- let's send them all off to arbitration if we can, and then I would not have to worry about this case for a while. And come back, and I'll figure it out.",
  "So is that -- is that right, or is it wrong? What's your insight or guess on that?",
  "I'm just looking for ways of separating these sheep from goats.",
  "But that isn't the only theory. That is, in my own mind -- I don't know if you want to call it \"probability\" or \"possibility,\" you don't manacle a defendant in a courtroom even though this jury may not have been affected. I read the opinion Justice Benjamin wrote, it was a very good opinion. I sympathized with his problem. Okay? So I'm not talking about him. I'm talking about we don't manacle defendants because many jurors, maybe not this one, would have been adding affected, and that seems the problem here. The debt of gratitude I think, no, that isn't the theory that underlies it, though it may in part. It's that you have here the largest amount by a factor, an order of magnitude perhaps, I mean hugely greater than any other contribution given to a judge by a single person. It doesn't just affect the fast through gratitude. A normal human being also thinks, if I play my cards right, maybe it will be repeated, and they'll want to keep me in office. And we have the fact of how it looks, and we don't have a situation where the something like this is inevitable, where you appoint judges. It's inevitable that there will be an appointment. I mean, hey, but that isn't true of sitting on this kind of case. So we have all those things that make it extreme. So what is the problem? If we say there is an envelope that the Due Process Clause doesn't touch, and that envelope is greater, and we touch less, if the States are regulating it themselves. Where they're not -- and this is way outside the envelope -- at that point the Due Process Clause comes into play. Now, end of opinion. Now, what terrible mess will the Court get into if they write just that?",
  "A logical principle or, I thought, if I was mentioning all those things that might lead a judge in the future, because of the size, in the past, because of the size, in the fact that it's a single individual, in the fact that there's a case coming up that's likely that the judge will decide - - all those things that are listed by the chief justices in their brief, all those things together make it a serious risk that there will be bias, even though an individual might not be. There is a serious risk. Call it a \"probability\"; call it an \"appearance.\" Use the language that you want, but put them together, and they spell \"mother.\"",
  "Don't you understand what I mean? I'm not worried about what you call \"probability\" --",
  "Why are you going through all this sort of parsing, I mean, looking at the legislative history as well as the statute in 1970? What is your answer to the last point that they made, that what Congress wanted to do was to make simple possession a misdemeanor, that's why they changed the word, which -- \"offense\" to \"felony.\" That's why they changed the word \"felony\" to \"misdemeanor.\" And I can't imagine why else they amended the statute, and just because I was curious I looked it up, and that's why they amended it, right. So -- so the legislative history makes that clear. So what you've done is figure out a way - - the government's figured out a way to do the opposite of what they want, to take people who simply possess and transform it into a felony. Now, what justification is there in the law for doing that?",
  "As to the first, I said subset. I didn't say you undermined the entire statute. I said you took a subset of people who simply possessed and that subset you transformed into felons. Now, your response I guess is just what you said.",
  "-- second.",
  "Is there another example in the law, anywhere in the law, where -- and there may be, I'm asking -- which you've come across, where we have an illegal business and there is a customer; and all the customer does is be a customer; and is there an example where just because he's a customer in a statutory provision that normally has a lesser penalty -- all right; imagine those circumstances -- you still can punish him as if he -- as if he ran the business?",
  "I'm not aware, and why should this be the first?",
  "The way they're a customer -- the way they're a customer is they use the telephone, and I guess one side thinks that's not a big deal, and the other side thinks that, anyway, in terms of what Congress thought, it's a tremendously big deal because Congress was really worried about telephones. Okay, that's possible. So can you get a parallel that's like that?",
  "What one comes to mind?",
  "That's jurisdictional. What I'm looking for is there's a business and a customer, the statute punishes the business worse than the customer. Now, we get the customer as if he were a business participant. That's what I'm looking for, where it's the way he does it -- i.e., whether he uses a telephone or whether he uses a telegram or semaphore signals or -- where the -- where the means of communication here or something like that suddenly transform him? Anything else that comes to mind? I didn't expect there to be, but I just thought maybe you would think of an analogy, which would be helpful.",
  "Well, what about the legislative history? Because I would read it -- and in fact what it seems to me that you're suggesting, when you read the statute, is using a telephone is -- because Justice Kennedy came up with a good example of what I was thinking of. If the buyer sits there with a gun, well, that's different, he shouldn't have the gun, and it's not surprising that he gets a higher sentence. And you're saying by reading the text you've discovered Congress thinks that cell phones are sort of like guns. Okay. I grant you somebody might have thought that. Justice Souter thinks it's not intuitively obvious, but is there any legislative history that suggests that that indeed is what people in Congress thought when they passed this statute? I'll read it if there is.",
  "And what should I read and where exactly - -",
  "Normally, where that is involved, I've learned, it's called what Justice Scalia called it \"a jurisdictional hook.\" They don't think the underlying behavior is worse, but they believe there has to be a basis and should be a basis for federal prosecution. I started out where he was. I thought this is just a jurisdictional hook, but now you say no, it isn't; it's much worse than that. It's like carrying a gun, not quite as bad as that, but on that -- in that direction. So I'm asking you what would I read in this history to show that what you're claiming is right?",
  "And that's what -- you've cited that in the brief so I can find it?",
  "Why? I can't get anywhere with the language, to tell you the truth. I could read it either way. It -- the House language is the same. The person \"discharges,\" yeah, but what if he discharges it accidentally? Is the accidental case or unintended case meant to be covered or not meant to be covered?",
  "And you don't get anywhere -- I just can't get anywhere with the language. The reason they put the \"is discharged\" is probably for parallelism. It was a drafting section in the Senate, and they do their job in a stylistic way. I found nothing that suggests anything other than that. So -- so where am I? Sometimes a person who discharges the weapon accidentally is really much worse than the one who does it purposely. Purposely, he shoots at the ceiling; accidentally, he kills a person dead; okay? So I mean, I can't get too far with that. So where -- so there we are. Is there anything else -- there is the post problem that the Chief Justice mentioned. Is there anything else you can say to me, who really doesn't see it one way or the other way in this statute?",
  "Would you say, look, this is why you win?",
  "Why -- why do you think that? I mean, it is absolutely true that a person who is a bank robber and has a gun and has already shown it, and it goes off accidentally is, is -- has caused a tremendous harm in certain cases, which traditionally has been thought meriting a higher sentence. And it is also true that he doesn't have the same state of mind as the one who does it purposely. That is true, too. Both are true. And so now what should I do? I know what you want me to do, but why?",
  "It's in relation to the -- I mean, you know, in a sense it is, in a sense it isn't; same problem.",
  "He sees a duck fly by the window and he's a hunter.",
  "There is another - -",
  "What would you think -- to go back to Justice Stevens' question, I would start with the assumption that, normally, not always, where you have a criminal statute and the crime has elements, that Congress intends that the elements be carried out with a guilty state of mind; I would start with that assumption. Now I would agree with you that sentencing is different, and the reason that it's different is because sentencing often goes up or down depending upon whether the harm that is foreseen does or does not occur, irrespective of the state of mind. So we couldn't apply that normal background rule, in my view.",
  "Now -- now, having done that I wonder if the background rule should come into play once again where a mandatory minimum sentence is at stake, for the reason that if the harm eventuates, there are many ways in which the sentence will go up. If this person had been killed, for example, it becomes a murder in the course of a felony. There are all kinds of other statutes that can aggravate the felony; and if you don't apply the mandatory minimum, the judge still can give him the higher sentence, if he warrants it. But if you apply the mandatory minimum where the judge wouldn't go up, the only impact that has is to take people who the judge and others think fall into the minimal category of bad behavior plus consequences, and force them to have a higher sentence. Now, that would be a rationale for a rule of lenity in mandatory minimum sentencing matters.",
  "Yes, it would. It would.",
  "No, I can't -- I can't - - the trouble is I can't find anything in the history of this that really says why they use \"is discharged\" or used \"as opposed to discharges.\" And I find those very metaphysical, those arguments, unless I -- I can see either something in the history or some functional consideration.",
  "\"Carries,\" what about \"carries\"? If a person is carrying the gun in his pocket but he doesn't know it, which could happen, does that fall within \"carries\" or not?",
  "So is he guilty of the first; do we know?",
  "The carrying has to be - - although the statute doesn't say it, Smith says the carrying has to be in relation to the crime.",
  "I thought it just said \"who in furtherance of any such crime possesses a firearm.\"",
  "No, it's a \"carrying.\" My -- my interest is the -- whoever, blah, blah, blah, for which the person may be prosecuted uses or carries a firearm, or who in furtherance of any such crime possesses a firearm. So I thought that the \"in furtherance\" does not modify \"carry\".",
  "Okay.",
  "So, you know, what happens if the person has the firearm -- he is carrying the firearm in his pocket and doesn't know it? He picked it up from the tailor, and now is -- is there an intent requirement there? Do we know? Did Smith talk about that? Do we know? I mean is there, you know, a state of mind requirement?",
  "Smith says \"in relation to\" and so the carrying has to be in relation to. And since the carrying has to be in relation to, that pretty much --",
  "-- covers the state of mind.",
  "I think I got everybody mixed up, because the first sentence of the statute is on the preceding page. And if I start at the beginning, I would discover -- of my memo -- if -- it says, if - - in -- who -- any person who during and in relation - - during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, blah, blah, blah, of a certain kind uses or carries a firearm.",
  "So there it is right there, or who in furtherance of such a crime possesses shall be sentenced. Okay. So we've got the during and in relation to covering the whole bunch. Then we have to read that into little (ii) and little (iii).",
  "Yes, exactly.",
  "Then we have to read that by implication where it says if the firearm is brandished during or -- you have to imply that.",
  "Yeah, that's not your argument?",
  "Forget it.",
  "Is that helping? I mean, this did take place during, and you would have thought when something goes off accidentally it's in relation to. I mean, you know, I can imagine an argument to the contrary, but it isn't obvious. It just is - -",
  "They have during, in relation to and in furtherance of, so their in furtherance of doesn't carry over. The first two do. An accidental discharge is it not in relation to the crime?",
  "It's an obvious question, I guess. I would just like to hear your answer directly. Case 1, count 1, selling drugs; count 2, using the telephone to sell the drugs. All right? The jury acquits of the first, convicts of the second. Logically impossible, but permitted under the law, right?",
  "Okay. Case 2 - -",
  "Okay. Absolutely illogical. Case 2, there is no count 1. Case 2, telephone count, hung jury; we retry it. Permitted, right?",
  "All that happened was that they hung.",
  "Okay. Case 2, hung jury, telephone count; we retry it. All right. So now why is it when we put them together and, case 3, count 1, substantive drugs, acquitted; count 2, telephone, hung jury. Well, in case 2 we could get a retrial of the telephone count. Why can't we get a retrial of the telephone count now?",
  "All that happened is they are retrying it just as they did in case 2. Why does the presence of count 1 there mean that they can't retry it?",
  "I -- I'm going too fast because you didn't take the cases in. Do you want me to repeat them? Maybe it's too complicated. I'm just saying case 1, count 1, the substantive count, conviction. On count 2, telephone count, acquittal. Everybody agrees that's permissible. Case 2 is only the telephone. That's all they indicted him for. And if they have a hung jury, you can, can't you, retry him?",
  "So, now, when we have case 3, which is the same as case 1 except that, instead of convicting him, they had a hung jury, why can't you retry him, just as you could in case 2?",
  "Oh, everybody agrees it resolves nothing, and that's why you could retry him in -- that's why you could retry him in case 2, because it resolves nothing. So if you could retry him in case 2, why can't you retry him in case 3? What does the presence of this other substantive count have to do with it. Since it never would have blocked the conviction on count 2, why does it stop you from retrying count 2? It would never have blocked the conviction of count 2. Why does it stop you from retrying it? Do you see -- do you see my - -",
  "That's the logical point I thought the other side was making, and maybe they're not because it seems to be striking you as surprising or maybe I'm not making it in a clear way. But what I wanted was a clear answer to it.",
  "And why not? Because the answer to my question was exactly what Justice Stevens said. Why is it that -- that if you could have the inconsistent verdicts in Powell, well, then, why can't, since they hung, couldn't you try him again on the hung count? And the answer is, because you're trying him again. And that's why we have all the briefs that we have, because the only way to answer this is to look and see if the policies that underlie the collateral estoppel part of double jeopardy apply here. And I can't think of one that doesn't. I can't think of one single one that wouldn't apply. Maybe there are some. And I can't think of any reason for allowing the government to have a second bite at this apple. What is the reason?",
  "Of course they don't. Of course they don't. Suppose that they never brought up that hung count. Then you wouldn't even have the first bite at the apple. So you would think it would be a fortiori you could go ahead. But that's the case; you clearly can't go ahead.",
  "I didn't think it had anything to do with integrity of anything. I thought what it had to do with is that they are being tried at the same time. And to test that out in my mind, I imagine this. In February we try the individual for the drug count, he's acquitted. In June we bring a telephone count. Absolutely forbidden, right?",
  "Okay. So why should the government be one whit better off because, in addition to doing that, they happened to bring a telephone count in January along with the other?",
  "Start the other side, which I think Justice Stevens was suggesting. Assume that there was only one trial on the substantive count in January. Now each -- he's acquitted. Now you decide to indict him in July on the telephone count. You argue to the judge: Judge, there shouldn't be double jeopardy here because maybe the jury just acquitted him the first time because they were lenient. Maybe they liked his looks. Maybe they were distracted by a fly. Maybe they were, maybe they were -- and we didn't even get an appeal. Are you going to win that case?",
  "No, not even a close. Okay. Not even close. Now, since you're going to lose that case, I grant you there's thousands of case talking about your ability to bring more cases if you have a hung jury. I concede all those. None of them talks about double jeopardy, to my knowledge. So we're back to the hypothetical. You've lost your case. Now, all that you did to turn that case into a winning case was you also indicted him on the telephone count in January. Now, that was my question the first time, and you began to have two answers. I just didn't see why the government should be any better off because they also indicted him in January. Given the language \"double jeopardy,\" you might think the government, if anything, should be worse off, but let's keep them neutral. So what is the reason that the government should be worse off because they indicted him in January on the telephone count as well as in June?",
  "No, no -- better. I misspoke.",
  "You have answered Justice Souter. I took your answer to be the following: That if the corporation had paid -- paid for a program and the program was 90 minutes which said vote for Smith, vote for Smith over and over -- that's the program - - that you concede that the government could ban this under the Act.",
  "I don't think they would. We agree. It's an imaginary hypothetical. But, in fact, if they did have 90 minutes of vote for Smith or vote against Jones, you concede for purposes of this argument that the government can ban it. Is that bright or not?",
  "Okay, okay. So one of your arguments is this is a special corporation. You can't. Now suppose it's General Motors. Can they?",
  "I would just like to get -- I want to get an answer to the question.",
  "Okay. Now, in my question that I'm driving towards is: Since General Motors can in your view be forbidden to have our film of 90 minutes vote for Smith, vote for Smith, vote for Smith, or vote against Jones, vote against Jones, vote against Jones, how is this film, which I saw -- it is not a musical comedy. What - -",
  "What -- how does this film vary from my example, and why does the variance make a difference?",
  "I want to get the answer to what I was asking.",
  "No, that isn't -- that isn't the suggestion. The suggestion I was going to, or trying to get to, is we know you can't just say vote against Smith, vote against Smith, vote against Smith. Now, I wanted to know the difference between that and a film that picks out bad things that people did -- no good ones, just bad ones the candidate did. And then we have another film that picks out just good things candidates do. And so candidates run films that show the good things they do, and then someone else shows the bad things they do. Now, why is that not the same as vote against Smith? Though I grant you, it's more intelligent. It's more informative. It's even better electioneering. So we're after electioneering. Why doesn't that fall within the forbidden category?",
  "I -- I guess it's the same as if you were to say, you know, I think Smith is a great guy. That's all. I'm sharing information. And what I don't see is if you agree that we could ban the commercial that says, I see Smith is a great guy, why is it any different to supplement that with the five best things that Smith ever did?",
  "I wonder if that's -- I mean, I take it the answer to the question, can the government ban labor unions from saying we love this person, the corporations, we love them, the environmentalists saying we love them, is of course the government can't ban that. The only question is, who's paying for it. And they can make a determination of how much money the payors can pay, but you can't ban it.",
  "All right. If that's correct, then I take it the interesting question here would be -- I don't know if it arises in this case - - suppose there were a kind of campaign literature or - - or advocacy that either a corporation had to pay for it, it couldn't pay for it through the PAC, because for some reason -- I don't know, the PAC -- and there's no other way of getting it to the public -- that would raise a Constitutional question, wouldn't it?",
  "Is that present in this case?",
  "I don't know about that. But I guess I would be worried if in fact there was some material that couldn't get through to the public. I would be very worried. But I don't think I have to worry about that in this case, do I?",
  "I agree with you about that, but I thought what saves this -- many people thought it doesn't save it, it's -- whole thing's unconstitutional, whole Act. That isn't what I thought. So what saves this is of course you can't prohibit all those things. What you do is put limitations on the payment for them. See that there are other ways of paying through it, say as PACs, and then limit very carefully the media that are affected and the times for which they are affected. Now, that's the statute reforms, and it's I think you need to address.",
  "But suppose -- suppose that the problem was a professional soldier convicted a certain number of years ago of a particular crime, a few years later through some amazing mistake they wrote the wrong number down. The clerk just wrote the wrong number of the code provision. That's all.",
  "And it made it a felony instead. It was actually a misdemeanor. What's he supposed to do? I mean, normally you go back to the Court and say: Judge, you know, they just made - - everyone admits it's a simple transcribing error. Would you please correct it? Now, how -- how is that supposed to work in the military?",
  "Yes. No, he's -- he's finished his sentence. This is several years ago. They just now discovered it, and it could affect him in the future that it happened in fact to be a misdemeanor he was convicted of. But the -- the code section they wrote down is a felony.",
  "Yes. Yes, that's right.",
  "No, this is 7 years.",
  "He can't even do that. So nobody in the military, in fact, once their thing is final -- then it has nothing to do with it, in your view, that he has left the military?",
  "You are saying -- you are saying, whether you are in the military, whether you are out of the military, no matter how egregious, no matter how obvious, there is no route for a military person, a professional, to go and get an obvious error corrected if -- if he has missed the statute, that there was an - - the civil statute of limitations, it's hard for him to go to the Tucker Act. He's been in the Philippines the entire time.",
  "Yes, it happened. It really happened.",
  "What I'm trying to do is suggest that I think you -- I can't quite decide what stool you want to rest on. Part of this you say, well, he's a civilian that has left the military. And then I read that. It seems to have nothing to do with it. But your other argument seems to be that doesn't matter.",
  "No military soldier can correct an error, no matter how egregious, even a technical -- you know, they just wrote the wrong thing down, because Congress didn't want them to. Now, I doubt that Congress thought about that. I'm just not sure they didn't want them to.",
  "Well, if that's so, then I guess you can have courts reviewing the civilians. They will review after the event the court-martial jurisdiction, the court-martials of people while they were in the military. That will become a matter of course anytime. I mean, there are many, many errors. We have approximately 5,000 petitions a year claiming some kind of constitutional error, and sometime they're right.",
  "So that's what you foresee?",
  "What way is it no?",
  "Why -- in other words, in the case I posed, he would -- he -- in your view, he wouldn't have any remedy, you would agree with the government about that, if it's seven years later you find a clerical error?",
  "Well, if, in fact, you're waiting until the -- the civil courts have lost all jurisdiction because the statute of limitations has expired, why do you need this? Why can't they just go -- I mean, why do you need this special thing that hasn't existed for 200 years? Why don't they just go to a civil case? And moreover, why doesn't your client fall within that situation? You're claiming that if all the statutes have run and everything, there is no coram nobis jurisdiction, I thought in your case they had all run.",
  "Then you're saying that what you're foreseeing is through coram nobis, indefinitely, a person outside the military who once was in it can bring constitutional challenges?",
  "Yes, okay, and we see those every day, don't we? But there is one difference. The difference is that often, though not always, a person in habeas who challenges a prior normal, civil system conviction, the State can retry him; and I guess in the instance that we're talking about, he can never be retried. So in fact the difference would be, in your view, the civilians who bring this would never be retried if they're right.",
  "And so they would have in that sense greater protection in the military system than in the ordinary criminal courts a person has in habeas, because the option of retrial is often but not always there. Now, why would Congress have intended that?",
  "I think you have a good answer to what my question was. I thought that was a good answer. It's helping me. And -- but where I'm slightly -- and maybe this is just not relevant to this case or maybe it's for the future. Coram nobis, I thought, was a writ that means really like technical clerical errors or something really unusual. Is this -- I mean, it's hardly ever there. I've not really seen more than a handful of cases. So -- so is this writ supposed to be available for what you're claiming is what I call a typical error of inadequate representation? And I don't know the answer to that question, but I think it's - - maybe you could say that's not presented. Maybe that's for a later case. I don't know how to treat it. That's why I'm asking.",
  "I knew it was.",
  "I thought it might be your answer: Well, that isn't raised. And that would be a perfectly good answer.",
  "I'm telling you my honest problem which I'm trying to think through: Where are we going with this?",
  "What's going to happen one way or the other way? That's why I asked the question. So all I'm asking is your best thought on it.",
  "What is the theory of the jurisdiction of the military court in the circumstance where the individual is still in the military, he's been convicted, and he is in custody? So he wants to get out of custody. Now, what's the theory of that? He can -- I take it it's accepted, is it, that they can, that such a person can ask the military justice system -- I don't know which court -- for release on the ground that he didn't -- wasn't adequately represented or some other ground?",
  "All right. It's a habeas case. Now, do you have -- can you do that in the military?",
  "And what's the theory of the jurisdiction that the military courts have over that?",
  "Aiding what jurisdiction?",
  "But they've already directly reviewed it.",
  "So there is no more direct review to be had?",
  "So how does this aid the direct review that is to be had, since there is none?",
  "I see.",
  "I don't think there's a notice question. I thought there were 5,538 plaintiffs here and -- that you represent, and every one of them has already gotten money from the trust except for two who have filed claims against it. So I imagine if that's so, they certainly know about it.",
  "Okay, so there is no notice problem. If there were a notice problem I guess there would be a due process problem. So, I don't see what notice has any more to do with this than the NCAA tournament.",
  "Well, in the original confirmation there are problems in asbestos cases, like other bankruptcy cases, of giving people notice. Bankrupt people often give notice to many who aren't there. And I don't know that -- maybe there is a constitutional problem with some of them, but I would have thought jurisdiction under the statute is clear.",
  "What is -- is this about notice?",
  "I didn't think so. I thought this was about the case of the meaning of the words in the statute that they have authority in the bankruptcy court to issue any order, process or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the title. And we've said that the test is whether the outcome of the proceeding -- this is the other State proceeding -- could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy. So, as I understood it, that's the test.",
  "That's what -- that's what this Court said. Now, they may be few and far between, an order like this, but where there are special reasons for it -- suppose it's a pension fund and you want to reorganize the company and this is the employees' - - they're -- the employees' pension fund's worried about claims which are related directly. Or suppose it's an officer, or suppose it's a worker, and to reorganize the company you must cut the claims off. And otherwise, it is down the drain for everyone, no more money in the fund, no more jobs for the employees. Now, what is it here that would say there is no special circumstance such that a bankruptcy judge can ever do it, no matter what?",
  "Is what you are saying also true of the various other asbestos cases that have, I think, done this?",
  "Well, of course, this has enormous practical impact on the debtor. If not him - - not this one, because it's already a done deal -- you will never get insurance companies - -",
  "-- to go into this kind of thing if they are going to be sued for the very act of helping the debtor defend the asbestos cases. And so, I can't imagine an insurance company in its right mind going into that when in fact all these suits are still open. That presumably is why the bankruptcy judge cut it off.",
  "Why does it say -- it doesn't say that. What it says in the release is it says: We are releasing or everybody is enjoined from bringing a suit for policy claims against Travelers, and a policy claim is any and all claims based upon, arising out of, or relating to any insurance policy. And then the bankruptcy judge, in thousands of findings, I guess, said that your lawsuits do relate to the relevant insurance policies. Indeed, the claims are based upon the joint -- the obligation of Travelers to defend those very policies, given the obligation to defend Johns-Manville. So the relation is exceedingly close, and the language covers it, and there are thousands of pages of findings, I guess, that show that.",
  "In your view, if Smith has a 2 or $4 billion claim against company X and the pension fund together, company X is in bankruptcy, and so the judge says: \"I want to enjoin this claim, we will settle it,\" you know, but the pension fund - - doesn't -- doesn't the bankruptcy judge -- if in fact without the pension fund you couldn't reorganize, wouldn't the bankruptcy judge have authority to cut off the claim against the pension fund? It's a question of whether the company goes down the drain or whether it doesn't. And - -",
  "-- the pension fund is all mixed up in this together.",
  "No, there is nothing here in indemnity.",
  "And that would be true of all the workforce and they have claims against the individual members of the workforce? They have -- it seems to me it would be an unusual case, I agree with you on that, but to say never -- to say never is what is bothering me.",
  "Well, why not -- because there is a good constitutional protection; it's called the due process clause. If the bankruptcy judge goes too far, it's a due process violation.",
  "Well, there's language, broad language.",
  "Broad language.",
  "Who stated it? Who stated that? I mean, when I -- I read what the judge said at the time. I've read language of the order, and I haven't found there anything that said that. What it talked about was policies that were seriously intertwined with the liability of Manville.",
  "Is this the confirmation order?",
  "That's different. Okay. So the confirmation order - -",
  "But there's another piece of paper called \"the insurance settlement order,\" which says that the confirmation order and all these other definitions and the injunction just refer to derivative liability?",
  "Yes or no?",
  "Yes?",
  "No? Okay. All right.",
  "Well, then I don't see what has to do with it.",
  "All right. That's a different definition than the definition of \"policy claims\" in the injunction, presumably.",
  "All right. I have a confirmation order, an injunction. It defines \"policy claims\" in both as a lawsuit relating to any or all of the insurance policies.",
  "And your other piece of paper says what?",
  "You go on. Don't worry. I'll look it up.",
  "Is there anything you want to say about the practical thing I have in the back of my mind which may be false? That language permits your position, but it certainly has rarely been implemented, if ever. And I see that, but in the back of my mind is the fact that if we start mucking around and give narrow meanings to these things now, there are going to be hundreds of thousands of people who won't get compensated who have asbestos - -",
  "Is that true?",
  "Is there anything to back that up?",
  "I said that.",
  "Would you - -",
  "Would you think you should have the burden in the following situation? At 10:00 o'clock on March 21st the employer says: I am going to get rid of Smith because he's too old.",
  "That's it. Writes out the letter, \"Good-Bye, Smith.\" An hour later someone walks into the employer's office and says: \"I've discovered that Smith was just convicted of larceny.\" All right? Now, he already fired Smith because he was too old. But I take it he can make the defense: Well, Smith would have been fired anyway; that isn't the reason I fired him, but he would have been fired anyway, and he can get off. But he should make that defense, shouldn't he?",
  "Fine. So the answer is yes?",
  "All right. So now we have the same situation, but the jury has said this bad reason, his age, was a motivating factor.",
  "To me -- it didn't say played a role.",
  "Well, what it says in this instruction that I have -- I don't see the other one - -",
  "Well, I have on page 7 of the -- of appellant's brief that the instruction was \"the plaintiff's age was a motivating factor in defendant's decision.\"",
  "Now when I read that, I think - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Fine, okay, all right, fine.",
  "Perfect, perfect. I didn't want to complicate it, but that may work in your favor to complicate it, and I want to be fair.",
  "Fine. It played a part. It did have a role: Age motivated in part. Now why isn't that the end of the matter? Because we have a statute that says age shouldn't play a role in. \"Play a role\" means it made a difference. I mean, to me. Otherwise it played no role. It was an understudy, a ghost. It \"played a role\" if it would have made a difference. \"Played a part,\" it would have made a difference, just like my first case. So we have an action, other things being equal, that should be illegal under this statute. But then, just as in the first case, we give the employer a defense: If you can show that in the absence of that age there in your mind, you would have done it anyway, which means the mix of motives would have been different, then you get off. So, if in the first case we in fact say it should be on the -- burden should be on the employer, why shouldn't it be in the second case?",
  "Will you - -",
  "Will you go back? I'm sorry to be hung up on this point. Maybe there are 15 cases that just prove I am wrong. But I'm -- I'm trying to figure out -- let's try other areas of the law. The dam is a nuisance. We now show, to prove that it's a nuisance, that it played a role in the death of my fish. I mean, isn't that the end of the case? Damages might be at issue -- how much of a role -- but as far as liability is concerned the gears were rusty. The rusty gears played a role in the derailing of the train. Again, it might be a question of who is responsible for what, but that there is liability I think in most areas of tort law would be over once you prove that the defendant's factor played a role.",
  "So is the law here -- am I wrong about ordinary tort law? Possibly. I don't know it that well. Is it that I -- is it that this area is special? Is it that there are cases so you can say any of those three? I am prepared to be totally wrong. I hope not.",
  "You can say that.",
  "And I think \"played a role\" combines at least the necessary condition, but I don't know - -",
  "-- if you have to - -",
  "\"Played a role\" -- how did it play a role if it was not a necessary?",
  "What they are trying to say, which is -- which is making me think -- it is a lot about -- we have a human being who did certain acts. And we know this. We know that human being had a mix of motives and that the bad motive played a role. It was a motivating force. And that might be sufficient. It is under Title VII. And if you want to interpret this by Title VII, that's fine. That's the end of it. But then we are going to let someone off if we imagine a different, but hypothetical, situation. The hypothetical is where the bad motive isn't there. Well, it's hard to prove what human beings would do in a hypothetical situation that isn't the real situation. And I take it that's the reason we have imposed this burden upon the employer. Is there an analogy to that in tort law?",
  "May I ask one other question before you leave this, which is where Justice Kennedy started? Suppose a State says: In our State, we want to tax all oil and gas property, and here's how we do it. We assess the value of all oil and gas property, ships and everything else included. Then we impose a tax of 20 mills per dollar of assessed value, something like that, on all of it. Now, the State will collect all of it, and we make one exception. We define which property the State will directly get the money from, and then the city can do the rest, if it wants. Now, here's what we do with the State money. We give it to the city. So if the city wants to, it can put the same tax on that little bit of property left over, which is a subcategory of oil and gas property. And by the way, the name of that little bit of property left over is called \"a ship.\" Now, is that a tonnage tax, and is that what Alaska has done here?",
  "I described to you the entire tax. We know no more about it.",
  "The way it does is just as I said. And maybe I was -- it was too much for you to take in. So the point is that it's a tax on oil and gas property. That's Code section 1. Code section 2 is defined subcategories -- (a), (b), (c), (d, (e), (f) - - all of that. Code 3 says (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e). The -- the State government collects and remits it to the city. (G), the city can assess the same tax if it wishes. It doesn't have to -- and keep the money. (G) is ships. And the reason I have asked that question is I read something from a -- Alaska Department of Economic and Community Development which suggested to me that that is Alaska's tax. I might have that wrong. I just read a sentence or two, and maybe I am wrong that that is Alaska's tax, and - -",
  "But if it's Alaska's tax - -",
  "-- what's wrong with it? It's a -- it's a tax on all oil and gas property, and all they do is they let the city collect some of that if they want, and they collect the rest of it and give it to the city.",
  "What I'd like to know is: Do you think what I said was a misdescription? What's worrying me about this aspect of this case is a possible need to send it back to find out what Alaska's tax system is. Now -- now, if what I just said is a -- is a correct description approximately and if the other side thinks it is, too, then at least I -- I know how to go about deciding it. And if I don't, I don't know quite what to do.",
  "That's a different argument. Can we just get to - -",
  "That makes matters worse.",
  "Let's suppose I accept just what Justice Ginsburg said, and said it's a hopeless morass if we look at all taxes. Let's look at this tax. This tax you call an ad valorem tax on personal property levied by Valdez, and then on page 11 of your brief you say that's not just on ships, it's also on mobile homes, trailers, recreational vehicles, and various types of personal property defined under State law as oil and gas property, motor vehicle, machinery, supplies and maintenance equipment. They come back and they say, as to your mobile homes, trailers and recreational vehicles, all that's happening there is either you have exempted them or they are fixed in place, and they are like real property and that's what you are doing. As to the other things, you do not impose a tax on those other things. Rather, the State imposes a tax on those other things. And it may be that you help the State do it by providing them with the assessment, and it may be even that you could do it, but you haven't; and therefore, the only thing you have imposed this tax on are the ships. Now I think I have that argument right. If I do, what's the answer to it?",
  "If I don't, what's the right argument?",
  "May impose doesn't help if you don't do it.",
  "State imposes it or - -",
  "And that happens with all these other properties? That is, in Valdez, you pay the city -- you pay the city -- for the -- for the taxes on that oil and gas property that isn't shipped?",
  "And you write the check to the city.",
  "All the things you listed on page 11 - -",
  "The -- the oil and gas, motor vehicles, machinery, appliances, supplies, and maintenance equipment.",
  "So they write a check to the city. Okay.",
  "What about a porthole tax?",
  "Is a porthole tax in your view okay?",
  "A porthole tax. They charge for portholes. Anyone who has a porthole who comes into our city pays taxed. That's not a tonnage tax.",
  "So, in your view, a masked tax.",
  "Oh, but the porthole tax applies, by the way, to that ship's captain who has retired, who has built his house with portholes instead of windows.",
  "So there are 2 or 3 percent of the -- I mean, it's only 99.9 percent on ships.",
  "Yes.",
  "What about the Greer? You haven't mentioned that. Greer in Norris v. City of Boston. Where he says the -- you know what it says; it's on the front page of their brief. All right. That seemed to me to say, don't interpret the Tonnage Clause to apply to tonnage. Interpret it, same thing as if it was mass, it's mariners, power of the steam engine, number of passengers, the master or owner of the vessel -- all those fall within the Tonnage Clause. That's what the paragraph seems to say.",
  "Can you -- I would like to follow up on Justice Stevens's question. Think of three categories, A is the category which you could see that other questions of law apply to. B, is this case, and C, is the other -- other things -- other things that it might apply to, but in your opinion it would be absurd to apply them to that. All right, what's in category C?",
  "Wait, wait. After Saddam Hussein falls - -",
  "-- and we have a new government - -",
  "Yo mean some period of days, or something?",
  "All right, is there any one other than that?",
  "No. Okay.",
  "So basically, basically your reading - -",
  "-- is the word \"any other\" does apply to any other.",
  "Except your case.",
  "And possibly this thing for a couple of days.",
  "Well, that isn't exactly an absurd result then, to say \"any other\" really means any other including this case.",
  "Nogales was doing great? I mean, I asked my clerk to go get some figures out of the record and she says in 2008 in the sixth grade, just to take an example, 77 percent of the English learners in Nogales failed the tests as compared to 32 percent statewide. In the tenth grade 84 percent failed the reading exam compared with 34 percent statewide. In 2008 the reading exam fourth graders, 67 percent failed in Nogales, the English learners, compared to 30 percent statewide. Now, I'm sure that progress has been made, but it doesn't seem to me, looking at that kind of thing -- and the record is filled with that kind of thing - - that that -- that you could say that the objectives are achieved.",
  "Well, isn't the point of this to teach the children to learn English?",
  "He doesn't actually have the right to ask me questions.",
  "All right. Let's take the one you mentioned. Let's take the one you mention. The one you mentioned, I take it the student academic achievement in mathematics, which is something called the AYP guidelines test, they are for high school, which you mentioned. It has -- I think it's 2008, maybe it's 2007 -- we have limited English proficient students, this is passing their test, 22.4 percent of the English learners are at students scoring at or above proficient. The overall rate is 68 percent. So it seems like about a third. Now, if you look at the reading language arts, the average is 73.5. Limited English proficient is 15.4. And that's quite a difference, 75 percent as to 15.4, in the high schools, on the tests that you have mentioned. So I just say -- my only point is that we have a couple of findings here; you are right, they have made progress, but they are not quite home yet. And I would say that, looking at this record, it seems to suggest that.",
  "Let's do another one. What they started out in the year 2000 is they said one problem with this State is we don't know what it costs the average -- the increased program. They haven't done a good study to tell what it costs. But we think it's somewhere around $1500, maybe it's $1300, maybe it's $1400 per student. And as of this very moment, the State is providing 3 to $400, leaving it up to the school district to find the rest of the money, which it has to take from other things like English, or -- is that right?",
  "What is the one State funding? Because I looked at your brief, page 22 to 23, and if I understand it correctly it says that the educational expenditures, that is to say monies, increased in this Nogales and USD - -",
  "-- maintenance and operation budget, by 30 percent. Well, I'm sure they did. But that's I take it the entire maintenance and operation budget. The numbers I had -- and I am quite interested to know if they are wrong -- the numbers that I have is that the only survey they've done across the State, or the most recent one, says that the English language instructional costs range between 1570 and $3300 per pupil. And then if you look at the amount the State provides outside of the reading, writing and arithmetic, which they provide, et cetera, for all students, what they provide is -- currently it's $340, and if that law had gone into effect, 2064, it would have been $450. Now, are those numbers totally wrong?",
  "There is a minor thing that I -- I think -- I'm not sure that Justice Ginsburg said. I thought that the funding order was not fund the plan you come up with; but rather, come up with a funding plan that bears a rational relationship to -- to the plan you come up with. So is that right?",
  "All right. And now the district court is at considerable remove. He says they have not yet come up with a study and a plan that seems satisfactory, and they haven't shown how the funding is rational in relation to the plan that they haven't fully developed, though they've made progress. That's where we are -- is that where we are?",
  "But aren't there things here that are a little extreme? I mean, if she's to be believed, then she was really naked, and the two administrators deny that, but you have to take her side of the facts. So taking her side of the facts, why couldn't the school administrators just do what they said they did? That is, you leave her in her underwear, tell her: Go shake her underwear. No reason to do any more than that. Or if she is really embarrassed about that, say: Go put on a swimming suit, you know. Shake the swimming suit, no problem. People see you at the beach all the time. Or call your mother. I mean, you know, we can think of another - - a number of things that seem a lot less restrictive than her version of what went on here.",
  "Yes.",
  "I know, but I mean, here she is embarrassed if -- if what she says happened happened. There seems no reason for that, and it seems so easy. Put on your gym clothes, okay? I mean, she does that every day. It is just such obvious alternatives to having her be really naked.",
  "I know, but she says in the record that they went further and required her to be partly naked beyond just her underwear. They say - -",
  "Okay. So that was my question. My question was: Why wasn't it? I wasn't asking about the law. I was asking: Why didn't they choose one of these alternatives?",
  "-- putting things in their underwear.",
  "I mean, I think there's a dispute in the record about that. So -- so we have, I mean you would have the right to prove your version, obviously. But suppose you fail to prove that and that the jury or judge, or whoever is deciding this fact, concludes the school board's right on that; all they did was ask her to strip to her underwear, period. Nobody saw anything else. Now, what's your view of that one? I mean, let's also imagine that this is sufficient to prove - - to -- what happened was Marissa opens a planner, and in the planner there's some small knives, a cigarette lighter, and a cigarette. And who gave you the planner? Well, Savana gave it to me. And they find some pills. Let's imagine those pills are cocaine or something like meth or something. And she says well, where did you get those? Savana gave them to me. Okay. That seems to be possibly reasonable suspicion to think Savana has some of these pills. And they're going to distribute them at lunchtime. At that point they go look, whatever they did here. But then they bring Savana in to the nurse and the nurse and the female official say: All right, Savana, strip to your underclothes and shake your underclothes. That's what happens, period. Now, is that latter part a violation of the Fourth Amendment?",
  "Because?",
  "All right. But it would be okay to say, change into a swimming suit or your gym clothes? Hey, your gym clothes are in the locker, they're about the same size, shape; go do that.",
  "No, they didn't -- she didn't reveal her body beyond her underclothes. She - - that's the hypothetical that I'm trying to work out here, because I'm not certain.",
  "I'm trying to work out why is this a major thing to say strip down to your underclothes, which children do when they change for gym, they do fairly frequently, not to -- you know, and there are only two women there. Is -- how bad is this, underclothes? That's what I'm trying to get at. I'm asking because I don't know.",
  "Well, I thought there was, because I thought on page 135 of the record the official said they didn't see her naked, and so I thought that there was - -",
  "My question -- my question has to do with accepting - -",
  "What they said on page 135 of the record, and this is a genuine problem I'm having. I'm trying to figure out, if that's so, and to repeat it -- you heard what I said, there's no reason to repeat it.",
  "Okay. I want to know why that search, if that's what happened, would violate the Fourth Amendment, assuming reasonable suspicion to think she possessed meth or cocaine at that time.",
  "Maybe the psychologists - - \"strip search\" has a lot of meanings. And do the psychologists focus on the situation with the child involved, you know, this is an -- my hypothetical, is that what they're talking about?",
  "It's not like you have any studies on this. But I mean, I hate to tell you, but it seems to me like a logical thing when an adolescent child has some pills or something, they know people are looking for them, they will stick them in their underwear. I'm not saying everyone would, but I mean, somebody who thinks that that's a fairly normal idea for some adolescent with some illegal drugs to think of, I don't think he's totally out to lunch, is he?",
  "Do you have any studies on this? I doubt it.",
  "So what am I supposed to do? In my experience when I was 8 or 10 or 12 years old, you know, we did take our clothes off once a day, we changed for gym, okay? And in my experience, too, people did sometimes stick things in my underwear - -",
  "Or not my underwear. Whatever. Whatever. I was the one who did it? I don't know. I mean, I don't think it's beyond human experience, not beyond human experience.",
  "Well, what are they supposed to do?",
  "No, no, but it's supposed to be what's reasonable.",
  "And a teacher is there thinking what's reasonable? And I've already got the thing sort of away from -- I see your point. I'm not quite talking about that. I'm worried about what to write in this as a general standard. And so am I supposed to say, look, school -- school officials who think that children could hide things in their underwear when they know they're not supposed to have them, is that school official really unreasonable except in a special case? That's what's bothering me.",
  "What's -- what about the case that they were talking about, so the relator's pursuing a case, that case is over, and they're not going to appeal because they don't have any money left, whatever it is; but the government looks at that judgment and thinks, oh, God, there's something wrong with this one, I better appeal it. That's the government lawyer speaking. Now, they're supposed to have 60 days to figure that one out, and you'll take that 60 away from them because they'll have to do this whole thing in 30.",
  "No, because they didn't expect - -",
  "The judge did -- the judge did a surprising thing, which judges sometimes do.",
  "Would this be a solution which wouldn't help you? You would say, well, there's some factors here cut one way, and there's some that cut the other way, and some circuits have said the government should have the 60 days, and those cases are already proceeding. So it's best to keep it where it is, which is 60 days, and then suggest the Rules Committee look into this, since we don't actually - -",
  "And it -- all right. And the Rules Committee would looked into it if it's a problem.",
  "Well, I know. That's repeating your argument. And I'm suggesting what would be wrong with the view that you lose because of the reasons I said.",
  "Why isn't it also a party under all these other rules?",
  "Under all of the rules of discovery?",
  "A city can in fact choose a test simply because there will be more minority people who will in fact end up in the positions, that's your view?",
  "You needn't do anything else? I mean, that is your answer to Justice Kennedy?",
  "I want to know is that your answer to Justice Kennedy or not?",
  "The answer is yes.",
  "If that's so, what's the difference here? The most that you're saying is the worst that could have happened here; the worst that could have happened is that some experts told them, this test -- by the way, test one is -- is even worse than in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical. It's a test that probably discriminates negatively against minorities. So if you admit he could do it even if the test didn't discriminate negatively against minorities, namely test -- in his case, why can't you do it triply, in the case where there's evidence that they did discriminate, the test does discriminate against minorities?",
  "If you got to that, then I have -- I'd like one follow-up, and that's it.",
  "What do you do if there is not a liability in question? Suppose a school district deliberately, to obtain greater racial diversities in the schools draws district boundaries in a particular way among neighborhoods or plans a construction program. Then suppose having done that, indeed having once drawn the boundaries, a group comes to the school district and says you can achieve greater diversity if you redraw the boundary. You can achieve greater diversity if instead of building this school where the -- where the foundations are laid already, you build the school over here instead. Is that, in your view, different from your case?",
  "It is? How?",
  "That's just what I'm doing exactly.",
  "But I'm interested in the distinctions, not whether it's similar to Justice Thomas's or not. I'm interested in the distinctions between this program -- I'll add one more if you want just this program, an employer - -",
  "And the difference between that and drawing the school district boundary, which takes from the individual children who live in that neighborhood the right to go to this school, which they think is a better one, and sends them to that school, which they think is a worse one, the difference between changing that boundary and changing the exam is what?",
  "What do you think of an employer who does the following? He advertises a job. Everyone comes in and applies. He says May 1 is the deadline. When he sees the applicants, he thinks, I'd prefer more diversity. And solely because he lacks diversity among women, minorities, and whatever, he says, you know, I'm going to extend the deadline 2 months, and I hope I'll get a few more minority or female applicants. Now, what's his reason? He wants more diversity in the workforce. Now, in your opinion, does the Constitution permit that extension?",
  "I have purposely gone, of course, to the concurring opinion because I believe it's the controlling opinion in Parents Involved, and there are two examples in that opinion. One is strategic site selection of new schools, i.e., a planned building, and the second is drawing attendance zones with a general recognition of the demographics. Those are given as examples of instances where there is race consciousness, but it does not trigger strict scrutiny. Now, why is your case like that rather than being like those examples where an employer or a government official picks particular people or uses quotas in order to get a certain quota or pay attention to race in an individual selection, both based on race, which clearly does require strict scrutiny? And if there is a difference, even then why is yours justified?",
  "Do you -- I'm still back on -- a university decides that tenure requirements lead to fewer women professors, so they say as an experiment what we would like to do is not have them for a couple of years; see what happens. On your view is that unconstitutional? Because, after all, it will certainly mean that certain majority race assistant professors have now lost the promotion they otherwise would have.",
  "That it's unconstitutional?",
  "Yes.",
  "It would not be unconstitutional?",
  "And what about - -",
  "All right. Oh, oh.",
  "But what we are doing is not giving the promotions to the assistant professors who otherwise would have job security.",
  "Oh, so.",
  "It's the result -- it's that you identify the person that makes your -- so in Texas, for example, they take the top 10 percent of all the high school graduates and put them in the university. Now, suppose they just decided, you know what we want to do? The top 5 percent. We want to see how that works. And, of course, then there are people who in fact would have gotten into the university -- and perhaps we can imagine a majority of the majority race -- and now they don't. Can Texas do that?",
  "I know that, but I -- I - -",
  "That was not my objective.",
  "I want to test out just what it is about this case.",
  "Well, you said no. Can Texas do that or not?",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay. And the difference here precisely is what?",
  "But in your -- in my example, to go back, the thing you've identified, it seems to me, is Texas couldn't do this. It couldn't look at the class that they're going to choose with the 10 percent and say, you know, there are not enough minorities, I think we'll go to 15 percent this year.",
  "It could not. And moreover, in the case of the tenure, what the school couldn't do is it couldn't say, looking over at the present tenured faculty and those who were just ready for promotion and who in all probability will be, we're going to go to the non-tenure system this year. We're going to go to the non-tenure system this year.",
  "That they couldn't do that. And again you that say the ordinary employer across America who announces a deadline for getting in applications cannot, once it sees those applications, say, you know, there are not enough minorities. I want to extend the deadline.",
  "All right. And therefore this is a very far-reaching decision.",
  "I understand the argument that the issues are not quite the same, that the Atkins issue of mental retardation is not quite the same as the issue that was litigated. Let's try and get that out of the case. I think that's where Justice Kennedy was going. Suppose it was a gun case and the Supreme Court originally thought you could convict people who sell drugs of simple possession of a gun. There's a finding, because it's a bench trial, that he simply possessed but did not otherwise use the gun. Then the Supreme Court holds that that isn't enough under the statute. So now the State wants to argue, because the proceeding on appeal or whatever is still going on, we want a second shot at this; we want to show he did more than simply possess. Is the State bound by what it previously lost on or can the State -- can he get a second shot?",
  "I'm not -- I'm not going to go into double jeopardy. I don't think necessarily that it's double jeopardy that -- that is relevant here. But I have a -- have you run into this in a different context? They wouldn't use the word \"double jeopardy.\" It would be some kind of due process problem. Maybe there isn't a problem. Have you run in your research to anything like what I described?",
  "It's not reopen -- it's - - it's the same problem. And maybe you found some authority to the contrary, other than statements, but actual authority. The defendant loses. He appeals. He says they made a mistake. And the normal remedy is you give him a new trial. Does it matter that it's a collateral proceeding? I don't think so. They go to the Federal court: Judge, they made a mistake at my trial. You give him a new trial. Everything's up for grabs normally at the new trial. I can't think of an instance where it isn't. Here, they are saying: Judge, they made a mistake. They should have applied the mental retardation rule of Atkins. So give him a new trial. Now, what I'm looking for is just one example somewhere that supports you - -",
  "-- that didn't proceed on the theory I've just announced or just said.",
  "No, I want a case even vaguely like that.",
  "Your argument, then - - we're getting somewhere maybe.",
  "You're saying to me, think of Jackson and Denno, If you're in a collateral proceeding and the Federal judge said there wasn't enough evidence to convict him under the Constitution, like the Shuffling Sam case, there isn't enough evidence; it isn't that he gets a new trial. The Constitution entitles him to acquittal, and therefore there is no new trial because of the Double Jeopardy Clause, right?",
  "All right. So you're saying here, the evidence the first time was such that they couldn't give him the death penalty under the Constitution as later interpreted. So if that's what you discover on the collateral appeal, a similar reasoning would somehow lead you to the similar result. Is that the argument?",
  "What about more than that?",
  "Why not -- I mean, suppose -- the part I don't understand in this statute, which may not be relevant -- I would appreciate the help. It seems to me that (a)(10) large (A) and then (F) have something to do with the parent who never goes to public school, the child just goes to private schools to begin with, and they get something. If they have - - if they have a disability, this program pays them something, right.",
  "It's at the very beginning, at the end of addendum page 1.",
  "What is that?",
  "All right. So in other words - -",
  "-- a parent who has a disabled child who never thinks about the public school system still gets some money, but not as much, for the disabled child?",
  "It's money to the school.",
  "To the school.",
  "And so, it's money that goes to the school for a program?",
  "Money that the children can get. I get it.",
  "All right. Now, would it then work, what is -- would this system work under the statute? You say, parents, if you are going to a disabled child, you simply go to a private school, you get the services you just mentioned. Now, if you put in -- put the child in a public school, and they find a free appropriate public education, fine, that's the end of that, you have to do it. Now, if they don't give you a decent one, you can, you can send the child to a private school, but it has -- you have to give it a shot to the public school system. Now, that's what you don't want the interpretation to be? You don't -- you are against that. But -- but let's amend it a little.",
  "I am reading the language. You may require the district to pay for someone who has been enrolled in special services - -",
  "You haven't heard my amendment.",
  "My amendment is the norm will be give the public school a shot, but there could be circumstances, you're getting the run-around, there is need to put that child in a public school now. In other words, special equitable circumstances that make it reasonable for the parent not to give the school a shot, though that's the norm. And in those unusual circumstances, there would remain grounds for equitable relief. What about that as an overall interpretation of the statute which has several parts to it?",
  "But you have to be willing to accept that it's an unusual situation, though it may well exist, that the judge is going to reimburse the parent where that parent didn't give the public school a shot. They will have to show there is a good reason for not doing that.",
  "Is that all right with you or not?",
  "Well, you are simply saying that it was reasonable for the parent here. I'm not asking that question.",
  "Well, what happens -- what happens if the hearing officer can't, but why couldn't the court? I mean, they see an unusual situation. The parents were justified, and it doesn't say there are no circumstances other than -- where you couldn't -- where they may not pay. So the judge says, I think this is a situation where it is -- it is equitable to pay the - - the reimbursement.",
  "Why not? What says you can't do that, other than your basic point about the \"may require\"?",
  "All right. But anyway, the regs don't say anything about that.",
  "You're saying the statute says the hearing officer can't do that no matter what. That's a separate argument.",
  "All right.",
  "How is it supposed to work? This is what is bothering me at the heart of this case. I imagine that banks, particularly right in these last few months, are in situations where there are three categories of -- of borrowers. One might be a category of people whom you are reasonably confident in, and the second is a category of people who are borderline or less so, and there are also minorities. Now, where you make the decision as a bank to deny them the loan, it sometimes is difficult to say whether that decision was made for a discriminatory reason, namely race, or for a legitimate reason, namely because this was a person unlikely to pay the money back. Now, how is a bank to function if 50 different attorneys general plus the Federal agencies all look at the books of the bank to look at the individual loan and to make that kind of determination about which quite honestly reasonable people will often differ? And how -- how is that really a problem, or am I just creating that? And if it's really a problem, how in your opinion does the Federal law deal with that problem, if not in the way that your opponent suggests?",
  "If I may say so, that response overlooks the question. I don't doubt the single standard. What I do doubt is in the -- in the category of uncertain cases, that 51 different individuals, 50 State attorneys general plus one Federal individual, will reach the same result.",
  "These are hard and, therefore, they will reach a lot of different results under the same standard.",
  "Okay. So you deny the hypothetical. You are saying that my analysis of the problem is wrong; there simply is no such problem, and since there is no such problem, it doesn't matter if everyone enforces it.",
  "Is your answer yes or no to what I just said, that you deny that the statement of the problem is realistic and therefore there is no problem in your view about having 51 different people enforce the same standard.",
  "And should such a problem arise, what?",
  "I want to - -",
  "You are just at the point of getting to what I -- the blank in my mind. And the blank in my mind is when you said, but if there were such a problem, as I had described, but if there were, then they could -- and now that's the blank. Then they could what?",
  "For example, just give me two, a couple.",
  "Is it -- could they - - could the Federal authorities pre-empt the State law, in your opinion?",
  "Can I -- can I take what Justice Ginsburg just said, and give you a thought that I am interested in your response to? I haven't seen the letter from the Attorney General. Is the whole thing in the record?",
  "Okay. Now, reading Judge Parker's description of it, it seemed to me that what he had said was that there are statistical disparities between interest rates and race. Well, as long as, most unfortunately, income is correlated with race, with minorities being towards the bottom, of course such statistical disparities will exist, some legitimate, some not. So if the only basis for getting this information is that allegation, it's hard to see how this differs from the case that Justice Ginsburg put.",
  "But it might be quite a different case, if they had gone into court and found individuals who were really getting different interest rates and who really seemed very, very similar, but for race. But at that point, they'd have to go get this same information, because that's where they would find whether that prima facie case was right or wrong.",
  "Do you see what I'm doing?",
  "I'm dividing the matter vertically, instead of, say, horizontally - -",
  "-- and I want to know if that's possible.",
  "No, I'll ask you that question because I'd like to hear your answer to that.",
  "Can I ask you this question for a second, please? And just take 2 minutes to answer it or not. You don't have to answer it, but it seems to me this is the question. This whole issue depends on the evidence before Congress. So, in reading the briefs, I have six categories of evidence. Compared to the City of Rome, the registration turnout still has two States, Virginia and Texas, with significant disparities. As to minority officeholders, there is a big improvement, but if you look at Mississippi, Louisiana, and South Carolina and a couple of others, it is still not great. The DOJ objections: The number of DOJ objections has fallen a lot, but it still exists. In terms of election observers, which were not mentioned in City of Rome, we have their statistics that two-thirds of the observers are focused on five of the six States that are covered. In terms of polarized voting, not mentioned in Rome, we still have testimony that the polarization is significant and common in certain places. And as to successful section 2, section 5 suits, once again not mentioned in the City of Rome, but since 1982 there were at least 105 successful section 5 suits and 653 successful section 2 suits. All right. I just summarized that because I'd like to hear in a couple of minutes, or five, or whatever you want to take. I'm trying to lead you to what I think is the heart of the case. It seems evidentiary. That is what I read. What is your response?",
  "Whatever you want.",
  "So what is the reason in your opinion if you had to summarize it in ray sentence or two, you would say that the reason that Congress didn't go into other States and decide which ones to add to this or go into these States district by district and decide which ones to subtract from this, the reason that Congress didn't modify voting rights statute but simply renewed it?",
  "Thank you. I have another question. How long did it take Congress to compile this 13,000-page record?",
  "And how long would it have taken Congress in your opinion to have compiled the record to figure out what's happening in this respect in every State or in these States district by district?",
  "You should have a chance to answer the same question. You heard my question, the time question. What's your estimate?",
  "And the individual contribution also covers people who would like to give $2500 instead of $2400, which is the limit. And maybe there are 100 million or 200 million people in the United States who, if they gave 2500 rather than 2400, nobody could say that that was really an effort to buy the Senator or the Congressman. So is that unconstitutional, too?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "So here the obvious argument is: Look, they said the compelling interest is that people think that representatives are being bought, okay? That's to put it in a caricature, but you understand what I'm driving at, okay? That's what they said in Buckley v. Valeo. So Congress now says precisely that interest leads us to want to limit the expenditures that corporations can make on electioneering communication in the last 30 days of a primary, over-the-air television, but not on radio, not on books, not on pamphlets, not on anything else. All right? So in what respect is there not conceptually at least a compelling interest and narrow tailoring?",
  "It's important - -",
  "Well, of course, it did - - was a basis for prohibiting speech by, in the sense of giving contributions above $2,400, by 300 million people in the United States. But the point, which I think is the one that Justice Kennedy was picking up, is are we arguing here between you and my questions, is the argument in this case about the existence of a compelling interest? Because Congress seemed to think that there was certainly that; it's this concern about the perception that people are, say, buying candidates. Are we arguing about narrow tailoring? Congress thought it was narrow tailoring. Or are we arguing about whether we should second-guess Congress on whether there is enough of a compelling interest and the tailoring is narrow enough?",
  "Yes.",
  "If that is so -- this is a point that is concerning me. I don't know the answer precisely. But suppose you are right. Suppose we overrule these two cases. Would that leave the country in a situation where corporations and trade unions can spend as much as they want in the last 30 days on television ads, et cetera, of this kind, but political parties couldn't, because political parties can only spend hard money on this kind of expenditure? And therefore, the group that is charged with the responsibility of building a platform that will appeal to a majority of Americans is limited, but the groups that have particular interests, like corporations or trade unions, can spend as much as they want? Am I right about the consequence? If I am right, what do we do about it?",
  "No, I'm not -- I'm not -- I am saying am I right in thinking that if you win, the political party can't spend this money, it's limited to hard money contributions, but corporations and trade unions can spend unlimited funds?",
  "No, I'm not suggesting that. I am suggesting we will make a hash of this statute, and if we are going to make a hash of this statute, what do we do about it? And that's why I want you to take a position on another important part of that statute, and that is the part that says political parties themselves cannot make these expenditures that we are talking about except out of hard money.",
  "Well, if we -- if we go - - if we go that route, what we are doing is creating an accounting industry, aren't we? Corporations give huge amounts of money to the C-4 organization, and then somebody, perhaps the FEC, has to decide whether in fact that is a way of subverting the prohibition against the direct payment for the communication, right? Okay, so Congress said, we don't want that. Congress said, that's going to be a nightmare, and we decide Wellstone, for whatever reasons. Now don't we have to focus on whether Congress can say that or whether it can't?",
  "And I don't know why it cannot say it.",
  "That's true.",
  "Is -- I -- I remember spending quite a few days one summer reading through 1,000 pages of opinion in the D.C. Circuit. And I came away with the distinct impression that Congress has built an enormous record of support for this bill in the evidence. And my recollection is, but it is now a couple of years old, that there was a lot of information in that which suggested that many millions of voters think, at the least, that large corporate and union expenditures or contributions in favor of a candidate lead the benefited political figure to decide quite specifically in favor of the -- of the contributing or expending organization, the corporation or the union.",
  "Now, it was on the basis of that, I think, that this Court upheld the law in BCRA. But we have heard from the other side there isn't much of a record on this. So, if you could save me some time here, perhaps you could point me, if I am right, to those thousand pages of opinion and tens of thousands of underlying bits of evidence where there might be support for that proposition?",
  "BCRA has changed all that.",
  "Actually I read that sentence that you just read as meaning the corporation is an artificial person in respect to which the State creates many abilities and capacities, and the State is free also to create some disabilities and capacities. Not a statement about balancing rich and poor.",
  "Why do you think that your -- that this privilege -- or is it -- more important than any other privilege? I mean, Justice Scalia's question and your answer convinced me that you can protect this the same as you can any other trade secret -- any trade secret. Of course, you do disclose it to the opposing party, but that is also true of any breach of any privilege, so husband-wife, priest-penitent, psychiatrist and patient. I take all of those are privileged. Do we allow collateral appeals there?",
  "Well, if we don't allow collateral appeals with the husband and wife, with the priest and -- and someone in -- you know, confession or something, I don't -- with a priest, or with a psychiatrist who is dealing with a patient, why would we allow collateral appeal here?",
  "But then if we grant your collateral appeal, don't we have to, perhaps, equally grant it in every situation, where a judge arguably makes an erroneous ruling on a question of privilege?",
  "It's the lawyer.",
  "So it's -- in your opinion, it's more important to protect the lawyers, who talk to clients, from erroneous rulings, than protect the priest or protect the wife or husband or protect the psychiatrist who is dealing with a patient? Now, that's hard for me to see why. I mean, I think lawyers are very important, but it's a little hard to see why they are more important than these other people.",
  "So -- so, I think any system of -- that denies you the interlocutory appeal, will, in fact, work some injustice. I have no doubt about that. Any system that allows too many interlocutory appeals wrecks the judicial system through delay. Now, I think on that kind of question which is here, maybe there is some information that you come across with the ABA, for example, that has 300,000 - - maybe 600 -- you know, hundreds of thousands of members. There might be instances in the circuits where appeal was denied, where the lawyers would say, my goodness, appeal was denied, I want to tell you the hardship that that worked. Has anyone gone around and tried to find if there are such instances, as there must be, how serious it was? How harmful, how often do we have any empirical information on that question?",
  "Is it wrong for me to expect that if this would work, a lot of instances of serious hardship not allowing the appeal, some lawyers in their meetings would be upset and they would raise a few examples? So doesn't the fact that you have been unable to find any tend to count against you?",
  "Now, I know that you're going to go into the question of how we shape a rule, and I would like you, and perhaps on rebuttal your other counsel, to comment on the following: I don't see -- as Justice Kennedy had a problem, so do I have a problem with anything that just says break in custody, and taking time seems fairly arbitrary. Suppose you -- could you try to shape a rule on the civil situation, the codes of ethics, where you are not supposed to talk to a client who is represented by a lawyer? That's where my mind is going. And the best I could do at the moment is you would say: When, due to a breach in custody and the passage of time, the questioner did not and would not reasonably believe that the suspect was looking for or was represented by counsel? What I've tried to do is take the purpose of the civil rule, the ordinary ethical rule, and then use it to shape a standard. So I would appreciate any comments on that thought.",
  "Quite a lot of what I read was about the problems of counsel. Counsel has nothing to do with this, nothing at all?",
  "If -- are we interested in counsel or not? If we are interested in whether he's represented by counsel, and Miranda covers both, then I would repeat my question.",
  "If we are not interested in representation by counsel, then I would withdraw my question and you don't have to answer it.",
  "Just in case -- just in case we don't -- we want to put a time limit on it, which I know you don't want us to do. I'm now thinking and I would like your comment, if you want, of a combination of what Justice Alito said and what I said, that is, that there are two parts to the Edwards thing. One is the lawyer part, and the other is the incriminating self part. Now the lawyer part would be handled by shaping a rule based on the rules of evidence, along the lines I suggested. And that would give you a time. And then the Miranda part could be handled by saying: but the suspect retains the right to show that this questioning is badgering without the question marks. In other words what they are really up to is to try to get him to change his mind. Now would that work?",
  "Well, if you're -- if you are going to use the Edwards, which I think is a good idea, as counsel part, which I think is a good starting place, you and every other member of the bar deals with this problem every day of the week. Not every day of the week, but very often. You know somebody's represented in a case, and you know you are supposed to talk to the lawyer. But eventually time passes, and then you are probably free to talk to him, because the whole thing's gone away. Now that's a pretty vague rule. You could make it more specific, but the -- the bar has lived with that kind of situation, I guess for years.",
  "So why can't we here?",
  "No, no, that's not what I mean. I mean that the obligation to deal with counsel, you don't have, after enough time passes, that it's no longer reasonable to think that that individual either has or wants counsel.",
  "My thought is, can you use the rule for lawyers, which has worked, to help shape a rule that would work here?",
  "But what -- what -- before we can even get into this, I think we have to decide if those words \"striking or touching\" describe one crime or two. And what we said in Chambers is that the nature of the behavior that likely underlies a statutory phrase matters in this respect. If you think of the seven different things covered by one statute in James or Chambers, two of them, failing to return from a furlough and failing to return from work in day release, seem to me quite possibly to describe one thing, not two. Now, how do we know that striking or touching describes two things? I couldn't find any instance, and we had the library looking. I couldn't find any instance in Florida where those two things have ever been charged separately. And they looked at hundreds. So -- so why do we think it's two crimes, rather than just one called \"striking or touching\"?",
  "It does, too, in Chambers. It's \"not returning from furlough or not returning from work release.\" You know, and I'd -- I would say the behavior is the same. It's not like burglary of a dwelling versus burglary of a boat. Those are two separate things.",
  "Here, why do you think they are two separate things?",
  "Okay. If they are separate things, what is the evidence? There is a legal question. You say the touching. Spitting, is that enough to rise under the -- to fall within the Federal statute? Suppose I agree with you on that; the answer's no. How do I know whether touching as applied in Florida as a separate matter in the mine run of cases, involves spitting or involves something that causes far more serious harm? How do I know?",
  "Well, there -- most -- this statute actually, we looked into it and it seems to be used, particularly the touching part, also to cover unwelcome physical, sexual advances. And it's not hard to consider such matters to have involved force of exactly the kind that the Federal statute is aimed at. And there was no striking, but there was in fact use of harmful force, touching. That was serious. Now, how do we know which is more normally the case when this statute is used in its touching respect?",
  "I would say that's certainly wrong under our cases. I mean, I would have thought that the reason that burglary, for example, is a violent crime is not because in every instance there is a risk of physical harm, because in the mine run of instances there is a risk of physical harm, and I thought we said that in at least three cases.",
  "I know, but an element - - you mean we should interpret \"element\" in the first part of this in a radically different way than we have interrupted equivalent words in the second part, and we should say that burglary -- in other words, assault or -- or -- in other words, unless in every case of prosecution there is going to be force actually applied or something like that, that it doesn't fall within one? I'm surprised at it. I mean, I guess it's possible. What would be the argument for doing that, which would be totally different than we have handled the other one?",
  "So -- so what about an assault? I guess, using a law school hypothetical, I mean, a statute for assault -- I guess you could assault somebody by threatening to throw a marshmallow at them.",
  "Okay. Now, assault is out of the statute.",
  "No, no. But I mean, on your definition, as you and Justice Scalia were suggesting, because it is conceivable that you could assault somebody by threatening to throw a marshmallow, that means assault is no longer a crime of violence, and that can't be right.",
  "Assault is not a crime of violence; it's not a use of force.",
  "What about attempted murder?",
  "But it didn't - -",
  "Well, but - -",
  "Well, what worries me more than -- than your application to battery is the methodology, because, if it's true that in Section 1, unlike Section 2, a single instance of where you could commit the crime without using force is sufficient to take it out of the statute, then, just looking through this, generally, you would take out assault, probably have to take out kidnapping. You would probably have to take out domestic violence. You would have to take out extortion, certainly, explosives laws. I mean, the very -- laws that I would think Congress certainly intended to include in that first definition.",
  "So that's very worrying, and why I don't think it's the right methodology.",
  "Yes, but an element could be an element that is a -- the word is \"element,\" the use or threatened use of physical force. Now, an element, say like abduction, could be an element that uses physical force if in the mine run of cases it uses physical force, even though one can sometimes think of an exception. That's how we have interpreted 2. So if we interpret 1 a different way, we are going to take outside the statute the very things that Congress wanted inside; and, if we interpret it the same way, I think we would get to the right result.",
  "Rape can be convicted without -- rape can be conducted without force.",
  "All right. So now rape is out.",
  "Well, the element of rape is not force; it's lack of consent.",
  "You do? You agree that, then -- in other words, Section 2 is not about property crimes that involve force, which is what Congress happened to say nonstop in the legislative history, which I know isn't read by everyone. But it seemed to me reading that history, the first part is dealing with those things that aren't property crimes. The second part, like arson, extortion, which they had in mind of a certain kind, and whatever, the explosives-related things, were things that they thought didn't -- could be property crimes that also involved harm to people.",
  "Well, you can't say yes to both of us.",
  "They wouldn't have to say that. They would have to say that it is not a crime like the three that are mentioned, which I can't remember -- it's arson, extortion -- and what's the third? Using explosives.",
  "Yeah, burglary, arson, extortion -- all right. You would say it's not like that. It's DUI; it was not like that.",
  "And I get - -",
  "All right. Suppose we interpret the statute, the act of the statute as requiring more force than that, as requiring something more than spitting. Now, suppose that sometimes, as they have made a strong case, that touching is a separate thing under this statute because that's what the Florida Supreme Court said, and moreover, there are prosecutions that seem not to fit within striking. How do we know whether by and large this were a touching as used in Florida, covers things with mostly minimal touching, minimal force or enough force to get within the statute?",
  "It might have, but battery by touching does seem a separate category. And at that point, you have to decide, is there an element there of force? And I think it requires more force than just the simplest touching. Now, on Justice Scalia's approach, the fact that there is one conviction for spitting is sufficient to take it outside the statute. That's not my approach. I would say, in the mind run of cases, does there have to be more force than just spitting? And now I don't know how it's prosecuted. So why don't I say in this case, from my perspective, very well, I don't know. No one knows. No one has told me. No one has looked into it. It's very hard to look into, but not impossible. It's the Government's job, faced with a 15-year statute, to do the looking. They have the resources. More than a defense attorney. Therefore, uncertain as I am, I must decide this in favor of the defendant. What's the response to that?",
  "Hear what they said, what the Eleventh Circuit said, it said that if battery under Florida law fits within the description of (1), then it is a violent crime for ACCA purposes. And then it says if not, then not. And as long as the issue was in front of them I would think that those last four words are a holding.",
  "Why?",
  "Was it argued?",
  "It is pretty hard to see it given Begay, how this is like arson or, you know, the other three there, burglary, arson - -",
  "-- explosives.",
  "So, I mean, I don't know. Maybe the court of appeals felt -- what they said was, \"if not, then not.\" And it was raised in argument.",
  "Yeah, but I -- I thought - - you know, it's -- it's like the other four listed out.",
  "But then we are rereading these three other examples out because then \"other\" covers any crime that poses a risk of violence, or whatever the words are there -- I forget the words. Poses a risk.",
  "And you think drunk driving doesn't present a serious potential risk of physical injury?",
  "How -- how do you think it should work? It seems to me they are two separate things. On September 7th, the defendant comes in and says, \"Judge, you've told me I have to have everything ready by the 13th. I would like additional time to prepare.\" And what he said was, \"until September 25th.\" He said that on the 13th: \"I want until September 25th.\" This is what I think the Chief Justice is asking, in part. Now, what the judge did is excluded everything from September 7th all the way to October 4th. And if I understand your argument -- I'm not sure I agree with it, but on the 7th to the 13th, that really wasn't additional time, but nonetheless, maybe there's something there. What about the period from the 25th to the 4th? I don't know what the theory could be on excluding that one, because what the defendant said on the 7th - - on September 13th, he said, \"Judge, I don't want any more time. I don't even want to file any motions.\"",
  "Yes. On the 25th, he said that. So what is the basis of excluding the 25th to the 4th?",
  "So it's - -",
  "That's what I understand. You get the period from the -- the 25th to the 4th comes under (D) or (H). It's a motion that is filed, and it's under advisement.",
  "So it comes under (D) or (H). Is that right?",
  "I mean, I don't mean little (h)(1). I mean big (H). It's attributed to a period during which any proceedings actually under any advisement -- or maybe it comes under (D) -- a motion not to file a motion is a motion.",
  "You are right, (D) has a special time limit built into it -- I mean, (h) or whatever the number is now. It says not to exclude 30 days. Okay?",
  "None of the others do. So I would say right there, Congress doesn't want the judge to have it for more than 30 days. Congress doesn't say a word in any of the others that says anything about preparation time.",
  "No, I know. But there is not an indication about preparation time. Their argument is a literal argument under the statute. Is it from other proceedings? Yes, we know that because of (D), okay? Does it result from other proceedings? Yes, because, in fact, the preparation time is a direct result of the other proceedings as defined in (D). Therefore, it is an ancillary matter related to other proceedings that was caused by the other proceedings. QED, their argument is literal and there is no policy against it. That's what they said. Now, as soon as you get to the last (h), you would find a big policy against it. Called not exceeding 30 days. Now, I take it that's roughly their argument.",
  "At least my interpretation of it.",
  "Does six days make a difference to your case? If they lose six days, do you win?",
  "What if I made - -",
  "Well, look what you have done, and this is what is bothering me. You take these words, which are a little vague, some of them, \"serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value,\" and you say that's a standard that a judge or prosecutor will apply. And people have to understand it because they have to know what to do to avoid the risk of being prosecuted. Now, as I have gotten out of these briefs, you then require people to apply that standard, not simply to the crush videos or to the dogfighting, but also to, as Justice Scalia pointed out, bullfighting, sheep hunting, bear hunting, deer hunting, fox hunting, humane slaughter, and for, I think somewhere I found, the stuffing geese for pate de fois gras. All right, so there is a whole long -- quail hunting. There's a whole long list in here of things that people might want to do. They won't know if it falls within this exemption. Nobody in every State wants to forbid these things. Sometimes they are, sometimes they are not. They won't know whether or not they can make this particular film, picture, or other. That's the overbreadth argument. And I would like to hear your response.",
  "So you want to say \"cruelly kill\"?",
  "Now, \"cruelly kill\" is not exactly crystal clear. And therefore my question is why, given the need for you to save this statute to read so many words that are so general, those contained here that I've read, cruelly kill, cruelly wound as opposed to just wound or kill. You are doing that in order to prevent chilling people who are engaging in activities that aren't intended to be covered by this statute. Why not do a simpler thing? Rather than let the public guess as to what these words mean, ask Congress to write a statute that actually aims at those frightful things that it was trying to prohibit. Now, that can be done. I don't know why they couldn't do it.",
  "Why? Why? You say a crush video, my description that I read of it, you would have a strong case. I'm not saying you would win, I don't have to decide that. But you have a very strong case. So you say to Congress, write a statute that focuses on that. You are worried about dog fighting, write a statute that focuses on that, and moreover, talks about something unlawful in every state. I am not giving Congress advice, though I seem to be.",
  "I'm just saying why -- why can't you here write a statute that does not force the courts into the work of interpreting these very vague words to prevent the statute from being held unconstitutional?",
  "But the point -- the point I guess is when you say yes to this, what you are thinking is that, just as real obscenity when depicted does nothing communicative but rather appeals to the instinct of lust, so Congress could find a category of things that do not communicate, but appeal to the instinct of sadism; and that is true when other creatures are killed for the pleasure of the people who want to see them killed. Now, that's what you are saying. Now -- and I think maybe that's true. We don't have to decide that, perhaps. But the government says that is this statute, that is this statute read in light of its basic intent, and it is up to the Court to interpret it so as it achieves that objective. And you say that's not possible. Why not?",
  "I think what -- I think what's going on is -- is not -- your conflating two things. One is you are trying to produce education about something that has no communicative value. In so far as you are trying to make an argument or educate, of course, it is protected, but the government, here, is saying I think the statute is intended to forbid a different thing entirely, and it's hard to draw a line. Maybe it's impossible; but promoting a thing which communicates nothing, but appeals to people's worst instinct, that is not to advocate it or not to advocate it. It is to try to make money out of it, and that's what they think, I believe, the statute is aimed at.",
  "So that's why they have the journalistic exception.",
  "We are going to advertise a drug that is known to kill people.",
  "We are advertising - -",
  "Well, there's some that can't be found. So if we take your position, there's some that can't be found, we just can't create our database.",
  "I mean, that's the problem that's underlying the fairness of this thing.",
  "In terms of if we take your approach, no matter how hard it is to find owners, you are just out of luck. That is to say, there will not be databases collected, because they cannot be complete because we cannot find the owner. If we take the position that it is sometimes waiverable, that obstacle disappears and now it's a question of the fairness of the situation.",
  "That's right. I just wonder why Congress would have ever wanted this kind of provision to serve as that kind of obstacle in any area.",
  "That's the underlying fairness. There might be -- maybe they will win on that. I don't know what the merits of that are. But certainly an absolute bar might sometimes help some copyright owners, but many times it will hurt them, because since they can't be found they can't be compensated. And if we set up a system and put some money in it, so if they are ever found they will be compensated, that will help them. So that's why I ask the question, why would a Congress, that wants to help copyright owners create this kind of system? When all the things you are talking about can be brought into play when we consider the fairness of the system.",
  "They wouldn't waive it then. I mean, the problem, I take it, realistically is this: let's take a group of people who want to make databases; now they want to use copyrighted material. There is a subset of people who have written it they can't find, so they say here's what we will do. We will take $100 billion, and we will put it in a fund, and like ASCAP, that fund can administer this money for the benefit of anyone who turns up. Now, maybe that's illegal under some law. Maybe the class isn't right. Maybe they can't get proper representation. Maybe it's inadequate, et cetera. But what I don't fail to see -- what I fail to see, is how -- whether you could do that or not do it has anything to do with registration, because we are talking about the people who aren't here, all of whom, if you ever bring suit when he's found, will register the copyright. The only reason they haven't registered, we don't know who they are, that's why. Maybe they have registered, for all we know.",
  "Maybe they can't do that because it would be an unfair result. But where is it in this provision of law that's designed to stop that ever from happening?",
  "Maybe it won't, by the way.",
  "It depends on what the terms of the settlement are. We could have a subclass that allows a subset of those people to come into court. No reason you couldn't. So I don't know whether or not it's true that they won't register when they are found.",
  "In 1909 Congress thought all this through with the databases and so forth?",
  "But why doesn't it? Just out of curiosity. You are making a - -",
  "Well, you say if somebody who owns the copyright.",
  "Yes. No. No. But what we want to do is we want to have, in our database, all of the material written about slavery, and, lo and behold, there are 4,000 books that we can't trace. Who, now, owns the copyright 100 years later? And there is no way to get those into our database. Whether - -",
  "All right. Now, that's a sort of loss, and my same point, that maybe that's as it should be, but it's rather surprising that this law is the law that will answer that question.",
  "I don't see why that's the issue before us. Look, procedurally this is a little boring, but it seems pretty well established in the law. I read a case called Toledo Scale and then there are a bunch of cases on jurisdiction, which I'm not going to name them because I'm sure you looked at them, but Travelers Indemnity, et cetera. And it seems to me they make absolutely clear that once a litigant, you and the others, have had an opportunity to raise a matter and now the case is over, done, but for an injunction that stays in, all those issues that they previously raised or could have raised are gone; that the only question left is whether the government has complied with the injunction. So I read the injunction. The injunction says the government is enjoined from permitting the display of the Latin cross, period. Once this law takes effect and you follow it, you are violating that injunction. You don't need nine proceedings to see that. You are violating it. Now, if you don't like the injunction because you think the statute has so changed the circumstances there is no need for it, there is a remedy. You go back to the district court and you say: Judge, change the injunction. But you haven't done that. And therefore, the only question before us is whether the Ninth Circuit is right in saying when you carry the statute into effect, you are violating this injunction, which I think no one could say you aren't. Now, now, that -- that's a very technical boring issue. I don't know why we heard this issue, but I don't see how we could reach any other issue in this case.",
  "But that's not what I'm talking about.",
  "We are talking about the first. We are talking about the first injunction. The first injunction says that the government may not permit display. You've covered it up, so you are not permitting display. You are in compliance.",
  "But what the plaintiff here said is that when you comply with this statute, you will not be in compliance, because you will turn it over to the VFW that will uncover it, so you will have permitted it to be displayed. Now, that I can see is an issue before us. But I don't see any other issue before us.",
  "But just I want to just get this clear procedurally. I'm sorry. It'll take one more second. As I read this, there is no modification of any injunction. What the -- what the Respondent asked for, he said: Judge, either hold that the transfer violates the current injunction, or modify the injunction. Then what the district court did do is he said the proposed transfer violates the permanent injunction. The permanent injunction is in the, like, the third paragraph of the July 24th order, and it says, you are permanently enjoined from permitting the display of the Latin cross. Therefore, he rejected the need to modify it, and held that - -",
  "-- this violates the injunction as written, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed that. So is there any question in this case of modifying? Is there any question other than the one that I think Justice Scalia was taking a good argument about, whether the proposed statute violates the July 24th injunction? That's what the case is about. Or why am I wrong?",
  "Thank you.",
  "I see what the judge did. He said: The motion to enforce the July 24th injunction is granted. He said: Buono's motion to amend it is denied. Then he did two other things, which he listed some people and he said they are enjoined from implementing the law. Now, I take it that those paragraphs 3 and 4 are an implementation of the July 24 injunction which he granted, not a new injunction.",
  "So that's the issue here that we were just possibly debating. The issue in the case is whether the district judge might lawfully enforce an old injunction in the manner he did, which was to add paragraphs 3 and 4. That question you concede is here.",
  "It's the same argument - - it's the same argument, as if you had an APA case, and the words in the APA are \"arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion,\" so somebody who has an unfair procedure says it violates those words.",
  "And I don't really see that it's any different, except we normally go to those words before we would decide a due process question. It's the similar kind of question. Why wouldn't we do the same thing here?",
  "Can you -- could you go back for a minute? I mean, this reads as if it's very complicated, but for me, I read the AFL-CIO brief and that's what I am thinking of and it seems this is not such a hard case. Basically, there is a statute filled with words of procedure, and it isn't too difficult to interpret that statute as meaning that the board should have fair procedure, not unfair procedure. Now, if you are willing to make that giant step, the remaining issue in the case is whether the procedure here was fair or unfair. And the Seventh Circuit is filled with pages of opinion that explains why it was unfair. And the reason basically it was unfair is because no one in his right mind previous to this case would have thought that you should fill up your brief with a lot of facts that nobody's going to contest. And after this case, the board said: By the way, you have to put in a whole lot of jurisdictional facts even if nobody is going to contest them, and since you didn't do it, you are out, and we won't even give you a chance to do it now. Okay? So I read that. I thought, is there something wrong with that? And then I thought I'd ask you, because you would know.",
  "It must be what they think of as an interpretation of the rule and the statute that they already had promulgated. The rule and the statutes say, the rule says you have to include all known relevant argumentative facts. So if the circular says we mean it, we mean the facts that people are having an argument about. And then the statute says, a full statement of the facts bearing upon the dispute. And the circular and then this document say we mean a full statement of facts that somebody might think have something to do with an argument that people are having. And, so, only after this case did the board say, oh, no, you have to include some disputes that nobody is disputing, some facts that nobody has ever disputed or seems to. Now, what's -- what's the response to that?",
  "I'm right in `stating what they did? Is my statement of what they did, which was meant to be as pejorative as I could possibly make it - -",
  "-- and you are going to say, that's right, that's the correct statement of what happened?",
  "I take it your point is that there is a rule? It's called 29 CFR 301.7(b). If that rule happened to say, you must show up by 11, that would be a fair inference you don't have to show up by 10. And that rule says you have to submit the argumentative facts, so there is a fair inference you don't have to submit the facts that are not argumentative. I take it that that -- suppose that you are wrong -- suppose that you are wrong on that. I think maybe you are right, but suppose you are wrong. Suppose they have loads of authority to make rules. Again, you have a strong argument they don't, but suppose they did. In your research -- and the same question is really addressed to your fellow counsel. In your research on this, did you find any instance in which either a court or an agency does change a rule, and says: Now you have to say the date right underneath the caption, whereas previously it was stamped by the clerk. Okay? They changed the rule. And they have every good reason in the world for doing it. And then they apply it to the case in front of them, which didn't know about it, and then they won't let them change it. Now, is there any case at all which said that that was lawful? I can think of lots of cases that say you cannot apply rules retroactively where it is unfair to do it, even if you had have all the power in the world to make the rules. I have lots of cases like that. What I wondered is if anybody found a case along the lines that I just said.",
  "And because -- I mean, in the normal - -",
  "Why -- why do you have a rule? I mean, I thought -- I’ve looked up six cases, and they all say, Strickland cases in this Court, that you look at all the circumstances. Now, what I think is radical on your part -- but tell me it isn't -- is not what the rule is, but that you want one. I thought the government's view normally was the same as we -- what's the exact words -- did the conduct of the lawyer meet professional -- prevailing professional norms? And then we look to see, if it did not, whether that led to a situation where he would not have pleaded guilty but for the failure. Okay? Now, the world is filled with 42 billion circumstances. If we agree with you, we will have set in motion the great legal rule machine. And there's nothing better than lawyers spinning off rules. And we will be here from now until -- good, we won't have any docket problem, because what we'll be doing is reviewing rule after rule after rule after rule. So why has the government -- I think for the first time, maybe not -- told us to abandon Strickland's approach and start spinning off rules?",
  "No, no. But it's easy -- I mean, you know one thing we are very good at here is making up hypotheticals. So I imagine it wouldn't be that tough for me to think of a hypothetical where everyone knows this 90-year-old individual who has actually never set foot in the country that he came from, and everyone knows that if he pleads guilty to this chewing gum offense where they have virtually no evidence, he will be sent back, at age 90, to that country. I would say any lawyer would say, be careful, because if we plead guilty, back you go, on the stretcher since you can no longer walk. See, all I did was spin out a hypothetical. And the reason I can spin those out and why we have the Strickland rule is pretty clearly that you shouldn't have sub-rules here because life is more complicated than rules tell us. Just look to see prevailing norm and did it cause the harm. And that's why I am back to my question: Isn't this the first time the government has asked us to adopt rules under Strickland rather than what it says --",
  "-- which is \"case by case,\" underlined, italics, repeated in the cases?",
  "No, no, they are not asking us to have a rule. What he is saying is, look to the individual case and ask in this case, did the -- at least that's what I heard him; he's in charge of his own case. But I heard him say, look to this case, and in this case, it falls below prevailing norms for a lot of reasons.",
  "Suppose a -- a client comes in. You are a criminal lawyer and you learn the facts of the case, and it turns out that, after listening to the facts, you think he is being charged with a fairly minor offense, a year maybe max, and he tells you: You know, I have a family here, I've -- I've -- you know, he tells you this story where it is quite apparent to you that if he pleads guilty, back he goes, where he might be killed and so might his family. Just sit there and say nothing? What would you do?",
  "Yes.",
  "What would you do? I'm asking you, would you tell him? He doesn't know about the immigration law. He thinks it's just a year. You yourself have learned that he probably will be killed, as will his family, if he pleads guilty. Would you tell him that?",
  "Of course you would. And do you think of any -- can you think of any decent lawyer who wouldn't?",
  "No. Okay. Then why have you -- in this case, if they didn't tell him, why has not such a lawyer failed to meet prevailing professional norms in my hypothetical?",
  "Oh, I'm not saying whether -- you have just told me that any lawyer worth his salt, in my example, of course would tell the client, and –- in my case. And so I just asked, then has a lawyer who has failed to do so not met the prevailing professional norm? That has nothing to do with ethics or not ethics; it's how lawyers behave. I don't see how you avoid answering that question \"yes\".",
  "You just told me everyone would do it, everybody'd do it. I don't know what a norm is otherwise.",
  "Before we get to the misadvice, to put every -- dot every “i,” every lawyer would do it in my case; that's a professional norm. If a lawyer fails to do it, he hasn't met the professional norm. And a rule that's absolute would overturn Strickland in that respect, because Strickland says if you fail to meet professional norms, you are guilty of inadequate assistance of counsel, okay? So Q.E.D. Now, what’s wrong with what I just said?",
  "What would you have done? I mean, I'm -- I'm not experienced in this. But I mean, I have heard the other side and I have read the argument. And it makes sense logically to say he has the worst defendant he has ever seen. He's murdered lots of people in cold blood. He gets up on the stand and says: I'm going to kill a lot more. He sounds totally bonkers. And -- and he says to the jury, I can't tell you that what he did was not aggravating; it was terrible. I can't tell you that there's anything here that should make you feel better about him; there is nothing. But we are a nation of people who are humane and our law says don't put a person to death when he fills with his nuttiness that third prong, which is a lower standard of insanity than I had to meet. But it's clearly met and here are the experts; I point to their testimony, and that's what they said. So be humane. Now, you think he should have said something else. What?",
  "No, he -- he said why. He said. He said: We don't execute people who are crazy and this guy is crazy. He might not be crazy enough to meet the standard of not guilty by reason of insanity. He's not crazy enough to meet the standard of incompetency, but you just heard three experts tell you that he's seriously crazy. And if you don't -- if you doubt them, don't doubt your own eyes. I don't see -- how can I sit -- and we have courts, two courts who said, yeah, that was okay.",
  "Or we had at least one State court that found it okay.",
  "But I agree with all that you are saying. What I am saying my hard time is here is why wasn't this advocacy, when indeed a reasonable decision as to what constituted advocacy in those really rare circumstances where it was the worst kind of defendant he had ever seen in his life who deserved no sympathy?",
  "Well, he talked about nothing else. And I understand -- look, I am not an expert. I haven't argued these things to juries, and I recognize some lawyers tell me, okay, this was very rambling. I didn't think it was rambling. I thought he was trying to spend a lot of time explaining away to the jury some prosecutorial remark, that you shouldn't pay attention to the expert because you, yourself, the lawyer, didn't talk to them enough. And so you describe that for a couple of pages and why it was irrelevant, and the reason he talked about the -- I thought, the reason he talked about the -- how you will feel when you go out of here, is because he recognizes this is the most sensational case in this community, ever, and all your neighbors are going to congratulate you. But what you are doing here is you are applying a standard, and you are proud to be an American, and that standard, as an American, is a humane standard that requires you to not give the death penalty when the man's insane. Now, I agree that he repeated that 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 times, but it was the same point over and over. And how can I -- since there is a lower court that seemed to find this adequate, how can I sit here and say it wasn't?",
  "Didn't -- didn't they cite Strickland?",
  "Well, I guess then they concede the argument.",
  "Why do we have no idea then? If they cited Strickland, why do we have no idea what they -- ­",
  "How -- how does that work? Certainly, it's a fairly common thing, that the defendant will make -- let's say, 20 arguments, maybe he would even number them. And it's fairly common to find a court of appeals in a state that says, as to argument number 17, and then they characterize it, we reject that argument.",
  "Now, that -- that happens all the time.",
  "And, now, it's very, very common that, in making that argument, there could be some good grounds for rejecting it, and there could be some bad grounds for rejecting it. So would we send -- do we send every case like that back, to say, I want to know if you rejected it for a good reason or a bad reason?",
  "What we do is we assume they did it for a bad reason?",
  "Is there any authority for that? Because, I mean, I'm not positive of this one, but I -- I do think hearing it that suddenly habeas opinions and district court opinions would grow by an order of magnitude, because it's very common to see arguments rejected summarily.",
  "Now, is there any authority for the proposition that if they reject it summarily, that then we don't assume they are right, but rather we assume they are wrong?",
  "Well, why wouldn't you do that as well, then, even a fortiori, where I'm just an appeals court judge and I get a district court opinion? Most common thing in the world, summary judgment denied, motion denied, this denied, denied, denied. And if I'm going to start doing this for State cases, wouldn't I also have to do it for Federal cases whenever a Federal judge doesn't give all his reasons, which is the most common thing in the world?",
  "We did? I mean, I've reviewed thousands and thousands of them and I've always thought that a trial judge doesn't have to spell out all his reasons. And the question is really, given the circumstance, can we say that he acted contrary to law?",
  "If it's trial-based, you look at what the facts are that he might have taken.",
  "So you are saying -- I mean, this is very helpful to me for a variety of reasons, but is -- in your view, the correct role of the habeas judge vis-à-vis the State judge there is the same as the Federal appellate judge vis-à-vis the district judge? That is, I'm thinking of a district judge makes a finding, doesn't fully explain it. Now, I would think it would be unlawful if it's an unreasonable application of a Supreme Court case. And I know how to review that. I mean, I -- I know how to review it, I think. Okay. So you are saying however I do that, I should do the same thing and the -- but you don't -­ you don't think there is a more relaxed standard than that? You think that's basically the standard?",
  "Same -- but if they had made an explicit finding, then maybe it would be a tougher standard.",
  "All right.",
  "What is the percentage, approximately, of the river that flows into South Carolina that the three intervenors account for?",
  "Well, about.",
  "Out of what? Out of what?",
  "Well, I mean, do they account for, like -- there’s a certain amount of water in dispute. There are some people who want to intervene. Are the people who intervene -- do they account more like 1 percent of all the water that’s in dispute, or do they account for more like 50 percent? That seems like a pretty relevant question to me.",
  "You must have some idea.",
  "Well, significant – is that more like 3 percent, or is it more like 90 percent? I mean, nobody has ever bothered to look at that in this whole case?",
  "Oh, that's -- I agree. That's a good point, but -- so what percentage if –- what percentage of the interbasin transfers do they account for?",
  "Okay.",
  "So insofar -- so insofar as what they are after is interbasin transfers, just what Justice Scalia said is correct. These are the interbasin transfer people.",
  "That’s helpful.",
  "Well, how is just this involved? Is there -- because I am amazed that this is now coming to me for the first time. All this case is about is interbasin transfers and that you account for 100 percent of them, you three. Is that -- is that right? Because I suspect in, like, 5 minutes, somebody might tell me it's not right.",
  "I -- that's not my question.",
  "I want -- I’m trying –- look, if Alaska sued California and the complaint was we want San Francisco back, San Francisco might have a right to intervene. But if it was about California generally, maybe they wouldn't. So what I want to know is, what's the water that is at issue in this complaint and how much of the water that is at issue in this complaint do the three intervenors account for? That seems like a fairly simple empirical question.",
  "That's what I'm trying to get the answer to.",
  "I mean, he was just talking about probable cause. How could that be duplicative?",
  "Look, I thought this case, though I grant you I could well be wrong, is not about a final forfeiture hearing where you have to show that it's more probable than not that the car was used for drugs. But under the Illinois law, just as Justice Alito said, you can seize a car without a warrant.",
  "And there are lists of circumstances. But in the Florida statute that Justice Thomas wrote about, it said that a person whose car it is, is entitled to a hearing, I thought, in a brief time to see if there was probable cause, just as a person arrested. You have to bring them before a magistrate within a short time to see if there's probable cause. Now, how do you do that in Chicago?",
  "So you're saying the answer to the question is there is no way? A person who doubts this probable cause has no way. He has to wait 6 months until there's a forfeiture hearing. He's out of luck because then it merges with the merits.",
  "Okay. That’s your answer. There is no way.",
  "Then I don't see why you win this case.",
  "What?",
  "I mean, is there a way or not? You have pointed to three statutes. Do they give him any way?",
  "Look --",
  "Am I right that what is –- what is the rationale your supporting it for the following: My car was parked on the street. There happened to be some big drug crime nearby, and the policeman took my car. In my opinion, there was no probable cause. I would like my car back. Now, I take it that in Illinois there is no proceeding, as there was in Florida, so that I can claim there was no probable cause, and I -- none at all. I never get that determination made; and, moreover, I have to wait, for 6 months possibly, before I get a different determination made, which is whether they had –- more likely than not, whether that's entitled to forfeiture on the merit. Is that the law? If anything like it is the law, what’s the constitutional justification for it?",
  "You mean they can keep my car even if it's more likely than not that it was never involved?",
  "But it's still -- okay, fine.",
  "Thank you. That is – all right. That's a burden of proof thing at the final thing. That's not the thrust of my question. The thrust of my question is: Do I have to wait for up to 6 months before I have any magistrate, any neutral official, pass on my claim there was no probable cause to take my car?",
  "And the Florida statute, by the way, doesn't do that. It says of course you get a hearing on probable cause.",
  "Am I right?",
  "Okay. So nobody gives you -- they go around taking cars even without probable cause. There’s no way to do -- it happens in every State. What’s the constitutional justification for making a person wait for 6 months before he gets a neutral judicial official to say whether there was even cause to take his car?",
  "But if I have a different position, which is I’d like to see if it's practical to decide this case now, two things stand in the way in my mind which I’d like you to address. The first is your opponents are saying, no, you shouldn't really address this issue now because there are three Illinois statutes which actually give them, anyone who wants it, a right to a hearing at least on probable cause. And that's a matter of Illinois law. And although the statutes don't seem to say it, they might. And the second is that this seems mixed up in my mind -- not necessarily your fault; it may be my mind -- but it seems to me there are two quite separate questions: when you are entitled to a final hearing of whether forfeiture is right or wrong; and whether you are entitled to a preliminary hearing on whether there was probable cause under the statute to obtain the car. Now, that latter question I think might be impractical in many cases to work out until there's been a trial of an individual who's accused of a crime, which may be much later. But the former question is where I think you have a point, that there are five instances here in this statute where a policeman could seize a car without a warrant and he has to have probable cause under most of them nonetheless. So your clients might say: He did not have probable cause; I want a neutral magistrate to contest it. Now, in my mind that reaches -- that's a different question than the final hearing about who's entitled to the car. And I also see the three statutes and now I see a case where here in front of me everything is mixed up. So I think -- perhaps I'm just seeing it that way, but those issues are mixed up confused and not separated out. So why don't we wait? What's your answer now?",
  "Okay, can we --",
  "Go ahead. Finish.",
  "Well, can I get to the merits for a second?",
  "Go back to what Justice Alito and Justice Sotomayor were asking. This statute gives a policeman the right to seize some property without a warrant if it's a circumstance where you could seize a person without a warrant. That’s basically what it says, doesn't it?",
  "All right. In that kind of situation, I would think maybe you are entitled to a quick hearing where the only subject would be: Was that language carried out? Was that policeman right? Was there probable cause, or wasn't there? Now, if that's the issue, I don't see why you give up at all on the baseball card. I mean, if somebody comes into my house and takes a baseball card, and he's supposed to have probable cause and he doesn't, I don't see why I can't go get a judge or a magistrate, determine whether he had at my baseball card, and pretty quickly, too.",
  "But if you go to the other --",
  "If you go to the other, which is whether there’s an innocent owner or whether in fact you should give bail to the property -- I mean, that's -- I know we give bail to people, but I don't know that we give bail to property. Maybe real property, but that seems a much more complex argument. So I want to know: What's your authority that we should give bail to the property and have a hearing on that?",
  "And why do you give up in respect to baseball cards or anything in effect to the first?",
  "What is the overhead?",
  "What is the overhead? I mean, that's something that I find interesting and important, and I can't find it anywhere. The numbers began to bother me in the same way they did with Justice Alito. I’m thinking: There are 30,000 hours. They got 10.5 million. That translates into, what is it, $350 an hour. Now, if the lawyer works for 2,000 hours of the year, which is a little high, he is being compensated at $700,000 on average in this case. But he has to pay overhead. So what's that? 40 percent? 30? 20?",
  "Well, I mean, if you have any rough idea at all, because I think if it's anywhere near $700,000 on average, you say to a taxpayer: You are going to pay this, and that's more money than 99 percent of the taxpayers hope to see in their lives, and suddenly they are paying that money to somebody, which is -- I could say: Okay, pay them 400,000. That's what he would get as the average fee for the toppest, most top lawyer. And that's, you know, pretty high. And -- but $700,000 a year for a lawyer. Wow. And that's what this judge paid. Now, what is it that came out of that? That's what I want to know before I make up my mind, frankly. And I'm going to try to look it up, but I'm trying -- I'm trying to get a rough idea here.",
  "Oh, I know, but --",
  "-- that doesn't help me, and the reason it doesn't help me is because if it's a very, very high number in dollars per year, then I am tempted to think: Well, very high is enough. You don't need very, very, very high. You see my point?",
  "Yes. I would be saying: Be satisfied forever with very, very high, the most top pay that any top lawyer gets; do not want even more than that. And if in fact I doubt that I have really made a difference to incentives on that one, for the reason that the Solicitor General said -- and my goodness, how do we explain this to the average person? That -- those are the questions that are genuinely going through my mind. I haven't made up my mind how I will come out in this case. So it's not a kind of putting this to you. I don't know.",
  "Should I -- should I look at the fact that, in the early 1970s, when this was done, legal fees were not quite so high? And perhaps, comparatively so, they weren't quite so high, either.",
  "Not just inflation. I think the discrepancy between these top legal fees and the fee of the average person -- or the work of the average person, the average wage for a family of four has changed quite a lot. I suspect that's true, but I could look it up. But should I look it up?",
  "Suppose the reason -- suppose the reason that they did that -- suppose they are very honest about their reasons, and they say, we think class actions are very often a very good thing, because a lot of people who are hurt can get some recovery and it acts as a deterrent. But there is some bad things about them. And one of the bad things is, somebody files a lawsuit, and before you know it, the litigation expenses are so high that the company feels it has to settle. Now, in our view that latter factor predominates. And that means that these procedures, class actions, will sometimes -- too often -- lead to the unjust, inefficient settlement of disputes. And that's why we are doing it.",
  "All right, if that's exactly what we did, why isn't that second-guessing the judgment of the rule that they are saying it is efficient -- an inefficient procedure. It is inefficient in terms of the object of -- of the Federal rules and what the class wanted. We want efficient methods of achieving justice.",
  "Overdeterrence because they feel that the class action procedure is one that leads to forcing companies to settle, and to that extent the class action procedure does not lead to the efficient determination of disputes but to the inefficient and unjust determination. That's their honest reason.",
  "No, it does. It says it’s the judicial process that does it.",
  "It's the judicial process and its expanse --",
  "-- that forces the settlements that create unjust results.",
  "That may be, and suppose they said, you know, a 30-day period for appeal creates unjust results in our opinion, and therefore we think it is more efficient to have a 90-day appeal period. That wouldn't last for 2 seconds, wouldn't it?",
  "So how is this different?",
  "Suppose you were appointed to a committee, just set my pay, that might be helpful. I'd say I'll pay you $50,000 a year to do it, as long as I am satisfied with your results. Now, would you, for example, not have in your mind, I would like to know what he's paid by other people that don't have someone like me setting his pay? Wouldn't that be in your mind?",
  "Yeah, so wouldn't that be a normal question to ask?",
  "Well, I don't know if they asked it -- I mean, I think we are reviewing the district court opinion, I think we are reversing -- we are reviewing -- sorry. We're reviewing.",
  "I have laryngitis; I don't speak accurately.",
  "I think we are reviewing a -- a decision of a court of appeals setting a standard, and so wouldn't, when we set the standard, say, we can't say if in every case you are not going to go out and ask him what he charges when he mows the neighbor's lawn, but we would like to know what he charges when he asks for money from people who do not have this kind of supervision, and we would like if it's a lot different to ask him why.",
  "Okay, so what's the problem then with saying that in the opinion?",
  "Well, it's pretty unusual that it won't be, and I think certainly you have in the case in front of us a case where it would be relevant. You may have an answer to the question. There may be a perfectly good answer, so let's listen to it.",
  "The answer dispositive? Well, I don't see it should be dispositive, maybe the answers would be quite different.",
  "All right. So -- but you no objection, then I'm not sure there is much of an issue. There might -- I mean, maybe there is some. That's the only issue, whether this should be dispositive always, or whether it should be a factor to take into account where relevant?",
  "So you have no objection to send it back and say look, of course this is relevant, perhaps quite often relevant; why don't you look at it?",
  "What do we do about Gartenberg? That is to say, the key sentence you can read either way. The key sentence could mean -- it just depends on tone of voice. You must charge a fee that is not so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not -- could not have been the product of arms-length bargaining. Or you could say, look, it's unlawful where it's so large -- it doesn't -- where there is no reasonable relationship. And if there is no reasonable relationship, how could it have been the product of arm's-length bargaining?",
  "You object if we turn them upside down?",
  "Well, I'm saying the tone, be a little careful here.",
  "So we can say the substance is -- I'm just trying this out -- the substance is to look and see if it's reasonable, and if it's reasonable it certainly is the product of arm-length bargaining, if it's not reasonable, how could it be? Got to get an answer to that, okay? So, that way you see the tone is be careful, you are a judge, you are not a rate-setter. How's that?",
  "I thought, by reversing that, picking out what the essence was, you would get pretty close to what you are arguing for, without getting into all this thing of whether it's just like a trustee or whether a lawyer should be a trustee or - - you know, there are a lot of questions here that could float around, of any language we use.",
  "So they are going to say, I imagine below -- I'm not sure -- say: Look, that's right, and Doctor talked about the shift from mandatory to discretionary, and the district court -- the State, in Doctor, said that it was a mandatory -- it's mandatory. But in this case, the district court said it's discretionary. So insofar as there are two rules -- or were at the time, your client got the benefit of the most liberal, and, therefore, insofar as there is a difference, it made no difference.",
  "How would you fill in this sentence? I'm beginning where the Chief Justice did. Say everybody said: Look, this opinion is at least unclear. It's -- everybody agrees that the simple existence of discretion does not make a State ground inadequate, so we send it back for you now. And you will have some good arguments, I guarantee each side will have some good arguments, as to whether they were being consistent or not, whether there was a consistent rule or not.",
  "Now, next sentence, which maybe would never be written: This is not to say that discretion automatically means it's adequate, for it could be applied inconsistently. Now, there could be another sentence, because that other sentence would have to go on to the fact that any discretionary rule will never be applied with perfect consistency or anywhere near it. That would be true if you give a trial judge the choice in his discretion to waive a -- a time limit ruling. Some will do it with one. Some will do it in the other. You can't do it perfectly. So is there any sentence we could put in there? So you hedged on there, and probably they will, too, because it's very hard to find the right sentence. You don't want the simple application of discretion, you say -- which inevitably means some inconsistency, to make a State rule inadequate. On the other hand, they can't go too far. So what is too far?",
  "But, but, but, but, but, a trial Supreme Court -- a Supreme Court in a State is supervising lots of trial courts, and you will have different human beings sitting there as judges, and they will inevitably be inconsistent with each other to some degree. Have you not noticed that?",
  "So is there anything we can say that will improve the situation? That's why I started out by saying maybe the best thing is to say nothing.",
  "In that case -- in that case, I guess there wouldn't be a -- a lawsuit.",
  "I mean, in that case, the debtor is never going to object. So we're never going to have that one.",
  "Why? I mean, you sit down with the creditors, and you look at the list and you try to work things out. That meeting goes on as long as you want. And if it appears there’s an argument about valuation, you file an objection.",
  "If it appears everybody can work everything out, fine. What's the problem?",
  "The rule is -- and that's what it's about -- the rule is about where you object, the trustee objects to the list. The list.",
  "That's called Schedule C. If you have an objection to the list, then it says: Here's what you do, trustee. Meet with the creditors, try to work it out. And if in fact 30 days thereafter and you don't need any more time, so you don't ask the judge for more time, file an objection.",
  "What's the problem?",
  "That sounds very complicated. I -- I mean, the thing that sort of persuaded me so far on this is this is what Collier says, the other side -- it's what all the bankruptcy judges. Ambro is a bankruptcy judge. This is a simpler thing.",
  "Look at the procedural rule. It's just what I’ve said. It says: If you have an objection to the list of property -- the list of property is C, okay? So here's what you do, trustee: Sit down with the creditors. See if there's really an argument. Now, if there's no argument, fine; they'll let you do what you want. If there is an argument and it has to do with that list, C, particularly valuation, which is what these things are all about, then file your objection. That's so simple. And it seems in most places they do it. So why do we want to run around Robin's barn or something to get somewhere we can get to much simpler?",
  "But Rule 403 doesn't say that. My Rule 403 says: \"A party in interest may file an objection to the list of property claimed as –- as exempt within 30 days after the meeting.\" Okay?",
  "It says “the list.” So that's where I think you're becoming awfully legalistic, to try to distinguish between the list and the property in A and B. I mean, what do you -- these are about valuation, says Collier. That's all we're interested in.",
  "Do you have any sense of how it works in practice? I'm a little worried by Justice Kennedy's question, because the government says in practice what's been happening is that in most places, trustees don't -- they don't object to these kinds of valuations problems, and now suddenly when the rule has changed in some circuit, they do object as a matter of form, which is unnecessary paperwork. The impression I had from reading Collier, and it was -- the opposite was so, that normally when you have the creditors’ meeting, things would appear, what was a problem or what wasn't, and the creditor would then file an -- or the trustee would then file an objection. Well, what is the case? How does the practice work? I'm -- I’m pretty uncertain. I'm not a bankruptcy expert.",
  "Yes, but how did it work normally for years and years? You'd go into a committee meeting of creditors. They'd get into an argument about the valuation. I'm sure that happened.",
  "And when that happened, did trustees file objections within 30 days or didn't they?",
  "How do we know that? I mean, I was impressed by Ambro. Isn't he the judge here?",
  "He had been a bankruptcy judge, so maybe he knows.",
  "Now, I don't know who knows, because I'm worried the government has looked into this, and somebody's telling them who knows it's the opposite.",
  "I'm very confused because of your answer to Justice Sotomayor. I thought what you were saying -- she said, well, you only have 30 days; you get all this value. That doesn't say very much. You said, well -- you -- you said less. Okay?",
  "You said less time. Which isn't much of an answer, but it's something. Now, I would have thought you were going to say but it's 30 days from the creditors’ meeting ending, and that's a movable feast that could last 5 years. You could keep postponing it. You can go to the judge and say, Judge, give me an extension, which he'll do. So there's no problem here. But you didn't say that. So the fact that you didn't say that suggests to me you're not certain about what this practical impact is.",
  "You are certain?",
  "All right. How long do these creditors’ meetings last? How easy are they to postpone? How -- how easy is it for the trustee to get this information together during the creditors’ meeting, et cetera, et cetera? Where do I look to find out the answer to that question?",
  "It isn't in the case.",
  "This is a case in which, as I think most cases where they approve contracts, what they're finding is that the contract rate in this circumstance, or here the settlement rate in this circumstance, is a just and reasonable rate, because. All right? So what are we supposed to do? I mean, are you going to say he's wrong, the lower court's wrong, because they got the whole thing mixed up. I mean –- could we say that?",
  "But then if we were to do that --",
  "But you would -- would you agree with my assumptions there?",
  "That what this case is about -- and it's a fortiori from the ordinary contract case -- is that sometimes an agency, because of particular economic circumstances, concludes that a particular rate-setting system is a just and reasonable system, and once that's in place, then as part of that system is the rule you can only challenge it when it violates the public interest, for example. Now, you can go and attack the whole business on the ground the whole business is an abuse of discretion or it departs from the statute. But if the whole business is okay, that's the end of it.",
  "Now, have I just said the correct law in your view or not?",
  "Sorry?",
  "But I'm not interested in if you have a back-up or not. I'm interested in, is it correct or not?",
  "How can we? I mean, that's a -- why not answer a case -- a question about employment discrimination law? Where -- where in this FERC thing does this say that these are contracts of a kind that Mobile-Sierra was about? I mean, I don't even know if Mobile-Sierra -- whether you could -- a third party could attack such a contract under public – under a just and reasonable standard, unless I knew first what the Commission thought about it in this context, because then the Commission's question would be: Is that a reasonable view? So what am I supposed to do here?",
  "We would have to take it on the assumption -- wait, I don't want -- you have 5 minutes left that you're reserving?",
  "What's the assumption? The assumption is the court of appeals thinks that the contract between -- among the generating -- the generators, that that is a Mobile-Sierra contract. So we're supposed to say, if that were a Mobile-Sierra contract, which it isn't, then we should decide whether a third party could attack it, about which the Commission has said nothing. Is that right?",
  "The transition rates?",
  "But the reasonableness depends upon the other. The validity depends upon the other. It's all part of a package.",
  "That's all true, but I would want to know what the Commission thought about that one, too.",
  "Why?",
  "Why are you powerless?",
  "Why don't you to go to the Commission and say: Commission, there is always special circumstances. You may think that in this kind of situation, which is a special situation, that the public interest standard, whether it's in a contract or whether it's in a tariff or wherever you want to put it, is the right standard for review. You may think that. But you don't think it for yourselves, you don't think it for somebody else, and here's some reasons why you don't think it for us. And if they agree with your reasons, they'll say: Fine, go ahead. And if they don't, they don't. Why aren't you exactly as powerful or powerless as anybody else?",
  "My point is if you don't like that as applied to your situation, you have a remedy. That's what the public -- that's why they're there, agencies. They are there to listen to you and give you a remedy, and the remedy is, if you convince them you shouldn't be subject to that, they'll say fine; and otherwise not. Why are you coming to us who know nothing about natural gas and asking us to do it?",
  "It's electricity.",
  "Then you're going to say you mean they never can do it, but it's well settled. It's well settled that they sometimes can say -- I mean, my point is this: I just found the quote I was looking for. So I was thinking natural gas. It applies to electricity capacity, too. Justice Jackson: \"The wealth of Midas and the wit of man cannot produce or reproduce a natural gas field.\" That applies to electricity capacity. We can't reproduce it. You can't. The Commission devises a system for trying to get it done, and if they do it reasonably, they win.",
  "The standard -- the statute is \"just and reasonable.\" That calls up a whole mechanism from the 1930s. I thought that it is long -- we're long past that point, that -- that whatever Brandeis thought it was, which they did in the thirties and forties, that it has also been interpreted to include the power to the Commission to deviate from that, because they find, for example, contract rates under certain circumstances to be just and reasonable, even though you don't use cost-of-service ratemaking.",
  "So is the answer then maybe where Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia were going, that -- because where I’m coming from, why I have been asking this, is I actually think the answer to the question so far on the question presented is \"sometimes.\" Sometimes you can't; sometimes you can. And it depends on a lot of things -- situations, circumstances, arguments to commissions, what they held, et cetera. So maybe that's the thing to do, you answer the question, say \"sometimes.\" Sometimes they can use one; sometimes it's the other. Indeed, in this very case, they've argued that it's -- that it's not even within the mainstream of Mobile-Sierra. And maybe that's so, maybe it's not. Send it back, say it depends on circumstances, time, et cetera. And then they can argue all these things out that we've just been hearing. What about that?",
  "So are you aware of any law or any statement by any judge, ever, that exempts the -- the FERC from the basic requirement that its rules, regulations, and everything else not be arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion?",
  "No. Okay. Thank you.",
  "And so, as long as that's so, I guess you could mount a challenge on the ground that to apply the contract regime system to circumstance X, Y, and Z, without permitting your challenge that you want, is, in fact, a violation of the APA, at the least. Okay? Now, that's why I say \"sometimes.\" Could you imagine such a situation, which I think is what Justice Sotomayor was getting at, or do you want it all the time? If you want it all the time, I'm not -- you're not getting sympathy from me. If want to say there could be such a time, maybe. I think I could think of five. All right? So -- so where are we?",
  "Before you get to Anza, this might be a good time to ask because I don't think we focused on this in Pasquantino. But if in fact the failure of a State to collect a tax is property, then why isn't every corporation that files an income tax return and makes two false statements automatically liable for RICO? I mean - -",
  "Well, that would mean the States have a new method, which I don't think they use, a new method of collecting treble taxes from anyone who makes two false statements or a false statement in two income tax returns, and it would seem to me that would have vast repercussions. I mean, it might be very beneficial; the States are having a deficit crisis; but - -",
  "How, how -- why would it not be - -",
  "But they left -- they don't have the RICO predicate, not paying your State taxes. But in effect you would read into the RICO predicate protecting States.",
  "That may be, but nobody focused on this issue. So -- so that's what's bothering me. What is the -- what is the stopping place?",
  "Or is there one? And if there is none, how do we reconcile this view of - - they're suggesting a stopping place, Anza and Pasquantino to the contrary. Right. But they're suggesting a stopping place on a matter that hasn't come up.",
  "Or focused on. It's come up but not focused on.",
  "So in your view California - -",
  "-- which has a $10 billion deficit, could go through, find every instance where a corporation made two false statements in two tax returns, one in each, and collect treble what they're owed.",
  "It doesn't say systematic understatement.",
  "It says two - -",
  "-- predicate acts.",
  "And the predicate acts are a deliberate false statement.",
  "If they did, then why didn't they put in not paying your State tax returns as a predicate act?",
  "Oh, well, that cuts against you.",
  "Because if they put in one, your theory -- they don't even need, whether they need that or not. Your theory applies to every tax, every tax.",
  "No, but go back to my question.",
  "My question is, forget the cigarette taxes. If I accept your argument, am I then saying that California, New York, and every other State that's owed money by corporations in their taxes can go through, look for two tax returns that have a false statement in them that were mailed in, and thereby collect RICO damages?",
  "Well, that's a pretty far-reaching - -",
  "Do you know anybody, any court that has ever said that?",
  "Why would - -",
  "If Congress wanted that result, why didn't they put in as a predicate act not paying your income tax or not paying your State tax?",
  "All right. So I think that their response to the mail and fraud is, you're right, it is all mail -- it is all mail fraud. All these tax violations, in fact every one, you mail in your tax return normally.",
  "So all of these would be mail fraud. But mail fraud is not a treble damages statute. And therefore the question is who will prosecute, State or Federal? So normally it's State if it's a State tax. But it's one thing to say Congress didn't care about that and quite another thing to say that Congress didn't care if the States were going to use this in order to collect three times what the taxes are owed. And so they're looking for a way to cut off this tax liability for ordinary, simpleminded tax - - failure to pay your State taxes. And that's why they've hit on this idea of the antitrust. I don't know if that's a satisfactory idea. I don't see the solution. I think I see the problem.",
  "Well, why is it that you haven't argued -- why haven't you - -",
  "Why is that relevant as far as cause is concerned?",
  "On cause, why isn't it a causal connection for them to say, look, your clients don't tell them who's bought it. They're supposed to, but they don't. And if we got the information, we go write a letter to the people, and half of them would pay.",
  "Yeah.",
  "But why isn't that a direct applicant action, but for foreseeable?",
  "Yeah. I know, but there is more here. It is also foreseeable proximate cause. I mean, it is absolutely foreseeable, not just but for.",
  "Forget the website. What if there had been no website?",
  "Is it foreseeable that, when they don't know who owes the money, that the people won't pay, but when they know who owes the money, they can write them a letter, and half pay?",
  "Some pay. Some don't. They have the numbers there. They get more than half.",
  "And, if you put people in front of railroad trains and half survive, then it's speculative?",
  "I mean, if you put somebody in front of a railroad train and half survive because they jumped, does that make it a speculative cause?",
  "And you say it's foreseeable that they won't get a lot of money. And that's what they're arguing?",
  "Now, what's the answer to that?",
  "The reason is because of what your clients did, so it's but for and foreseeable.",
  "End of case. Now, we go to the damage section.",
  "I took torts a long time ago. I thought that was part of it.",
  "No, no. There can be other things that cut it off. Proximate cause. Foreseeable. No kind of an event that would cut the causal chain, like some odd fluke or something.",
  "No policy reason or others for cutting the chain. I mean, it's Torts 1 in 1962, okay?",
  "Why do we need that theory? I mean, why not just say what Newman said and the others said? There is no free-standing right. There is just a right not to convict a person with made-up evidence, and of course a prosecutor insofar as he's involved in the prosecutorial stage is absolutely immune. But if he's involved in the investigatorial stage of that event, well, then he's not immune absolutely. That's a policy decision. That has nothing to do with free-standing rights.",
  "All right. Then I'm making that argument.",
  "Mere foreseeability. You can fill in those boundaries, Toffler, not Toffler, as you wish. But the basic theory isn't a problem because, after all, we're just drawing a line somewhere within the stage of an ongoing tort on the basis of policy, and Buckley suggests such a line. I don't see a conceptual problem there, is my problem. Maybe there are practical problems, but I don't see a conceptual one.",
  "I interrupt you right there. I would say they are not absolutely immune for the whole constitutional offense. That's the line I'm trying to draw.",
  "So I agree with you on that. I agree with you. I won't do it. I'll take it as one tort. Began before the investigation stage, ends with conviction. One tort. Now, within that tort we draw a line and we draw a line based on policy purposes as to when the prosecutor is absolutely or qualifiedly immune, and where that line comes is Buckley, approximately. Okay? Now, I don't see a conceptual problem with that and I'm having a hard time finding a practical problem.",
  "There's a different tendency, which I would say this is a slight fluke, what you're describing. I'm more worried about what Justice Alito brought up, that, other things being equal, I think it's probably a good thing to get prosecutors involved in the questioning process. That -- that has a kind of check on the police. And the concern I'd have is that the --this will discourage the prosecutors from becoming involved in the witness -- witness questioning process, at least not before the police are well on the way. And that is a very negative incentive, I would think. So what is your most pro-prosecutorial rule that you could live with that will in fact minimize the risk of that kind of disincentive? Now, are you just going to say, well, Buckley?",
  "Or is there something -- I mean, I can see Buckley with the, you know, probable cause. It turns on and off as you're talking to the witness. First what he says, you have the probable cause; then you don't; then you do; then you don't. I mean, I -- I'm not -- I just want you to give your best thought to this problem and tell me what is the most safe rule that will allow you to win your case?",
  "We have amicus briefs here that give us a lot of reason. They say -- they say it's very discouraging to, you know, AUSAs or DAs going in and talking to the witnesses with the police.",
  "And they say they do it in Chicago, I think. In other places, they do it a lot.",
  "Well, also, you're making me more worried because I think, if 85 percent of all the defendants -- or 90 percent plead guilty, it might be a highly desirable thing to get prosecutors involved in the truth-discovering process, I mean, so that they don't just see themselves as the job of -- well, we're going to take somebody, put them in jail. Maybe -- maybe that's a reason for pushing it back a little bit, this -- this line.",
  "Where have you got it now? You've got it as when there is probable cause for believing that someone has committed a crime?",
  "Someone? So it's someone -- needn't be the particular person they eventually indict?",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "Do I have it right, in your opinion, so far? I'm just interested in the relationship between (d) and (e), and as I read it, just to look at the language, it seems to me, in the (d) case, we're talking about something that was decided on a record in a State court. And you -- you're the lawyer, trying to get the Federal judge to say, that's all wrong. You're going to say their facts are wrong, their fact-finding. So you say: Judge, that was unreasonable, you know, in light of the record. That's what you do under (d)(2)?",
  "Now, (e) is a different situation. (E) is a situation where, for some reason or other -- and there are a few -- you are having a new hearing in the Federal court. One reason for having such a hearing could be that there was a factual predicate that couldn't have been discovered and it's very important. So you're get into that Federal court hearing. And now, when you're in the Federal court hearing it turns out that in the earlier State court hearing there was a fact-finding that has something to do with this. It may be not so important, but it's over there and you want to get the judge to ignore it. So there you have to show what (d)(2) says. You have the burden of saying that that was an unreasonable fact-finding. That's what it says. Those different words make -- seem sensible to me because the proceeding is different, and the way we talk about the proceedings is a little bit different. But as a practical reality, I guess they come to about the same thing. All right. Now, forgetting my last comment, have I got the first part right as you understand it?",
  "Well, what's an example?",
  "I can't think of any - - give me an example - -",
  "-- where you're trying to proceed under (d)(2), and (e)(1) is somehow relevant. Couldn't think of one.",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "No. You just look at them, and you look under (d)(2), and you say this is an unreasonable determination of fact, period. There's no reason to go into (e)(1). I mean, if it is an unreasonable determination of fact, he wins.",
  "And if it isn't, you win.",
  "It didn't say that. What it says in (e)(1) is (e)(1) is talking about in a proceeding instituted by an application by a person in custody, the factual issue is presumed correct. But if you fail to develop -- - you know, in a proceeding, it's presumed correct. You're right it doesn't say it literally. But I can't figure out an application for it unless they're talking about where there is a new hearing. Otherwise there is just no need for it, it is just repetitive and it gets people mixed up, and (d)(2) does all the work.",
  "I see that, I see that.",
  "That's a possible way to look at it.",
  "And the problem I see with that -- now I see why it's controverted, but the problem with these standards of review, it just -- it mixes people up, and it sounds as if you're bringing in a hammer after you've brought in a saw, and the hammer looks a little tougher than the saw, and -- but why get into all this business?",
  "Well, we have one here, and my real objection, I guess -- and it's interesting, I now see the conflict, with Justice Alito's clear explanation of it. And I -- I suppose the -- the thing I would ask you then is, look, my objection to it, hypothetically, is it's too complicated. Lawyers have enough trouble trying to figure this out.",
  "Is there any reason we need to interpret it that way? The language doesn't have to be. Why not have just a simple, clear thing? If -- if they're unreasonable, the State loses, and if they're not unreasonable, the State wins. Da-da. That's too simple. But why not use it?",
  "If that's so, why would we not soon have what I call the habeas corpus jurisprudence of what is a subsidiary and what is a major fact and what is a finding? And what's wonderful about that is no habeas corpus proceeding will ever end because, throughout the country, people will make mistakes about what is the - - what is the subsidiary and the subsidiary to the subsidiary, and then what is the more general, and pretty soon, we'll have all -- everybody will be arguing about that, and there will only be four professors in the country who understand which is which, and they will each say different things.",
  "Can you do what you have just done with the category non-homicide cases?",
  "Life without parole?",
  "Under the age of 18 when committed?",
  "One hundred and eleven. Of those 111, how many are in Florida?",
  "Seventy-seven. And of the remaining, how many States are they in?",
  "Six.",
  "You say it's suspect. What is your opinion, so far as you can do it, following category: Non-homicide, life without parole, under the age of 18 when committed?",
  "Not in your own system?",
  "You don't know how many people in Florida --",
  "Non-homicide, life without parole, under the age of 18 when committed.",
  "And they say 77?",
  "What? Sorry.",
  "Okay. Let's -- let's count it their way. Let's say that a -- non-homicide --",
  "So -- so in your example, Mr. Smith was sentenced to life without parole for a robbery. Then you said Mr. Smith also killed someone. Now, was he convicted of killing someone?",
  "Yes. Okay. And so did the judge have in front of him the conviction for the killing of the person as well as for the burglary or whatever?",
  "Yes. Okay. So I think I could count that as a homicide offense. I understand your point. Now, let's suppose that we take those out of it; in other words, for argument's purpose, concede that where there is also a homicide offense, it counts as homicide, not in the set I am asking you about. I’m asking you about the set of those non-homicide offenses, life without parole, and they were under the age of 18 when committed. How many in Florida?",
  "Even though you gave -- said that the reason for the difference was a set of instances that I just asked you to put to the side.",
  "So, what is the right -- go ahead.",
  "I mean, I think if you want to address it, that the basic argument here is we want a bright line. And the justification for the bright line is (a) it's pretty unusual to have this. So that is one part of the clause. And in respect to it being cruel, you go back to what is supposed to be some kind of rough, basic connection between criminal law and generally accepted principles of morality. And the confusion and uncertainty about the moral responsibility of a 13-year-old is such that it is not -- it is a cruel thing to do to remove from that individual his entire life. You say we’re at the extreme. Now that's roughly what’s perking around in my mind, and I would like you to reply to that.",
  "That wasn't my point. I guess I wasn't clear. My point was, of course, there can be cases in any set which go in all kinds of different directions. But, as a general matter, human beings are uncertain about how much moral responsibility to assign to individuals in a particular category, and that category roughly corresponds with an age of maturity. So you get into arguments when you get to 10, no; 11, no; 17, yes maybe; 16, yes maybe. But as long as we are around 3 years old, 5, 7, 9, 12, and they want to say certainly 14, we are in that area of ambiguity. And not just we, people all over America, some thinking one way, some thinking another. And that's enough to cut the connection with morality, a strong enough connection that could justify taking the person's entire life away. You see, I'm trying to make a general argument, and maybe I haven't stated it perfectly. But if you can get the drift of what I'm talking about, I would like to hear your reply.",
  "Do you want to comment on the district court, the -- the -- what -- what the -- your opponent says is that this Florida rule is a rule as the district court applied it that said the following: You have to file a challenge within 2 years. There are three exceptions to that. One and three clearly don't apply. And as to two, Roper isn't clear enough to make it apply. Their response to that is there is no Florida law that says you have to challenge a sentence within 2 years. That Florida courts -- and then they have, like, 14 cases listed here. And the Supreme Court of Florida has said that when you are trying to correct an illegal sentence, that whole part of the statute does not apply. Okay? What's the response to that?",
  "Okay. So what I should do is go look up and see what those cases hold, and -- and you said to the lower court or the court of appeals -- you said their argument is wrong. The 2-year statute does apply. The 2-year statute does apply. There are three exceptions, and you do not fit within section (B) because. Where did you say that?",
  "So the State didn't even deny what he was saying?",
  "So the State -- he says that whole section doesn't apply. There is no 2-year statute. And you say Florida did not reply in a brief to that argument?",
  "All right.",
  "In any case, there is a circularity point here, I guess. If we were to say in our opinion -- if we were to say that Roper does hold that there is a fundamental constitutional right which we extend to this case and it applies here, and it applies to the -- retroactively to those whose -- certainly those who are raising the issue, then we would send it back and Florida now would not bar it under this statute, because it would fall squarely within the exception. Is that right?",
  "Well, if you leave something out, Congress can put it back in, tailoring the protection to what they feel is necessary. But if it covers everything under the sun, I've never seen a case where Congress would take something out. Now, if we are relying on Congress, I guess the circuit would say, let's go narrow, and we won’t have -- you know -- since you referred to Congress, I thought I would bring that up and see what you think.",
  "So that would mean that every -- every businessman -- perhaps not every, but every successful businessman typically has something. His firm wouldn't be successful if he didn't have anything that others didn't have. He thinks of a new way to organize. He thinks of a new thing to say on the telephone. He thinks of something. That's how he made his money. And your view would be -- and it's new, too, and it's useful, made him a fortune -- anything that helps any businessman succeed is patentable because we reduce it to a number of steps, explain it in general terms, file our application, granted?",
  "Okay. Well then, if that were so, we go back to the original purpose of the Constitution. Do you think that the Framers would have wanted to require anyone successful in this great, vast, new continent because he thinks of something new to have had to run to Washington and to force any possible competitor to do a search and then stop the wheels of progress unless they get permission? Is that a plausible view of the patent clause?",
  "So you are going to answer this question yes. You know, I have a great, wonderful, really original method of teaching antitrust law, and it kept 80 percent of the students awake. They learned things --",
  "It was fabulous. And I could probably have reduced it to a set of steps, and other teachers could have followed it. That you are going to say is patentable, too?",
  "Okay. Fine. Now, suppose I reject that view, hypothetically, and suppose I were to take the view that this is way too far, that that’s not the purpose of the statute. Suppose for hypothetical's sake I'm still a little nervous about that -- that circuit's decision there. Have you any suggestion for me?",
  "That's exactly what I -- maybe I can get you to inadvertently help by -- a hypothesis you don't like. That's why I say it's inadvertent. You said there are two things. There are actually four things in the patent law which everyone accepts. There are two that are plus and two that are minus. And the two that are plus is by giving people a monopoly, you get them to produce more. As you said, you get them to disclose. The two minuses are they charge a higher price, so people use the product less; and moreover, the act of getting permissions and having to get permission can really slow things down and destroy advance. So there’s a balance. In the 19th century, they made it one way in respect to machines. Now you're telling us: Make it today in respect to information. And if you ask me as a person how to make that balance in respect to information, if I am honest, I have to tell you: I don't know. And I don't know whether across the board or in this area or that area patent protection will do no harm or more harm than good. So that's the true situation in which I find myself in respect to your argument. And it's in respect to that, I’d say: All right, so what do I do?",
  "Well, thank you. I thought that was the issue, not the answer.",
  "Suppose you say this. I'm just testing things out. Start with Diehr. I mean -- and Diehr has these words in it, similar words; it just says “e.g.” -- are you following me?",
  "Okay. Now, you say what is it they have done in this case in the Federal Circuit? They have pulled back. That's a mood. That's a mood. They’ve pulled back insofar as they are pulling back from business methods, not machines, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. Okay? You say we see no problem with that. Now, they have left much unresolved. One, transformation; how broad or narrow is that? We don't know. Many people's problems will be solved if it's either broad on the one hand or narrow in the other. Two, are you automatically patented -- in the patent statute, if you just sort of reduce this to a machine by adding a computer on at the end? They've flagged that as a problem. They haven't answered it. Could there ever be a situation where it doesn't meet this test but still is patentable? We’re not sure.",
  "Yes.",
  "Do you see what I'm trying to do? I'm trying to note the things that have been raised in these 80 briefs insofar as possible, say there’s a lot there for the future that we can't really decide, but say as a pull back, okay.",
  "So I thought you were saying that the correct argument for the people attacking the patent in that case was to say, this is not a machine. The machine there is a computer. This is a program that changes switches, and that is a different process for the use of the machine. Now, whether that process is or is not patentable depends upon a lot of things that we don't have to go into in this case. Is that right?",
  "Okay. Well, then what is right?",
  "But then all we do is every example that I just gave, that I thought were examples that certainly wouldn’t be patented, you simply patent them. All you do is just have a set of instructions for saying how to set a computer to do it. Anyone can do that. Now, it's a machine. So all the business patents are all right back in. Now, that -- what I think we were looking for was -- or at least I was -- was why that isn't so, and how you are going to later, down the road, deal with this situation of all you do is you get somebody who knows computers, and you turn every business patent into a setting of switches on a machine because there are no businesses that don't use those machines.",
  "So, in fact, if -- if what we have is a motion in the category of grace, except for asylum, saying, of course, the Justice Department makes a decision that can't be reviewed. But then the department, let's imagine, has a regulation, and it says: Anyone can ask the department for a rehearing in such a matter, and we'll decide as a matter of grace whether to give you one. Now, you're saying that would be reviewed?",
  "Why wouldn't it be reviewed?",
  "You just said it was. You said every procedural decision is reviewed, which to me, makes no sense to begin with, because I can't imagine that Congress, while they don't want them to review the substance at all, is perfectly happy to have the courts review every detailed matter of extra time to file a brief, extra time to have an oral argument. All those matters would be reviewable, I guess, in your view.",
  "Exactly the same is true of the substantive decision. I mean, that has nothing to do with it. I want to know -- look, this is where I'm going. I don't think your -- I can't find a reading of this statute that makes sense, except for one which I am trying on, and I'm sure there’s a lot wrong with it, that what Congress meant to do here is to take all the procedural decisions, including reopening ones, and treat them the same way that they are treating the substantive decisions. So that in his case, he wins. Because he gets review of the substance, he should get review of a reopening. It's the same thing. And in some other case, they'd lose, because if you don't get review of the substance, you shouldn't get review of the reopening. Both are the same thing. They are just filed at different times. So that, to me, is the only reading of this statute that I have yet found that made sense. But since no one argues for it, I'm sure I must be making some huge mistake. But that's what you can tell me.",
  "Yes, but you are on the wrong side, if you agree with it, because --",
  "No, you are on the right side, because he wins. No, you're on the right side. He wins. I take that back. I'm sorry.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Oh, but, wait, new things have happened. He doesn't just want to relitigate it.",
  "New things have happened; that's why he wants it reopened.",
  "No, he's not, but his motion to reopen is -- it's my hypothetical; I want to deal with it; I accept yours. My hypothetical is, something new came up. That's why he wants it reopened.",
  "Something new came up. That's why he -- I think, isn't it true, often people want it reopened because something new came up?",
  "Okay.",
  "No, no.",
  "Oh, I'm asking you, what possible sense could it make?",
  "Look, we're -- two issues. One is grace in respect to -- let's call it fraud, and he loses. Something new comes up, and what does he want? Grace in respect of fraud in light of this new fact. Now, my question would be: What possible sense does it make to say the courts cannot review the first, but they could review the second?",
  "Oh, by the way, this reopening is done by regulation, not done by statute. That's where I get to the problem. You are trying to distinguish between whether it's done by regulation or done by statute. And I'm trying to distinguish on a very different context. Treat the motion to reopen the same as you treat the initial motion, whether it's done by regulation or whether it's done by statute.",
  "Do you want to say anything about, apparently, this idiosyncratic thought that I have had? This is -- it’s -- my thought is that both sides are arguing: We just look to see if it's discretion given by statute or given by regulation, and we draw the line on reviewability there. Now, what we're talking about is a big set of cases, including frauds and various things where there is some discretion substantively to let the person stay. Now, on that big set of cases, the statute says if it's fraud, et cetera, we don't want review. But if it's asylum, we want review. Isn't that how it works, basically -- basically?",
  "Okay. Fine. I'm saying instead of looking to see whether it's a rehearing or procedural or reopening matter, period, you look to see whether it has to do with the basic category. If it's something that Congress doesn't want courts to meddle in, that carries over to reopening, which is the same thing; it carries over to rehearing petitions -- they’re all about the same thing. And if it's something that Congress did want courts to meddle in, like asylum, it carries over to reopening, and it carries over to rehearing petitions and other such matters. So Congress has one simple judgment: We want courts to meddle in these affairs substantively or we don't. And our job would be to say, right, if that's what you want, unless it’s unconstitutional, that's what we give you. Do you see the way -- I'm just drawing the line vertically instead of horizontally. But I agree, nobody has. Now, to me that makes sense, but apparently to no one else. So I would like to be talked out.",
  "I didn't leave anyone out. No one is universal.",
  "How do we know they didn't? I mean, there’s such a thing in the law called -- what we think of often -- they often use the word \"ancillary\" to describe it. And when Congress passes a thing that has to do with X, you often interpret a statute to carry with it the application to ancillary matters, the thing that are bound up in X, even though they don't have a separate sentence because you can't think of everything that describes every matter ancillary to X. That's normal in law.",
  "Yes, and we would say those decisions specified includes those decisions that are totally wrapped up in the same thing. So that if a person tries to escape this by simply making his main argument in a rehearing petition, he can't escape it, because it's really the same thing.",
  "Well, why not? This is not a matter that is the subject of the special provision. A reopening petition is the same kind of thing, identical to the initial petition, and so something that applies to the initial petition applies to the reopening petition because they are the same kind of animal. If you have a -- you know -- I mean, okay. Oh, forget it. I see the point, no point going further.",
  "Do you have any reason why Congress would have taken great trouble to make certain that courts can review asylum decisions, but Congress would not have wanted a court to review a reopening of an asylum matter, which can be done, after all, only if something new comes up that justifies asylum? For example, a new government comes and takes over a country, and now they are going to murder the person, and that couldn't be considered the first time because the old government was there, and they were just going to torture him, all right? So -- so there's something new here. Now, why would any human being say, we want to get courts involved in the first decision, but we want to keep them out of the second decision?",
  "Reopening is not a bite at the apple. Reopening is a new thing; at least, by and large, and supposed to be -- a change.",
  "Exactly, and that's why I ended up with this unusual --",
  "The arguments in this case, my initial reading of them, are more balanced than any I can remember, really. For each one, there is a counterargument and I'm somewhat left up in the air. So if -- since we have to decide it, it should -- should I take this into account: That if the Respondents are right, you are absolutely correct that there will be a lot of people, perhaps, who get rewards at the Federal Government's expense who shouldn't have them. No question. They front-run the government. They read the report, run in court fast, before it's in the newspaper. But if you are right, then they are going to have to assign people to look at these obscure administrative reports that didn't even get in the newspaper. So they want to do that, they don't have people to do it, and they say these people are performing a service of sorts by reading them, the reports, for them and telling them about it. And there it is, balanced. But they are the ones who suffer. You see, they suffer both ways. They suffer if people don't tell them; they suffer if in fact too many people are getting unjustified rewards because the money comes from the Federal Government, the 10 percent, 25 percent. So if they're the ones who suffer, should I not pay special attention to their views as to how the balance works out?",
  "As you can tell, I have taken that point in.",
  "So my question wasn't that. My question was, Should I or should I not give them a little expertise weight on the grounds that they are the ones who know it best, that they are the victims?",
  "The question is, what sense does that make? I mean -- and I thought you said that the category 1, which is the criminal proceeding, civil or administrative proceeding, I thought you said it does not apply to State proceedings in your view. You said that was the better view.",
  "What's the state of the law on that? I thought it was virtually -- what is the state of the law?",
  "I think you'd have to say that. But -- but now, what is the state of law on that?",
  "What are we supposed to do? I mean, to me it makes no sense. We are only talking about things that don't get into the newspapers. So - - and the purpose of the Federal Government's reading of this would be, look, we don't have people to go send around to every -- read every State report. We just don't have that personnel. So we rely on these whistleblowers and we know some will be unjustified. I would think the same thing would be absolutely true of State criminal proceedings that don't get into the newspaper. There are probably 50 -- several thousands -- thousands and thousands. So how to read these differently is a problem for me. And I think that's on your side of it. But we are back to Justice Scalia's question, which to me is the -- is the question here.",
  "Is there any history, which I pay attention to -- is there any legislative history or anything else that you can point to, to me that's important, showing that that first criminal hearing means just Federal?",
  "And they meant criminal hearing. Criminal hearing meant Federal criminal hearing, not State.",
  "You say \"exactly.\" I was looking for the backup for that.",
  "I just want to get your expertise on this, because you have probably read the legislative history of the 1986 amendment. All right, am I right in thinking this? If I go back and read it -- which I will -- I will discover, not once in this entire 1986 history anywhere, House, Senate or conference, does the word State appear in any relevant context?",
  "I'm not right. Okay. So when it appears - -",
  "What I'm -- the relevant context has to do in my mind at the moment primarily in respect to the first clause, \"criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding.\" Is there any indication that those were meant to apply -- any indication that those were meant to apply to State as opposed to uniquely Federal, criminal, civil, or administrative proceedings?",
  "Yeah. Clear from the record -- clear that - -",
  "And the word hearing - -",
  "There is one ambiguity whether this clause, the first -- what we call first and second refers to State as well as Federal. If the debate took place in a context where everyone's just thinking of Federal, it's not surprising they didn't put in the word Federal. They don't think of everything. All right. Now, that's my question. You started with the House. The House to me does think just of Federal. The Senate's ambiguous on that point - -",
  "-- and the conference is yet more ambiguous on that point. So is there anything -- when I look at the conference and the Senate versions, I'm going to say, gee, they did -- sorry, they did actually think of Federal and State, too, and it's sort of mixed up? Or am I going to see that that context there is Federal?",
  "Now, I agree with you about that. I think it's the silence, though, that might cut against you.",
  "And the reason that it's - - it's basically silence -- the reason I am thinking that cuts against you is because of this sorting of the context where they are focusing on Federal. And, if everybody is working in that context, then nothing said about State means they are just assuming it's all applying to Federal. Now, what I'm looking for, you might be able to put your finger on, is something that shows that my last statement is not right.",
  "I think in the -- it was - - it probably came out in governmental affairs in the Senate, which I think had 17 members at the time.",
  "So your point here is -- I will put it in cash terms, is the Federal government, who will pay a lot of qui tam lawyers some percent to go and look through all these State criminal hearings and State reports and all these things that didn't get into the newspaper and to bring cases, so it may be cheaper to pay them then it would be to hire staff to do that. Now, your point is that they get a little over-enthusiastic sometimes, and they can bring actions that maybe not be so well-justified, and the -- the Federal government is going to have to hire people to sort those out anyway, and so would the States in that kind of mess. Is that your point?",
  "But the -- I take it the point of general principle, as opposed to this case, is I take it you will concede the following: Let's imagine on January 1 some investors look out and there are not only storm clouds, thunder, whatever you want, lots to put them on notice. So then the statute begins to run. But it could be the case that once they start to investigate, there is a key element, say scienter, the only evidence for which would take them an extra six months to find, because it's in the hands of a person who is in jail in Burma. All right? So, you are prepared to say in that situation the statute does not begin to run on January 1; it begins to run on July 1, if they really look into it. But if they don't really look into it, then it’s January 1. That's I think the basic difference, as I gather, between the sides, or one major difference in this case.",
  "All right. Now, if that's correct, why? That is to say, it seems to me that, in treating these differently, you have proposed a real morass for courts to get into. Did they really investigate on January 1? Was it an inadequate investigation? Was it a thorough investigation? Along with the difficulty of drawing a distinction between why it should be that that difference should exist, why not just apply the same rule to the investors whether they really do investigate or whether they don't and in both cases the statute begins to run on July 1, not January 1?",
  "Then he would have to file a complaint possibly before he has enough evidence to even bring a case. That is, suppose my guy in Burma is going to be in jail for 3 years; he can't get to him for 3 years. Now, he's going to have to file his complaint before he could have the evidence that there was scienter. Now, that doesn't make sense to me.",
  "So, is there a difference -- I'm trying to get these terminological differences clear in my mind, and I'm not quite certain of the difference between you and the government. If you go back to my -- my Burma example, I think both you and the government agree that the statute doesn't begin to run until you find this person in Burma. But now, I'm not sure you disagree about -- whether you agree or disagree about this. So I think -- you find the person in Burma. That’s 6 months after you had all the other indications. Now, both of you say the statute begins to run. You would say, when you find that person in Burma, you have to get, through him, enough information to be able to file your complaint now in respect to scienter. But the government would say, when you get that person in Burma, he has to be able to give you enough storm clouds, in respect to -- to scienter. Is that what the -- is there that difference? I think -- believe --",
  "Is there no difference, then, between the two of you, or what?",
  "Okay. So do you think -- you think the standard should be -- and I can find out from the government, and I will, I guess -- that it should be -- that you have to -- a reasonable person having talked to the guy in Burma would walk away thinking, Fraud. That's the standard; you think they’re both there -- but both of you agree you have to find the guy in Burma, though it could turn out that other features of the case, 6 months earlier, would put a reasonable person on notice to begin looking for somebody in Burma?",
  "So you both agree about that?",
  "So -- so you want to say, you ought to get enough information from that or in all the other things the same, so that you have -- are able to file the complaint. They want to say you have to get enough so a reasonable person would believe a fraud had occurred. Is that right?",
  "No, I'm not saying -- I'm not so worried about that. I know there's a lot less, but -- or more, whatever -- but I am --",
  "So how -- how -- what's the right phrasing? Because I -- I understood that inquiry notice has somehow made an appearance, and it seems to confuse me. So you say the statute begins to run when a reasonable person would have found facts sufficient to show a violation or sufficient to permit him to file a complaint that alleges a violation? How -- does that come in any way?",
  "How do I say that here?",
  "Okay.",
  "So you are basically in agreement. And then the way that the -- the -- then the way that this inquiry thing comes in is that sometimes, perhaps quite often, a reasonable person, given certain facts, would begin to inquire.",
  "And if it happened to be a case where inquiry played no role, then it wouldn't. It's all a question of what a reasonable person would do.",
  "Now, but when you say it isn't referred to, it seems to me to be referred to. It says \"The term 'debt relief agency' means 'any person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person.\" And the term \"bankruptcy assistance\" is defined to include \"appearing in a case or proceeding on behalf of another or providing legal representation with respect to a case or proceeding.\" Doesn't a lawyer provide legal representation?",
  "All right. So doesn't the term \"provide legal representation\" include a lawyer?",
  "Yes; they include other people besides lawyers.",
  "I don't know. What is it getting at with \"providing legal representation with respect to a case\"?",
  "It would seem to be a lawyer.",
  "Yeah. Those are other people who are covered.",
  "What he -- what I think his argument is, as I understand it, is if you look at the definition of \"bankruptcy assistance,\" you will see there are seven different things that a person could do and fall within that definition. And all of those seven things are probably provided by the kinds of agencies you see advertised on television, which say: We will help you with your debts. And they probably aren't lawyers. And, so, if you look at the six of the seven things, it's clear that all of those are provided by those television companies. And the seventh is simply added in, namely the providing legal representation, to be a catch-all to be sure that if one of those companies actually does something that is legal representation, even though they are not lawyers, they are caught, too. So he is saying, read the whole paragraph and then you will see they are after the companies that appear on television and they're not after lawyers. And then he says that's the history of the bill, and so forth and so on. Okay. Now, that's the argument, and so it isn't - - can't quite be brushed off as quickly, I think, as you did.",
  "Why? I mean, there could not only be lawyers. I mean, there are numerous proceedings where your brother, your mother, your cousin, your friend appears for you. They say: Bring a friend, bring one of us.",
  "We will charge you very little, we will save you money. I am a lawyer, by the way.",
  "I have relatives who aren't, and you can bring one of them.",
  "I don't how this works exactly. I'm not an expert. I thought that, when someone goes bankrupt, that one of the things you ask the bankruptcy judge for is permission to pay for ongoing expenses, and that would include an attorney's fee. Otherwise, people could never be represented.",
  "Well, so why is there some incentive here? All the attorney has to do is follow ordinary procedure.",
  "What the attorney says is, Here's what we will do; when we file for bankruptcy, I will ask the Court to approve my own fees as something that is continuing after bankruptcy.",
  "And he says, This is what they will be. So what is the harm - -",
  "-- since that's what he has to do, of making him tell his client that that's what he has to do?",
  "No, you -- you can't? This prevents you had from saying, What I'm going to do is ask the bankruptcy judge to approve what I just said?",
  "Of course. And so what's wrong with the law that tells the lawyer that's what he has to tell the client?",
  "What's the strongest case, I mean, that you can muster in favor of this proposition, my question being the same as Justice Sotomayor's? What’s the strongest case where you can find any court that said a matter is void -- it’s void, not -- not just legal error, so you can attack it 90 years later -- it's void just because the lower court that made the error didn't apply a clear statute?",
  "Give me your strongest case.",
  "But I’d like an answer to my question, because I can -- I have read the treatises, which I have in front of me, and they say that it's void only if you show a -- the same thing that Justice Sotomayor just said. And so, since I don't think there is some kind of constitutional due process error here, and there’s clearly jurisdiction over the parties, I guess you are saying there wasn't subject matter jurisdiction, which is a little vague. And so I want to know what's the clearest case, strongest for you, where a court has ever said that a failure of some -- of some other court to apply the language of a statute properly, no matter how clear, is a lack of subject matter jurisdiction? What is your strongest precedent? That's all I'm asking.",
  "All right.",
  "Well -- we're conceding that they violated the statute, the bankruptcy judge. The question is whether it's void. And void, as you just said, was three categories: One, was there a violation of basic due process for your client? I don't see it. Two, did the bankruptcy judge have jurisdiction over the parties? It seems the answer is yes. And, three, did they have subject matter jurisdiction? Which we started by saying was vague. So I asked you for your strongest case. You said Vallely. I have only looked at it quickly, but it's only four pages. And what that case seems to say is that there is a statute which says there is bankruptcy jurisdiction over all commercial businesses except for insurance companies and two other categories. This party here is an insurance company, and and therefore they can attack it later, because there was no jurisdiction over an insurance company. Now, if that's your strongest case, I don't know what the others are going to say, but it seems to me you don't have much precedental support to put this in a category of lacking jurisdiction.",
  "Well, what about the consequence of -- there happen to be -- well, I counted -- 14 different kinds of things that follow that comma, including criminal fines, sentences. There are all kinds of things. And is it the consequence of my accepting your argument that anybody who is a creditor in respect to any of those 14 things can come in at any time and announce under Rule 60(b)(4), even if it's 10 years later, that the district court -- the bankruptcy court made a mistake?",
  "Now, that would be quite -- to me -- extraordinary. So I hope the answer from your point of view must still be no.",
  "Wait a moment. What would it be in the case where you have a discharge order and it says things in it which somebody feels fall within 1 of these 13 categories? Now, are you saying that that somebody can come back and make his argument 15 years later, because he will say that, since it falls in that category, the judgment is void insofar as this language covers what I don't want it to cover?",
  "Well, but you see, it's the same problem that’s bothering us. I would like a yes or no answer.",
  "Is it the case if somebody feels the conditions were not met with in the 13 categories that -- or 14 -- that follow the comma, he -- you feel that they were met. The other side says, they weren't met. I sent him a notice, but it was in a balloon, okay. You know, was the notice a real notice, wasn't it? People argue about that. So in any case where you have a person who says, no, they weren't met, and the other side says, yes, they were met, that first person can come back 13 years later and say that the judgment was void? Is the answer of the government yes or no?",
  "All right. Is there any --",
  "Oh, they may not have said it right, but they -- but they -- that’s a different problem. But the -- the -- why doesn't the Treasury just say to people: We’re not going to insure your loans where you don't object.",
  "All right. Then the government is harmless.",
  "But why would it not be a sanctionable matter under Rule 11? If -- the lawyer knows that he is supposed to make this special claim to get this kind of discharge -- he knows an ordinary claim won't do it. He submits a paper that asks for the ordinary discharge, but he has to sign it, and that sign -- that signature, is a -- is a certification that to the best of his knowledge, the claims and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law. So if he signs it knowing that that isn't the way to do it -- indeed, there is not even an argument for doing it that way, for modifying the law -- then why isn't that a sanctionable matter under Rule 11?",
  "I mean, the reason I ask that --",
  "The reason I ask that is I think the argument on the other side is that it's so clear in the law that this is not the way to go about it, that you have to make a separate piece of paper saying you have special hardship; that that’s so clear what Congress wanted, that 40 years later you can come back and attack it, if they didn't do it. I mean, that's basically, in my mind, their argument. But I think a simpler way would be to say if it's that clear, if it really is that clear, the bar itself will enforce the rule by not knowingly deviating from the way that Congress set it out, to which there is no legal objection. Now, is it really -- what do you think of that?",
  "I wasn’t making any conditions.",
  "That's -- that’s what why it’s a -- this is actually -- the part that is a lack of understanding or a complete understanding on my part, is -- is how Rule 60(b) works, because -- because it does ­ - the law does have the three categories -- the three categories that your friend described. And this third category is supposed to prevent a discharge even where the creditor doesn't object, unless certain things are filled out, and they weren't. So the three are there, made an objection. If at any point the creditor had come in and objected, not to the discharge but, you know, just said, hey, it's the wrong form; you’ve got it wrong. It's like an error ­ - they win.",
  "But -- but they waited a very long time.",
  "So now they have to come in, I guess, under 60(b), and it must be either 60(b)(4) or 60(b)(6) --",
  "-- and I take it there’s a time limit on that, and the time limit is “a reasonable time.” Is that how we are supposed to do, that we have to say they didn't file -- if fact they never filed 60 -- it's your side that filed the 60(b)(4), I gather. So this is good and mixed up.",
  "It’s good and mixed up. So what is -- how is it supposed to work?",
  "Yes.",
  "They have a new situation. It's sort of like an avulsion. It's sort of like an accretion. The only precedent of -- you keep talking about a hundred years -- it seemed to me some dictum in a case called Sand Key, which does say that the upland property owner has the right to touch the water. So in this case, the Florida Supreme Court says the purpose of that was to make certain that the upland property owner could go to the water. And so here we have a case that assures he can go to the water, and they have a new situation, which, as I think Justice Scalia said, looks an awful lot like an avulsion, though of course there are differences. So it sounds like a typical common law situation. A new situation arises. You try to apply old precedent, and they reached the result they did. Now, what's your response to that? Because that's the argument the other side makes.",
  "You didn't lose any. It just went out the front door there. The land ended here, and the new avulsion comes in and extends it further. You didn't lose one inch. All you lost was the right to touch the water. But the court here says you in effect have that right because you can walk right over it and get to the water.",
  "Don't you have a right to walk across and put your boat in the water and swim, and nobody can stop you?",
  "Now you have that right. They didn't take that away from you. The statute gives it to you.",
  "You say “absolutely not.” I thought there was a provision in this law that said they cannot put anything on that strip which destroys your right of enjoyment of the upland right. Now, if they put a noisy hot dog stand that keeps you up at night, doesn't that violate the statute?",
  "It doesn't say anything about your right to peaceful enjoyment?",
  "And what does it say?",
  "So what does the statute say about your right to have peaceful enjoyment of your land?",
  "Injurious, okay.",
  "Well, what they say is the following -- this is what they say, I think: They point to a case called Sand Key, and in Sand Key it says littoral property rights include the following vested rights: One, the right of access to the water, including the right to have the property's contact with the water remain intact. That's what the court said. And in the court's opinion what it says about that is it says, in this case, the Act expressly protects the right of access to the water, which is the sole justification for the subsidiary right of contact. in Sand Key, and they're asking why was it there in Sand Key, and that's what they come up with. Now, after this sentence I just read you, there is no citation. So I want you to add anything you would like to say why this is, that sentence I read you, justifiable under Florida law.",
  "No --",
  "I'm giving you what I took was -- I don't want to characterize the answer. I might have found it sufficient, others might not have. I don't know. I'm saying they point to Sand Key. I've read you what I thought was the answer.",
  "Tell me if I'm right, and if I am right, that that is meant to be the answer, justify it, if you can.",
  "Well, why do we have to say that? I mean, they're writing a -- a -- an opinion here against a background of an act, and as I read that opinion -- you can add something to this if you want -- I make a list of what they say in effect provides, not perfectly, but provides, roughly, the same kind of protection that the Sand Key statement provided. One, you can go to the water; two, you have a right of ingress and egress, if that's any different from the first. I'm not positive. Three, you have a right under the Act that nobody can put anything on that strip which is injurious to the upland owner. All right? So those are at least three things, and I think there's a fourth. Yes, the fourth is that nobody can build anything there that is harmful, except if it's to do with the environment; that's not harmful, that's helpful to the beach owner. It's supposed to be helpful. And, five, you get your beach guaranteed. So all of those things are things you get under this Act in an intermediate case where it's a little like an avulsion and a little not like an avulsion. Now, do I add anything to my list? And do you have to go beyond that?",
  "Okay, that's what I wanted to know. What more?",
  "Well, isn't the question here that the reason they don't under Florida law is in a situation where the law isn't clear, we draw the Florida law this way rather than that way, and that is a reasonable common law decision because of the six points that we've listed on the list?",
  "So it's not that it's a taking --",
  "-- and you're compensating; it is a reason why this is a -- I am somewhat putting words in your mouth, but I mean --",
  "Well, why not? Because -- because what they said is: We have a right to touch the water, and you've taken it. That's what they said this Act does.",
  "The court said: You've never had that right. And it's just like a person who owns 40 acres in the middle of Vermont, and the State wants to build a nuclear power plant, and they say, you have to pay us. No, says the State. And the court of the State upholds it on the ground there is an implicit easement under Blackstone to take land for power plants without paying for it; it's called the power plant easement. Okay? Now, in such a case, it would be the judicial taking because their ground is not -- whatever you normally have, but their ground is you never had that property right in the first place. Now, how -- if that ever were to happen -- and that probably, perhaps, is not this case, but if that ever were to happen, wouldn't there have to be a remedy under the Constitution for it?",
  "Now, how does that work? I mean, I have a beachfront property; I wake up one morning and there's a little half-mile island attached to half of it, and there we are. Mean high-water mark is half a mile away. You say I can reclaim that under Florida law? What's that mean?",
  "Which is -- how does it work?",
  "Oh, no, no. This is -- you can't. You can't.",
  "It's rock.",
  "Okay, so what happens?",
  "It can happen. Okay. So my point is, I think, which is the same, I think, as Justice Scalia, that he -- that the upland owner no longer, under the law of Florida, has a way of getting his land out to the mean high-water mark. Am I right or wrong?",
  "Okay. Because?",
  "What about the right in Miranda that says -- in Miranda -- \"We hold an individual held for interrogation must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with the lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation.\" Okay? Where does it say that? Interpret it any way you want. You know, we are used to grand juries. In a grand jury, he can go consult with a lawyer, but he doesn't have the lawyer with him. So, where does it tell him that?",
  "Yes.",
  "I'm just asking you to point to the words that tell him that.",
  "Don't have you a right to talk to a lawyer at a grand jury?",
  "Yes, correct. And so aren't you supposed to tell this person, that unlike a grand jury, you have a right to have the lawyer with you during interrogation? I mean, it isn't as if that was said in passing in Miranda. They wrote eight paragraphs about it. And I just wonder, where does it say in this warning you have the right to have the lawyer with you during the interrogation?",
  "It doesn't use the word \"present,\" Miranda? It says right here: \"We hold\" -- it says -- \"not just prior to questioning, but also to have counsel present during any questioning.\" That's what Miranda says. And then Miranda, after discussing it for five pages, goes on to use the words I just said. You have to tell him he has the right to have counsel with him. So it does use the word \"present.\"",
  "Well, what FBI are we talking about? Because the FBI advice of rights says: \"You have the right to have a lawyer with you during questioning.\" Were they -- and -- and I was taken by the fact, \"We hold that an individual must be clearly informed.\" And so, is there some other case that says -- or some other FBI statement that they give people that doesn't use the words \"with you,\" that says you don't have to say \"with you during,\" or doesn't have to say \"present during\"? Was there some other case that said that?",
  "Excuse me. Can you just devote one minute before you finish –-",
  "-- to the question of why these are adequate? If you remember my question, I tried to explain why I thought they might not be adequate.",
  "But there were four. One is to have during, in the presence of, the right to have a lawyer during the interrogation, in the presence of, with him at the time.",
  "Now, that's one of the four. That's one of the things they devote two pages to Miranda, and they repeat it when they summarize what you have to say. I just want to know where in this statement does it say that?",
  "Really? I guess anybody who has had prior experience with the law, as this man might have done, might be familiar with a grand jury proceeding.",
  "No, no, no. But I tell you: Here's your right to talk to a lawyer before questioning.",
  "Now, you then repeat, you can assert that right whenever you want, to talk to him before questioning.",
  "And my question is, how does that tell him he has a right to have a lawyer with him during questioning, that the questioning he has a right to have take place from beginning to end in the presence of a lawyer, a matter that the Miranda Court repeated three times in the summary and wrote eight full paragraphs about why that was important?",
  "Where does it say it approves that?",
  "It wasn't though, actually.",
  "It isn't -- it isn't consistent with it. That's interesting.",
  "They didn't say anything about during.",
  "So anyway -- then they don't need to mention “during” at all because if that's right, the FBI warning at that time, J. Edgar Hoover's letter or whatever it was, just talked about telling you, you have a right to counsel. It doesn't say anything about “during.”",
  "So then you think that, in fact, going by that warning, that there is no constitutional right to have them say a word about during. This would be okay if they said nothing at all about it.",
  "Is -- is there since then -- I mean, as I read it now I see that, as I said, it seems very clear that they intend you to have to say that the counsel has to be -- is present with you. Present, okay? Now the FBI warnings, which they did say is consistent, don't say that.",
  "They don't.",
  "Okay. Now, since the time of Miranda, has this Court ever talked about that? Has there been any lower court or have there been -- has the practice of the departments to any great extent been such that they stopped talking, or did not talk, or never spoke about a right to have a counsel with you during -- during -- “during” just dropped out. They just said forget about “during.” It wasn't --",
  "This Court has referred to “during.”",
  "Well, they don't have to -- they can't issue a subpoena without the board's approval, I take it -- the commission's approval.",
  "What?",
  "Or what?",
  "And the commission can't change the sanctions?",
  "And it can't -- it can't pass a rule saying, we don't want you to do that?",
  "So as far as -- if the company was ever certain it was right and that the Accounting Board was out of control, completely wrong, the company would just say: I'm not complying --",
  "-- fine, do what you want.",
  "And then at that moment, the group that would decide whether they were right or the board was right would be the commission; is that right?",
  "It says you don’t -- you can get it even without a subpoena?",
  "Where does it say that? Or I'll take your word for it. I’ll look it up.",
  "I don't want to delay you, so forget it. I’ll look it up later.",
  "But I've got one thing on my list. I'm looking to what they control, can't control -- the commission. And so far I've written that in your view the commission can investigate people without subpoenas, and the commission can do nothing about it, okay? That's one.",
  "Now, what's two?",
  "Okay. So we only have one on our list.",
  "Okay.",
  "I'm not saying it's good or bad. I just want to be sure I have a complete list.",
  "And if you have a statute that says each Department -- Commerce, Justice -- the Attorney General of the United States or the secretary shall appoint an inspector general who will in fact inspect and find ethics violations and that office -- he cannot be removed from that office without cause. In your view, that's all -- and it would be unconstitutional.",
  "Yes. Well, why? What's the difference?",
  "So you are saying that the -- the chairman of the SEC does not under the Constitution have the authority or the SEC does not have the authority to appoint individuals who cannot be removed without cause?",
  "Or -- or you might be saying they do not have the authority to appoint inferior officers of the United States. I don't know why they wouldn't have that authority if the Secretary of the Interior has that authority.",
  "What's an independent agency?",
  "Well, what is an independent agency?",
  "But why isn't -- so why aren't they subject to the President's plenary control?",
  "The SEC. What -- what restrictions? Because, interestingly enough, my law clerks have been unable to find any statutory provision that says that the President of the United States can remove an SEC commissioner only for cause.",
  "It's silent.",
  "But that was not what I have asked.",
  "I know. I'm not interested in that. I'm interested in an answer to my question.",
  "And the answer to my -- my question was --",
  "-- is there anything in the law, as far as you know, any statute, that says that the President cannot remove a commissioner or the chairman of the SEC but for cause?",
  "The answer is there is something?",
  "Where -- where is that? Would you refer me to that citation? Because we couldn't find it.",
  "I don't agree with that, but I mean, you do agree. I thought an independent agency is a function of a number of different things: where it is on the chart, what people's customs have grown up to, expectations about it -­",
  "-- what the President might expect he can do or not. But all those things are not what I'd call hard law.",
  "Well but if it's not hard law, then I wonder.",
  "I mean, that's why I asked the question. It's not what I have the answer to.",
  "Why? In Humphrey's Executor there was no provision that said --",
  "There was a provision, which we know, that said the President cannot remove an FTC commissioner but for cause. Have I been wrong on that all those years?",
  "It would render the board unconstitutional?",
  "If an executive appointee who is a superior officer of the United States appoints an inferior officer, which inferior officer can be removed only for cause -- I mean, my goodness -- I can -- there are lots of shapes and sizes. I can't imagine what would be unconstitutional about that. What?",
  "Does the chairman serve as a chairman for a fixed term?",
  "No? Okay.",
  "So, therefore, what you had said before would not apply to the chairman, that is to say: The President can remove him at will --",
  "There is no statute to the contrary; he does not serve for a fixed term, and so you cannot imply that. Since the chairman cannot --",
  "-- can remove him at will -- you do not have what you would call the gearing into play, this somewhat mechanical jurisprudence, of what's an independent agency.",
  "So you are saying that the chairman, not the commissioner, is the person who does the appointing?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, what do -- what do you say in response to their formal argument that heads of departments are those people whom the President has at-will control over, like the Secretary of Defense, and Freytag is support for that. And these aren't those people, so the SEC’s members must be inferior officers, and the Constitution says nothing about and implicitly forbids inferior officers from appointing other inferior officers beneath them. All right, that's a formal argument, but I got that out of their briefs, and I want to know what you respond to it.",
  "Yes. So I -- so we have to take the dissent there as opposed to taking the majority?",
  "I see.",
  "What’s the reason --",
  "What is the reason for this? Having read this enlightening opinion of Justice Scalia in Freytag, which is enlightening to me if I've read it correctly, I would say that the question -- there are two separate questions. One question is: What is a department? And this might well fit within that. And the second question, which is separate but mixed up in the cases, but not his, is: When is it constitutional for Congress to limit the President in his ability to dismiss a -- an officer of the United States or -- inferior or superior -- for cause? And -- and what's -- if you can answer it, what are the justifications here for imposing that requirement?",
  "I'm not interested in that.",
  "I'm interested in -- I'm developing --",
  "That's right.",
  "No, I think they’re saying -- which I am getting gradually --",
  "I think what he’s saying is: First, we know what bribery is; we can deal with that one. Second, we know what kickbacks are; we can deal with that one. And what he means by the honest services other than that is, imagine a list of 5 million bits of honest service that a workman has to perform for his employer. Now, on that list, there might be 35 requirements to disclose something where the interest of the employer goes -- employee goes the other way. And he's saying it violates the statute not to do that in circumstances where the employee knows that the failure to disclose will, in fact, lead the employer, to whom he should have disclosed it, to make a significant decision; namely, that decision to avoid which was the reason he didn't disclose it.",
  "Now, I think what he is saying is that’s rather precise. That fits with what was there before, and therefore, all the government is saying is: Now we have those three things. If you didn't quite -- I didn't quite get that out of the brief, but that may be my fault. All right? So anyway, it was probably there; when I go back, I'll see it. And those are the three things. So he's saying: You see? It doesn't matter the source as long as there is a clear legal obligation, which could come from corporation law, for the employee to disclose the conflict in this situation. I think that's what it is. Well, and so what's your response to that?",
  "You are saying, I take it, that there was no duty in Alaska criminal law, disclosure law, to disclose. I think you might find in a treatise on agency that there is a duty to disclose.",
  "Not even in the Uniform Commercial Code or the --",
  "And this is supposed to be something that the average citizen who works there just knows all about?",
  "He intended not to disclose something, right.",
  "Okay, okay. I see.",
  "So, now -- now think of that answer -- complete that answer, if you can.",
  "Now, go back to -- I'm trying to get you back to your general answer that you wanted to give. And I -- I -- remember my list of 6,000 things --",
  "-- which I made up, and these are all the things that --",
  "-- an employee owes an employer.",
  "Now, some of them -- you have taken out three -- no bribes, no kickbacks and no conflicts of interest where that’s defined in the narrow way you’ve defined it. You have to know you are not disclosing, you know you have the obligation, you know action will be taken on it, and the action will be taken to help somebody else or to the detriment of the employer or something like that. Right?",
  "Something like that. Okay.",
  "So, now, I think, well, I go back to Justice Scalia's language of that statute. And I say, oh, my goodness, why did you pick these three? I mean, I can easily -- I make up comical examples because they illustrate the point.",
  "But I don’t mean them to be comical. Look, think of a person who is really angry at his employer and he changes all the direction signs around in the building to mislead him so that the employer will miss the key meeting and make the wrong decision.",
  "I mean, why not that one?",
  "No, no. That's not my point. I don't believe the way you’ve interpreted the statute that you could or would -- could prosecute what I just made up as a funny example.",
  "But I can make up thousands of examples from the list, and I think Justice Scalia's original point was something like, well, you've taken some words, 28 words that cover 6,000 things, and out of those 6,000 things, you have picked, perhaps randomly, 3 which --",
  "-- you say it covers.",
  "No, no, you picked them -- all right.",
  "I thought there was a principle that a citizen is supposed to be able to understand the criminal law that was around even before Justice Scalia.",
  "Well, the Sherman Act criminalizes price fixing. You see, I can say that in two words, intentional price fixing. Do you think what we have been talking about this morning can be reduced to anything like those two words?",
  "Well, let me ask a quick question here. I notice, in the Skilling case, the first question is whether the statute requires the government to prove the defendant's conduct was intended to achieve private gain, et cetera, and if not, whether the statute is unconstitutionally vague. Now, does that first question give the government an opportunity sufficient to say whatever it wants in its brief about the constitutional question?",
  "All right. So we could assume that, if you need time, at that time, you could ask for whatever you wanted to ask for?",
  "Before you -- do you - - does the government feel that it hasn't had an adequate opportunity to brief the constitutionality of the statute?",
  "Might this come up in the Skilling case?",
  "So we have to say, in your view -- no, I'm just -- I'm cutting into you because I don't -- you answered it once you said that. The -- the -- what I wonder is, does the government feel, in order to have a full opportunity to brief constitutionality, that we should issue an order saying: Please brief the constitutionality?",
  "So we should say that?",
  "Now, as I hear that -- I am exaggerating, possibly, but I think every agent has a duty of loyalty to provide loyal and honest services to the master, master agent. Every worker is an agent of his master, the employer. So every instance in which a worker does not provide honest services to the employer, he has met your test. I think there are 300 -- perhaps there are 150 million workers in the United States. I think possibly 140 of them would flunk your test.",
  "I mean, that's what worrying me. Now, why? Because -- I -- \"Do you like my hat?\" Says the boss. \"Oh, I love your hat,\" says the worker.",
  "Why? So the boss will leave the room so that the worker can continue to read the racing form. Deception? Designed to work at reading the racing form instead of doing your honest work and, therefore, violation? Now, explain to me how your test does not - - and I think you can probably do it; I just don't understand it at the moment. Explain it to me, how your test does not make this statute potentially criminalizing 100 million workers in the United States, or some tens of millions?",
  "Now this -- I'm just getting a label, and as I hear you talk, I think it's not what you necessarily -- I found in the brief, or didn't understand it from the brief -- but I found precisely what you said, it seems to me in what I have labeled Altshuler alternative B, does that ring a bell?",
  "Yes, yes. You've read the briefs-- you've read the briefs. He has alternative A and alternative B. And alternative A he says kickbacks, and it could be limited to bribery or kickbacks. In alternative B he adds bribery, kickbacks and undisclosed self-dealing capable of causing economic harm. That's what I got out of the brief.",
  "Now I just heard what you said and it sounded like the same thing.",
  "It is not causing economic harm.",
  "So what about my racing form? He is acting for himself and not his employer.",
  "Different matter. Different matter. The foolish to prosecute, jury defined, worries me for the reason that what's in the back of my mind -- and you will see what -- I am disclosing to you what is in the back of my mind.",
  "When the criminal code was reenacted and never was, one kind of joke was that it there it would be -- there would one ball, the law would be read as a crime to do wrong, okay? \"It is a crime to do wrong.\" Sometimes adding, \"in the opinion of the Attorney General.\" All right.",
  "Now you see the problem? It may be you would never prosecute it. It may be a jury would never convict. But that isn't the basis for having a statute that picks up 80 or 100 million people.",
  "That -- that is Altshuler B, which I -- that seems to work, but then you want to go beyond that.",
  "And I think in going beyond that is the paradigm case of -- of moonlighting?",
  "No, because - -",
  "No, no, no, no. I'm trying to get -- encapsulate your test in my mind. I'm just trying to find a way, so as I listen to you, I think what you are driving at -- a paradigm case of what you are driving at would be moonlighting.",
  "Yes -- no -- yes. He takes a day -- he leaves an hour early because he is selling real estate.",
  "You have to have all those elements? One -- I mean, everybody is working for the company. Everybody has loyalty to the company owner. And, now, you are saying everybody has competing things that they sort of like to do, which would deprive the owner of the honest services, but you are saying, in addition to that, he has to have his own company?",
  "In addition to that, what?",
  "I thought materiality just has to do with whether a false statement you make, in fact, causes the effect, or is likely to, that is the harmful effect.",
  "That's always there.",
  "No, and the -- and the reason I say with -- maybe I have the example that I mean now. In the cases you just mention, the bribe case? Right, the legislature is not going to gain. The legislator or the briber might, but somebody will. And the object of those bribes was that there would be economic gain, and that was what -- when I went through all those McNally cases, I thought I could fit them into this alternative Altshuler thing, but now, you -- you worry me that you have a different test that will bring in like any failure to fill out a disclosure form. A deliberate failure to answer a box, one out of 1,000, for every government employee, would immediately -- 20 years in jail.",
  "But there is no such answer.",
  "I thought, in contracts, there is no such answer. When you interpret a contract and it doesn't say, you try to figure out -- I used to be taught that; probably I am way out-of-date -- you try to figure out what a reasonable party would have intended.",
  "And I thought that's what Bazzle said, that --",
  "Not as out-of-date.",
  "Yes.",
  "I see that now, but then -- but there are two separate questions.",
  "My question was, first, the same as Justice Ginsburg.",
  "And I have a question for you on that, because in reading these briefs, I thought your description of who is to decide this matter of whether there is to be a class action was just what you said: The question of who should decide it is a matter for the parties.",
  "So when I looked at -- I just have been reading Bazzle three, five times, and there seemed --",
  "All right. But what it seems to say is that that's a matter to figure out from a contract and background circumstances. In Bazzle, the contract was: Any -- all disputes relating to this contract. Here, it doesn't say that. It says: \"Any dispute arising from the performance, termination, or making of the contract.\" Now, a class-action determination does relate to. Maybe it doesn't arise out of, okay? That's an argument.",
  "So why are all these briefs saying that what Bazzle said was: Whenever this is silent, it goes to the arbitrator; the who question is answered at arbitration. I can't find it saying that.",
  "Yes, I know. I know. But what I actually thought doesn't matter. What matters is what is said.",
  "Now, you're -- so the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question is, as to the who question, who shall decide whether or not in your case class actions are permissible?",
  "The who question in Bazzle, because of the contract and background, was the arbitrator.",
  "The who question here, irrespective of the contract is the arbitrator for the reason that Justice Ginsburg said. There's a separate saying: You are the who; you, arbitrators, are the who.",
  "So now we look to the what. They then decided it.",
  "What -- what did they decide? And you are saying that's wrong. And there you run into all the authority, Misco, who used to be in other places, saying when the arbitrator says something, unless it's in Marrs, follow it. That's what you are addressing.",
  "That -- isn't that -- you and I have a contract. I'll ship you 17 pounds of durum wheat, and you will pay me $43. In the meantime, a green worm eats up all the durum wheat, and therefore they can't send durum wheat; they send some duhu wheat. All right? Question: Is the contract valid or not?",
  "Answer: We have courts for that purpose. We have arbitrators for that purpose.",
  "Arbitrators will look to see what it says. If it says nothing, they will try to determine what the parties thought. If they can't determine what they thought, they will look to custom, analogy, et cetera. Now --",
  "They won't?",
  "That's where I started this. We don't get many contract interpretation cases, and that's why I -- I needed to go back to Jack Dawson, who is a great contracts professor. And I am --",
  "What?",
  "I didn't have that pleasure, but the --",
  "The -- but the -- as I recall, the way I would have interpreted -- imagine a worker who says: I have a right, permission -- it's permissible for me to eat lunch next to the machine. The employer says no. The question was what is -- does the contract permit this or not? So the arbitrator or the judge reads the words. Nothing. They have no idea. Then the judge or the arbitrator reads the rest of the contract. Hasn't a clue. Then the arbitrator or the judge goes and looks and sees what's practice around here? \"I don't know.\" Then they might look to what happens in the rest of the industry. Then they might look to what happens in foreign countries with comparable industries. Then they might look to public policy. They might look almost to anything under the sun they think is relevant, and the way, in jargon, you describe the bottom line is: They have found a meeting of the minds as to what this means. Now, of course, it isn't really a meeting of the minds. But that's just the summary of the conclusion as to what, objectively read, those words in the contract mean. Now, that's how I think I would have learned it. Is that still done, or is there some other way of describing it?",
  "If that's contract law --",
  "-- then I take it what they're saying is: It may be true that the arbitrators, when they looked at some of those elements, really got it wrong. Now, if they are correct on that -- this is the other question I have. You are going to say: No, they're not -- they didn't get it that wrong; wrong, maybe, but not that wrong. All right. Now, can they not do this? The next person who has this form contract does not so readily agree it's up to the arbitrator to say whether that contains a class action or not. Rather, they say: I read this contract as reserving that question to the court. It's not the same language as was there in Bazzle; it's not the same industry of the kind you had in Bazzle; and, therefore, a judge should decide that. That's the meeting of the minds on the who question. And then we’ll get it all resolved, because the judge might come out differently if they're right, and maybe arbitrators will follow the judge. I’m interested, because we might have to write something, in your answer to that question.",
  "Not -- we know they're going to -- they have something already in place.",
  "Yes.",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "There’s a supplemental agreement here because I thought --",
  "-- in reading this, the supplemental agreement submitted the case under Rule 3 --",
  "-- of the AAA, and it’s supplement --",
  "-- rule 3 of the AAA supplementary rules says, an arbitrator shall, quote, \"determine, as a threshold matter, in a reasoned, partial, final award, on the construction of the arbitration clause, whether the applicable arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed on behalf of or against a class.\"",
  "So I thought the supplemental agreement said --",
  "-- apply Rule 3, and therefore, it was asking the arbitrators to decide the question put in Rule 3. Is that right?",
  "So then we could get the question by reading page 7 of the blue brief.",
  "What is the --",
  "What is the theory of this? I understand in hearsay, which as we have just seen demonstrated, is very complicated, filled with all kinds of rules --",
  "-- some of which I may recall and others of which I certainly don't.",
  "But the -- the Confrontation Clause, I would have thought, would have picked out the heart of that. So we have Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Walter Raleigh says, \"Bring in witnesses,\" which they wouldn't. So why shouldn't we say what this clause is about is Sir Walter Raleigh?",
  "Bring in the witnesses. Now, once you bring them in, the defendant can do what he wants. He has had his chance to cross-examine them. End of the matter, and leave the rest up to the hearsay law.",
  "You could have -- you could have hearsay that is not prepared for testimony. There are all kinds of categories. And suppose, in your case, this hearsay of business record or --",
  "And how often will you say: I understand it's admissible, but I would like as well to call the witness who prepared it. Will you do that very often? Suppose you learn that that witness is -- is 4,000 miles away, so you say, I’d like to call this witness, and you know perfectly well that it's going to be virtually impossible for that witness to be produced. What happens?",
  "I'm trying to think of something that’s hearsay, and --",
  "-- and what I'm trying to figure out --",
  "-- is will defense attorneys, if they have the right under the Constitution to insist that a lab technician be present, in cases where they happen to know that lab technician has left the job and is married and is reliving in a distant State, say okay, let's call her. And that way the prosecution really cannot present the case except at inordinate expense. And I'm concerned about that --",
  "-- but I don't see quite how to deal with it, how much of a problem it is, and the impact on this particular situation.",
  "I don't know except anecdotally, but Massachusetts seems to be having huge problems, reported anecdotally, with the --",
  "Rouse -- is that --",
  "The woman, Barbara -- Barbara Rouse?",
  "And then there are conflicting reports in the newspapers, but I don't know.",
  "What happens if the lab is -- is divided into four or five parts and there is several different machines and we have different people at different times using these different machines and performing different operations and each, at the end, certifies that the red light was on or it was this or it was that? Now, do we have to call all those people?",
  "Why not? Each of them --",
  "Each of them looked at a special part. Each of them said --",
  "-- that it was this or that, and in respect to each of those statements, it’s this or that. That is hearsay.",
  "No, no, it's no confrontation because in this instance the hearsay prevents the confrontation.",
  "Your answer to my question is, if a laboratory is so organized so that six or seven people perform different steps of the operation, if it is organized in that way, all of them must be brought?",
  "You don't believe so, but you gave me an answer saying they did have to, so -- because you said they could organize differently. So now explain to me why they don't.",
  "Well, the reason that I ask is because floating in the back of my mind is -- is if -- (a) does the Confrontation Clause apply?",
  "And if the answer to (a) is yes, then are there different kinds of implementation rules in different areas where there are other signs of security, where there are other reasons for thinking it's not bad testimony? That line is not something that’s necessarily workable, and -- but I brought it up to try to think about it.",
  "Well, I think that underlying this is a fairly simple problem, conceptually. Imagine we have Sir Walter Raleigh at trial, and there’s an affidavit for missing witness A and witness B and witness C, and they are over in a room somewhere, whether they were treated badly or not, and they have written these pieces of paper. In they come. And Walter Raleigh says: \"Bring me the witness.\" Now, suppose they had trotted him out, and he cross-examined him. Still, those pieces of paper came in, and they weren't cross-examined. And so what do we do about that? They weren't cross-examined, and how did they get in here?",
  "As I read this statute, it does let in that piece of paper.",
  "And so why then, by analogy, isn't the statute bad?",
  "If -- unless you -- unless you have some special kind -- I mean, you’d have to some special -- specially reliable evidence that sort of fell within the Confrontation Clause but not totally. And that's what I -- the more I think about that, the harder that one is to do.",
  "Well, to put my chips on the table, which you probably understand, I thought the reliability of this evidence in the mine run of cases was such, and the distance from Sir Walter Raleigh was sufficiently great, that it fell outside the scope of the Confrontation Clause for those two reasons, but mine was a dissenting opinion.",
  "So, therefore, what do I do?",
  "All right. So the statement, the sentence in this opinion, that, in your opinion, would have the effect of limiting Melendez-Diaz without overruling it, what is that statement?",
  "What if it doesn't quite work, that the Confrontation Clause seems to be expanding, just with the opportunity for cross-examination creating all kinds of incursions into areas where it’s not necessary for fairness purposes? Then does it make sense to say -- hey, unfortunately, to say that the only workable system is that you have a system which has exactly the confrontation point, but indicia of reliability do have an impact as to what the implications of the Confrontation Clause violation are, in terms of practical trial necessity.",
  "Now, there we are, accepting the warnings of the dissenters in Crawford.",
  "Well, what about Raleigh's witnesses -- you know, the hypothetical I gave you, for the heart of the matter, the heart of the matter, and they stick it in their affidavits, and you say, oh, don't worry, don't worry, you can cross-examine them later in the trial.",
  "Then how do you -- what is -- is that absolutely necessary? Any party State may withdraw from the compact by enacting a law repealing the compact. That sentence seems to me your toughest point because that's what they did. They simply withdrew.",
  "Now, where in the contract is it something that says -- I mean, maybe that was foolish, to put that in there, but they did put it in. And so how do you deal with that sentence, which is one that Justice Scalia brought up in his --",
  "Well -- all right. Well, go ahead, explain.",
  "Is there in this implicit that the State of North Carolina, prior to their withdrawal, while they are still acting, will appropriate reasonable amounts of money for this?",
  "Do appropriate steps include --",
  "-- do they -- does this -- if we have a lend-lease agreement entered into a treaty and absolutely ratified, I suppose that if Congress decides not to lend and won't appropriate the money to do it, we are in breach of the treaty.",
  "And I assume if there is a similar agreement here and North Carolina's legislature doesn't appropriate any money for whatever internal reasons, North Carolina is in breach of the treaty.",
  "Do I understand this correctly?",
  "Is there any authority for the proposition that when a legislature does not appropriate the money that the executive of a State has committed to another State, that State is in breach, irrespective of whose fault it is within the State?",
  "Okay. So this case then boils down to, am I correct, in the years prior to their withdrawal, did they take the steps, appropriate steps, that this contract obliges them to make?",
  "And you say they did not?",
  "But that's -- but if you win on that one, you win.",
  "And the state of the finding of the Commission in respect to that precise point, and it's called -- what is it called? The \"Impact Commission\"? Do we have the same thing in mind, the Commission? Is that what it's called?",
  "They have -- they are the ones who are the judge, it says.",
  "All right. That's what it says.",
  "The findings in respect to that specific 2-year point are what, and where are they in the record?",
  "Why is it -- to go back to the word \"sanctions,\" when I read the word \"sanctions\" in the law, the thing that comes to my mind first and foremost is the money, like a fine; and sort of second, imprisonment. But paying a fine, that -- that seems to me the most primitive and basic sanction of anything. And -- and why -- and particularly, if you say the fine was limited to giving back money you previously took. So, why wouldn't you read this clause here which says \"including\" -- and then it doesn't mention money, but it includes some other things, and you say well, sure, they include the other things because the word \"sanction\" doesn't automatically call to mind those other things, but it does automatically call to mind a fine.",
  "Now, are we supposed to -- are we supposed to treat compacts among States as if we are dealing with those who want to impose obligations on the States?",
  "Here, aren't we trying to say what obligations did the States themselves want to impose on themselves?",
  "Well, it adds -- it adds ­ - it starts \"Qualifications.\" It says it's the judge of qualification and it's the judge of their compliance with the conditions and requirements of this compact.",
  "\"And the laws of the States relating to the enactment of the compact.\"",
  "Okay. I see. So --",
  "So I was thinking of this, is: What we have are a group of States, each of whom feels it's necessary to build a cholera plant. And they know that the cholera plant will be hated by everybody in their State, but it's necessary. So they each say: We’ll undertake it, okay? But the deal is you do, too. Now, that's their basic deal. I don't know that they ever would have entered into this as part of the basic deal that State A depends for 4 years on State B doing it, but when it's State A's turn, they run away. Well, that's the deal. They can run away. But in addition, take $80 million? Okay. That's where we are back with the Chief's question. Now, I don't know whether it is an appropriate step or not an appropriate step to keep the 80 million as well as running away. But it seems to me that we have an arbitrator that was supposed to decide whether it was or whether it wasn't, and they said it was an appropriate step. They foresaw you would take the 80 million, never give it back, at least. But the Commission thinks it isn't. And the arbitrator paid no attention whatsoever to the Commission. And what the Commission says in the language that I quoted is that the Commission is the judge of the members' compliance with the requirements of this contract. So when I read that, I think: Surely, he should have paid some attention to the fact that the Commission thought that what was keeping the 80 million was not an appropriate step. Now, there we are. That's my question. And the only answer I've heard so far is, if I read the rest of the sentence, it talks about laws of States relating to the enactment of this contract -- compact. And I don't know that you read \"enactment\" so narrowly to refer to laws that talked about how you adopt it. There might be a whole lot of laws. I guess you pay attention to all of them. So I don't see what the last phrase has to do with it. But anyway, that's my basic question in the case.",
  "So, in your opinion, the Commission is not the judge of anything other than membership?",
  "So, therefore, the six pages or so of this compact that has to do with a lot of detailed issues that might appear before the Commission -- it is not the judge of whether there is compliance with those issues --",
  "-- because this concerns only membership?",
  "Well, why -- why would anyone stay in the contract? I take it that your point, which is an awfully good one, is that this compact was designed, like others, to solve a political problem. It's necessary for the country to store low-level radioactive waste, necessary for health and safety, but because of the politics and people's understanding, incomplete, no one wants it, and so, now, the States have formed a series of compacts. And we are told, in an amicus brief, that, if this compact is interpreted to allow one State to take advantage of another State's having done so for years and then run away and keep $80 million to boot, it will be impossible for many other States to resist that same route. And that will be the end of compacts through the United States, and what we will have is low-level waste without storage. That's argument, roughly, that's made in an amicus brief in this case, and I would like to know your opinion.",
  "But what -- what -- you just said -- I may not have misunderstood, but I thought you said, in response to Justice Scalia, that, during 1997 and '98, when he said why didn't you take appropriate steps, that you said you didn't do anything, and that was the appropriate step; is that right? If you -- if you said that --",
  "If I heard you correctly. All right. But then it shows in the -- in the Special Master's report that, during that time, you received from the Commission funds over $7 million. So you may not have done anything, but you did take $7 million at that time from other people. And so they are saying, fine, if you didn't take any anything, didn't do anything, and that was the appropriate step, why isn't it the appropriate step now to give us the 7 million back?",
  "You say -- well -- in other words, North Carolina's money in '97 and '98, which was $4 million, went to pay for current expenditures during North -- during that year, '97/'98, but the Commission's money, which amounted to $7 million in that time, was not spent on current things? It was rather a payment for things done in the past? This sounds not -- I'm not -- I mean, that's possible, but I just don't recall anything that suggests that.",
  "So the whole formula --",
  "-- and the whole --",
  "How does it work? I mean, how does it work? The-- there's a -- there’s a plant in South Carolina, and a truck comes up filled with radioactive waste out of Georgia.",
  "And they go to a booth, and now they are charged something. And is the fee and special surcharge, which this refers to, the total charge?",
  "Total charge. And what does that amount to, primarily? Do we have any idea on a typical --",
  "No -- well, I don't know how they did it. But, anyway, there’s a charge. Say it's $1,000, or maybe it's $10,000.",
  "So -- so the truck company has to pay $10,000 to the authority.",
  "And they are saying here that that $10,000 represents --",
  "-- the financial commitment of all party States to the Commission.",
  "That money might -- seems to come from a private company.",
  "It comes from a private company. It goes to the -- it goes to the Commission -- it goes to South Carolina --",
  "-- and they give it to the Commission.",
  "Well, why -- why not? I mean, is there anything to prevent the United States Government to say: Mental illness is a serious problem in the United States, and we feel the States sometimes do a good job, sometimes they don't, but we want to set up a group of Federal mental hospitals and treatment centers of the most modern kind, and in these circumstances, there will be a handful of people who pose a threat to themselves or others, in which case they must be restrained. There might be due process problems, whether you have the right person, whether they should be restrained, et cetera. But doesn't the Constitution give authority to the Federal Government to set up a system of mental illness prevention and cure, if in fact they determine that that's a desirable use of Federal money?",
  "It doesn't have the power to set up hospitals?",
  "In other words, if the doctors were to say, there are a thousand people here suffering from mental illness, your own daughter or mine or someone has a -- is threatening suicide or threatening murder? There are lots of real cases like that, where people have terrible times, and there are not adequate State facilities. And were the Federal Government to say, this is a problem that we wish to go into and help with, you are saying the Constitution prohibits that? Where does it prohibit it?",
  "Well, once you’re down that road -- I was rather surprised, but not too surprised, that, I think perhaps with prompting, I heard you say, I think, that the Tenth Amendment would prohibit the Federal Government from setting up a system of mental care, which you’d better tell the people across the street, if that's your view. The -- the -- is that what you are actually saying?",
  "Of national mental care for mentally ill people.",
  "Because you either think that the Constitution prohibits that or you think it permits it.",
  "Yes, probably the Commerce Clause power.",
  "So it's fine --",
  "The -- go back once more because I am obviously getting nowhere with this, but I thought that, if you set up a set of hospitals, as I think the government could do, there will be a few people, sometimes, who have to be restrained in those hospitals for themselves or others’ benefit. If you set up a system of mental hospitals, that's even more true. If you set up a university, some people will be sick, and they will be in the infirmary, and occasionally, you will come across a person who has to be restrained, et cetera. Now, once you are down the road where you admit the government can do that, how is a prison any different?",
  "You set up a prison where, in fact, occasionally, people have to be restrained for health reasons, et cetera, and just as in the other cases, sometimes that can last past the normal release date, so can it in prison. Maybe there's a better way, but why isn't this just a normal part of running this institution, just as it is in the other cases?",
  "No, I'm not, actually. I'm just showing you the connection between running an institution, which, for whatever set of reasons in the Constitution, you have the authority to do, and then it becomes, as part of that institution, part of the job to take care of people in a certain way. Sometimes that requires a restraint, and sometimes that restraint could last beyond the period where in the absence of that need the person would no longer be part of the institution. That's true of a hospital, of a mental hospital, and of a prison. Whether they rest on the same power or a different power, the government has the power, Federal, to establish all of those institutions. I'm just drawing institutional connections. That's -- that's what I'm saying. Maybe that's an unnecessarily complex argument, but I was just seeing it that way.",
  "If that's so, imagine a well-educated American woman marries a man from a foreign country X. They have a divorce. The judge says, the man is completely at fault here, a real rotter. The woman is 100 percent entitled to every possible bit of custody, and the man can see the child twice a year on Christmas Day at 4:00 in the morning. That's it. Now, there's a law like Chile's that says you can't take the child out of the country without the permission of the father too, this person who gets to see the child twice a year. And you’re saying that that's custody. It’s custody, and -- and what is the woman supposed to do? She can't get a decent job worthy of her education. The -- the -- all the courts said that she's entitled to the child. She has to choose between her life and her child. And -- and is that what this -- this convention is aimed at?",
  "Now -- now, of course, what I'm asking you with my example --",
  "Is why interpret it that way, where all that you have is a rule of law that applies to everybody, even in the case I've tried to imagine, where to say it's a right of custody would ruin the life of the woman, would give the husband something which he should -- certainly shouldn't have in any moral term, it would seem, and she comes back to the United States and is forced to give her child back to whatever this country is. I have called it X. Now, why give that kind of interpretation to this statute, which seems to have a purpose that’s looking after women and children?",
  "Well, that's your conclusion. I'm just trying to get -- to see if there is any humane purpose underlying the interpretation that you have advocated, and certainly there are two interpretations here. Your opponents will soon present us with a different one.",
  "That isn’t my question.",
  "I'm trying to get at what the humane purpose would be, given your interpretation of the law in this kind of situation?",
  "What’s the law -- what is the law if a mother and a child -- sorry. What’s the law if a couple living in a foreign country has a decree of the court, and the decree of the court grants certain visiting rights to the father, and the father, violating those rights, takes the child to a different country. Can the mother get it back?",
  "What’s the normal law where you have a couple -- they’re supposed to leave the child in the country, but it doesn't say that. There’s no ne exeat thing. They’ve just agreed to certain visiting rights.",
  "And in violation of those rights, the father, say, takes the child to another country in violation of the divorce decree of the first country.",
  "No, you are not understanding my question.",
  "My question is, outside this convention --",
  "If -- forget the convention. Suppose there’s just a divorce decree.",
  "And suppose a parent, violating the decree, takes the child to another country in violation of an ordinary divorce decree. Does the injured parent have a way of getting the child back?",
  "I'm sure there isn't, but under the law --",
  "You would go and take the court's order to a court in the United States and try to enforce it?",
  "And the American court would be under obligation, I guess, to enforce it?",
  "Well, all right. So our question here is which of the two mechanisms should we use?",
  "I know you think that, but I'm still worried about my mother in the case that -- that you gave me.",
  "I’ve read through that, and I’ll tell you that, on the basis of my reading through all that stuff, my mind is in equipoise. I find some one way, some the other. I think maybe each side does a little overstating here, but -- but I -- I am in equipoise, having looked at that quickly. So I know -- I know the stuff, you can -- but that's why I am trying to get to the underlying humane idea that’s supposed to underlie that, and see if it applies here.",
  "What they seem to be thinking of -- this is -- maybe you can get at what is bothering me. I’m perhaps not articulating it very well. But the -- where there's any kind of a custody right, I normally think there was a human being called a family law judge who has a very tough job, and he has looked at the situation of these two people here and the child. And he said, at least: Smith and Mrs. Smith, you are each going to have a little bit, at least. Now, but in a situation where he says to Mr. Smith, nothing, I want to give you nothing -- he thinks this is Frankenstein's monster; he does not want to give him a single thing -- that, on your interpretation of this statute, that doesn't matter. Just because Chile has a general law that says you can't take anybody out of the country without permission, just because of that, even Frankenstein's monster is considered to have custody for the purposes of this, though the human being who looked at this, called the family law judge, said: Don't let him near that child. All right? Now, that's -- don't pick up on my errors in that I know I haven't stated it quite right, but look at what I'm driving at. And that's what's bothering me.",
  "I know there are ways out, but why should we include custody to be a situation where the human being who looked at this couple thought that that individual, the husband, should have nothing but visit him occasionally on Christmas? Why should we interpret the word \"custody\" in this treaty to include even that situation, which turns the treaty into a general “return the child” no matter what?",
  "Well, could we interpret the words \"great psychological harm\" to include, for example, a situation where an educated woman with an advanced degree is unable to get work in the country where her child lives and has to live under conditions that are -- that are really -- we would say are fairly primitive because of her inability to find an appropriate employment? Can you include that under great psychological harm, so that the child wouldn't have to go back?",
  "Well, has there ever been -- would you advocate that kind of very broad standard of great psychological -- and what would be your position, or what's the government's position on that?",
  "So if I -- if I think, as Justice Alito was starting out, that if the -- a court order in the divorce case says the father and mother will jointly decide what house to live in, that the father has a custody right, if it jointly says the father and the mother will decide what State to live in, that that's a custody right. That it says that the father and mother will decide what city, same. The father and mother will jointly what country to live in, same. But suppose that there is no such decree; rather, the jurisdictional statutes of the nation, without considering this family, have a rule that says they have to live in Chile without Court permission. Is there any way I can draw a line, in terms of this statute, between the two situations, the one being where the divorce judge actually focused on the needs and circumstances of a family, the other being where there was no more than a jurisdictional law in a nation that tried to protect the jurisdiction of its courts?",
  "I understand that, but what I'm wondering is if -- if -- I thought you would agree with me about that, and since I thought you would agree with me about that, you would explain to me how I could reach that result, consistent with the language of this convention, which talks about custody rights granted by operation of law.",
  "Who's against it? I -- as I read their brief, France is not on their side. It's split.",
  "Canada is on your side; that the House of Lords is -- has some dicta written by two judges, which is good, but it wasn't a holding in the case.",
  "And -- and that's about it, and so maybe they --",
  "Germany.",
  "Who do you count for you of the seven, just so I can write it down and go back and read them? Any one of the seven for you?",
  "Which?",
  "Okay. Any other for you?",
  "Canada. Okay. And who's against you?",
  "No. I asked who is against you.",
  "You think one against you, one for you, the rest unclear?",
  "Okay.",
  "How old is the child?",
  "Why didn't your client just ask the judge there to leave Chile?",
  "Can we read that exception there to say -- \"grave injury\" and so forth -- can we read it as in essence saying, look, do what's best for the child?",
  "So what -- the part that's worrying me most is where the lawyer is the debt collector. All right? So he's within the act, and he has a client of debt collectors, and the clients all say: Please go collect the debt. And they say: We want to do this, like in this -- suppose in this case, they say: Tell us if you don't owe it; ask them to write a letter to that effect; we won't collect it; now, is that legal? And the lawyer looks up everything in sight and says, yes, it's legal. And then that's what he thinks. All the circuits have said this. And then he asks the FTC and they say, yes, it's legal. So there he is. Everybody's told him it's legal. And lo and behold, this Court, surprisingly, holds the opposite. Well, he shouldn't be liable. And if he has to worry about that, he can never defend his client. The only answer is: Whatever the man says who is opposed to your client, that's what you have to do. That can't be the meaning of this statute.",
  "No, no. What the FTC said is: We won't give you one.",
  "So he is a lawyer litigating for a client. That was my hypothetical.",
  "Yes.",
  "It's not a mistake. The point is, in a sense, that any decent lawyer would say that's what the law was; that sometimes lawyers get surprised because courts don't always act the way they think is reasonable.",
  "Why aren't they in good faith?",
  "Both.",
  "Ah, but that's in your view of it. I am saying that the opposite view of it is that your view of it puts lawyers in an impossible position, let alone the client.",
  "It -- it's not just that it's unfair. It's worse than unfair. The lawyer is under an obligation to represent his client, and he cannot do anything but tell the client: Just pay money to this particular plaintiff whose view of the law is totally contrary to every circuit court that's ever decided it. Now, how can you put lawyers in that position?",
  "But it -- but it suggests that you would like a -- a sensible interpretation of this that avoids the result I said, if possible. And there is a different way of going about it, which is you could say that a bona fide error in respect to a lawyer imposes much higher standards on that lawyer than it does on most -- and it's simply a client -- that before you can call an error bona fide, that lawyer really has to look into it. He has to have asked the FTC. He has to have gotten -- and made an effort to get a letter back. And if there are one or two circuits that hold the other way, well, where? And if you don't, you are not bona fide. Now, that would get to virtually the same place but it would protect the lawyer against true legal surprise.",
  "So how -- how do we do that? Because you see, you are quite right. The client runs the same risk in antitrust law in a whole other lot of areas. Absolutely right. But once you bring the lawyer into it, the lawyer has what he doesn't have in an antitrust case under your reading, which is an incentive to distort the law in order to protect his own pocketbook. And that is, to me, a big problem. So you say there is -- there is a -- a way around that. And what?",
  "The lawyer writes a letter to the client. The first thing the lawyer tries to do is to settle the case. \"Dear Client: Please send me the money, and by the way, if you don't owe it, tell me in writing.\" Okay? That's what the lawyer does. That's a legal activity. It's at the heart of practicing law, because nobody goes to court anymore. And -- though he will, if necessary, so he's part of this. Now, how do we get out of this problem that I'm putting? I'm really looking for an answer to that, because I think it's a big problem.",
  "Well, maybe your colleague can, but how -- so they define a -- the reasonable error falls in is because he's a person who regularly collects or attempts to collect consumer debts owed to a -- you know, owed to another person. That's pretty broad. That doesn't come about until '86. You are saying the bona fide language there is before, in '77?",
  "Okay. But then what - - how -- but I still can't figure out how we get this thing to work here, and -- and you just came up with a new idea.",
  "So -- I get -- okay.",
  "That's true of antitrust defendants, too.",
  "No, I see that. Is it - - is it -- what do you think of the idea that your opponent here has suggested that the way to deal with the lawyer's problem that I mentioned is simply read the substantive provisions, so that there is no violation for ordinary legal activity where they have gone and asked the FTC or you know, all the things that are against them? What you would have to do. That isn't so hard to do as I first thought, because the words that seem to make -- the primary words of what is outlawed are the words \"unfair or unconscionable means.\" Now I -- I doubt -- you would know -- I doubt that there are other words in the statute that forbid lawyers from doing anything that really shouldn't be forbidden. I mean, they shouldn't call people up in the middle of the night and harass them and so forth. But -- but you could read unfair and unconscionable means to say that where a lawyer is really hit by surprise, you know, all the circuits were against him, the FTC wouldn't give him an opinion, that he no longer is acting unfairly and unconscionably. What about that?",
  "That's right. I was seeing a special problem with lawyers. Call -- the unfairness problem that you are talking about, call that the antitrust problem, because it is just as much. But I saw the special problem of putting the lawyer in the impossible situation that you've just described. Now it's with respect to that problem that he offers the cure of reading the words \"unconscionable\" and what is it? \"Unconscionable and unfair means.\" Read those words to exempt the lawyer when he's in the dilemma I discussed, and therefore the lawyer will not have an incentive to -- to skew his advice.",
  "I was wondering if you know, can you give me just a rough idea, of the percentage of instances in which people write to the FTC to take advantage of the safe harbor and the FTC just says, \"Well, we won't tell you.\"",
  "How many have asked?",
  "I mean, it seems to me that's the obvious solution to the problem, that - - until you hold they are not -- they are liable for mistake of law, but anyone can write to the FTC ahead of time and -- and get a safe harbor. It's -- so I don't know what we could do to suggest maybe that mechanism, which is built into the statute, should be used.",
  "Well, all right. But I mean, if there have been seven requests and four answers then all these horrible things that are going to happen if you do say there is -- unless you have mistake of law defense, aren't going to happen. Because all that has to happen is that people write to the FTC and they get an answer.",
  "That means lawyer, if you are worried about this, go write before you do it.",
  "Oh, now I do see -- which is why I asked the question, I asked to get an answer, and the answer now seems to be floating around the FTC idea. It's -- seven letters, that isn't very much. I just wonder if the -- if the bar in this area, and their clients, if they made an effort, might be able to get the financing for the FTC so they could have enough people to respond quickly to the letter.",
  "All right. So I thought -- I thought -- as I read your complaint, almost every word of it had to do with pro -- per se violations. So I forget those here, right?",
  "You forget -- just yes or no. I forget it. Okay.",
  "Now, I've suddenly heard you talk -- the only thing left I could see was where you say, by their agreement to grant an exclusive license to Reebok, they unreasonably restrained trade in the markets. That's what I'm supposed to focus on?",
  "What other paragraph do you want me to focus on?",
  "No, I'm interested in the complaint at the moment.",
  "Yes. Okay. So I'm looking at the complaint.",
  "Fine. I get the point. I'm asking a question. And I just heard you say that you want, for example, were it -- you want the Patriots to sell T-shirts in competition with the Saints, or whoever. The Red Sox. All right. You see the point? The Red Sox -- I know baseball better.",
  "You want the Red Sox to compete in selling T-shirts with the Yankees; is that right?",
  "Yes. Okay. I don't know a Red Sox fan who would take a Yankees sweatshirt if you gave it away.",
  "I mean, I don't know where you’re going to get your expert from that is going to say there is competition --",
  "But you’re going to go back and prove that actually there is competition between those --",
  "Is that what this case is about?",
  "They have very small allowances, the 3-year-olds.",
  "All right. You think -- I guess you have a right to that. I'm not -- you have a right, but that's what you’re going to have to try --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "But I'm trying to look -- what I'm trying to get in my mind is what specific restraint you are focusing on. You listed three or four, and one of them is you want, in effect -- I'm joking about it, but it's true -- you are arguing that the Yankees should compete with the Red Sox in selling shirts. Another thing you are complaining about, which is the one I understand less, is that these teams got together and they agreed that they would just have one person sell all this stuff together. And what you think is that they individually should have decided whether to choose that one person, or maybe to choose two people, or three.",
  "Is that right?",
  "No.",
  "I find --",
  "I find it easier --",
  "-- to think about the case if I know what's going on. And I'm not certain this is irrelevant, but given Justice Scalia's persuasive remark, I will withdraw my question.",
  "And then the question I have -- I now understand this much better in light of that. And -- but I don't -- and -- and I see your point. What I'm not certain about is: Is it better to characterize it as a single entity, in which case we get into the kind of confusion that I think exists in this case? Or just say, look, it's a joint venture? If Panagra creates a joint venture, of course they are going to buy things like office space and employees, so it's reasonable by definition. We don't even look into it. Those things that are close enough -- take your criteria from 17, page 17, which are excellent criteria in my mind, and you say these are the criteria by which we decide whether those ancillary parts of a joint venture that is itself reasonable are also reasonable.",
  "No, no. We wouldn't say per se. We are saying that the justification here: They are reasonable. Why are they reasonable? Because there is a legitimate joint venture, and this is an ancillary part of that legitimate joint venture. People can attack it, but it's going to be no easier to attack than if they tried to attack what you call a single entity.",
  "I see.",
  "Copperweld -- look, your second criteria opens it up to attack in precisely the same way that my use of rule of reason does, because they are going to have to show it doesn't significantly affect actual or potential competition. Therefore, they file their claim; they say they win under the second criteria. That’s precisely the same as a person filing his claim and saying it's unreasonable. We are only talking terminology, but what worries me about this is the terminology, because I think that the lower courts have taken Copperweld terminology and transferred it to a place where it does, I think, perhaps not belong.",
  "The problem, as I see, for you in this case is that the basic conclusion is in the court of appeals, where it says: \"Viewed in this light, the NFL teams are best described as a single source of economic power when promoting NFL football through licensing.\" Well, how do we know that?",
  "Their allegation is that that isn't true. And I have -- and Copperweld just seems to me to be very confusing on this, since -- since my hornbook knowledge of it was we have Copperweld to deal with the case that we don't make booths in department stores compete in price against each other. All right? Normally, however, we say independent vendors can't get together and say they fix prices. That's per se. And joint ventures are in the middle, so we apply a rule of reason. Now, very simple. I thought that has been the law since Panagra. I don't know what, in fact, Copperweld has to do with it. And they are saying that this basic joint venture for promoting is not a reasonable agreement. So why shouldn't they have their shot? You might well win, but they want to make that claim.",
  "Fine, but that's the conclusion here. That's not the -- that's the conclusion. The question is: Should they be permitted to join their centers of economic power into one when they promote and sell their T-shirts, sweatshirts, et cetera?",
  "Now, you can't answer that question by announcing the conclusion.",
  "Well, can't it ask someone to do that? Oh. Oh, you are saying the game.",
  "What does a game to do with this? I thought we were talking about T-shirts and helmets, and I -- I thought it's the simplest thing in the world. You pick up the phone and say: Hello, Shanghai, do you have a helmet?",
  "This is a summary judgment motion?",
  "But now the question is: Are you basing that on economic-related data about the pros and the cons of -- you know, the economic harms of stopping them from competing versus the economic benefits of allowing them to act as a separate -- as a single entity? Or are you basing it on a pure legal word called \"single entity\"? And what worried -- I thought when I read the opinion, first, of the district court, that he's just following what I think started in the Seventh Circuit, unfortunately, of taking this word \"single entity\" and throwing around -- throwing it around all over the place and stopping the economic analysis. But then when I read the last paragraphs of his opinion, he seems to be saying, when I go back to the record, which you want me to do, I will discover that there is lots of information showing economic benefit to this venture of promoting together. There's nothing to suggest they could compete, and so it's clear, to the point where they don't get to trial, that this is a reasonable agreement. All right. Now, is -- have I -- am I right in thinking what you are thinking?",
  "All right. Good. Then I want to know what your position is.",
  "Yes --",
  "Well, I wouldn't read -- can you read Copperweld as follows? Copperweld is ratifying a decision by an entrepreneur or several to organize his entrepreneurial entity as one where there are obvious efficiencies in doing that, such as it would obviously be inefficient to have the sales people behind counters in a single department store competing with each other in price. A joint venture is a situation where it's debatable whether or not there is that kind of efficiency in organization, and, therefore, we apply a rule of reason. That's Panagra. I don't see anything in Copperweld that’s intended to overrule Panagra. And as long as Panagra is not overruled, we would apply, at least to major decisions by joint ventures, a rule of reason. Now, what is wrong with -- and you might still win on the rule of reason. But why isn't that analysis correct? I’m putting it forward as a hypothesis for you to discuss.",
  "There is very definitely a joint venture here to play football, but there isn't a joint venture to build houses, and there isn't a joint venture obviously in sight to promote. So they’re saying that there’s such a different activity, the playing of football versus the promotion of a logo, that we ought to go and look under a rule of reason as to whether a joint venture in promoting a logo is justified in terms of competition's harms and economic benefits.",
  "Well, it would be if they tried to do it, but, there, they would be attacked on the ground that under the rule of reason, they do not have the justification such that the antitrust law would allow them to do it.",
  "And they are saying: And promoting is precisely the same. That's why it seems to me to be something that you can't decide in theory. It's a matter of going back to economic facts with witnesses and so forth.",
  "So let's call it “NFL supermarket.” Red Sox supermarket, Patriots automobile shop, Patriots tractor store -- everything becomes Patriots. Everything -- no competition anywhere. Now, you say that's ridiculous, and once you say that's ridiculous, you are now into the business of deciding whether this aspect of the undeniable legal joint venture to play baseball or football -- whether this aspect is properly the subject of merger. And once you’re into that, you’re into your $7 million, and I can't really think of anything that's going to help you there.",
  "And the SG in its brief, you see, on that key 16 and 17, it seemed to me, simply reproduces in precisely somewhat different language, but precisely the argument you are now having: Is this the kind of thing that should be merged? We know by applying the rule of reason. And, second, if it is merged, is this particular aspect of it something where there could be competition, and there isn't much justification? That's their rule, too. Again, we are back to the rule of reason. So, how do I save you the $7 million?",
  "So we don't even ask the question whether under the rule of reason such a thing is reasonable or justified?",
  "So suddenly it's all a lot of things that would have been pre-empted to go to the board. For example, you have a labor dispute on a construction business, and one union's out there telling the other: Keep on going. And then some other group comes in and says: Don't let them do that to you. And another says: You don't have to do that under your contract. And there are 19 unions and they are all fighting about -- each other, and everybody is going to end up suing each other in Federal court. I thought the purpose of the LMRA was to stop that. The purpose of the Labor Act, the Wagner Act was to stop that. They didn't want Federal courts any more than State courts interfering in that kind of thing. So why should we read an exception into this?",
  "It would reproduce the situation that led all the Congresses and Presidents in the 1930s to stop it.",
  "Yes, that's right, and they said: Here's how we’ll deal with that. We’ll deal with that by giving the employer and the union a right to go into court and enforce the contract or get damages for its violation. That we figure furthers labor relations. But it's pretty hard for me to see how it could further labor relations by letting any third party under the sun come in and say everything that went on during a labor dispute is a -- is a tort in respect to the contract that might not even have been signed yet.",
  "Yes, but what -- there is no doubt about the formation, just as Justice Sotomayor said. There is a contract, the contract that was signed on December 17th. It is formed. You don't doubt that it's formed. They don't doubt that it's formed. And that contract has an arbitration agreement in it. And one of the questions that will be arbitrated, I take it, is whether that December 17th contract, because of its retroactivity provisions, provides damages for what happened in July. And part of that will require the arbitrator to interpret the December 17th contract --",
  "-- to decide whether it does cover that event of July 2nd. Now, what has this got to do -- I mean, I would have thought -- is that ­ - I mean, what is your argument?",
  "So, why isn’t --",
  "I think people are not communicating. Imagine on December 17th you and I enter into a contract and it's all written in red, all right? And one of these red sentences says: I will pay you $32 extra an hour from the moment that the blue contract went into effect. See? Now, whether -- that moment when the blue contract went into effect is a question, isn't it, that we would turn over to the arbitrator, the person who is arbitrating the meaning and application of the red contract. That's simply a question of fact and contractual meaning like any other. Now, what have I said that's wrong?",
  "Why is that a difficult issue? I can easily modify the hypothetical. The red contract says: Joe Smith will be paid $32 extra an hour from the moment when this red contract takes effect. Okay? And, now we have an issue, when everybody's agreed, we'll send the meaning of the contract to arbitration. We’ll send the application of the contract to -- to arbitration. One of the questions is: When, for purposes of the $32, did this contract, which we have admittedly signed, take effect? Why isn't that question for an arbitrator? Is there any authority at all --",
  "-- anywhere that says it isn't -- I can't -- I can't even know what authority ­ - what reasoning it would be.",
  "I thought of another way of putting this because I am having a hard time with it. You and I could do this, couldn't we? We could try to enter into a contract on May 1, and who knows what happens, we disagree about what happened, and by the way that had an arbitration clause in it. Now, whether -- since we disagree about it, that would go to the judge, whether we formed that contract with its arbitration clause, because everything's up in the air. A year later, we enter into another contract, and what that contract says is, we are going to arbitrate every dispute between us, including that old dispute about whether there was that old contract, okay? And we could do that, and then you would -- you would certainly arbitrate the issue of contract formation, even for the old one, because we said we would do it, right?",
  "Okay. So why isn't the December 17th contract that second contract in respect to the July 2nd?",
  "Just before you finish, Chief, is it all right if you -- I'm not quite clear on how this pre-emption works, and I perhaps didn't have it right. But imagine 301 had never been enacted. I thought, had that never been enacted, certain kinds of State claims, particularly tort claims of interference with labor contracts, for example, might have been pre-empted anyway by the Labor Relations -- by the -- by the LMRA. I thought that did the basic pre-emptive job. And then where it is pre-empted by the LMRA, 301 creates an exception to the pre-emption, so that it isn't pre-empted, if you have a suit. Now, my thinking is probably out-of-date and wrong, so I would like you to explain how it works.",
  "No, no, because I think that your response to the Chief Justice's question, which is why I became uncertain, is that it is the LMRA -- not the LMRA at all that pre-empts tort actions and State activities that interfere with labor relations, as this might. It is, rather, section 301 itself that pre-empts it, and then it is odd because it pre-empts it, but it says, we won't give you any, and -- and that's why I became uncertain.",
  "Well, that may be, but then you might have -- then you’d have a remedy in State court. I think the argument was that -- anyway, I have this argument: 301 doesn't pre-empt anything but the contract claim. Now, go bring your claim in State court. You might have a good claim in State court that isn't pre-empted. Suppose one of their employees hit somebody over the head. You’d have a great claim, and that isn't going to be pre-empted. Now, yours might be, because there is a set of tort actions in State court that the labor acts pre-empt; in particular, those that involve conduct that is arguably protected or arguably forbidden by the labor acts. So, if you fall outside that category, you are not pre-empted. And if you fall inside the category, you should be pre-empted; not by 301, but by the labor law which gave this kind of decision to the labor board to make. What is -- is that argument sensible? Is it right? What do you think?",
  "So what happens -- in other words, suppose the landlord here really wants the guy to clear out, so he puts thumbtacks on the ground and horrible-smelling things all over. And then the franchisee leaves, but the franchisor says: Hey, I didn't want you to leave; that's your problem. I mean, that's constructive eviction or constructive termination?",
  "Now suppose it's the same situation, but this person, the franchisee, being quite indefatigable and daring, finds a way of sneaking through the barbed wire that has been put up. And there’s one pump they forgot, and there’s a car that comes up, and he serves that person. Now is it constructive eviction?",
  "No?",
  "Objective? You’d say any sensible person would clear out immediately. There are lions and tigers roaming the gas station.",
  "And suppose he doesn't, though, that he doesn't clear out because he's not sensible, and he just desperately needs the money.",
  "But if they do something reasonably designed -- a reasonable person would clear out, then why not clear out?",
  "So what's the test?",
  "What's the test? Because if you say we are going to give an action to a person who didn't clear out, although the franchisor was trying to get him to clear out, you are then going to convert into a Federal action every single breach of contract or serious breach of contract that there is, which is the precise opposite of what Congress wanted when it passed this statute. So, what is your test as to we know that your case is the lions and tigers case?",
  "I wouldn't put it that way. I’d say constructive termination means you didn't terminate. Okay? That's what \"constructive\" means. It means you didn't do it. But sometimes a franchisor could act in such a way that the law should treat it as if he really did. All right? I can imagine a test for that. But we have the second problem here, is that even if the conduct was designed -- it's equal to terminating it -- this individual didn't leave.",
  "So he was still there running the business. That's the part I would like to test for.",
  "No. I want to know your test for deciding -- even though the first part is met, how you apply it when the person didn't leave? I understand a person who left. He left.",
  "The franchisor says: I didn't tell him to leave. And then you go look to see if the franchisor's conduct was so bad, it was the same as if you told him to leave. I've got that part. The part I don't have is what happens if he doesn't leave? Because one thing we know, the conduct wasn't so bad that this person left, because he didn't leave. That's that second part that's bothering me.",
  "I need -- the injunctive remedies in the State court?",
  "Yes, all right. But the reason I need a test is because the other side is saying: I know what the test is; the test is he has to leave.",
  "So if you -- if you can show me some cases or a test or something where he didn't have to leave, even though the franchisor's conduct was so bad that a reasonable person would have left, then I'm on to something and I know where to go.",
  "The problem that -- that I see here is that if in fact you are right, that the -- the franchisor -- he breached the contract in your view. Did that breach rise to a termination? Did it rise to that level? Now, it's simply a question, since he breached the contract, of what court you are going to sue in, in your view. If this isn't a termination, you sue in State court; if it is a termination, you sue in Federal court. So, why -- why wouldn't we say, well, let him sue in State court, because if the person stays on the premises, everything becomes blurred. If you require him to leave the premises, then it's clear. If you were to let him stay on the premises and also argue it's a termination, we are going to have people coming into Federal court because they think there are more damages or something, I guess, or whatever reason. There will be a whole lot of unclear cases. So it's better to have a clear line.",
  "You are going to say they have a right to, but the other side thinks they don't. So it doesn't answer my question to just refer to the fact that you have a right to. My question is a practical question: What's the harm of sticking to the clear line that is normally there in other cases, in this case not depriving your client of a remedy at all?",
  "Just saying he goes to State court to get it.",
  "Well, you have a choice, you know. So, here's your choice, dealer: Stay there and sue in State court, and by the way, if they are charging you too much money under the contract and you are really hurting doing -- putting lions and tigers, whatever they are doing, go get an injunction in State court. See? They have injunctions in State courts. That exists.",
  "Or, you have the other choice. Move out.",
  "Then if you move out, you can sue under Federal law, and you will get all these other things like the extra million dollars or something. So, move out and get the extra money, or stay there and sue under State court. Why is that a bad choice?",
  "The theory of it is to protect the dealer, and the dealer here is faced with a company that says, we are not going to renew your lease. And they are unreasonable, and the dealers think. The statute says: Fine, don't renew it, okay? And, here, we’ll give you a really good deal, so you won't be hurt. If you really think he's wrong, go sue for an injunction. And, second, we are going to give you extra bonus damages and attorneys' fees and all that stuff. So we protected you a lot. Now, why should there be a third thing that the statute says nothing about, which nobody's ever heard of? You just stay there, and you say: I'm going to just do business every day, just like nothing happened, and I write the words under protest. I mean, why would Congress have gone to all that trouble if that's all you have to do?",
  "No, but there is a purpose, and the purpose is that this system at least brings a judge in to see if that dealer really does have enough of a claim to get this relaxed injunction. But your system leaves it 100 percent up to that dealer. It could be heard of that dealer really doesn't have a good claim, and all he does is write the words \"under protest.\"",
  "But you don't have a judge in it, at that stage, under your interpretation.",
  "The -- I don't know if this is relevant or how to use it, but years ago, I took a course in this kind of thing at the Kennedy School. I was teaching, and they said the only way you could figure out what -- what's what here is you use something called “binomial theorem,” and you have to have, like, urns, and you imagine that there’s an urn with 1,000 balls, and 60 of them are red, and 940 are black, and then you select them at random, and -- and 12 at a time. You know, fill 12 -- fill a hundred with 12 in each. And when we tried to do that, just for the interest of it, I -- I found that you would expect, with these numbers, something like a third to a half of juries would have at least one black person on it. Now, that may be wrong, because I am not a mathematician, but -- but putting that together, it looks as if there is a pretty big disparity.",
  "On the other hand, that isn't what they testified to, so I guess you’re going to tell me just ignore it and forget it.",
  "Well, you know, maybe it’s the only way to do it, that the statistician stays with these urns, which I guess they have computer programs for.",
  "I -- I don't know, in other words, and maybe I should just -- I hate to write something, like, saying 2 and 2 is 6.",
  "No. You can skip it, if you want. If there's any comment, fine.",
  "I don't know. The one thing I learned from the urn business is it never turns out the way you think.",
  "For example, it had the example of, like, the eight: There are eight out of a hundred, and you run this thing a thousand times, and you’ll discover that there is one black juror on about half the juries, or a third, anyway. That's much more than I would have thought intuitively. And I might not have even read the example correctly. So you see why I -- I’m at sea, as soon as you tell me to be a statistician. I even got a book called Statistician for Lawyers. That didn't help me very much.",
  "Okay. So, is there anybody who said whether -- if all -- they all take their jurors first, the districts, and Grand Rapids uses a higher percentage of jurors. So now there -- and they have more of the black jurors, so that there are fewer left over --",
  "That could be. Now, is there any -- in this record, does anybody say whether that's okay or not? I mean, to -- to have people serve jury duty near where they live or nearer where they live, on its face, is not so bad. Did -- did anybody say whether this is good or bad?",
  "Are you --",
  "Now, why is it -- I’m just not clear in my mind. Why is this siphoning bad? My impression, which may be wrong, is you -- you have a thousand people in the room, let's say, and if you let the district courts choose first, people will serve nearer where they live. Now -- and so most of them would rather serve nearer where they live. And the result of that could be, for the reasons that were stated, that then there are fewer minorities on the more general jurors that draw from a wider area, and I don't know about the merits of that. I mean, I see a negative, and I see a positive. So is it -- it doesn't seem to me obviously bad, nor is it obviously good. So what should I do?",
  "Right.",
  "Well, but -- but that's just the explanation of the problem that we're seeing.",
  "The problem we're seeing is that if Grand Rapids has a higher juror utilization rate and they have a higher minority population, then you will end up with the leftover juries having a lower minority population. Now, the explanation for that is that you choose the district judges -- you choose the district jurors first. My question to you is: I -- if you're just a -- I'm not instructed in this area. If you were just to tell me, what do I think of that, I would say I'm not sure. I think you have fewer minorities, that's true, but people get to serve closer to home. Now -- now, can you enlighten me a little bit about this?",
  "Well, I wouldn't say that, but I still haven't -- I will try again. Forget the cases. As I’m hearing this, all I’m hearing is: Well, if you let the -- if you say that the wider area should choose first, you will get a higher number of minorities, but very tiny number; I mean a very small addition, one or two people. And if you do it the way they’re doing it, you'll lose those one or two people, but you will let people serve closer to home. So I just think -- as a person, not as a judge -- that's why I am letting you answer it as a judge -- but I mean, I’d say, well, it doesn't sound like much of a big deal. And -- and I do see an advantage in this, of the way they are doing it, so, now, you tell me what's -- what's wrong with that?",
  "So what if --",
  "All right. So is --",
  "What about the -- the more I listen, the more I think you think there are a lot of things people could do. They could send three letters; they could explain in the letters why it's important to come; they could try reversing the thing a little bit with the districts first or not first -- all kinds of things. But what -- but now you’re forcing them into this legal rubric. So what about a decision, which you wouldn’t like, probably, but it would say we can't say that they’re unreasonable in respect to not having all of these, but there -- who knows? You know, when they get around and others try them, et cetera. In other words, unreasonable/reasonable is one standard, and ambiguity plays a -- a role here, too, that might be helpful.",
  "Well, the SG says that isn't trust law. The SG says that trust law -- when you make a mistake and you send it back, that the district judge has a choice here, which would make sense. The district judge, if he thinks he’s going to get something out of the trust -- the administrator, listens to him. I mean, it sounds like common sense would be: Listen to the administrator, but you don't have to do it.",
  "Because it's very complicated. He may understand it.",
  "So, is she wrong? You’re saying if I look at those cases, I’ll find --",
  "It's not -- it's not a standard of review. It's -- he's trying to figure out what the word \"duplicative\" means, okay? And the -- and the administrator did his best. He says it means what it meant before, which is, like, 14 pages of who-could-understand-it. Okay.",
  "And then it turns out that that isn't what it means, and the district judge says: That's affirmed. So now he says: Give me another shot. If it were me, I’d listen, but if I thought this isn't really that great, I would try to figure out something else. And then if I were a court of appeals judge, I’d say it's up to the district court.",
  "Now, luckily, the SG says that is the law.",
  "Yes.",
  "Says it isn't the law.",
  "What about just that? He came back, the administrator, I think, the second time, with something that very closely resembled the first time.",
  "And what about that for a reason thinking he’s not in that good of faith? Go ahead.",
  "It's -- it struck me if -- it's hard. I don't necessarily follow it at all, but the -- you had this original plan where, basically, you were trying to figure out how much money they took away, and you compared it with what it would have made if you had invested it in certain funds. So now we have a new word, which is called \"duplicative\"; you can't be duplicative, something like that. And then the Second Circuit says that new word called “duplicative” for new plans doesn't really pick up this old phantom system; at least, it doesn't give notice. Now he sends it back, and the poor district judge, since he thought that was perfectly sensible to say it did pick that up, says: Well, they told me it didn't, so I’ll ask the administrator what do you think we do now? The administrator says: I have a great idea; the plain vanilla system. The plain vanilla system happens to be very much like the old system, except in following your own funds, you’re not doing it; you’re following the -- the insurance industry's funds.",
  "So, I mean, that’s -- it's what they’ll pay for an annuity.",
  "And that's called -- that's called their funds. That's called what they think they’ll earn.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes. Correct, and the question is: What is attributable to? And they struck down your phantom system for doing it, and then the administrator comes back with a new system, which new system is going to take the judgment of the insurance companies about what was accrued.",
  "All right, fine. And then what he's thinking is that's awfully similar. We just substituted different people here --",
  "It's similar in a sense, and it's different in a sense.",
  "But the -- the more you hypothetically grow it, the less chance they’ll get the floor.",
  "And so they’d like it to get the floor, and so they’d like it to be --",
  "Is that right?",
  "That's true.",
  "Up until this time?",
  "Why -- why -- as I understand it -- which big if -- you and I are both working at Xerox, and in year 1 -- and we each have 500,000 in our contribution account, and you leave, and you take the 500,000. I stay, and I don't. Okay? Now, my 500,000 over the next 10 years is going to grow somewhat -- as long as it wasn't 2007. But it --",
  "Okay. I might spend it, but if I leave it there, it would grow, okay. But some -- some people leave it there, they grow.",
  "So, when figuring the floor, what Xerox does is look to see how much it grew. They look at the whole thing, now, 10 years later, and they say, you’re up above the floor, good-bye, we will give you this, not the floor, okay. Now, you are in the same position, and you happen to come back to Xerox, and all they want to do is say, you know, we’d like to assume yours grew, too, I mean, not -- a little, anyway, and the first thing they wanted to do is to say it should have grown the same way we treat our own guys, as it having grown. And the court of appeals says that's wrong because you left the words out, but send it back to see it's fair. So then the expert comes in, and the expert says, well, they didn't want to give us that way to grow it; here is how -- we will assume it grew like an insurance company, the most incredibly conservative people in the world, how -- how they would have treated it as growing, if you bought an annuity right then, and that just gives us even a lower number. And -- and they want to say, why didn't you at least listen to that, instead of coming to the fact which is very, very unusual, it didn't grow at all, in which case, you are eligible for the floor.",
  "So I think that's why they think it's either an abuse of discretion or you should have listened more to the -- to the expert -- should have done something else.",
  "It's a pretty big windfall for people. You’re working at Xerox, and your plan is about approaching the minimum level -- let's quit and then go invest it, and then come back 3 days before you’re bound to retire, and then you’re going get whatever the plan grew, and you’ll also get your minimum.",
  "Well, why would anyone promise them that kind of a deal?",
  "What about -- a bit more serious question -- I mean, that is a serious question, but the more general question, what about something that is analogous to Skidmore deference?",
  "So you say --",
  "You say -- you take the -- the district judge here can take -- takes the administrator's opinion for what it's worth.",
  "He has to listen to it.",
  "That is essentially the principle, I thought.",
  "But he does have to read it. He has to read it --",
  "Read it, and take it for what it's worth.",
  "You don't think they would -- you think they would do that?",
  "Yes. Okay.",
  "Is there a way for the lawyer -- a lawyer sees that his client has a good case against the government, and thinks he can get an EAGA fee, so he says to the client: I'd like to represent you and I can get paid for this. But the client says: There are a lot of debts I owe the government. Now, is there any way they can work it out so he can get the representation?",
  "What?",
  "In other words, the lawyer and the agency and the client sit down, and the lawyer says: Here, I can get some money for this client and that will help everybody, but I want to be paid. So I want you, Agency, to agree that on the repayment schedule if I get an EAGA fee, then I get to keep it and I don't have to give it to my client, who will have to give it to the government. And then they can sign a piece of paper and then that's done and the lawyer gets to keep the money.",
  "And has that ever happened?",
  "But it could now. Now people would know about, and they could do it.",
  "On the first one, imagine that the -- a trust owes some money to the government. Now, suppose a lawyer representing the trust recovers. Now, they recover on a separate debt, okay? Separate debt? One. That money goes to the trust. Right?",
  "The trust first owes -- the trust owes $1,000 to the government. The trust then independently recovers $500 from the government on a different matter.",
  "The government couldn't offset that?",
  "Yes. Of course it could.",
  "But the trust is not a person entitled to the benefit of the payment.",
  "The beneficiaries of the trust are entitled to the benefit of the payment.",
  "It's not entitled to the benefit of the $500. The trust holds money for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust. So --",
  "-- it can’t -- you agree that that couldn't be?",
  "Yes, and once you agree that that couldn't be, I think you are in trouble on your first argument. I'm not sure.",
  "Well, similarly, the -- the guy -- the client here receives the benefit of the money that he has just gotten from the government, including the attorney's fees. It happens that he can't keep those attorney's fees, just as the trust can't keep the $500. He has to give the attorney's fees to the lawyer, just as the trust eventually has to give the $500 to the beneficiary. So I'm simply saying -- drawing a parallel, which -- go on to the next issue.",
  "Well, how is it different? Look. This, what I was talking about, has nothing to do With EAJA.",
  "It has to do with when the government's allowed to offset some money.",
  "And it's allowed to offset some money when the money is money that it would otherwise give to a payee. All right?",
  "And then you've defined \"payee\" as a person who has some beneficial interest in that money.",
  "And I think that the client here has no more and no less beneficial interest whether he's a person or whether he's a trust. That was my point.",
  "Okay.",
  "I don't understand your earlier point.",
  "Imagine that if Joe Smith is in a lot of financial trouble.",
  "His house is being foreclosed on --",
  "-- all his bank accounts are attached. Then he gets some money from the government and -- including an EAJA fee.",
  "And it's $5,000 of money and 1,000 for the fee. They put it in his bank account. It was attached, good-bye, nobody sees the money, because it's whoever attached it got the money. Is that possible?",
  "I'm making this up. I'm not talking about the government. I'm saying the government paid him 5,000 plus 1,000 in an EAJA fee, and the bank got all the money because it had attached his bank account. Is that possible?",
  "I'm making it up. No. It has nothing to do with -- I'm just making up --",
  "-- a hypothetical.",
  "All right?",
  "You follow that. Those are the facts.",
  "Okay. So a year later, Joe Smith is doing much better. Couldn't the attorney now sue him for the $1,000, say I’d like it? It went to the bank because they had attached the bank account.",
  "All right. Now, suppose it happened to be that that 6,000, 5 for the one and 1 for the other, came from Social Security. Then how does that make a difference?",
  "It couldn't take 1,000?",
  "Couldn't take any of it. Because of?",
  "Is that in here?",
  "And the EAJA fee counts as a Social Security benefit?",
  "I changed it and said, now, how does it matter if it’s Social Security?",
  "If you win this case?",
  "In other words -- in other words, no one can attach? No one can -- no one get the EAJA fee by attaching the bank account of the client?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, skip my points. They’re too complicated.",
  "How is it absent? Because the statute says that the established -- the -- it's established -- namely, the unlawful employment practice -- it's established only if, and certainly if, the respondent uses --",
  "-- a particular employment practice that has a disparate impact. That refers back to (a)(2). So back in that period, on a certain date, he used that limiting practice, and, therefore, on that particular date, he established the unlawful employment practice by using a test that limited, et cetera.",
  "Is my impression -- is there anything else in that (k)? You see, it lists about 10 things, let's say 10 -- imagine. One of those things is that it was used. Now, all the other things there will not have been -- are things that -- that -- to do with the test, basically. So you have like six or seven that have to do with the test and the criteria, and then you have one that it was used.",
  "And -- and so I thought, looking at the list, it's quite right that it's used for a different purpose but --",
  "But, I mean, this (k) has to do with a different thing, but -- but -- and the critical element of it was that the practice be used.",
  "Well, you'd have to then say that all the things that are there, the other nine and so forth -- all those nine things --",
  "Well --",
  "Yes.",
  "No, well, that's true -- it does --",
  "Supposing that -- what you say is you want to engage in political advocacy on behalf of the Kurds. That's your words. All right. Suppose -- and these are two hypotheticals. Hypothetical one, your clients, let's say, or some other people, know that what the Kurds' hypothetical plan is, is to pretend they're a political advocacy organization, but to go around shooting the people who don't agree with them. Okay? Case one, the hypothetical defendant knows it. In case two, he doesn't know it, but it's true.",
  "Well, wait. They want to apply. They want to do --",
  "They say in this case that they want to provide training in the issue of humanitarian international law, and they want to provide training and expert advice and assistance in respect to how you petition the UN. Now focusing on those two things, and going back to Justice Sotomayor's question, why -- what is the government's interest in the following? Under O'Brien or any other test, you look at it and say, does teaching have a First Amendment interest -- training? Yes. And what about teaching about advocacy? That's what they are doing, teaching about a certain kind of advocacy. Yes. Therefore there is a First Amendment interest implicated, seriously. Now, when that is seriously implicated, there is also a government interest, on the other side, in not having terrorism. But there is a less restrictive alternative which they suggest, that in that situation, what they're entitled to read this statute as saying is that, if they believe and a person reasonably would believe that their teaching, assistance, training, would not significantly aid this organization in its unlawful ends, then they are not guilty. Now, what is the government's interest in not accepting that interpretation? The First Amendment is hurt; there is an interest; but there is what they describe as -- and what I have narrowed -- a less restrictive way of going about it. And they have to be reasonable in what they think. Now, what's the objection to that?",
  "I'm sorry. I’m not talking about tsunami aid. I am talking about the instance where the teaching is itself teaching about how to do something, and that something is the kind of thing that the First Amendment protects.",
  "Fine, and if a reasonable person would know that, that it's going to help them, then it is unlawful, if it's going to help them and a reasonable person would think it was going to help them in their unlawful activities. But we're not --",
  "Well, but petitioning the United Nations -- and that's what you are teaching them -- does not, on its face, seem to me to be something that reasonably you would think was going to aid them in their unlawful objectives, but for the realm of ideas. Now --",
  "-- and then Congress put a thing in here which says: Don't construe this statute in a way that will abridge First Amendment rights. So it's aware of the problem of First Amendment rights.",
  "And is there any evidence that something like that would, in fact, but for the realm of ideas, help this organization commit its terrorist acts?",
  "Well, in that -- on the -- just forget the harmonica for a second; I'm more worried about the lawyer. You’re saying that a -- a group abroad which may have some American citizens in it -- let's assume they do -- want to hire a lawyer. And this lawyer is supposed to file some amicus briefs and do other activities. You’re saying Congress has forbidden that in this statute, and that's constitutional?",
  "But I want to know if that's what you’re saying, what I just said: that an organization has American citizens, engages in terrible stuff, but they are not entitled under the Constitution to have a lawyer in the United States who does legal work like filing amicus briefs.",
  "What is this to do -- I mean, the obvious question, to me, is -- since I wrote the -- I think I wrote the opinion in Castillo -- is we looked at the language of the statute, very similar to this, and we said: Machinegun means a separate crime. And they recodified it. And it looks to me as if all they did was take the things that we previously said were separate crimes and put them in (B), and take the things that are obviously sentencing factors and put them in (A) and (C). All right. Now, that's what it looks like if you just read the statute. I didn't find anything in the history that suggested any other intent. So why do you think that that change makes the difference?",
  "To make your life a little more complicated and difficult, though perhaps it makes it easier, we reach the questions that Justice Scalia was raising, I think, and they are important only if you win, only if we say that it is a sentencing factor. If it is a new crime, we don't have any problem, because if it's a new crime, the jury has to find the fact. But if it's a sentencing factor, then we get into the problem of Harris versus Apprendi. And then you have to decide whether it's maximum, minimum, et cetera. But in Harris, I said that I thought Apprendi does cover mandatory minimums, but I don't accept Apprendi. Well, at some point I guess I have to accept Apprendi, because it's the law and has been for some time. So if and in fact, unfortunately for everyone, I was -- it was 5-4 in that, I think, so my vote mattered, and I don't know what other people think but in -- on this Court. But if that becomes an issue, if that should become an issue about whether mandatory minimums are treated like the maximums for Apprendi purposes, should we reset the case for argument? Or do you feel, in your opinion that -- that you’ve had enough of an argument because you devoted two or three pages to this topic?",
  "Well, I think basically Apprendi did significantly change McMillan, but that’s --",
  "Does the government believe that it has sufficiently argued this, or would you suggest on the government's behalf that if it becomes an issue it's set for reargument? That was really my question.",
  "No, their -- their -- their basic argument is look at the statute. (A) has what is undoubtedly a set of sentencing factors. Brandishing and discharging are as traditional as they come. Then look at (C), and you find some other ones that are sentencing factors, because recidivism is as traditional as it comes. And between those two they put (B). So since the neighbors, (A) and (C), are certainly sentencing, they must have meant (B) to be a is one of their basic arguments.",
  "Is there anything other -- do we have anything other than the statute itself? When I looked at the statute itself, I thought, well, all that's happened here is nobody's thought of this issue at all; nobody's read Castillo. What really happened is somebody in the legislative drafting section was focusing on what he said they were focusing on, Bailey, and then they have a form manual. So they followed the form manual. Now, is there anything to suggest that isn't what happened?",
  "Well, what is the basic purpose of this statute? I'm having a hard time with it. Is it -- is the purpose of the statute to try to get a lot of people to register who haven't registered at all? Or is the purpose of the statute to get the people who had registered in one State and then moved, and make sure they register in another State?",
  "No, I mean, if they are just trying to get people to register in general, and they are not particularly worried about travel, then they are using this travel as a kind of jurisdictional hook. And if they are using it as a jurisdictional hook, they’d like to get everybody, as many as possible. That argues against you.",
  "I -- I have a hard time seeing just what they’re aiming at.",
  "Basically, at the time they passed this --",
  "-- most States didn't require registration.",
  "Would you say this at the moment -- you may not know, but I think it would be helpful. At the time this was passed, would you say almost all States had some kind of registration act?",
  "Yes. Okay.",
  "Now, thinking of that -- thinking of that set of registration acts in virtually every State, did most of those or none of them or a few of them or how many made it required that a person register who had committed a crime, a sex crime, in a different State and had moved to that State? Most, all of them, none of them?",
  "Universally.",
  "All right. So -- so, therefore, every person who has committed a sex offense, or almost everyone, would have been subject to a requirement to move when he committed the offense and would have been subject to a requirement to register when he moved under some law. Now, Congress's purpose then must have been just to try to get uniformity here.",
  "Well, what about going back to the purpose? There's a section on page 26 of the House report where they go in some length to saying that the purpose is this is going to help with 100,000 missing people. Don't worry; if you can't remember, it doesn't matter. What they say is there are 100,000 missing. What they do is they travel, let's say, from Alabama to California and they don't register. Now, this statute is going to help with that. Well, how does it help with that? They are already supposed to register in California. And I thought, well, maybe the way it helps with that is that it imposes some new information requirements, so that Alabama, if it were complying, would now have a lot of information about the sex offender, and it would have an obligation -- it could more easily track him down, or at least California could or somebody could more easily track him down, because he has to give information to Alabama, and Alabama has a registry up. Is there something like that in this?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, but that’s -- that’s true of everybody whether they have moved or not moved.",
  "That is, what I’m -- the reason I brought up the other is because if this is just a jurisdictional hook, I can see why Congress might be trying to get as many people as they want to register. But this -- this also serves some purpose, like we’re going to make Alabama get some information, makes it easier to catch these people, that purpose wouldn't be served when the travel takes place before this takes effect because Alabama wouldn't have kept the information then.",
  "Okay. So Congress passes this statute. And how does it help specifically with that?",
  "Okay. So the person who hasn't registered in California --",
  "He’s afraid of the Feds. He didn't -- he wasn't afraid of the California police, but he’s afraid of the Feds. Okay. I've got it. I've got that. Any other thing?",
  "Okay. As far as I can read that page, it seemed to me, insofar as what you’ve just said is true, that would happen only after this statute is passed. And, therefore, the fact that he had moved before the statute is passed would not trigger the cooperation. It might trigger the Fed prosecution part, but it wouldn't trigger the cooperation part.",
  "The only reason I bring it up is if this is a very close case. That tends to cut somewhat against you; namely, that the thing applies full-force in terms of its purposes to people who travel after, but it only applies as sort of this weak thing to people who travel before.",
  "Have you been able to find -- when in doubt about the purpose, let's turn to the language. Is it the case that you found any other statute, any other statute, where Congress phrased a jurisdictional hook in the present tense?",
  "Do you find anywhere where they’re both phrased in present tense and it was pretty clear that Congress intended to catch activity that was -- at least where the jurisdictional part took place before the statute took effect? You find that good an analogy anywhere?",
  "One last one. It should help with a minor point. But -- but I take it, under the statute, you have to register if you are a sex offender. And that's true whether you’ve moved or not moved?",
  "Yes.",
  "But it's a crime -- it's a crime under the section we’re talking about only if you are both the person who had to register and you didn't and you moved?",
  "Yes. Okay.",
  "Everybody in the State has to register if they meet that definition?",
  "Moved or not?",
  "Okay.",
  "It doesn't. He said, first the crime has to take place, before the travel.",
  "And, moreover, there’s a statutory limitation, because after a certain period of years, you don't have to register anymore. So the hypotheticals about the infant and 20 years ago are out, because the longest it could last is 15 years.",
  "And then you wouldn't have committed the crime as an infant, so there we are. But it's still a long time, 15 years, I grant you.",
  "I assume you could make all that argument on remand, if we remand it. But what's your argument -- apparently from what I've read in this case, the Second Circuit uses a standard of plain error that nobody else uses.",
  "And it says that all the other circuits say: This is our set of standards, and we've set them forth. And the Second Circuit says: No, it's -- you have to have a new trial if there’s any possibility, no matter how unlikely.",
  "Now, nobody else uses that. It seems contrary to our cases, and is there any justification for their using it?",
  "Because unless I can hear a justification, I would guess I would vote to say send it back and let them use the same standard anybody else does.",
  "What's your response to that?",
  "So why don't you make the --",
  "The very magnitude of the error would argue for -- you’d win on any test. I mean, why does that say you have to use a special test that is specially designed to find when there is hardly any error? Here there’s such a bigger error, according -- that you think that you would have won under any test. So that -- so why -- why do you do have to have this special favorable test? That's -- that's the question that I'm thinking of. I'm not thinking of whether you are right or whether you are wrong on the -- how much evidence there was and how awful it was.",
  "That's true. And also no person should be convicted with a confession that was coerced. And no person should be convicted with evidence given under torture. And no person should be convicted with evidence unlawfully seized by the police. Now, for all those latter things, every court apparently uses the normal standard. So why would we in this case use a special standard?",
  "How do you say we -- in your opinion, if we agreed with your basic idea -- if, which is totally hypothetical.",
  "If we agreed with that, how would we sketch the lines? That is, when does the jury -- does the judge have to do more than is ordinary, and what counts as more than ordinary? I mean, I -- what I have fear of, to put it out for you, is that jury selection can go on a very long time.",
  "And judges have to -- have to run their trials. And if we tell the judges that they have got to do more, that will become exaggerated, and they’ll administer it in a way that will make it hard to select juries. That's the harm I'm worried about. So I'm asking you, how would you sketch a line that prevents that harm?",
  "I didn't ask you -- I just asked you to do your best.",
  "So we’ve got the wave of public passion --",
  "And what about the second half?",
  "All right. Now, what's the second half? The second half, which I'm really worried about, is that we get into the business of running the trial court's trials. So I want to know what it is that the trial court at that stage, in your opinion, other than transfer, has to do?",
  "What happens if -- I gather -- that a -- that a trial judge has a panel in front of him and people say, yes, I think he is guilty? And -- and the trial judge says, now, if you listen to the presumption, can you be fair? You look him in the eye, and if he says, yes, I can put this aside, trial judges do accept those jurors. Now, if that is the practice, and others would know more than me, then our -- our -- I'm worried about changing that ordinary practice.",
  "There's no problem? I went through the 200 pages, and I counted -- this is only my own subjective recounting of it, but I counted six of whom only one lasted, but I counted five others that they had to use peremptories on that include one juror, 29, who herself was a victim of this offense to the tune of $50,000 or $60,000. The judge said: I will not challenge her for cause. I counted another, juror -- what's this one -- juror number -- number’s 74, who when he looked her square in the eye and said, \"Can you be fair?\" She said, \"I can't say yes for sure. No.\" Okay? So, in my own subjective account, there were five here, maybe six, certainly three, that perhaps if they'd had an appeal on peremptories, which apparently they don't, they might have said these should have been challenged for cause. So I’m concerned about the 5 hours, about the lack of excusal for cause, about the very, very brief questions that he provided to people who had said on the questionnaire they could be -- they could be biased. They said we think he's guilty, for example. And all those are cause for concern. At the same time, I’m worried about controlling too much a trial judge. I’ve expressed those concerns. I know this is a special case. Half, almost, of the jury questionnaires they just threw out. And the community -- you know all the arguments there. You see what's worrying me. And I’m worried about a fair trial in this instance and to say -- and I'm genuinely worried, and -- and I’d like to hear your response to the kind of thing I'm bringing up.",
  "I’d never heard of an instance where a trial judge would not challenge for cause -- but I'm not saying it doesn't happen -- where the juror herself is a victim of the offense to the tune of $50,000 to $60,000. See, we are getting into an area that I'm not familiar with, but I think that that's not supposed to be.",
  "No, but it's not just one. There were like five, of which I have given you the worst, and they had to use up all their peremptories. And they can't appeal this. And it's that taken together, plus the one who sat, juror 11, provides, as they point out for the reasons they say, some cause for concern. And that's what I'm trying to get at.",
  "Go ahead with it, but they didn't challenge 63 for cause, so I guess they waived it.",
  "Let's try juror number -- let's try 76: Judge: \"Here's the detail that really concerns me. You said, 'I think they're all guilty.'\" \"Right.\" \"Now, there's nothing wrong with thinking that, if that's what you really think. You just need to tell us that.” “Okay.” “That's what you think, isn't it?” “It's been a long time since I answered that questionnaire.” “Right. Now, as you\" -- Okay? Now, that’s -- that, as far as I could tell, is as close as I can get to a recantation of what she thought originally.",
  "You can -- well, you focus on what you just put together. You said intent to deceive, intent to violate the law. I believe in another case, you’re saying they don't have to have an intent to violate the law because there was no State law that prohibited whatever was at issue. So is the government now saying -- which is a big difference -- that you cannot convict somebody unless they know, i.e., they intend to violate a law that forbids the conduct in which they are engaging, other than this honest services law, or are you not saying that?",
  "You’re not saying that.",
  "Then if you're not saying that, what the person has to carry around with them is an agency treatise.",
  "Yes, I mean, of course they intend to -- it's not the case that is obvious; it's the case that is not obvious that worries me, and --",
  "-- in the case that is not obvious, of course they intend to withhold information. I agree with that. But the problem is they don't know it's unlawful to do so.",
  "Then on 932, she does answer it, and says, “He's assumed innocent.” “And can you conscientiously carry out that assumption?” “I could honestly say I will give it my best.”",
  "And so the judge looks her in the eye and says -- fine.",
  "I see. And I'll --",
  "I'll read that again. But my question is, can we get a hold of these 238 questionnaires? Are they in the record in front of us?",
  "That happened about 2 hours and 15 minutes into the exercise, didn't it?",
  "Okay. So -- so what we have here is a course of conduct, 2 hours and 15 minutes of saying nothing.",
  "Would you say that that’s -- that's gone past the point where --",
  "In Butler he said: I will talk to you, but I am not signing any forms.",
  "What they say is, “a course of conduct” -- we will not hold -- “This does not mean a defendant's silence, coupled with an understanding and a course of conduct indicating waiver, may never support a conclusion....”",
  "But the prosecution's burden is great.",
  "But going back to Justice Sotomayor's question, is there anything during the 2 hours and 15 minutes that could suggest a waiver?",
  "I thought Miranda held that you can't question a person unless he waives his right.",
  "You can question him even after he -- it's clear that he hadn't waived his right. Is that -- that's Miranda? Or at least that's unclear? Is that --",
  "No, I'm not talking about the waiver. I'm saying, imagine that it's clear that a person hasn't waived his right. Now let's suppose he says, \"I do not waive my right.\" Okay? Now, is it clear law that once he says \"I do not waive my right,\" the police cannot continue to question him?",
  "Is that clear law, yes or no?",
  "Okay, yes. If that's clear law, would you say that at some point before the 2 hours and 15 minutes expires where they're continuously asking him questions and he says nothing, that it has become clear that he has not waived his right?",
  "For the question is not this. The question is whether, after 2 hours and 15 minutes of silence, it is clear -- it's nothing about Supreme Court law. Supreme Court law is clear: You cannot question him after he makes clear he hasn't waived his right. So then the question becomes, is it reasonable for a State court to say -- after 2 hours and 15 minutes of asking questions and he says nothing, is it reasonable to hold that he has not -- conclude that he has not waived his rights? Is that the question?",
  "What would you do with Miranda's statement \"But a valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused\" -- I grant you, as modified in Butler to say that the State has a heavy burden of showing that the silence followed by a confession -- the State has a heavy burden of showing that that is an affirmative waiver. Now, those I think are the two statements of law, the third being that after, if there is no waiver, the police cannot continue to question. Now, I thought that was the clear law.",
  "I grant you, you might argue for a change in the law.",
  "Why do you say it would change the police's behavior? Inbau and Reid and, you know, the -- the NAC -- the Defense Lawyers’ brief here is filled with quotations from typical police manuals, and they all seem to say things like you have to have at -- once the waiver is given, the police may proceed with interrogation. That seems to be what police today are instructed across the country. It says you cannot question people until he indicates after the warning is given a willingness to answer questions. That's the police manual. So why do you say this would extract a price on law enforcement when the typical police manuals seem to say what the Petitioner here is saying?",
  "I mean the Respondent.",
  "Which -- which are the police manuals that go your way? Because I want to look at those, too.",
  "Well, Miranda does not say that. I mean, I think -- I think that Justice Scalia is right on that, that Miranda doesn't say you can't question him. The pages that you read to us say that if you have a lengthy questioning, then the fact that he then gives a statement cannot be taken as a -- cannot be admitted. That's -- that's what it seems to say on page",
  "-- in the absence of some special circumstance.",
  "Am I right? I mean Miranda does not explicitly say that you cannot continue questioning. Am I right about that?",
  "I'm asking because I don't know. I didn't see it in the --",
  "But I don't think that was the question. The question, at least as I understood it, is that Miranda says you cannot admit a confession into evidence unless he has first waived it.",
  "Then it says, clearly, that even if the police and the prosecution testify he did waive it, even if they say he did, explicitly, still, if there's a long questioning, even then, the court should be very careful about admitting it.",
  "And doesn't it flow from that a fortiori that if he doesn’t admit it and all there is, is the long questioning that, there has been no waiver?",
  "He answered three questions.",
  "All right. One, do you believe in God? Yes. Two, do you pray to God? Yes. for shooting the boy? Yes. Okay. So, where -- where did he waive it?",
  "So, in this case, after 2 hours and 15 minutes when he gave the answers I just said, when did he waive his Miranda rights?",
  "No, I think any then -- then Miranda is --",
  "It says you can't admit the stuff after a long questioning unless he waives. Obviously, he says something or there would be nothing to admit.",
  "You mean to imply that earthquake, fire, flood, mad postman burns mail truck, et cetera?",
  "So, even if it's a terrible earthquake, all these people are just out of luck?",
  "Well, why? Natural disaster, yes, you said no equitable tolling, they’re out of luck?",
  "The statute?",
  "And, so, are you -- you read the statute to say in some cases, you could do it. If you’re going to read it in some cases you can do it, then I guess we’re at a discussion of is this one of those cases?",
  "So that’s earthquake, fire, flood, et cetera?",
  "Well, why should it matter? It's certainly unusual. Isn't that what we are after, one, is he diligent? Answer, yes, he has been diligent. Two, is it extraordinary? I would think it was fairly extraordinary that a person writes these letters to counsel and so forth, then the -- the thing isn't filed. Is that extraordinary or not? Whether it was his fault, whether he himself was kidnapped. I mean, maybe it wasn't the counsel's fault. You can imagine a lot of circumstances. But the question, I would think, is, is it extraordinary and is it fair?",
  "You mean counsel in Florida often when -- miss deadlines and so forth when their counsel -- when their client specifically says to them, even a few weeks before and by mail several times, please file such-and-such, is not extraordinary in Florida?",
  "We have a problem with the bar, don't we, if -- if -- if the -- if --",
  "Why could you not say here -- I mean, the key sentence, I take it, is the Eleventh Circuit and it says: “No allegation of lawyer negligence or failure to meet the standard of care” -- none -- without “proof, bad faith, dishonesty, mental impairment” on the part of the lawyer, could ever qualify. Now, that's -- so we just say, no, no, that isn't so. Sometimes it could, when combined with other circumstances. And then go back and let them -- I don't know what this particular individual Petitioner's prior conduct has been. I understand the problems that you have. But do you -- I guess you’re going to say no to this, but -- but it's a little hard to see why you couldn't have a narrow standard but just not rule out the possibility that under certain circumstances, just at fault; maybe he got kidnapped. You know, I mean, there are odd things that happen in life. And just say go look for this; see if it's truly extraordinary, if it's fair, if he was diligent. What about that?",
  "So would there be -- I mean, what I'm actually worried about is not a lawyer being kidnapped. I'm actually worried what can happen in a person’s life. He gets deathly ill. His wife gets sick. Something happens to the children. Some very unusual thing comes along at the last minute, and all the plans go awry. And to have a little bit of flexibility in this statute to take care of those very unusual human circumstances seems a reasonable reading of it. But you say it's not because --",
  "Okay. How does that work? I think that would be useful for either you or Mr. Clement, if you've thought this through. Is this right different from others?",
  "There are two ways. One is that -- look at -- all you have to do is look at the briefs. Look at the statistics. You know, one side says a million people killed by guns. Chicago says that their -- their gun law has saved hundreds, including -- and they have statistics -- including lots of women in domestic cases. And the other side disputes it. This is a highly statistical matter. Without incorporation, it's decided by State legislatures; with, it's decided by Federal judges. Now, think of this, too: That when you have the First Amendment, or some of the other amendments, there’s always a big area where it's free speech versus a whole lot of things, but not often free speech versus life. When it's free speech versus life, we very often decide in favor of life. Here every case will be on one side guns, on the other side human life. Statistics, balancing life versus guns. How are Federal judges in your opinion, rather than legislatures in the States in a Federal system -- how are Federal judges supposed to carry this out? I want to see where we’re going.",
  "Heller, I didn't think, explained that with great -- I was dissenting, though. I didn't think it explained it with total clarity, but that's a dissenter's view.",
  "Let me be specific, suppose Chicago says, look, by banning handguns not in the hills, not hunting, nothing like that, nothing outside the city -- in the city, we save several hundred human lives every year. And the other side says, we don't think it is several hundred, and, moreover, that doesn't matter. How do you decide the case?",
  "You’re saying they can have -- no matter what, that the City just can't have guns even if they’re saving hundreds of lives -- they can’t ban them.",
  "But there is a difference.",
  "There is a difference here with the other amendments. There is a difference, and the other amendments -- you have the First Amendment’s, the First Amendment expression. Here we have right in the amendment written a militia-related clause. And the way that -- the way -- the way that the right might be incorporated in respect to that is light years different from the way it might be interpreted if you think what it is, is the right to have a gun to shoot a burglar. They’re just two separate things. And as to the first, it's pretty hard for me to see why you’d incorporate it, for reasons I won't go into. As to the second, I understand it. So we’re starting with a difference in purposes at the least. And shouldn't that make a difference in how you incorporate?",
  "Because the -- one of the reasons --",
  "-- at least, is that -- you’ve read, I'm sure, that all the law professors at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, London, et cetera, that say even Blackstone in the 17th century thought that this is primarily a right to raise an army through Parliament to -- well, I can't go on here. I'm just saying think of that brief, and you’ll see the differences, even accepting Heller.",
  "So do we read the -- the clause at the beginning -- the militia clause -- we’re supposed to read the words of the Constitution, aren't we? I guess --",
  "-- the answer to that’s yes.",
  "Thank you. Very well, and doesn't that suggest what the purpose of putting the right there is even under Heller or at least one purpose --",
  "And does that not give us a clue as to what they thought that --",
  "-- the ordered liberty was? That's your point?",
  "But --",
  "Well, suppose it is.",
  "-- Suppose it is. Assume for argument's sake that it is. Still, I take from what you are saying that -- let's make up an imaginary importance of ordered liberty chart, and we give it to James Madison and the other framers. And he would say, insofar as that right to bear arms is important for the purpose of maintaining the militia, it's high on the ordered liberty chart. Insofar as the right to bear arms is there to shoot burglars, it's low on the ordered liberty chart. And if that's what they’d say, it's conceivable that part of this amendment would go through and be incorporated; namely, that part which would prevent a law that would disarm people to the extent they couldn't form militias. But that part which would disarm people to the extent that they couldn't shoot burglars, that would not be incorporated.",
  "Step one -- step one is make my chart. Step two is look at what's high. Step three is, even though that high part, even that high part, nobody could think was incorporated.",
  "He did, actually. He did. That's how he went about it.",
  "I don't understand your Westfall Act argument. I must be missing something. My understanding is, many years ago, Congress passes a statute and says: Give absolute immunity from Bivens actions. Sue the government; don't sue the employee. It says that, basically. A long time ago. Then, sometime after, Congress passes another statute, and in paragraph (a) of that statute, it says: An even larger group of people, just sue the government. And then it says: As to this larger group of people, paragraph (1) of this statute doesn't apply to Bivens actions. So, what does that got to do with this earlier statute? Doesn’t it refer to it. I don’t -- in other words, I understand your Carlson argument. I got that one, but I don't understand this argument if I have the statutes right.",
  "Well, is there an answer to the question? Because that would be important.",
  "That's your Carlson argument. I got that one.",
  "I understand that one. The one I don't understand is what's the relation of the Westfall Act to this argument?",
  "Yes, right. They give the government employees the same kind of immunity that -- a little more limited, and that's in paragraph (1). And then paragraph (2) says: Paragraph (1) doesn't apply to Bivens actions. It doesn't say anything about the earlier statute. It applies to a different group of people. It has all kinds of requirements, nothing involved with 233. Okay. So, what is it to do with this case? Now, what I'm thinking now from your hesitation is it has nothing to do with the case; it's the Carlson thing that is the important thing. Now, you",
  "You’re talking about the Westfall Act. Absolutely right.",
  "I just say, what does the Act have to do with this older Act?",
  "Westfall -- Westfall Act is not -- is not the FTCA, is it?",
  "Oh, it is the -- in other that gives you action against the government.",
  "So it says: This Act is the exclusive remedy -- the FTCA is an exclusive remedy for all employees, but this provision which gives us an exception does not give you the exception, does not make it exclusive for Bivens actions. Okay. You go ahead. You explain it to me. I don't want to keep repeating my skepticism, I want to listen.",
  "I think his point is it doesn't matter whether they did or didn't consider it; the question is the statute was decided by Justice Brennan as an example of a statute where Congress did explicitly say whatever it thought that this particular remedy was a remedy exclusive, an exclusive remedy, and that satisfied the second requirement of Carlson. That was Justice Ginsburg's first question. And -- and there -- that's, I think, the problem for you in this case.",
  "Can't they sue the Federal Government and collect money?",
  "No, I mean, can't your clients -- anybody who has a case like yours -- can't they sue the Federal Government and collect damages for their claim?",
  "Did your clients sue the Federal Government?",
  "Did they collect money?",
  "No. But if they win, will they?",
  "Suppose that the -- the Department of the Army orders clothes for the soldiers at a time when the department is a separate agency of Government X in 1940. In 1950, this department is bought by the Dior clothing company. Now, it's a private entity, and someone would like to sue the department because they didn't pay the bill. It is now a private entity. They are suing them for what happened years ago when they were part of the state. Is it sovereign immunity, this statute that blocks the suit, or some other principle?",
  "The statute would block the suit. There’s precedent with -- you know, famous precedent with King Farouk, which says the opposite. It says: You were king, you are not king now; therefore, there may be a different principle, but we can sue you now.",
  "All right. And you’re saying if a state disappears, it no longer exists, so you couldn't possibly be interfering. You couldn't possibly be interfering in the workings of the state --",
  "-- you still can't sue anybody --",
  "-- who was part of the official operation --",
  "-- even though there is no present interference?",
  "Why? Why?",
  "Because if the state doesn't exist, why is there any stronger reason than in the incident where the entity is no longer part of the state?",
  "Oh, no, you may have act of state doctrine. At that point, the State Department comes in and says: You can't maintain this suit because of the act of state doctrine for the very reason you’ve said.",
  "And that's my question: Do you need the act of state doctrine or does this statute cover it which removes the discretion from the Executive Branch to decide on a case-by-case basis?",
  "Well, what is your --",
  "Right. The question I think, as I understand it, which is certainly why it’s bothering me, is: Don't think of this case. Think of the set of cases where it's clear that the plaintiff is suing an active state. He’s suing France or he’s suing England or -- he’s suing an active state for an official act. And the judge says: I have read the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act; dismissed. Judge, let me amend this. And all he does is he fills in the names of the individuals, because there were some individuals who did the act. Now, does he suddenly fall outside the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act just because he listed the names of the people who did it, and everything else was the same?",
  "Well, then, this Act does nothing whatsoever.",
  "Well, it doesn't protect --",
  "-- the state, because all I did there is I made my complaint the same, relief was the same, everything was the same. I happened to go to the Internet to find out who were the human beings working for the state who did the thing I'm complaining did. And all I did was fill their names in, in the complaint. And I cannot imagine any complaint that isn't open to that, because a -- a state can only act through an individual.",
  "So wait --",
  "-- you’re saying this Act is only good as against a bad lawyer? Because any good lawyer would simply fill in the right names.",
  "There is never a case where this Act would give immunity if the plaintiff has a good lawyer. Is that what you’re saying?",
  "Oh. Oh, that's a different answer --",
  "Fine. If you’re going to give that answer --",
  "-- which I thought was what you would give --",
  "-- then I have added my question: Sometimes the individual, in the first set of cases that Justice Ginsburg mentioned, does count as the state. Sometimes the individual does not count as the state. And the trouble I'm having, in this case, is to work out the principle of when that individual would fall within the FSIA -- as you now, via Justice Ginsburg, have conceded, sometimes it does -- and when it doesn't. And I've tried to work with the idea of relief, or maybe the nature of the cause of action, or maybe the time that the suit is brought, such as a time afterwards. I'm not an expert. You’re more of an expert than I. What are the principles that determine when?",
  "Then that -- I mean, I'm sort of there. You may agree with this, that if you have an individual and with what's being charged here is he is, in fact, now acting as Secretary of Defense, and this action is an action he took in his official capacity, that's it. Forget it. This Act covers it. But where you’re claiming it's not and he's not now a member, the reason for the Act disappears, and you go back to the act of state doctrine.",
  "But all you have to do is write a different word in. Now, that's the question that’s --",
  "-- and then Ms. Millett sort of backed off that.",
  "And that -- and if -- what I'm seeing here is two extreme positions. You’re saying: Never, no matter what, can you simply write the name \"Joe Smith\" under the word \"Niger.\" Okay? Can't do it. Even though every act -- no matter what, you write that human name in, and you -- this statute doesn't apply. To me, that means it never applies. All right? The opposite would be that never, under any circumstances, can you sue an individual for a -- for a -- for an official act. That seems the opposite. I should think sometimes you certainly could. Maybe after he has left the government. But I'm looking for the principle, if I'm right, that would divide the two.",
  "You want to stick to your extreme position? Never, just write the thing in --",
  "Well, do you want to stick to that position, that all the plaintiff --",
  "-- has to do is rewrite the name?",
  "That's an excellent reason. Can you give me one single example ever of a complaint that would ever be dismissed under this statute --",
  "-- if -- if my lawyer is clever enough to look up who the individuals were and substitute their names?",
  "Why can't you say that if the person, the individual you are suing, is a member of the foreign state, is engaged in the kind of activity that you’re complaining about, is subject to the orders of the foreign state, and the relief would affect the foreign state, you are suing the foreign state? But where he was a member of the foreign state, and you want money from him, even though what he did in the past was an act of a foreign state, this lawsuit is not affecting him in his capacity -- is not affecting the foreign state. Indeed, there isn't even one. So in the first set, he falls in the FSIA. In the second set, he doesn't. And you happen to have the second set, and, therefore, he may still be immune for what he did in the past, but that would be a different docket.",
  "That -- that's where this is all leading me.",
  "Before you get into that, I have a question that there may be an obvious answer to, but I haven't found it. My understanding is -- it's a standing question. My understanding is that they are asking as relief, and the only relief they ask for, is to raise the taxes of a competitor. Am I right?",
  "Okay. If that's correct, I have found no case that -- I haven't looked that hard, but certainly no case in this Court -- that said there is standing for a firm to challenge the taxes of a competitor where the remedy is: Raise his taxes. If there were standing for such a thing, it would -- I'm surprised that there aren't competitors all over the country doing business out of State bringing diversity cases in Federal court, saying: My competitor's taxes should increase; it's all very complicated, but the Commissioner didn't properly follow State law. Now, I have found no case, certainly not in this Court, which said: Where all you want is to raise the tax of a competitor, you have standing. So perhaps this is well-settled that you can do it, but I thought I would raise that for both of you at the beginning in case there is something you want to say about it, which might save me a little time looking it all up.",
  "I have no doubt, and the standing rule I think is clear, that if we're saying because I am injured, and they have injury, you can't -­ you must give me reduction in my tax. That's what those cases say. I have no problem with that. Absolutely clear. You can do it. But where all you want is to raise somebody else's taxes, that I had thought -- and probably wrongly, but I had thought there is a prudential standing rule that says you cannot bring such a lawsuit. And I don't see why you should be able to. It seems to me it would be a nightmare if you could, which doesn't surprise. So there we are. That's the question. And you will tell me: No, it's all clear; they can do it. And I would like some citation or something and explain why they should be able to do it. But you don't want to, anyway. It's really for them.",
  "Is there anything -- I see in their complaint, they ask for \"such other relief to which plaintiffs are entitled,\" and therefore the judge, despite what they say, might just say: Well what you are entitled to is you are entitled to pay fewer taxes. Is that a plausible thing, in which case it would interfere with the revenue collection of the State.",
  "What is -- what's your -­ you better give me your accurate assessment, not just agree with me, because I would like to know what you -- I want to know both sides.",
  "But I have no idea -- why I am asking the question is I have no idea or little idea of the underlying State law merits. And my suspicion is in about 10 or 15 minutes I will hear that the State law merits are such that it's virtually impossible that they are going to say to us: Pay fewer taxes. Rather they will say to our competitors: Pay more taxes. So now is your chance to reply to that hypothetical argument just in case they make it.",
  "That's all right. It's in the jurisdictional amount.",
  "They might want to -- in all the Court's cases, the challenger wanted -- he said: I don't care; either make them pay or give me my money back.",
  "So that -- that should be your case, I would have thought. But you're not saying it so you can get into Federal court. Now, that's how I read it. And that seems -- that's worrying to me.",
  "The Establishment Clause, I would add, there is a lot of reason for thinking it's special in respect to standing, because there is no other way to challenge the Establishment Clause. And that is a long-festering disagreement within this Court, but I'm not sure you can apply these rules to everything else.",
  "But you see what is worrying me. What's worrying me is, is there are businesses all over the country and there's Federal tax law, too. And suddenly people begin to think: Hey, this is a terrific idea; I am going to go through my competitor's tax returns and I will discover taxes they should have paid but didn't, and all of a sudden we will face a lot of lawsuits challenging other people's taxes. That's what is worrying.",
  "And this is not true of the other cases. What do you think of the other half of their argument? I'll have to think about the standing thing to see if I want to press it or not. But the other half is: Look at your case. Your case would just be like -- just like the other cases, if you just said: Give us a refund, as they did in the other cases. But you haven't said that, because that would run afoul of the Tax Injunction Act. Rather, what you have said is: Raise their taxes. So the point of the State is: Now, wait a minute. Leaving all of the things aside, you asked for other appropriate relief, and it's highly probable in such situations that a Court could -- would say: Give them the exemption. And if it's going to say, give them the exemption, hey, this is now not within Hibbs. So what's your response to that?",
  "Why not?",
  "No, no. There's a lot of things they could say -­",
  "Of course. Of course. Absolutely right. That's what worrying me. That isn't the answer. That's the question. And -- and the -­ it's what Justice Kennedy said in respect to discrimination problems. Usually, either remedy is at issue. You can't control the remedy because you asked for all other appropriate relief. Ergo, it falls afoul of the Tax Injunction Act. What's your response to that?",
  "You didn't ask only for the other relief. You asked for such other relief to which plaintiffs are entitled. And what they say -- now I repeat the argument. Okay.",
  "So then, in your opinion, your next-door law firm, next to you, brings a case and says: Mr. Fitch should pay $1,000 more taxes next year because he deducted $2,000 that was illegal. You see that? You see? Now I'm trying to bring it home. There is something wrong with this picture, and I can't quite put my finger on it.",
  "I mean, your next-door neighbor in your business, which would be a competing law firm.",
  "But they don't actually bring you into the case.",
  "Or why isn't this a Hibbs? You read the -- clearly the other side says to read the footnote, not as destroying the comity principle. You know, this is right on the merits. It still exists, comity. And you say a strong case for withholding the -- the Federal court's jurisdiction on grounds of comity or withhold -- not hearing the case, is the natural remedy -- which is to give you a refund -- is available in State court. Go apply for a refund. No problem. And that --- and the answer, you know, and then you don't get into all the problem of trying to assess somebody else's liability, et cetera. What is wrong with that, precisely?",
  "Why not?",
  "So not give it -- up to the State? You could say give us a refund or raise their taxes, one or the other. What's wrong with that?",
  "If doesn't solve the problem for you if you get a refund?",
  "Why not?",
  "Why?",
  "Well, no, no, you have it, too -- they -- they work it out, so it equally applies to everybody including your clients, so you are all on the same footing. Now what is the problem with that?",
  "Have you found any authority on the following proposition: That a plaintiff, an out-of-State company, brings a suit in Federal court, where the normal relief would be to give him a refund. He says: I don't want a refund; I just want a declaration; I want to you declare this unconstitutional. Have you found any case like that?",
  "Wait. Wait. Forget comity. I'm just asking you -- I want to read the right authority. Can a person, in other words, get around the Tax Injunction Act by pleading his claim and just saying: I don't want an injunction; all I want is a declaration? It seems to me it should have come up in history. So I can have the First Circuit cases to look at. Anything else?",
  "Well, then why don't they win? Because their first thing, they say: Declaration. They just want a declaration. Strike their second claim. All they want is a declaration.",
  "You should -- you should have a very direct answer to this question. Were you finished, because I don't want to interrupt that train of thought?",
  "Can you -- can you -- if you are right, it seems to me you should have a very clear, concise answer to the question that I'm just going to ask you. And this is the question: Imagine that there was no delegation, none. Now we have five members; is that right? One of them dies. So there is a vacancy. Now, can the remaining four exercise the board's power?",
  "Clearly. Okay. So what is the difference between the situation I just described and this situation where the Board simply delegated its power to three people and one of them dies? What's the difference? I can't find any difference in the language. So what is the difference?",
  "Correct.",
  "Except that two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to the first sentence, which says \"The board is authorized to delegate to any group of three all of the powers which it may itself exercise. \" So, what's the difference?",
  "Well, I know that, but I'm asking why does that make a difference?",
  "Except.",
  "Then what is the reason -- I now see. Your answer to my question is that the vacancy clause applies to the full board but not to the group.",
  "Okay. Now, got that answer. And now I see how you could read the statute that way. So, now I would like -- and that would be in your favor.",
  "And -- and, therefore, I would like to know, since you could also read it the other way, why should it be read your way? I mean, I can think of a lot of reasons why not. One is something that Justice Scalia was raising: It may work havoc as to what remains effective, what doesn't, what about the board staff decisions, which are, which aren't. I can see a lot of reasons for not doing it. But what are your best reasons for reading that vacancy clause the way you want me to read it?",
  "So I would have thought, but this is only me -- other people don't necessarily go in for this kind of argument. But in thinking of the -­ the -- the arguments in your favor, the one that sort of resonated a bit with me was that this is a very Republican Congress in 1947 that passed Taft-Hartley, and one of the things they were really aiming at was to move the board from three to five. And this is a way so that that just doesn't happen. But I assume from the briefs filed that there is no supporting legislative history for that, what I've just said, so I better wipe it out of my mind.",
  "To read -- you can read the language the way you want, that -- because of the vacancy clause. You see, there is a sentence there that says \"A vacancy shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise the power.\" That implies in the absence of that clause, five to four, they couldn't. Okay? Now, you say that clause applies to the remaining members, i.e., to the three. And now we don't have three. And since we don't have three, there are -­ and you have to have three. Because they're not -­ there's not -- there are not the remaining members, you see.",
  "As long as there was another member, you could -- you could do it. But without that remaining member, you can't.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Is there any other legal -­ this is what -- one thing, if I were thinking without the language for a moment, and I -- the Taft-Hartley Congress did, I think, want to limit the powers in a number of ways of the board, maybe expand the membership to be sure there would be both parties in larger numbers. If you could limit this to adjudications, you would say, well, then they can't set major policy with just two members. But I don't see a way to do that, particularly since the board has often set rules in adjudication which have broad application. So am I right in thinking that we have to decide either, it is okay for two members to set the most major policies, or we have to say they can't even conduct adjudication, even the simplest adjudication, even the least significant?",
  "No, no. But that is a rule. They set a rule in the adjudication -­",
  "And is it -- is it correct numerically that, in fact, under identical language except the word \"and\" changes to \"except for,\" the -­ from 1935 to 1947, there were two-member panels and they decided about 400 cases, and then they took the same language, and now since 1947, roughly, what are the figures? How many cases? Has it only been this instance where it has been two members or have there been other instances?",
  "Is that when the 400 cases that you are talking about were?",
  "And 1947. And how many cases were decided by two members about, I'm not asking for -- during the times you are talking about before the present two-member boards?",
  "Well, you need the \"except that\" once you have language. You need it because now you have a bigger board and it says there is a three-member quorum.",
  "I thought they -- they simply are taking the earlier phrase, the earlier statutory phrase, and they are changing those words because grammatically you now need it?",
  "Is this the language? It says the -- see if it helps with Justice Scalia's question. The language says \"a rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of” the STB “shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it receives.\"",
  "And so that's what it has to do, is a bill of lading for property it receives. And you are saying \"receives\" means receives from the shipper.",
  "It does not mean receives from another carrier.",
  "Is that right?",
  "Is -- is there a way to -- are you finished?",
  "We don't even get into this problem if -- unless the ship line is a rail carrier?",
  "Well, it says, “A rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to” the STB “shall issue a receipt or a bill of lading.” That's what leads us into the problem.",
  "But mid-carriage -- it only talks about -- they use that word \"received.\" That's why I thought possibly it didn't because it says --",
  "That's a separate argument?",
  "Did the Ninth Circuit pass on that argument?",
  "Did the Ninth Circuit pass on that argument?",
  "It did not.",
  "So that's not right in front of us?",
  "It's quite different.",
  "Then under that view, I guess that -- that any intermodal transport, China, all the goods coming from China, which tend to move under a single bill of lading, as soon as they get to the United States and go on a train for 50 miles, a new bill of lading must issue?",
  "Why?",
  "All right, so you're saying they don't have to issue --",
  "Fine. If they don't have to issue a separate receipt, what we’re talking about is the bill of lading that was issued by the ship.",
  "All right. Now, if that's correct and if the ship -- the only one that has to do that, it says, is a rail carrier, and a rail carrier is a person providing common carrier rail transport. And then that's defined to include intermodal equipment used by or in connection with a railroad. And my understanding -- which I'm asking you for correction if I don’t -- is that the argument here is the ship is providing intermodal equipment used by or in connection with a railroad.",
  "And it's the words \"used by or in connection with\" that I am focusing on, because to apply those words here seems to me to bring every international shipment in the world, no matter how small the American portion by rail and no matter how big the foreign part of this transport -- it brings it all within Carmack. And it means that the bill of ladings issued by people throughout the world are all going to have to apply to meet the terms of the Carmack Amendment, which had the purposes of railroads in the United States, and that's going to be a nightmare.",
  "Now, first, is it true what I said? And, second, if it is true why isn't it way contrary to the purpose and a nightmare?",
  "No, but why don't they have to issue a bill of lading? That's what they say. So every company, the Finnish company, Chinese, every company, every shipowner, even if he’s never been to the United States -- sad for him, but nonetheless -- every one of those is going to have to issue a bill of lading, whatever meeting whatever requirements are there, and we know at least one requirement you think applies.",
  "Your point was --",
  "-- if it creates such difficulty, why were the railroads in favor of it before?",
  "Anything here that says on land? Anything in Carmack that says on land?",
  "In other words, if it's in a ferry boat -- remember, we have a very broad definition of \"rail\" where \"rail\" includes all things that have nothing to do with rail.",
  "And so now we’ve got that broad definition, and I would have thought we traced through what has to be in the receipt, and then we get to the -- that section and where it's exempt, because they got -- want to get rid of it; then you have to put in -- you have to put in a certain kind of waiver, which is very hard to achieve. And that -- that's my understanding of it.",
  "Yes, but they can't get rid of the thing you like.",
  "They can?",
  "How do they do it?",
  "There are two things here I don't understand I'm just trying to get clear. In the first part, 706(a), it talks about -- in the definition of \"rail carrier\" -- 102(6), I guess. It says railroad includes -- railroad transport will include intermodal -- intermodal equipment transport used in connection with a railroad. What is intermodal equipment?",
  "Okay. So now, if we read it literally, to go back to my -- I'm trying to produce the worst example that frightens me the most. There is 3 miles of railroad transport in the United States, but it carries the chassis, or it carries that big box, which has come all over the world, from all over the world. And if we read this with no limitation, this definition makes the ships that carried it from other places railroads, and once that's railroad transportation, we’re into Carmack. And now, if STB exempts it, what happens is the provision comes into play that says you can't exempt an exempt carrier, in effect, from the liability provisions. And it means the ships that had to issue the bill of lading now have to allow the kinds of suits -- now, here is the point I'm not certain about -- I would think against them, not just against a railroad carrier, and perhaps against them for anything that happens, even on the ocean, and not just the railroad carrier for something that happens within the United States.",
  "Now, explain to me: What is it that gets us out of that?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, where does it say that? Because I’d better read that one.",
  "Yes. Yes. Where?",
  "Do you know -- do you know offhand where it says that, just so I -- I’d better --",
  "Good.",
  "That's COGSA. That's not Carmack.",
  "So what gets us out of Carmack?",
  "Then why are we suing -- why are we suing -- why does the ship being sued here?",
  "I see.",
  "Can we go back one more second? Can you just give me the citation in Carmack -- not COGSA, but Carmack -- that would get our intermodal shipment out of the board's jurisdiction? Because what I'm thinking about is the intermodal shipment and the boat sinks near Hawaii. Okay? Now, on your reading of Carmack, not COGSA, what gets that shipment sunk in Hawaii -- or Midway or Guam or someplace -- what gets them out of Carmack?",
  "Which words?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, and it includes transport, just as you defined it, between the United States and another place -- United States and a place in a foreign country.",
  "So that's what this is. This is a shipment between Shanghai and San Francisco or Oakland.",
  "(a)(2).",
  "Oh, sorry. Between a place in -- oh, transportation in the United States.",
  "Between a place in.",
  "Thank you.",
  "How -- how do you get out of the language that says that a rail carrier providing transportation “shall issue a receipt” for property it receives? Now, the boat, oddly enough, is a rail carrier under the definition.",
  "And, therefore, it should have issued -- since you agree it's a receiving character, it should have -- or -- it should have issued a bill of lading, that then, if it's within Carmack, as I've just tried to put it, requires it to have certain things in it that they say aren't there.",
  "Oh, yes, right; and now we see a rail carrier --",
  "You can get the definition there, and it includes somebody who provides intermodal equipment. And you look at transportation, and transportation includes services related to that equipment.",
  "Ah, now all right. Fine.",
  "But --",
  "Now just give me how -- what I would write in the opinion that would in fact -- because what they did here, the ship, is it took a container and put it on the train. Okay? So that's inter-service equipment. What's the language that does it your way?",
  "Then -- then you get to -­ you get to Justice Alito's question, because in fact what we have here is we have piece of paper issued in 1981, and on that piece of paper it says: You, Billy Joe Magwood, are guilty and sentenced to death by electrocution. Then we have another piece of paper which was issued in 1986, and that says: You are ordered and adjudged guilty of the offense of aggravated murder and sentenced to death by electrocution. So the words are identical. And one was issued in '81 and one was issued in '86. So you are saying since '86 -- this piece of paper in '86 is a new judgment, you can start all over. So then the question comes up, well, if you can start all over in respect to anything, why can't you start all over in respect to everything? But you recognize that that would be a mess, because all the things that were never challenged here, like those things related to guilt, they could all come up again, too, even though he has never done it. So what is -- what is -- what is your answer? Clearly you are going to start saying some things if it wasn't at issue you can bring up, and others you can't; and once you are down that track, how do we know whether these are on one side or the other?",
  "It is something new in respect to the sentence.",
  "It is something new in respect to the sentence.",
  "Ah! But it is not new in respect to the words. They are identical.",
  "All that happened -­",
  "-- is the sentence was reimposed. So why not those things? Does your concession on the first part, which I agree is necessary, imply a concession on the second part, that it's not new in respect to what might have been brought up before?",
  "No, I think what you would have to do -- it's a dilemma here.",
  "What you would have to say to follow his approach, is you would say: Judge, here is what you would do. They're filing it from the second judgment. Okay? So it is not second or successive. But wait. If there is a first judgment that says the same thing, then it is, in effect, the first judgment that counts. Now, what happens when there is a change? Well, to note the scope of the change, you would go to the habeas court and you would say, to the extent that that habeas court changed -- reversed -­",
  "-- or left open or told the lower court: Do this over; to that extent, it is a new judgment. And that -- that would get them where they want to go.",
  "Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait right there. I would have read that to say that what he said was: Vacate the sentencing part. Now, you say: Well, vacate the sentencing part; fine. Now we look at the second judgment, and we say: It's a new judgment. Oh, but it isn't.",
  "Insofar as that habeas didn't tinker with it. But they did tinker with it, because they vacated the sentencing part. Now, why doesn't that work? And his argument is, that works much easier for the judges, much easier for everybody, than to try to figure out whether a claim could have or couldn't have been raised, whether a sentence was changed from six years to five years, or who knows what we are going to get into; et cetera.",
  "This argument -- I am making it up, but I mean, he doesn't have to apply these arguments -- but it seems to me that the argument against this is: What you are proposing is too complicated. There are thousands of these in the courts of appeals. All you would like is you would like the court of appeals to look back and say: What part of the original sentence did the district court, habeas, vacate?",
  "Not look into the reasons for it, et cetera. Because once we start going into the reasons for it, the litigation is just going to mushroom.",
  "And -- and, you know, you have this new witness but not that new witness, et cetera. So his argument is one from simplicity. Start with the judgment. Second, keep it the same insofar as the district court didn't vacate it. And deal with it as a new judgment, which it is, insofar as they did.",
  "That's what they raised -­ your view is a simple rule, no matter how many judgments there are.",
  "If this claim could have been raised and would have been fully adjudicated had it been, it's barred.",
  "But if either it couldn't have been raised, or if it could have been raised and wouldn't have been fully adjudicated or was not fully adjudicated, not barred.",
  "And applied to everything. Can we reconcile that with the language? Does it work in terms of the language?",
  "One judgment. One judgment. Never come up on appeal. Yes, it did, the first one. And let's see. There were 15 issues that were raised. They only answered -- you know, they answered one. Now we go back and then five years later he wants to bring up a different one. Fine. You can do it. Not second or successive.",
  "It -- it's there in the case.",
  "It's one judgment. He makes five claims.",
  "The district court doesn't decide, for some reason, I don't know, number 3 or 4. Maybe I -- maybe it's not realistic, what I say. Let me think about it some more.",
  "Full -- see, he filed his petition -- this would get rid of -- I think there are -- I am worried about that there are cases out there that say the opposite. But we get rid of all those cases, if there are any, and you just say that he has not had the full opportunity to have the litigation on a claim that he did raise.",
  "Or if he couldn't have raised it, it doesn't matter if there was one judgment forever. He can raise it again and again, as long as he only does each one once, and they are not second or successive even if they appear in petitions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.",
  "What happens if in the first trial, the lawyer thinks, you know, I have two claims here; one is mediocre and one is great. And I'm not going to win in the court of appeals unless I make the great one; just forget about the mediocre. And he brings it and he wins. Okay? Now he goes back. Now can he make the mediocre one?",
  "So he better put in everything.",
  "And if he puts in everything and they don't reach the other ones, he's okay, because he can raise it again.",
  "Now, that's -- I would like you to follow that up specifically. That is, in my mind the difficult issue in this case is not the jurisdictional issue under principles of international law. It's the question of the scope of the statute. And there the things against you are three. One is Professor Sachs's argument, which I would like to know your answer to. The second is in Judge Friendly's two opinions. The first opinion -- the second one, rather, Bersch, he says if you had a foreign exchange and foreign plaintiffs as -- and there was no foreign plaintiff, the security issued over a foreign exchange, even if that fraud takes place totally in the United States, the statute wouldn't cover it. That's Friendly, which started this. And the third thing is what he says in Leasco. He says: We cannot see any sound reason for not taking your position, at least for the plaintiffs who are Americans. Okay? Now, France, Britain and Australia have filed briefs in this case giving what they consider very sound reasons, which are reasons that Judge Friendly never considered. And those three reasons, as we know, is they point to a number of conflicts, that if you win, how that will interfere with their efforts to regulate their own securities markets, right? That's all one question: Professor Sachs, Friendly in Bersch, and Friendly in Leasco. But that's what I'd like to hear your answer to.",
  "What do you -- do you want to finish?",
  "Then -- I mean, I can see. I will give you all that. That isn't what is bothering me. I think you are right so far as what you have argued. But the part that I think is most difficult is why I -- I shorthand referred to Professor Sachs' article.",
  "Because what Australia is actually saying is what we don't like about -- about the American system, you know, their -- their common criticisms of class actions. We say, first of all, the American rule means even if our companies here are right, that they are going to have to pay their legal fees. We don't like punitive damages. We don't like that we have the opt-out. And these are all our citizens, and we don't want to subject our companies on our exchange to that stuff. Now, fine, they have a reason on their side. Then Professor Sachs says: Read the statute, because they argue -- it was never intended to cover that kind of stuff. Now, that's what I would like you to address specifically.",
  "Give me reasons for it. The strongest one for it, the strongest example against you it seems to me, is Judge Friendly's example. Schmidt, a citizen of Germany, flies to New York and meets Jones in the hotel. And Jones says, I have a bridge I want to sell you. Look out the window. Say, Do you own the Brooklyn Bridge? Yes. And that's a lie. Here's what you do. You invest in buying shares of my company sold on the German exchange. Okay?",
  "Conduct took place in the United States, a terrible fraud. This is contrary to fraud and, says, I think, Judge Friendly and others, it should apply at least where Schmidt is an American citizen and Professor Sachs says no, not even then. What do you do with that case? The fraud took place totally here.",
  "Sign the paper here in New York.",
  "Sign the paper, right here, and give me the money, because I have an urgent appointment.",
  "Yes, but your position and hers is: That's no more a valid claim than this one or any other one we dream up. That's why it's a pure example, and I want to know how you feel about it. And -­",
  "Or any other. Or -- read the next word.",
  "How does it hurt the other countries if what we would say on their reading of this is, Congress has said, \"Look, if some terribly bad conduct happens in the United States; they lie through their teeth; and you, whoever you are in the world, who buys some shares and as a result you are hurt, we will give you a remedy. Come to us\" -- now, how does that hurt Australia?",
  "Or France or England or any of these others?",
  "So it's not as easy to apply this, you think? Now, on your theory, I guess Schmidt is in Germany and we have our Brooklyn Bridge. Okay, now wait. What happens is he calls Schmidt on the telephone, Jones, and he says I own the Brooklyn Bridge. Actual, right, direct? Under your test, correct?",
  "Schmidt is in Germany. He calls him up.",
  "All -- everything -- you have to assume he's going to buy the thing on the exchange in Germany but the fraud is in Brooklyn. He is lying about -- he doesn't really own the Brooklyn Bridge. So he calls Schmidt. I am interested in -- he calls Schmidt. Causation, that's what your last pages of your brief, focus on that. He calls him and he lies to him. Actual. In your theory -­",
  "No.",
  "Go back to my Brooklyn Bridge example. Everything is hatched in your boiler room.",
  "And they communicate the lie by calling Schmidt in Berlin on the telephone, directly.",
  "I'm looking -­",
  "No, I'm focusing on the last pages of your brief. Where you turn this whole thing on the directness of the causation.",
  "I'm accepting that for the moment. What's bothering me, taking off from what the Chief Justice said, is the feasibility of your test. Your test, it seems to me on causation, would say that when you phone Schmidt and lie to him, he can sue. But when you phone your parent company, knowing that they will put it in the prospectus and Schmidt will read it, you can't sue. And then what occurs to me is suppose you phoned a reporter, or suppose you phoned your parent company and you knew they would tell a reporter. I'm focusing on the practicality of your causation test.",
  "Correct.",
  "You think that's the question here? You think the question is whether this really took place in Florida? I didn't think that was the question.",
  "Let's skip -- skip my question because other people may ask.",
  "There are thousands and thousands of mistrials every year and hung juries are not all that unusual. So in this case we have testimony going on for 4 days, 10 hours total. And we have jury deliberation of 4-1/2 hours, and we have really very little -- I think you can argue it both ways that the jury was deadlocked. There are some things for, some against, only a couple. And he doesn't consult with the lawyer, all right. Now, in these thousands and thousands of cases that must be there over the decades, you probably looked through a few or at least talked to your fellow bar members. How many have you found where you would say that a mistrial was declared despite facts that are on your side? In other words, there are going to be millions of cases, not millions but thousands; many of them will support the defense. Maybe many support you. But I haven't seen any here that say they support you. So how many do? And what do you want me to read to see that this is not an extreme case that counts as an abuse of the judge's discretion? How many did you find which will prove to me this is not, this is closer to the norm?",
  "Correct. That's why I am asking the question. What they've said is, is it an abuse of discretion? And they've also said the judge has to be careful. Okay, so we have like an abuse of discretion scale and this is pretty far over on the abuse of discretion side. I think anyone would admit. But what cases will show to me that it's on your side, not quite an abuse of discretion? Or is this the most extreme case in history?",
  "I know you don't believe it. All I want you to do is to give me some evidence, like refer me to some other cases or explain to me how you have come to that conclusion, not on the facts of this case, but looking on the scale.",
  "I don't want you to look at this Court. We don't have a case where we said what was an abuse of discretion. I want you to tell me -- and I've already said this twice, but I am judging from your answer you found no case supporting it. You have found no case in the history of the United States that was more extreme than this -­",
  "-- where they said it wasn't an abuse of discretion. That's what I'm judging from your answer.",
  "There is no note indicating. There are five, there are notes they sent out, and at 9:30 in the morning they said: Judge, we have a concern about our voice levels, disturbing. That's what they said. Then they asked to see the evidence and they said: Explain Count 2. Then they said: Are we allowed to break? And then they said: What if we can't agree? Mistrial, retrial, what? And at 12:27, the same time, they said: What about lunch? Then he brought them out and he says to the juror: All right, do you believe it's hopelessly deadlocked? And the foreperson said: The majority of us don't believe that. And he said: Don't say what you're going to say. And then he doesn't have the lawyer there. Okay, that's fairly extreme. So that's why I ask the question.",
  "Exactly but I'm drawing some conclusions from your silence. You haven't found a case supporting it?",
  "So can -- what -- what is -- looking at -- can you take the converse of the question I asked your colleague on the other side, if you can remember it? I'll -- do you see what I'm -- on the scale. I mean, this is a fairly simple case.",
  "What is wonderful about this case is there is no disagreement about the facts. We could write them in under two pages, just quoting exactly the notes and exactly what the colloquy was and note that the lawyer wasn't there. So there we are. Now, imagine that in front of you. You -­ it's easier for you to look up the cases than it is for him, because you want to find reversals, and all you have to do is you look and you try to see when the State courts, Federal courts have said there was not manifest necessity. So I have some time. I will read some cases. Which ones do you want me to read? And I don't need to read the standard. I have the standard. And I don't have to worry about -- I agree with the quotation of the statute; you have the burden. And the question is we have a record of those two pages, and does it clearly show that he abused his discretion when he said there was manifest necessity? Now, I will read -­ whatever cases you tell me to read, I will read. But I want to find facts and I'm not sure you found some, either.",
  "How could it be that there are no cases? I mean really, thousands and thousands of mistrials?",
  "How can it be that there are no cases? Are reversals very, very rare for manifest necessity?",
  "Oh, that's good. Now, tell me then what did you find? When you say \"remotely as bad,\" then you perhaps found some where contention was rejected, or where contention -- what did you find? What did you find by way of cases where they said on facts as bad as this, or not quite as bad as this, there was no manifest necessity?",
  "And those are the ones -­ so as I'm seeing this case, it isn't that complicated. You know, it's pretty clear what the standard is. The standard is, was the decision of the -- of the State court reasonable in deciding that there was a sound -­ sound -- the words come from nine wheat, that's -­ that's, you know, like 100 years ago or something.",
  "186 years ago when it was something like \"sound, careful, exercise patience\" -- or whatever, \"the sound, careful exercise of discretion.\" They said there was. And the question for us is, was that reasonable? Okay? I guess if the judge had said, \"Hey, we have only been deliberating half an hour and the game starts in five minutes, I've got to get there -- dismissed,\" that would be unreasonable.",
  "Objectively unreasonable. So come as close as you can to that, where they held reasonable, and what case is it?",
  "Well, why do you do have to do that? I mean you read it. It so complicated. Just reading this, I -- I think the language should say this: 10 years, he's got a 10-year sentence. At the end of the first year you write the number 54 on a piece of paper if he has done well. Suppose he comes in on January 1, okay? So January 2, after the first year, you write the word 50 -- the number 54. And you do that each year. And by the time you get to the year 8, what you have done is you have got 432 days. So then you subtract the 430 days from 10 years, and what you get is you are 67 days short of 9 years. So now you look at the last sentence, and what you do is you take 67 days, subtract that from 365, and you've got 298, and you simply prorate for those 298. And you subtract that, too, so he gets another 10 days or so, or 15 days credit, and that's it. And that's following the statute, it seems to me, absolutely literally. And it also seems to me to make sense, because you don't want to give him credit for time he never serves.",
  "No, that isn't what the -­ if you want to know what the sentencing commission did, I think the best evidence of that is you read the introduction to the guidelines. And what the introduction to the guidelines says is that, roughly speaking, many of the sentences approximate the time actually served before. Now, what to me that suggests is that the sentencing commission never considered this question. And if there's something more specific than that, that shows they did, I would like to know what it is, because I don't trust memory.",
  "But there is nothing in there -- that's not a policy statement; that's not a guideline. That's a staff conclusion. And the staff conclusion, I think, is conflicting with what it says in the -- in the introduction to the guidelines, which is that all of this was very approximate. I don't see how -- how -- a court would be bound by that.",
  "Is this right? I'm -- I'm sorry to ask you this question, but I get lost in the math of this sometimes. Do you remember my example I just gave, you know, with the 9 years you go and put it on a piece of paper?",
  "I take it what you want is you, in -- in essence, want him to get credit for 54 days for that tenth year?",
  "Yes. And the argument against that, reading the language and so forth, is, well, look this is an imaginary 10th year. He is not actually in prison for 10 years. He is going to be released sometime late in year 8. And so why should we add 54 days? I mean maybe it would be a nice thing because sentences are awfully long, but -- but why would anybody want to add 54 days in respect to a year that's never going to be served?",
  "Another way to think, and I think probably you'll -- if you look through the records of the commission, they even thought about this problem, and the -- the -- you will see a lot of talks given by various people who were there, which say that for this reason you are bringing up, that it might have been thought there was no credit for the first year. In other words, you don't cut the sentence in the first year. You don't begin cut until the second year has been served, so he has to serve 365 days. Now when you point that out, that is not the Bureau of Prisons's interpretation, that's nobody's interpretation. They're all going to let him out if it's a year and a day. They are going to let him out several weeks before the end of the first year, aren't they?",
  "Everybody's going to do that. Oh -- there was a technical amendment.",
  "That's what happened. In other words, the statute made before -­",
  "Ah, I better get that -­",
  "But the trouble with that, and I'm glad to know about that technical amendment, because then -­",
  "-- we never considered it when I was on the -- nobody thought about it at that time because the language was different. But now that you had have got this language now, it's hard to reconcile with that first year. He is sentenced for a year and a day, you see. So literally, it says calculated on January 2 of the next year. But he's already been in for longer than he should be by that point. So you really have to calculate it before the year ends; you have to calculate it at least by October. And -- and -- and once you start calculating it before, the statute literally says, we are into a more complicated thing than I thought.",
  "That's true. But the strongest argument -- I -- I don't want to put words in his mouth because this is complicated. But I see it as this. Let's call that time you are talking about, that tenth year, phantom time.",
  "Now, you are saying don't put in any phantom time. And he's saying let's put some in. Now, the strong -- a strong argument, I think, for his is the following -- think about that first year. That first year we are going to calculate 54 days, subtract it, everybody seems to agree we get to the number 311, right? But if you were to apply the last sentence to that first year, the prorating sentence, you wouldn't get 54. You would get like 45 days, or 47 or something like that. But everybody agrees under the Bureau of Prisons system that it is 54. And, therefore, in respect to the first year, they are calculating phantom time, i.e., not the first year, but a person who had a sentence to a year and a day. If you had a sentence to a year and a day, you agree it's 54 days, and everybody agrees with that, and that includes phantom time. So he said, well, if you include it for the first year, since the statute says nothing about the first year, why not include it for the other years, too? How can you possibly justify phantom time being included in the first year but not in the other years?",
  "So, in other words, they don't let him out under 311?",
  "In other words, the Bureau of Prisons for a person whose has a sentence of a year and a day does not let him out 54 days short, rather they let him out 47 days short, because they apply the last sentence in the prorating of that sentence?",
  "Is that -- is that what happens?",
  "So what's -- what's the -- the words in the statute is that it may reduce the term. You can’t change the term -- you cannot change a sentence, except that you can reduce the term if such reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements.",
  "Do you see anything -- what's -- what's unconstitutional about that? Then they issue a policy statement, and the policy statement says you can't reduce it except insofar as our new -- whatever the new thing is -- applies. If you’re arguing that that violates the Constitution, what I’m missing is why? What violates the Constitution in that?",
  "I don't remember --",
  "I thought in Booker -- and I have to go back and look at it, but I thought in Booker the Court held that certain specific -- like certain specific words in certain specific provisions of the -- the sentencing statutes were unconstitutional because of Apprendi and because of the other part, Booker itself. Well, 3582 wasn't one of them. So -- so there must be something unconstitutional if you’re right. I don't see how you get around this statute.",
  "All right. If it's not unconstitutional, then why don't you have to follow it? Because what it says is, you cannot get a reduction except in respect to what the policy guideline says. And the policy guideline says you don't get a reduction, except insofar as we’ve reduced a sentence in a particular respect. What's unconstitutional about that? I'm -- I'm not saying there isn't. I want to know what your argument is that it is unconstitutional.",
  "Well, that's what it says. I don't know how you’d interpret it some other way --",
  "-- if that's what it says.",
  "No, it just says what we're doing is we’re reopening the sentencing in respect to the particular way we reduce people's sentence, not in respect to something else. That's what I read the policy statement to say. That if there were 19 things that were considered in the sentence and one of those 19 is changed in a downward direction, then it says we make an exception, says the policy statement. You can reopen number 19, but not the first 18. Now, why is that unconstitutional? What in the Constitution prohibits doing that?",
  "You agree. Now -- now, what -- that's what I -- I could understand that if 3582 said to the judge you resentence him. But it doesn't say that. So there’s a sentence in effect, and what 3582 says is a -- a sentence can be reduced just as if, to go back to the beginning, Congress passed a statute or the Commission said everybody's sentence will be reduced. That doesn't change what the sentence was. It says there’s a reduction, like for good -- good time. So it says a defendant, if he has been sentenced based on factor 19 in the case, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, the term of imprisonment there under the sentence. So I'm back to my question. What’s unconstitutional about that?",
  "And what the court just says is the court -- the Commission says: That's right. You may reduce it in respect to what we’ve considered; you may not reduce it in respect to something which is not considered. So I'm still puzzled about the constitutional problem.",
  "No, no, you don't have to apologize.",
  "I understand your argument now. And I didn't quite and now I do. So there’s nothing to apologize for.",
  "You wanted to get the idea in my mind. I'm not expressing that in my question, but I got your answer.",
  "Well, that’s what it says. It’s -- the other thing that has bothered me, to tell you the truth, is -- is the part of the point that was brought up previously, that it is up to the Commission whether to make it retroactive. It is.",
  "I don't know why they couldn't take into account that to make any drug-related change, you see, and then make that retroactive, is going to reopen the sentencing for every single person who has already been convicted of a drug crime in the Federal courts, of which there are probably tens of thousands. And -- and I think they would properly take that into account. And, therefore, they might properly say, we're not going to make this retroactive.",
  "Can -- can I ask you a different question on the secondary argument that they make? When I read the secondary argument, that there was an error in the calculation of the guidelines and she would like to have that error corrected, I didn't see anything in the policy statement that would prevent her from getting that correction.",
  "But why?",
  "What in the policy statement? Because what it says is: What you're supposed to do is: Judge, you go and look at the guidelines that were applied. Now, substitute the new one reducing the sentence for the old one, and then go apply it. And, therefore, that seems to me not to block a claim that would say, when you apply these guidelines with the new one substituted for the old one, apply them; that is, if, in fact, there was an error the first time. Now, she may have a hard time showing that, but if she can show it, what in the words that are right there in (b)(1) stops her from getting that correction?",
  "I have it in front of me.",
  "That’s right.",
  "That’s right.",
  "Well, all other guideline application decisions, and the claim is that they just made an error, like a clerical error, a clear error, manifest injustice, in that first math. Do you think that this would leave them unaffected?",
  "Yes. I see.",
  "No, no. I would have thought the objection to that is: No, they didn't make a mistake in applying Booker, because this Court has said that Booker isn't retroactive.",
  "And, of course, they did make a mistake if it is retroactive. And then the Court should have said it is retroactive, in which case there would be no problem.",
  "I know my word was: It shall leave all other guideline application decisions. Well, that's -- that's -- their claim is not that the guideline -- it's that they -- they chose the wrong guideline or they didn't apply the right words. You see, so they weren't applying that -- they just applied the wrong thing. Now you say I'm working too hard. Okay.",
  "Yes, but they do if Congress says they do.",
  "So in other words, if, in fact -- you agree or don't agree, I don't know -- but the government says and they say, the government of the United States has here -- and it can, under the Constitution, delegate to a private person the authority to prosecute.",
  "There is a big argument against that.",
  "The argument is: This would be the one person you can't delegate it to because they are very biased.",
  "And that argument, you say, is not in this case.",
  "Okay. So now we have what is in the case, which is the question of whether, leaving that argument out of it, did they hear or -­",
  "It's highly relevant, I think, because I think you would you like to make the argument, which I would like to hear, is that: Forget the United States. The Constitution permits this woman to bring the case as a private citizen.",
  "Now, if you are right about that, the plea agreement drops out.",
  "Because nobody says made a plea agreement with her. Because that is the argument you want to make at some point.",
  "What do we do about that? Because it's very hard for me to focus on the case -­ the issue you want me to decide -­",
  "-- without thinking about the one you don't.",
  "And the reasons, as I have categorized this -- the -­",
  "So what do --- so what do we do? I mean, I think of this as like Aeschylus; you have the Furies gradually giving way to justice.",
  "I mean, private -­",
  "-- vengeance is out and justice is in, and we have 3,000 years of that, and they are all going to be variations of that theme and we could think of 100 arguments. Boasting. Then is this special?",
  "Well, before I can answer that question, I would like to know whether the government could appoint the private person. After all there is a check -- there is a check against the total Furies, it's the government doing it. Now you say no, the government can't do it, so -- but they can do it on their own. Maybe -- I don't know.",
  "How do I get my -- how do I begin to answer these questions bound together in my mind in some partial way?",
  "But you want to do that. You see, so there is no control. You are saying we want the private individuals to have the authority to bring criminal contempt; they are on their own; they decide it. The government has nothing to say about this. It's a totally private matter.",
  "All right. Now the State of California, trying to save money, say we have a very good idea. We are going to pass one law, abolish all the prosecutors' offices and say wherever there is a victim of crime, that victim will bring the prosecution. Now you really are back to the Furies. Is that constitutional?",
  "Yes, there was, before -­ before Aeschylus. Or whatever. But the -­",
  "You would say that that is constitutional -­",
  "-- to have a statute that all criminal prosecutions would be brought by victims, period?",
  "All right. If there are, then why aren't there the same here?",
  "You might -- you might -­ you might say this. To answer your question that is here, there are a couple of ways of doing this. One way you would say is, well, don't worry about this so much. If the answer is no, you can still bring your private prosecution but you have got to get government permission, because you are doing it in the way of the government. But if the answer to the question is if you can't do either, they you might say, then why wouldn't you say why well, aren't we back to the Eumenides, and the answer is going to be this is say contempt. Contempt is special. I don't know whether either or both of those ways would work. So what would you think, since the government has changed its position, of sending this back so some of these things can be worked out? At least we would have some opinions that would help us.",
  "Oh, well, that's a different matter.",
  "That's -- that's -- why isn't it a different matter?",
  "Okay, so now you are into the question of what counts as a prosecution.",
  "And there again, I am at sea. I don't know what the authority is.",
  "I accept that -­",
  "Is there somewhere I can look to see what happens? All I can find in the long law is that a violation of the order is a contempt. Fine; no problem. And then the only word about the Petitioner, it says the Petitioner is entitled to relief under this chapter, which contains about 50 different things. And it doesn't say what kind of relief. It doesn't say how you get relief. It doesn't say if you are just asking -- all those things you raised. So how do I find out actually what is in the system.",
  "It doesn't say that. It says the earlier part of this statute which goes on for six pages in an earlier part of this statue, which goes on for six pages, seven pages. It says, a Petitioner has a right to seek relief under this subchapter. Now, that contains civil contempt. It contains how you get protective orders. It contains a lot of things that are absolutely noncontroversial. So I am trying to figure out: What is the system?",
  "Is your argument the broad argument that the Chief Justice was talking about, that we have a man who drives in a car from Baltimore to rob a bank in Washington and the U.S. Attorney in Washington gives him a piece of paper which says, I will not prosecute you for this now or in the future, and suddenly the U.S. Attorney in Baltimore prosecutes it. Are you saying that that is barred or not barred? That's the broad argument.",
  "Or are you making a narrow argument?",
  "Well, I'm just asking you your position on that. Can the -- does this piece of paper from the U.S. Attorney in Washington bar prosecution by the U.S. attorney in Baltimore? Yes or no?",
  "It does bar?",
  "I don't know. It seems to me you go further than you need to and, moreover, imagine a State offense that just says possession of marijuana, zero to 5 years. Now, our problem is, reading those words, is that or is that not analogous to a Federal -- a Federal -- what a Federal law would make a felony? And suppose you discovered as a matter of fact that all the people who did have a prior conviction got more than a year. In simple possession, they got less than a year, which you’d have to do research to find out.",
  "Well, if those were the facts, I would say it is analogous to the Federal felony where this person was sentenced to more than a year.",
  "Well, we could argue that one --",
  "-- but I don't see where -- that there’s a line, because it seems to me the rule is set forth -- we said in the last sentence here of -- what's the case? You know --",
  "What?",
  "Yes, Lopez. It says: \"A state offense constitutes a ‘felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act’ only if it proscribes conduct.\" So we’re not looking at what happened in reality. We’re reading some words from a State statute.",
  "That's what proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that Federal law. This would be normal. We get some words in the State statute, and you have to decide are the -- those words cover some events in the world. And you look at those words, what -- the events they cover and discover, did they or are they analogous or not analogous to what is a felony under Federal law? Sometimes that's easy, sometimes it's not. You have a case, I think, that's easy. But I can imagine the case you’re talking about, not easy.",
  "So you say, what do you do? I see no rule there. I see no rule absolute how you treat it, so I probably would treat it by trying to look at what really happens under this statute in the world.",
  "Why -- where does it say \"offense element\"?",
  "Where does it say that?",
  "Why?",
  "Well, where in the statute --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, you say that it says \"elements.\" I don't see any of our cases that say \"elements.\" And I -- and I think that -- that what we could do is look to the conduct that's likely to be at issue under these State words, and if in fact it's regular that the State does punish people for more than a year when in fact they do possess for the third time, at least there would be a good argument --",
  "-- that that counts. You want to argue it doesn't count, okay. I don't know why you do.",
  "But, I mean, I'm interested in why you do, since that isn't your case.",
  "I know, but the reason I ask my question is it seems to me your approach, which I think is consistent with Lopez and Nijhawan absolutely --",
  "-- does raise the question you are talking about. So I want to know: Why are you talking about it? Because I might be missing something, because I don't think -- if I'm right, your case doesn't",
  "Okay. Well, skip the question.",
  "The exact words of Lopez, which I think are important: \"We hold that a State offense constitutes a felony punishable under Controlled Substance … only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony.\" Okay?",
  "Under Federal law. Now, there’s an ambiguity when you use a word like \"offense\" or \"crime.\" Sometimes you mean what this guy did, and sometimes you're referring to a statute. It's statutes that proscribe, not what this guy did. So we’re talking about the statute. So what it tells us to do -- and we said the same thing in Nijhawan, and I have written in other opinions the same thing -- you go read the State statute. Forget what he's done. Read the statute and see if the statute proscribes conduct that would amount to a felony under Federal law. So let us read the statute. We turn to the statute of conviction. What it says is it is a class A misdemeanor for which you are punishable of less than a year if you possess less than 28 grams or whatever. It says nothing about recidivism. There is no increased punishment for recidivism. So all we did was read the statute. The statute does not proscribe conduct that would be a felony under Federal law; it proscribes conduct that would be a misdemeanor. QED. This person has not been punished in Texas under a statute that proscribes conduct that would be a felony under Federal law. End of case. Now, what is the matter with what I just said?",
  "What do you mean, “a two-step inquiry”?",
  "Okay. Okay.",
  "No --",
  "Where does it say that? Where does it say that in the language? You are looking to the conduct that the statute proscribes, not what he engaged in. Suppose the State statute says it is a misdemeanor to steal a chicken, okay?",
  "It is a misdemeanor. He is convicted of stealing a chicken. It turns out that the way he stole the chicken was to burn down the farmhouse.",
  "That is a felony. Now, what we have written is: Forget the second. I’ve written it in five opinions or four or three, most of which had a majority.",
  "It is called -- it is written right here in this case. It is written in Nijhawan. What is it that tells us to go beyond the conduct that the State statute proscribes, not some other thing?",
  "Where is the additional question? Read me the words of the statute that -- there might be. I'm not -- I'm being argumentative, but I want to know what words in the statute say there -- or what words in a case say go look to some other thing beyond what the State statute proscribes?",
  "Yes. What offense? The offense proscribed --",
  "-- by State law. That's why I asked you: Where does the State statute proscribe something that has to do with recidivism? I’ve read that State statute three or four times.",
  "You go ahead.",
  "Can I ask you a related question, which will show what I'm trying -- another thing that’s worrying me. Suppose we’re in the Armed Career Criminal Act. Now, I have -- this is my hypothetical. You’ve heard of cat burglars. Well, this gentleman is called the pussycat burglar, and the reason is he’s never harmed a soul. He only carries soft pillows as weapons. If he sees a child, he gives them ice cream.",
  "It is absolutely established that this person in breaking into that house at night only wanted to steal a pop gun, and he is the least likely to cause harm in the world. Question: He is convicted of burglary. Is that a crime of violence? Answer?",
  "Correct.",
  "The answer is of course, because we are not looking to whether he is the pussycat burglar or the cat burglar. We are to look to the statute of conviction and see what it is that that behavior forbids -- the statute forbids. Lewis, Nijhawan say -- do precisely the same thing with this part of that long list. Indeed, Nijhawan lists this provision as an example of what you would do the same thing for. Now I'm back to my first question. Let's do it. Read the Texas statute. And where in that Texas statute does it say a word about recidivism or punish that conduct? Now, if I adopt your position, am I not, not simply overturning Lewis and Nijhawan, but getting a very mixed up area of the law which we have tried to straighten out -- Taylor, ACCA -- once again totally mixed up. That's my concern.",
  "That's what was worrying me, that's why I asked the other question. But the -- what was worrying me would be a statute where they -- it's big enough in the State to cover possession with recidivism or not, and they deal with it at the punishment stage, and I can see your point in respect to that. But that isn't this statute. This statute not only doesn't deal with it at the punishment stage; it's forbidden to take it into account because what this says is you can only get recidivism if you previously had a conviction for a class A misdemeanor, and the prior conviction here was a class B; and, therefore, one thing we know about the statute is that under this statute, his behavior as a recidivist is as close to irrelevant as you could make it. That's why I’m back to the cat burglar.",
  "It did? Well, Nijhawan uses this provision as an example of where it didn't.",
  "Well, that’s -- that --",
  "Because she got to that argument at the end, and she said my -- I wrote that, I think, and I -- when I used as an example or the text uses an example, this provision is one where you don't look to real conduct. She said that was a mistake, really. It was overstated, because what they’re saying is that recidivism analogous to the $10,000 was meant to be a real conduct aspect, not just offense of conviction, and -- and she gave similar reasons. That's why -- similar reasons are that the States are too mixed up in this; it will be too difficult to look at that element itself. So she’s trying to analogize that to the Now, why isn't that a good analogy?",
  "But what’s wrong with his deciding: I don't like to do this anymore? I don't want to collect all this money; it's too complicated; and so I don't know how many of these messages are related to work and how many they are just mucking around prying into each other's business.",
  "So I would like to know, so therefore I'm going to look and see. Now, what’s unreasonable about that?",
  "Oh, no.",
  "I'm saying what's -- the city owns the pager. It's a pager used for work. They are giving a privilege to people if they want to use it off work. It seems to be involving a big amount of collection, and so what he wants to do is he wants to see how much of this is being used for work and how much is of this not being used for work. My question, which I just repeated, is why is that an unreasonable thing?",
  "Fine. And then if that’s not unreasonable, why is what went on here that is any different?",
  "How does that differ from what I just said?",
  "No, I understand. I thought it's just a more -- a few more words to say just what I said. That they wanted to look into this because they are tired about collecting so much money. It's the third time I've said the same thing; probably it's my fault I’m not being clear. But it looked as if they wanted to know how many are being sent for work purposes, how many for private purposes including prying into people's business, which wasn't too desirable, and -- and -- so that they could get the -- the charges right. Now, that sounds like what the jury said they were doing, too. And my question was -- I don't see anything, quite honestly, unreasonable about that, where you’re the employer, where it's a SWAT team, where -- where -- where you’re paying for this in the first place. So the reason I ask it is I would like you clearly to explain what's unreasonable about it.",
  "That's the conclusion. Now, what's your reason?",
  "Well, explain that one to me.",
  "Being naive about this, if I had a -- like, 20, 30,000 characters in 1,800 messages and I wanted to know which are personal and which are work-related, a good way to get at least a good first cut would be to read them.",
  "Okay? So I start off thinking that seems to be reasonable to me. That's what I would do.",
  "So all right. Now you tell me why that isn't reasonable.",
  "All right. But the officers might say: I don't want you to read these messages because they happen to be about the sexual activity of some of my coworkers and their wives and me, which happened to be the case here.",
  "So I guess if you had asked for consent, the officer would have said no.",
  "Now, he says, I still want to know. I will be repeating it. All right. So what -- that didn't sound very practical. What's the other way?",
  "Well, the officer is going to say, hey, these are all big -- work-related. I’ll tell you that. I only had two.",
  "Okay. What's a third way?",
  "That would have been rough on them. Because you want to let them have a few; you need pizza when you’re out on duty. You want to -- there are --",
  "Look, so far I listened to four things, and I'm just being naive about it. I’ll read it more closely, but I don't see why these four things are so obviously more reasonable than what they did.",
  "But the question, in the Constitution, the word is \"unreasonable.\" Is it a reasonable or unreasonable? So the question -- what I asked is not maybe you would have gotten a better result if you had hired Bain Associates and Bain would have done a 4-month study at a cost of $50,000. But I could say a person who doesn't want to hire Bain and who doesn't want to rely on the unverified word of the officers who were using these for God knows what is not being unreasonable. That's the ultimate issue. And that's why I’m putting it to you to show me that what they did was unreasonable.",
  "Doesn’t this say the opposite? It says we are -- you have to let anybody in -- anybody -- regardless of their status or beliefs. So you can't discriminate on the basis of status or belief. That's what the policy says I just read. It doesn't say you can; it says you can't.",
  "That's what you say, but that's not what the policy says. The policy says that you have to let everybody in, regardless of their status or belief.",
  "So you cannot discriminate on the basis of status or belief. perfectly constitutional and --",
  "-- you have to -- you have to let these organizations discriminate on the basis of belief. And they say: No, we don't want to; that's too complicated for us to figure out which ones we should, which ones we shouldn't. We'd rather let them work off-campus. We just don't want to get into this business. It's not just against religion. It might be against a Turkish-speaking society that thinks Turkish is extremely important to speak or a chess club that thinks the same. It could be a lot of people. Now, why do you -- what's wrong with us, a First Amendment -- an organization itself affected with First Amendment interests, saying we just don't want to have those on campus organizations, too much trouble.",
  "That's their way of doing that.",
  "Let me make an imaginary example, and that’s --",
  "If -- if a homosexual person said, I want to belong to this club, and I believe in its principles, I don't believe in sexual relationships before marriage, and that's why I want to work for homosexual marriage, which I do, so my consistency there, is that person -- I am consistent in what I work for, what I believe, and on -- as far as premarital sex is concerned, it's totally 100 percent with your organization that you are representing; would they admit that person or not?",
  "He shares the belief that there should be no premarital sex --",
  "-- and he says that's why I am working for Proposition 8 or whatever the proposition, or against it --",
  "I'm working to legalize homosexual marriage in which --",
  "So they would not -- the answer is no, that person --",
  "No, he's not --",
  "-- because his sexual conduct --",
  "-- he will refrain until marriage is made lawful --",
  "-- at which point he intends to engage in sexual conduct.",
  "That person.",
  "What we have is a rule, a stipulation. And as I read it, to try to make sense out of it, it does seem to discriminate against organizations in respect to which intellectual purity would be important. They’re going to have a harder time. The ones that don't care that much will have an easier time. Now, in trying to judge the constitutionality of that, I first have no idea which these organizations are. We've got one of them, but there may be a lot of others. I don't know if the Democratic Club is or is not. I don't know how big the tent they want. I don't know whether the Turkish Society even exists. I don't know how the chess club feels about players of tiddlywinks.",
  "So I have an absolute void in this record, which in turn I think would be important to fill that void, because their justification --",
  "-- is they don't want to get into this, it's too complicated, and we’re not doing that much harm to them because they can meet off-campus, and it's a big, disruptive influence, all of these things. And then sneaking in here is this anti-gay bias issue, and -- and they want to say: That isn't much, because that isn't really the point here, and that's what we think, anyway. It's just an example of something. So with that great unclarity, asked to decide a constitutional issue where I feel I’d need more facts and I don't have them --",
  "-- the more justification to know what it really is, which I don't have, what should I do?",
  "What’s supposed to happen? I don't know the answer to this. Hastings, let's say, or Berkeley has four or five or six different religious chapels for services on Sunday or Saturday, and they say we’re open to all branches of religion, orthodox Jews, conservative, and reformed. And then the orthodox say we want men and women to sit separately. Now, can Hastings say or Berkeley, no, we’ll let the reform come, we’ll let the conservatives come, but not the -- not the orthodox Jews. They can't have their service. Would -- would that be constitutional?",
  "Yes, but what is your opinion?",
  "So if, in fact, the -- the --",
  "-- they have clubs and they’re not services, and what they do is they discuss -- they discuss the -- the nature of the service, and there can they have separate discussions --",
  "-- men from -- men and women?",
  "I guess your answer to that is the orthodox Jews cannot. They cannot have separate women's groups in their organization, which is an after religious school organization.",
  "Outside of the university, et cetera.",
  "Well, that's their problem here.",
  "And their reason to put in a sentence as to why they don't want these orthodox Jews to meet separately on the campus -- men in one group, women in another -- and discuss the religious service -- they want none like that, and their reason for wanting none like that is?",
  "Well, I'm trying to make it as close as possible.",
  "They have a small orthodox club.",
  "It's not totally, if -- but it's imaginary, it's fantastical. The -- you could imagine a school in the '60s that said that we think the way to advance learning is everyone gets together in a nice discussion group and hugs each other and talks, all right?",
  "Now, that's a possible educational theory.",
  "They say that we are going to apply that to everybody because that's how we do it. And --",
  "-- if there are any ideological organizations that suffer --",
  "-- so be it, but it's fantastical, and therefore --",
  "Well, my --",
  "-- my question is, if I can think of this policy -- but I tend to sympathize with your view that it's so hard to believe that they really hold it, maybe they do, I don't know about it -- what do I do with this case? How can I say whether this, let's call it \"hug your neighbor policy\" is -- to put a label on it that's catchy --",
  "-- how do I -- how do I evaluate that?",
  "But Congress says -- to paraphrase and not get it accurate -- that the Department of Transportation shall enact a rule governing tire safety within 9 months from the effective date of this legislation. And the Department of Transportation fails to do that. It doesn't promulgate its law for 18 months. Is that law invalid? The rule?",
  "Of course, it isn't.",
  "So how is this different?",
  "I understand that point. I'm just asking what’s a relevant difference?",
  "Because?",
  "Why couldn't he?",
  "You just read us the provision.",
  "The judge enters a -- an order, a final order. And that final judgment, as was true here, says: I haven't decided restitution yet. He can appeal. Then what it says is when you get around to the restitution, then enter another judgment, and you’ll appeal that, as happens precisely in the case of the 60 days -- you know, that extra stuff that Justice Scalia was referring to. That's a possible interpretation of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. I don't see, you know, the appeals thing. I don't see anything -- I don't have in front of me the language on filing an appeal, but I can't think of anything that’s contrary.",
  "That's right.",
  "It's a final judgment, and because there is another provision that says an order of restitution is itself a final judgment.",
  "You read it to us. I mean the one you read to us.",
  "What?",
  "Yes, the same problem.",
  "I see.",
  "Where does it say that?",
  "Well, this is a court-made rule of what counts as a final judgment.",
  "All right. Is there anything in the decisions of this Court interpreting that rule? I mean, you could have collateral orders. You could have all kinds of things. And doesn't it boil down to the same question? I mean, I agree with you that if Congress wanted to make a 90-day deadline, you really have to do it, and you can't restitute thereafter. All right. That's one thing. But if they didn't, why didn't they equally intend the judgment without the restitution order to be a final judgment?",
  "And then later on, just as in (o), if the judge does impose an order of restitution, then of course, that's appealable, and that's a different judgment. Is there -- what in the law prevents the -- that interpretation?",
  "Yes.",
  "So you have precedent.",
  "All right. Well, what about that as a possible answer? If we accept -- the -- the judge, of course, could say to the defendant: I'm not going to sentence you; I'm not going to put that sentence -- I'm not going to sentence you at all --",
  "-- for 100 days.",
  "And your remedy, then, might be to ask for mandamus, if that was too long a period?",
  "And -- and -- so why wouldn't that be similar here? If the judge is going to go after the 90 days, he’d have the power to do it, but it would be like a continuance, and he’d have to exercise that reasonably.",
  "No, no. I know. You’re interpreting it literally, and --",
  "-- and that's --",
  "But I mean, if I thought, for argument's sake --",
  "-- that Congress doesn't care about whether it's after 90 days -- it was just to sort of speed things up -- on that assumption, wouldn't you unreasonable continuance?",
  "That is correct? I've got it?",
  "No, no. I'm thinking of --",
  "I'm thinking of the general problems --",
  "-- of continuances for sentencing.",
  "And your argument is that 90 days is long enough?",
  "Okay. I’ve got it.",
  "Okay, now suppose -- now we’re getting to exactly the point where I thought your co-counsel, your sister counsel had a good point that I wasn't -- hadn't thought through, and that is what happens now in -- on day -- we’re finished the trial. The sentencing is over. They got the presentence report, and the judge enters -- suppose he entered a judgment but didn't say anything about restitution, because he says: I’d like to give you a chance to appeal this. And I'm not going to deal with restitution for a month when the victim recovers -- all within the 90 days. Can the defendant appeal that piece of paper?",
  "The answer is because of this provision?",
  "Whoa, whoa. What about what the -- what -- what you just heard quoted, forgetting this particular sentence in the code, was that a judgment isn't final -- you can only appeal a final judgment until all the parts that are there, and the restitution is part of it. And so until it's final, you can't appeal it. That's what -- that's what the case Parr, which it quoted. What is -- what is your response to that?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, I suppose it's no -- no imprisonment; it's supervised release. Now what happens?",
  "Yes, but I mean, what's bothering me about this, and I'm not aware -- but you’re quoting a sentence that wasn't in your brief and what I hadn't taken in at all is the extent to which this is inextricably mixed up with the rules of appeals, which are very important. So unless I have in my own mind how -- how this all fits together, I -- I don't know how to decide going to muck up the -- the rules of appealing from a criminal case. Now, what you’ve told me is I'm supposed to say that within 14 days of a -- of a judgment imposing imprisonment, he has to appeal, but of course if it's supervised release, he doesn't, or I'm not sure.",
  "Why not?",
  "Yes, but if -- but I have to be able to write my reasons, and in doing that I have to respond to the argument of the other side, which is that the strongest reason for thinking Congress intended this to be final and not beyond 90 days is that if you don't do that, you muck up the rules of appeal. Now, explain to me why that isn't so.",
  "Which is just what you say he has to do if the sentence is supervised release.",
  "Why don't we go back to my hypothetical --",
  "-- and just substitute the word \"fine\" for \"supervised release.\"",
  "I'm not -- I'm not an expert in this area, as you can see. And -- and I need to have a place to go to look so that I can see that these things, in your view, all work out, and you’re not creating some odd appellate system. Do you have any suggestions for me as to what I could go and read and look at that would help me?",
  "Can the (o) -- you remember -- you know what I'm referring to by (o)?",
  "All right. Can that be read to refer to initial -- an initial judgment of restitution as well as an amended judgment?",
  "Look, you straightened me out, from your point of view. But now you've mixed me up again.",
  "Because I think you said that the defendant is just out of luck. But, previously, you had said that (o) applies, so I thought what you were saying was that the sentence of imprisonment is immediately appealable and must be appealed within 14 days because of that 3582.",
  "And then you said (o) applies, and (o) says that a sentence that imposes an order of restitution is a final judgment. So if (o) applies, when, 8 months later or 20 months later, that restitution is made final and embodied in another judgment, that is a final judgment which can't be appealed. So if you’re right about (o) applying, then the answer to the question is, no, he is not out of luck. Now, don't just agree with me because I seem to be on your side in this question.",
  "I’ve got to figure this out.",
  "Could you go back to -- could you go back to Justice Alito's question, because --",
  "-- that was exactly the same thing. I think what he may be saying, though, is it makes more sense to read these statutes as saying imprisonment or community -- or community service, a form of supervised release, or fines -- I don't know about forfeiture -- can be appealed as separate final judgments, because then you don't have to wait for 90 days.",
  "And if you read it that way, it's fairer to the defendant, and you don't have to worry about the restitution appeal because of (o). Now, what blocks the reading -- what blocks the reading I just gave?",
  "It's no mistake if you happen to know it, if you happen to know who the right party is?",
  "Ever?",
  "Have you ever driven a car where your wife has said turn left and you’ve turned right?",
  "Has that ever happened to you?",
  "Was there anything you didn't know?",
  "No, I'm asking about this question, my hypothetical.",
  "Was there anything you didn't know?",
  "Correct. Did you do it by mistake? Yes, of course, you did. It's happened to every human being. There are millions of instances in which people do things by mistake where, in fact --",
  "No, my wife does not make mistakes.",
  "I make mistakes, and sometimes I make mistakes knowing all the facts, and so do you and so does everybody else. So I never heard of this thing that you can't make a mistake knowing all the facts. But anyway, here we have a person who didn't know all the facts. What the judge says is he should have known all the facts. Where in the record does he say he did know all the facts?",
  "That's a different matter. My wife told me to turn left and I turned right, okay? But I didn't take it in.",
  "So that's a different matter. Where does it say that he did know the facts as opposed to he should have known the facts?",
  "I just want the citations to the page. I wasn't challenging you. I just wanted the citations to the page --",
  "-- where there’s a finding that, in fact, he knew that this company called \"Costa Cruise\" in Italian is the same as the company called \"Costa Cruise\" in English? I take it \"Crociere\" means \"cruise.\"",
  "Yes, yes. One is called \"Costa Cruise\" in Italian and one is called \"Costa Cruise\" in English. And I just want to know where it says in the record that the client or he, the lawyer, actually knew, actually knew that he should have sued the one that spells its name in Italian?",
  "I didn't ask you that question. I'm asking for a record citation as to where there is a finding that this particular plaintiff knew that the Italian company called \"Costa Cruise\" was in fact the one he should have sued?",
  "I’ll write them down and look at them later.",
  "I thought what the district court said was “impute” the knowledge.",
  "Where does it say that? Where does it say that on 19a?",
  "Well, I -- I know. I would say in reading this, that both courts have made the most elementary mistake of the English language in thinking that when a person doesn't know something but should have known it, that that’s inconsistent with a mistake. That's the very definition of a mistake.",
  "Now, all I want is some citation from you that shows that isn't what they thought.",
  "Well, that's the conclusion, and when I read two sentences down, it said they may have had constructive knowledge. The word \"constructive\" to me, when I hear I want to run out the door, because what the word \"constructive\" to me means is not knowledge.",
  "I'm on page 19a.",
  "Constructive notice.",
  "All right. Then what is -- where is the page that it says that the plaintiff had actual, as opposed to imputed, knowledge?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, I don't understand what the lawyer reading the ticket has to do with this question.",
  "That isn't true, is it? In the English language, it's not true? I mean, that's why I was giving you some examples. I don't know; maybe there’s some special legal language somewhere written in Blackstone, or maybe it's Lord Coke, I don't know, that says when you use the word \"mistake\" don't use it in English, use -- use it in Italian.",
  "But I mean, if we're going to use it in English, there -- it's not hard to find instances where a person would know, but he'd still make a mistake.",
  "And there's even a fortiori --",
  "-- if he doesn't know, even if he should.",
  "Isn't that true?",
  "What possible reason is there that somebody who is hurt on a ship and has a lawyer, and she has a broken leg, and she'd like to get recovery, would deliberately sue the wrong person?",
  "Is there such a reason?",
  "And I’m just saying, did he do it by mistake? If you were representing this person, would you want to sue the company that could give you some money if they are liable? Or would you rather sue the Bank of America that has nothing to do with it?",
  "Well, I want to ask you about that, because in your brief you refer in your footnote on page 6 to requirements of the Federal Government 44101-44103. So I looked those up. I discovered that 44103 says that it is a requirement, and you say you follow these requirements, that you shall establish under regulations of the FMC financial responsibility. And those regulations tell you that, at least as best I could read them, that you must furnish a written designation of a person in the United States as a legal agent for service of process, and they are referring to instances in which somebody on a ship suffered an accident. So since you say that you are complying with that, I would like to know the name and address of that person in the United States for whom you must send legal process, because if obviously that had been on the ticket, that is precisely the man to whom this plaintiff would have sent the notice.",
  "Well then, were you correct when you said in your -- in your brief that this company which you represent does comply with 44103?",
  "It is relevant, I think, because it adds to the confusion if they are under a legal requirement to have a service -- an agent to receive service, and then they not only don't do it, but they don't have it printed on the ticket. And they get everybody mixed up by having the same name in English, or a very similar one, and announcing someone you’re supposed to serve, and then it turns out to be not that person you’re supposed to serve. It's a mysterious person that you can't find.",
  "It seems odd. I’d like to know what the explanation is of this.",
  "This might be tangential, but is there a reason to suggest the Federal Maritime Commission look into this? Because I read the regs. I don't understand quite what's going on, because it seems to me they have a rule that is designed to prevent this situation.",
  "Is that true, what I'm suggesting or not? You know the area better. maritime lawyer, Your Honor. But I think certainly if the Court's opinion were to note it, the Maritime Commission might well take a hint from the opinion and look into it.",
  "Take the case, though -- just take the -- what is the government's position? The ERISA plaintiff wants $5 million. They get denied everything. The -- the court says: I noticed here there was a 30-day deadline that you had, and he only gave you 28 days, so I'm sending it back, but I'll tell you your claim that there was enough evidence is absurd; you’re never going to win it. And then he goes back, and he loses it. Okay? He has had a procedural victory. Does he get attorney's fees? Not -- not a chance that he’s going to win this claim, and, indeed, he loses it. He doesn't get a penny. Does he get attorney's fees, because on a technicality he won a new hearing?",
  "My question is --",
  "-- does the statute, in the view of the government, permit attorney's fees in the case I just mentioned?",
  "Your answer is, yes --",
  "-- it does permit?",
  "All right. You’re just saying it won't be a problem because the district court judges are all reasonable, and I know they think that.",
  "Well, the judgment is, send it back. That's what it says: Send it back. And the reason for sending it back is this woman was undergoing terrible pain, that the Social Security Administration says she’s completely disabled, that she’s entitled in the -- on the evidence shown. There’s no substantial evidence to the contrary. But you, the company, want to take money from her instead of giving her the money. Now, I’ve read the record. It doesn't support anything contrary to what I’ve said. So now you send it back. Now, what is that but a big victory for the other side? Which then leaves the company to say: They're right; pay them. Now, if that isn't -- I mean, what words of English -- if you’re -- we’re talking about partial success. Partial success, or not total defeat. That is the language from Ruckelshaus. Not \"total success.\" You still get it. Okay. What in the English language can we read in a case or a statute that would say you shouldn't reach that commonsense result? Now, of course, I’m characterizing it a little bit, but it does seem like a commonsense result.",
  "If someone wants a remand, it's a remand, but on limited grounds; that is, a holding of the district court. The ERISA administrator was -- it's an abuse of his discretion to refuse to give this woman nothing. In my opinion, she's entitled at least to $30,000, but whether it's 30 or 35, I don't know. So I remand it to the ERISA administrator so he can decide to act within -- within his discretion, give her either 30, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Now, in your view, attorney's fees -- all the statute says is the court, in its discretion, may allow a reasonable attorney's fee. Nothing more. Now, what would stop an attorney's fee in that situation?",
  "If that's what you think.",
  "You distinguish between him saying you have to give her at least 30 and his saying the evidence that supports giving her less than 30 is -- insufficient, is substantially -- is -- what's the word? Yes, worthless.",
  "That's the line you draw?",
  "That may be, but why can't they do this? What would be wrong with this heretical idea, that as long as the plaintiff wins something out of the court, the district judge -- that group of people we were talking about -- has discretion to decide whether ultimately they got something significant of what they wanted, and as long as that judgment helped them get them something significantly of what they wanted, attorney's fees are fine; and we leave it all up to the district judge as long as the district judge doesn't abuse the discretion that that standard gives him? What would -- I mean, would the Earth come to an end? What would happen that would be so terrible if we said something like that?",
  "It didn't say anything against the catalyst theory. It said you have to remember this is an American country, we follow the American rule, and there has to be something special in the situation. And what would be special in this situation is that the judge has to decide that as a result of the favorable ruling, the plaintiff really did get something significantly of what she wanted.",
  "You also received -- she also received a conditional judgment in her favor.",
  "She said: Unless this order goes into effect within 30 days, the judgment will be entered for the plaintiff, for her -- for her.",
  "Well, she got one judgment in her favor. It was a conditional judgment. I mean, if we’re being technical, if we’re going to just do this totally on some kind of procedural theory of what's a judgment, what's a judgment in your favor, and we just don't want to look to the merits of it and see what really happened, then why doesn't she win? Because she got a judgment in her favor, okay? End of the matter.",
  "Well, let's read the judgment. Let's see. It says -- it says judgment. It says in a -- what is it called? I just saw it here. My colleague had it here. It says -- I think this it. It says “Conclusion” -- it says -- and it's in the conclusion, and it says what happens. And it says it denies, denies, denies, denies. And then it says: \"Reliance to act on Ms. Hardt's application, adequately considering all the evidence, within 30 days. Otherwise, judgment will be issued in favor of Mrs. Hardt.\" Now, that's in a kind of judgment, I guess. It's in an order. So an order saying we’ll issue a judgment -- it sounds to me like you could say that's a judgment in her favor. You don't have to, but you could.",
  "No. Normally, a judge -- a judge doesn't say: It is ordered that if you do not act within 30 days, there will be a judgment entered in flavor of the plaintiff. That's not a usual thing.",
  "I'm just saying, if we’re going to be formal and we’re going to look to certain words included in -- in certain papers, irrespective of what really happened, don't we have those words in the paper that's relevant here?",
  "Yes, that's -- that’s true. The thing I was wondering in this case is there's a -- a dispute that's about racial discrimination and so forth. There’s a clause, and the clause says this is arbitrable, but that is being disputed because the plaintiff in the case says that's an unconscionable provision, so it doesn't really apply. And then you say but now that dispute is referred to the arbitrator to just read the language. But the plaintiff says that that language, too, is unconscionable, and as long as that language is unconscionable, then how is it clear and unmistakable that they, he, agreed to do it, because an unconscionable provision is not a provision? So if we apply First Options -- I mean, it's complicated because of the language; it's not complicated once you think it out, and -- I hope. But just applying it very literally, it would seem to say that you do not have clear and unmistakable evidence that they agreed to submit this kind of dispute to arbitration for the reason that what you point to is itself according to them a product of unconscionability. How do you -- how do you respond to that?",
  "Well, making itself could be, but I think that's a harder question, whether a -- certainly if the person says you see my signature there; that's not mine; that's Joe Banana's, who tries to imitate me -- there is no contract, and no matter what it says, it doesn't go to the arbitrator. All right? Now, we can argue about whether it is or is not analogous to that when he claims it's unconscionable. There's a very good argument it is analogous. There's a very good argument it is like fraud in the inducement, and there are some arguments the other way. But First Options I think cuts through that, by saying whether that's true or not, unless it's clear and unmistakable that they wanted this matter, the matter of whether the arbitration clause itself is unconscionable referred to the arbitrator, whether or not they wanted that referred to the arbitrator has to be clear and unmistakable. And they are claiming no, because the lack -- the provision that says that is itself a product of unconscionability. That's to repeat my question. But, having repeated the question, why isn't that the simplest, most direct, and four-sentence ground for deciding this case?",
  "He’s not saying that this whole arbitration clause is unconscionable?",
  "Well, all right. So he's -- he’s complaining the whole clause is unconscionable, and that's part of the clause.",
  "Yes, and in First Options, we said it wasn’t clear and unmistakable.",
  "And the rules were what I just described.",
  "So let's go back to that. Maybe the other way is simpler. You say you agree that if my defense to this contract, which you are trying to enforce against me or which gives me a right to sue you, look at the argument, you put up this four-page document, and I say: Look, that is not my signature; that is the signature of Joe Bananas. We agree that's for the court.",
  "Okay. Now, we agree it's for the court if my defense is, what he did is he got me drunk, told me a bunch of lies, and I signed it. I grant it's my signature, but look at how squiggly it is. And my will was not a free one because I was under the influence of alcohol and lies.",
  "Okay. Same. Okay. That’s Prima Paint.",
  "Okay? Now, he says the reason that I did not sign this contract -- I agree it's my signature; I agree it is not squiggly -- but still my will was overborne. What was it overborne by? It was overborne by those very situations that lead courts to label contracts unconscionable. The reason we don't enforce unconscionable contract is because the person who was the victim had no free will. He did not sign it of his own accord. And that doesn't -- there’s no other reason, and that's the basic reason, and therefore assimilate it to the other two. What's your response?",
  "Yes, but that's what I want the answer to. I know you don't agree with it. What I want is a list of reasons why.",
  "But I'm not interested in arbitration law. I’m interested in contract law, and I want to know why as a general matter of contract law an allegation of unconscionability, defense of unconscionability, is why is it not enough like the coercion defense or the inducement defense or the \"I was in Alaska\" defense? Isn't it enough like that that they should be treated alike? And now you're going to say no, and I want to know why not.",
  "What is -- what I'm not sure about what you are arguing now is my -- as I came into this, I thought there were three situations. Situation 1 is common in labor arbitration. It's an arbitration agreement that says wages, hours, and working conditions disputes will be arbitrated, and we have a question about whether a particular dispute is or is not full within the definition.",
  "As to that one, we assume that the parties intended the question of arbitrability to be arbitrated; we assume it. Normally, that's the rule. It's the scope of the arbitration agreement. That's a little hard to distinguish, but sometimes that's not the argument. The argument could be: Well, there are four different provisions in the arbitration section, and we think one of them is void because it's, say, unconscionable, but the others are okay. Now, that one, I mean, normally, you could if it's clear enough say I want that one to go to arbitration. And the third one is that you have a contract, and it's an arbitration contract, and it's on four separate pieces of paper, and what you’re saying is, I was in Alaska, or the equivalent, and maybe unconscionability is the equivalent. On that one I'm with you. I don't see how you can submit -- agree to submit that to the arbitrator, because there’s no agreement, or at least no valid one, at least no valid one under State law. But what are you arguing? That this is that case or this is the other case I just mentioned, that middle case where you have 10 provisions and you’re saying that this one over here is unconscionable but that one isn't; and -- but I did sign a valid arbitration agreement. I agree with that. It's just that certain provisions of it are invalid because they’re unfair. What are you arguing in this case?",
  "Well, the second one -- I don't see how you get there, because if it's the second, one you concede that there is an arbitration agreement that’s valid. And if you concede that there is a valid arbitration agreement between you and your client, and you’re arguing over the scope of different provisions or whether certain provisions within it are valid or invalid, why can't you submit that to an arbitrator if it’s clear enough?",
  "As to each provision? As to each bit of -- why?",
  "But suppose you and your -- your client -- rather, your client and the other side have absolutely agreed, clear as could be, under the arbitration agreement: We want arbitrated too whether the provision that these words are contained in is unconscionable. Can't they agree to that?",
  "Okay. Let me say it more easily. We have agreement number one, four pages, and within it is a question of -- which just looks like this one. Agreement number two: The two parties agree that if any dispute should arise as to whether any words in agreement number one are unconscionable, they will go to the arbitrator. Agreement number two is concededly valid. Now do you want to say that agreement number one -- those words have to be decided by the court?",
  "Right, but if you’re going to say yes --",
  "-- then I think if you’re going to say yes to that, then it’s contrary to First Options, I think. I'm not sure, but I don't see why not.",
  "I read your -- I promise you I’ll go back to First Options, which I thought was of gem-like clarity --",
  "And I am apparently the only one in the world --",
  "-- the only one in the world who thinks that. And I’ll go back to --",
  "I’ll go back to that and look at it. But the -- the --",
  "Looking at your response to their motion to arbitrate --",
  "-- it seemed to me you said here that -- that because of your -- your position, your client's position, that the whole thing is unconscionable. You didn't say that?",
  "Yes.",
  "But not every contract. I mean, I’ll take that argument. I’d like to know about that argument. I’d like to know what really is the underlying, which I’ve never looked up. What is the underlying rationale in contract law of setting aside contracts as unconscionable? Why do courts do it? What's the theory? I’d like to know that.",
  "See, that's what I wonder, that last part -- is it that the basic theory is we want to protect a group of people by -- who voluntarily entered into contracts by giving them the right to opt out, or is is that we don't think that they really meant to do it?",
  "Okay. On that question, or any other question, is, I would imagine, where we have agreement one, and the argument is maybe agreement one was unconscionable. And then we enter into agreement two, and the parties in agreement two agree to -- to arbitrate their unconscionability dispute in agreement one, and there’s nothing wrong with agreement two, I would think that's then the question of unconscionability is for the arbitrator.",
  "You said \"all,\" and I just don't think you meant all. But maybe you did. That's why I asked the question.",
  "All right. What is the one-sentence answer, one sentence, to the thing, this is a very interesting case, lots of stuff in it that we needn't reach because irrespective of everything else, they in their reply, the district court, and the court of appeals all said these whole four pages, the whole four pages were unconscionable, so none of it’s enforceable, and all we have to decide is whether that's an issue for the court. And the answer to that being not an issue for the court is what, in a sentence or two?",
  "They said, look, there’s a four-page document. They said this four-page document is unconscionable, the product of unconscionability, and, therefore, don't enforce it. That's their claim. That issue is at least is for the court, because there is no valid agreement here at all, if that's right.",
  "Can you go back --",
  "Suppose that in 1957 in Little Rock, a group of Little Rock citizens had wanted to put on the ballot a petition to require the school board to reopen Central High School, which had been closed because there was a sentiment in the community that they didn't want integration. And it was pointed out that if they signed this petition, there was a very good chance that their businesses would be bombed, that they would certainly be boycotted, that their children might be harassed. Now, is there no First Amendment right in protecting those people? And if there is, how does it differ from your case?",
  "I'm not sure that that's right. I think that -- that this may well apply to the crime that is being -- that is being prosecuted where the crime is defined as a real offense in the world, with the limitations put on that term by the guidelines. I would think that would be a natural reading, in which case you'd look to the conduct of the person. And if the conduct of the person is such that it calls for a mandatory minimum of a certain kind, there we are. And if that exceeds this amount, there we are. You can't apply it. And if it doesn't, you do apply it.",
  "Have you looked into that? I mean, that was my reading of it as -- in the most natural way. The word \"crime\" is ambiguous. Sometimes it means words in a statute. Sometimes it means an affair in the world. And I thought this one probably meant the affair in the world.",
  "Well, I read that -­",
  "If that's so, then this gives tremendous power to the prosecutor to decide what the sentence will be in terms of how he manipulates the charge. And I thought that probably this, read with the guidelines, is designed not to -- not to permit that. It's to minimize the discretion, not to maximize.",
  "I mean, I don't know if it makes any difference. I mean, has there ever been such a case where the prosecutor worked this in such a way that he would produce this? Are you aware if any such case ever happened?",
  "So there are two possible readings now of the \"except\" clause where it says -- the words are this subsection doesn't apply where a mandatory -- where any other provision of law sets forth a higher mandatory. Now, one possible reading, which is yours, is what this means is that, judge, where you are operating under that provision you just mentioned, and you're going to -- the guy has committed two serious 924(c) things and so he is entitled to life -- this is just what the Chief Justice said -- this is done to remind the judge don't give him life plus 25 years, because it would be 25 years under this statute, not 5. That's one possible reading. The other possible reading is, judge, where, in fact, you have a pretty -- you have the underlying drug offense that's going to get you up into the 30s and it's -- you know, in the guidelines, it's going to be probably 10, 5 years, or whatever it is. You have a pretty high drug offense already. And now we give him 5 extra years, say, for having a gun under this, unless he's already gotten, say, a mandatory minimum of 7 years. And if he's already gotten the mandatory minimum of 7 years, here's what's happening: Judge, turn to the guidelines, and the guidelines will tell you to add 3 or 4 extra years. So in one -- that -- those are the two possible readings. Now, the first reading to me makes very little sense. The second reading to me says, yes, this is serving a purpose. It's once you're sure this guy has to go to jail for 5, 6, 7, maybe 10 or 20 years for sure, extra amounts are controlled by the guidelines, which is administered by a judge. Now, if you just came across that for the first time, which would you think was most probable.",
  "When -- when did Congress pass the statute that they amended in 1998? The one with -- you're saying -- I mean, it's a good point. You have a point, that this would make it more lenient, the interpretation. But the \"it\" was passed when?",
  "So that's way before the guidelines. So what they are trying to do now is the -­ in 1998, is they're trying to -- see, in 1998 what they're trying to do is take some of these old provisions and reconcile them with this new system that has come along. So I agree you have a point there. But it -- it does make a certain amount of sense, because what it is saying is, in these cases where you have a whoppo mandatory minimum anyway, so you're sure he's got it; now, the additional amount will be controlled by the guidelines, which are subject to not much discretion. They are pretty close to mandatory minimums, but there's a little wiggle room.",
  "Oh, it's not strongly. The -- what is it an example? You're saying the other -­ this thing also serves the purpose that perhaps someday Congress will pass a new statute, a totally different one, and a busy district judge might think that he should add the 5 or 25 years from this provision on to whatever sentence this hypothetical new statute provides, but this will tell him not to do so. Did you have anything in mind?",
  "I take it in those other offenses there are other things in the code, and the odd thing about this one is there is no other thing in the code except the one we've been discussing. And so I just wondered if there -- was there at the time anybody thinking of adding some new thing that this might have been applicable to? Or have you come across anything? I take it your answer is no.",
  "No, no, no. It's a shift over to the sentencing guidelines, which say a person like this one will receive an extra 3 or 4 or 5 years depending on the circumstances. Will receive it, just like a mandatory. Unless, of course, it is an unusual case. That's what it's a shift to.",
  "Am I wrong?",
  "I didn't say that -­",
  "You do. You do, but the difficulty that I -- I don't get the answer to Justice Ginsburg's first question. Of course you have all kinds of costs dealing with ownership, but what the IRS says, what it says in the statute, is you are supposed to take the applicable costs from IRS. And what it has on page 5a is it has something called \"ownership costs.\"",
  "And it defines those as $471.",
  "And then on 3a, where it says what ownership costs are, it says the transportation standards consist of nationwide figures for monthly loan or lease payments, referred to as ownership costs. So when I read that, I said ownership costs means monthly loan or lease payments, nothing else. Now, you have all kinds of other things. It's just these words \"ownership costs\" don't refer to those other things, because of that definition given right there. That's what I thought Justice Ginsburg was initially asking.",
  "And I -- and how -- how do you get out of that what I think of as very, very clear language which says what these standards refer to?",
  "Yes, but it doesn't -- for example, suppose you buy a dozen apples every month, and they cost you $48 extra. You're not going to say the ownership costs refer to the apples, even if you decorate the car with them.",
  "I mean, ownership costs refers to lease and loan payments. Nothing else.",
  "Is there something wrong with the IRS saying what they mean? It says ownership costs means monthly loan or lease payments. Now, is there something -­",
  "That's what it says it means. Now, is there something illegal about it defining ownership costs in that way?",
  "What is -- we've got about half the courts in the country agreeing with you. And so you've read all those arguments, and what in your opinion is the best one on the point, again, where I am stuck, which is Justice Ginsburg's original point? I mean, I can think of millions of examples. You have a form that says -- the employer says entertainment expenses. Then it defines entertainment expenses as food and transport, and they leave out movies, you know. Or you could have vacation expenses, and vacation expenses are defined as transport and hotel, and they leave out meals. And here we have a definition of ownership expenses, and they say leasing and loaning, and they leave out other forms of ownership.",
  "Now, the argument is, well, that's what they mean by it, so that's what applicable. Now, what's the best argument against that in those 50 cases? Why is it trying -- why to try to get an expense which isn't loan or lease? Have you any more right to it than if you tried to get an expense to my totally irrelevant apples? I mean, it doesn't fit within the applicable definition. What's the answer?",
  "I've looked at the form.",
  "Yes.",
  "Ownership.",
  "But they -- two pages earlier they say what they mean by the word \"ownership.\"",
  "Yes.",
  "You say half the courts say, oh, you just sort of imagine what ownership expenses are, and anything that they can fall within that general English language word is what they can deduct; is that their approach? Because we -- you say cut off the definition, cut off the definition from the word \"ownership\"; don't use it. So what do we use to define what ownership is?",
  "No, I know, but it's for ownership; it's not for, for example, whistling. It's for ownership. So -- so how do we define what that $471 attaches to? Do we use a State common law definition or something? How have they done it?",
  "Why?",
  "Why don't we?",
  "You're -­",
  "The -- sorry. Are you finished?",
  "Go ahead.",
  "Finish, yes.",
  "I think it is -- well, I'm trying to work out what was his point. And I don't blame him for this. But trying to figure it out, he says look: This whole thing was written for a different purpose than the IRS, and if we start reading all those things from the beginning into the tables, we're really going to get into a mess. For example, we are going to give people deductions when they have lease payments, even though they're not owners when they have lease payments. The company owns -- not even an ownership expense, but it does say use the lease payment. And then it has all these other things. So forget it; do a simple thing. It says ownership expense. You go to the registry of motor vehicles and you say, is Smith the owner? And they'll tell you, yes or no. And if the answer is yes, he deducts $471. Sometimes that's too little; sometimes that's too much. But once we depart from that, we're really in a nightmare of trying to figure out what all these things mean that were written for other purposes. So, what do you say to that?",
  "What do you mean? How could it possibly be admissible? First, there has to be a degree of formality, as the Court held in Hammon, sitting in the kitchen; and, second, it has to satisfy State hearsay tests. So unless it's an exception to the hearsay rule, it is not admissible.",
  "Well, of course, there are exceptions. There could, in fact, there could be a co-conspirator exception. There could be a dying declaration exception. But what we're talking about is whether the Constitution keeps it out, even though State law -- because, say, it's a co-conspirator exception -­ would permit it in. So the answer is no, it's not the case that whenever you come across a victim of a crime and ask him questions, it's going to be admissible. It depends. The State hearsay law, the exception, and whether there's a degree of formality, as there was in Hammon.",
  "It would not apply? There are -- there isn't a Federal hearsay rule? And there are not exceptions that you have to satisfy?",
  "I thought there were, in my copy of the Federal Rules of Evidence.",
  "-- involves something like that, if -- what keeps that out? I mean, assuming that a State law or the Federal Rules of Evidence admit it as an exception to the hearsay rule, why should the Confrontation Clause bar it? There is not great likelihood that, like Sir Walter Raleigh or Cobham's affidavit, it is going to be introduced per se into the trial as a form of evidence that there was -- why would we want to keep it out? That's the part that I do not understand.",
  "Federal -- I mean, under the Federal Constitution.",
  "Suppose I think we didn't. Suppose I happen to think -­",
  "I'd like to hear your answer because I don't think we decided it in Crawford.",
  "But does it mean -- does it mean that the individual is thinking this may be used -­ there's a certain formality to the situation; it may be used at trial? Or it may just happen to turn out? I mean, what is the relevance of the formality of the situation? When I looked into history I thought -- I'm not an expert in history, and I'm also -- I understand there have been situations where the Court's gone back to prior cases and looked at footnotes and said it doesn't express things precisely clearly and changed it a little bit. I think that that goal could be open to us. So I want to know what the basic reason is that there -- that would justify keeping out, let's say, an investigation. There's an investigation of a crime, and a policeman comes across a confederate who makes some statements just generally that help the investigation; therefore, it would come in under -- as co-conspiracy, okay? What in the Constitution, what functional principle, is there that says we should keep that out of Court?",
  "Is it all hearsay? Now, all -- all hearsay evidence, despite State or Federal rule makers saying there are exceptions where the trustworthiness is sufficient, such as co-confederates, confederates, all of that's wiped out by Crawford and the -­",
  "Of course, what I'm looking for now because I'm -- is whether there's any sense to that. What is the constitutional rationale? I joined Crawford, but I have to admit to you I've had many second thoughts when I've seen how far it has extended as I have written it.",
  "So now you've just got what I'm looking for. What I'm looking for is I can go into Blackstone a little bit and look back and see what this was after, was the problem of Sir Walter Raleigh's trial and the Marian judges. And now what I need is a line. Because if I can't find a line, then what we've done, which seems just as wrong to me, is suddenly bar virtually all hearsay exception evidence, of which for 400 years, or 200 years anyway, there has been quite a lot in the courts.",
  "What, in your view, is the correct line and why, most importantly why?",
  "Is there any -- I'll try this -- I think you're just -- you don't like my -­ where I'm coming from, but -- and so you might not have an answer to this. But -- but in my mind, I see a line, and that line is dividing what I think of as the Confrontation Clause, Sir Walter Raleigh situation, which I have in my mind as people going into a room and saying, now write out your testimony, and they write it out in the form of an affidavit, or they send in a letter, and they say \"bye,\" and then they walk next door to the trial and introduce it. I mean, that's Walter Raleigh, in my mind. And then, on the other side of the line, is an -- evidentiary rules that are basically in State cases run by the State. And they sometimes let hearsay in, and they sometimes don't, and they make reliability, et cetera, judgments in developing their -- their decision as to how hearsay exceptions will work. Okay? Now, why don't I like emergency to draw that? The reason I don't like the word \"emergency\" is I think police do lots of things other than handle emergency and develop testimony. There's a range of things that you would describe as investigating the circumstance. There's no danger. There have been a string of robberies. They go around and ask the grocery store people and everything what happened. Now, I don't know why we should keep out evidence that, say, is given in that situation by a confederate. It turns out he was the assistant -- why? And if I don't like that, I don't like the emergency rule as doing the -- as doing the work there, and I'm looking for something else. Now, you have my whole train of thought. If you want to say, Judge, there is nothing but the emergency rule, you are perfectly free to say it.",
  "They're not. They're just asking -- all right. Yes. Go ahead.",
  "Yes. They're investigating.",
  "Yes, yes, but in the past that situation you are describing arose only where there was a hearsay exception. I would imagine most likely it would be the case of a confederate, someone who was part of the conspiracy. So if I think if that's going to be the case, that probably will be admissible where this has bite.",
  "And there be some others, excited utterances, maybe another. Dying declarations are probably few and far between. Baptismal certificates -­",
  "I know they did. And what I'm saying is I'm finding that -- it seems to me that that line, if taken literally, would keep out exceptions to hearsay testimony, which have been well established in the United States for 200 years. Baptismal certificates, statements of birth.",
  "Confederates is the one I come back to.",
  "Okay, okay. I forgot -­",
  "Many -- I mean, like many cases there is language that takes -- that can take us far afield from the subject matter before us. And I will admit that I did not foresee the scope of Crawford. So I'm really asking about that scope and, in particular, whether, looking to the past or to reason or to whatever you want, there is a good reason for keeping out the testimony of, say, a co-confederate, a co-conspirator, where it was elicited, not with intent to introduce it into the courtroom, but it was elicited in the course of an ordinary investigation of a crime.",
  "What is -- what is the answer to Justice Alito's question? The -- a clerk doesn't give a license to someone he should. Right? Now, you bring -- that person brings a lawsuit against the city. Now, if Monell applies, in order to win he has to show that it was the city's policy to deny it, or maybe all he has to show is the city's policy was to leave it up to the clerk. And if he finds it was the city's policy to grant it, he's going to lose, which he should, because there was no such policy. The clerk was wrong.",
  "What's the harm in that? Now, the next question would be: If we show the third, is there any ground for an injunction against the city? And on that one, I don't know. Maybe there is. Maybe conditions changed. I don't know. But what's the harm to anybody in doing -­ requiring that in order -- just what I said? What's the harm?",
  "There are two possibilities -- three possibilities. The clerk denied the license. (A) there is a city policy which requires him to do it; (B) there is a city policy that permits him to do it; (C) there is a city policy that forbids him to do it. All right? Now, those are the only three I can think of. And it seems to me in (A) or (B), you could recover against the city, and in (C) you couldn't.",
  "So -- so -- so, why -­",
  "If there's no city policy, then the city hasn't done anything wrong under Monell. Now, is that what you're arguing? That the city should, even though it has no policy, nonetheless have to have attorneys' fees, is open to suit, et cetera, and forget about Monell? Is that your argument?",
  "If you're right about that -­",
  "All right. If you're right about that, there's no problem for you because you are saying, yes, you need a city policy, and this counts as a policy.",
  "-- against State.",
  "I mean, here you have a statute, and the statute doesn't have any method in it to get off -- get out of it, even when you should. Their claim is this is a State matter, the State's responsible, it's unconstitutional, go sue the State and tell the State to do it. Now, that's a -- what's wrong with that position? And either they had the power to do it under State law or they didn't. If they did have the power to do it, then you probably will show a practice. If they didn't have the power to do it, why should they bear anything against them? You should tell the State go do it.",
  "What is wrong with that?",
  "Why did the State -- why did they send it back? I thought they sent it back in order to determine whether there was some policy against doing it.",
  "So what is your view of what the liberty -- you're saying that the words in the Constitution that protect the right that you claim was violated are the words, \"No person shall be\" -- I guess -- \"deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" I guess you mean the word \"liberty.\"",
  "All right. And in your words, it is liberty -- define it. Liberty to what?",
  "There is a right to liberty to control information about oneself?",
  "All right. And all information? Some information?",
  "Liberty -- there's a liberty to control all information? Protected from - - from what? From the state? The state doesn't have a right to give you any -- get any information about you? On a driver's license? It's -- what? When does it come into play?",
  "So the fact that the government says -- I go and I want my driver's license, and they say fill out the form, we want to see how you -- if you can drive or not, that potentially could violate the Constitution?",
  "Potentially. It might not, because it might be justified, but each such case would have to be justified. Is that -- is that your theory?",
  "It says \"liberty.\" The liberty, you said, was liberty to control information about yourself.",
  "So I want to know how that works. Every time anyone in the Government asks a question about you personally -- of course, it wouldn't be unconstitutional -- but every time it would have to be a justified thing; is that -- is that your theory? I'm just asking.",
  "And so, what -- how do we decide? I'm a little interested, if you could spend 2 or 3 minutes elaborating this. A number of laws, Federal laws -- I imagine the regulations fill this room, and I think many - - maybe more, maybe several rooms. And many of them involve asking people for information. And the number of forms that ask people for information, I guess, about themselves, might fill several rooms. And I can imagine in a country of 300 million people, you would find someone objecting to many of the questions. And so, how is the system supposed to work, in your view, where judges will decide whether a particular question -- I'm not saying you're wrong. I just wanted to get an idea from you as to how this legal system works, where any question asked by the Government about a person is potentially subject to challenge as unconstitutional. You and I will agree that many are fine. But you are worried about some that aren't fine. How does it work, the system, distinguishing the ones from the other?",
  "What is your view on that question? You know, there's a famous, funny example that supposedly may be untrue. Senator Hruska used to ask and say -- in giving a reference, he would write about someone, you'll be lucky if you can get Smith to work for you. That's - -",
  "That's the kind of thing that you might want to know, and despite the ambiguity there, and it seemed to me that question 7 sort of drove at that. And so -- but they did enjoin it. So, in your view, is that aspect of the injunction wrong?",
  "All right, then, if it's right, why is it right? Because it seems to me the basic thing any employer would want to know is whether I'm lucky to get this person to work for me, that kind of thing.",
  "I mean, what is the specific thing about question 7 that you think is unlawful or should be changed? What words do you object to in that question?",
  "All right. So they cannot ask, do you have any information about this person's employment, residence, or activities concerning general behavior or conduct or other matters? Now, I am an employer and I'd like to find out if he's going to do a good job. So what am I supposed to say? There doesn't seem to be a place here other than that to get into that question.",
  "I see. I see.",
  "Well, how is that so? The -- I've read the instruction that the court gave, and it seemed to me the instruction the Court gave was word-for-word taken from Canton. And when I read the question that you presented in your Petitioner's brief -- in the petition for cert, I thought what this case was about was an instance where there was only -- it was conceded that there was only one such instance. But then when I read your second reiteration of the question, which is a little different, and read the briefs, I thought no, there are four other ones. And so what you're really asking us to do is to decide in the case of perfect instructions whether the evidence supports them. I didn't think I was getting into that, and, frankly, as raised, the brief I think clearly supports it, but others could disagree. But why are we getting into that business in this Court?",
  "All right. Then what is it you're asking? Is there something in the instructions that is wrong? What?",
  "What?",
  "Sorry. Where -- I'm reading the instruction. I have it here. What is it? I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm just saying, what in the words stated are wrong? And where is the request that they be stated differently? That I should look at that, and that they weren't. Okay.",
  "What are the words -- I mean, it looked to me like the words on page 828 are pretty similar to my copy of what he actually said. So what are the words on page 828 that you think he should have said that he didn't say?",
  "All right. What he says here is, \"The situation involved a difficult choice or one that the prosecutors had a history of mishandling, such that additional training, supervision, or monitoring was clearly needed.\" So it looks to me like, unless I'm reading the wrong page, which I've sometimes done out of my memo here. It looks to me like he gave those words.",
  "I'm saying what is it that you asked the judge to do that he didn't do or that you asked him not to do that he did do? That's what happens. That's the way you object to an instruction.",
  "Okay. So what is that?",
  "I want you to point out in the record the words that were said to the district court saying, Judge, I want you to say this, and then the judge didn't do it.",
  "Which is where?",
  "Then I think we take it as saying that you not objecting to what -- to instruction.",
  "I mean, your whole brief is objecting to the instruction, and you didn't include the objection?",
  "Wait, wait. If you don't object to the instruction, then we're back to what I'm saying, that what you're objecting to is you don't think the evidence was such that, given that instruction, the jury could find guilt. And that's what I thought this case wasn't about to begin with, and there are three other instances. So I don't see why, given this instruction, the jury couldn't find guilt.",
  "All right. But, look -- I -- he read the instructions. They came right out of Canton. Seems perfect. Now you're saying, well, whether they did or not, you cannot have an incident -- you can't have liability if there's only one incident. And at that point, I say, gee, I don't know. I mean, maybe it depends on what the incident is. Maybe the incident involved somebody saying, hey, Brady? What's Brady? Or somebody saying, what's a criminal trial? I mean, that person needs training. And -- or -- but I don't even have to think of that here, because there were four incidents here. And, therefore, I don't have to try to make up weird hypotheticals. So where we have four instances and we have correct instructions, what's the problem?",
  "Okay. Okay. We have -- we have -- all this case? I thought that they had several instances in other cases.",
  "All involved -- in other words, there has never in this office been an instance of a Brady violation outside of this case.",
  "After, that's what it was.",
  "Ah. There were four Brady violations involving this office, okay?",
  "All right. So now we're talking about not one; we are talking about four - -",
  "-- over many years, with tens of thousands of violations, correct?",
  "This is helpful. Thank you.",
  "Isn't -- am I right -- am I right on this? Here -- I read on page 4 of your brief that it seemed what happened -- and I might not be right. Correct me if I'm not. What happened is a piece of paper called the lab report came to the -- one of the prosecutors' attention 2 days before the trial, and what it said was the blood that was the perpetrator's was type B. And the person on trial has blood of type O. Is that what happened?",
  "And the -- and the prosecutor knew that the person on trial had type O?",
  "Ah, that's something - -",
  "I see.",
  "Did it turn out at the trial that eventually the prosecutor knew it was type O?",
  "When the did they learn that?",
  "So we have to overturn the jury finding?",
  "We don't?",
  "Because they found that the failure to adequately train amounted to deliberate indifference to the fact that inaction would obviously result in a constitutional violation. That's what they found. Now, how can we -- assuming that's true and accepting it and not overturning it -- find that there was something unlawful? Because you're arguing - - you're all arguing about whether the training program really was adequate or not. They found it was not. What do we do?",
  "I'm not certain that this is about the funeral. I mean, I understand there was a funeral in it, but the First Amendment question seems to me a different -- possibly a broader and different question. Did your client see the signs? I gather from the record he didn't see what the signs were; he just saw tops of signs. So he didn't read anything on the signs; is that right?",
  "So he hadn't seen them. So how does -- how did your client find out that the signs, the tops of which he saw at the funeral when the demonstrators were standing with the approval of the police, 300 feet away -- how did he find out what they said?",
  "Did they say in -- my question is, how did your client find out these very objectionable things on the signs? How did he find out what they said?",
  "Yes, that's what I'm interested in.",
  "Okay. So now we have two questions. One is, under what circumstances can a group of people broadcast on television something about a private individual that's very obnoxious? And because of the funeral, you said that -- I accept that from your point of view; that is very obnoxious. And the second is, to what extent can they put that on the Internet, where the victim is likely to see it? Either on television or by looking it up on the Internet. Now, those are the two questions that I'm very bothered about. I don't know what the rules ought to be there. That is, do you think that a person can put anything on the Internet? Do you think they can put anything on television even if it attacks, say, the most private things of a private individual? Does Maryland's -- does Maryland's law actually prohibit that? We know it does. And what should the rules be there? Have I said enough to get you talking?",
  "Well, you can go ahead and finish - -",
  "The more you say about this, the happier I'll be, because - -",
  "I'm quite interested.",
  "What about the -- taking - - if you have an instance where the defendant has said on television or on the Internet something absolutely outrageous. You show that. You show that it was intended to and did inflict serious emotional suffering. You show that any reasonable person would have known that likelihood. And then the defendant says: Yes, I did that, but in a cause, in a cause. And now -- in a cause that we are trying to demonstrate how awful the war is. At that point, I think the First Amendment might not leave this alone. But if it's not going to leave this alone, there's where we need a rule or we need an approach or we need something to tell us how the First Amendment in that instance will begin to -- enter and force a balancing. Is it that you want to say no -- no punitive damages in such a case? Or that you would have to insist upon a particularly clear or a reasonable connection between the private part of this and the public effort? Have you thought about that at all? Because that's where I am thinking and having trouble.",
  "Hustler -- Hustler v. Falwell is defamation.",
  "Intentional infliction, okay, good. Thank you. Go ahead.",
  "Well, answer then, please.",
  "Compelling.",
  "We are still worried about the statements on television and on the Internet and the knowledge there. And I'm not -- I'm starting -- I'm trying to get the same answer from you I was trying from your colleague. Brandeis said that the right to be let alone is the most important, and so he must have been thinking there could be a tort there for interference with privacy, and the First Amendment doesn't stop State tort laws in appropriate circumstances.",
  "And emotional injury, deliberately inflicted, could be one. All right. Now -- and I think it is one. But I see that in some instances that could be abused to prevent somebody from getting out a public message, and, therefore, I'm looking for a line. Now, let me suggest a couple. See what you think. Maybe you can think of some others. You could have a judge make the decision, since the First Amendment is involved, not the jury, and the judge could say whether in this instance it was reasonable for the defendant to think that it was important to interfere with the emotional life of that individual. You could say if that was so, there will still be no -- there would be no punitive damages. There could be ordinary damages. You could remove all protection from the defendant in an instance where the defendant nonetheless knew, actually knew, that they were going to cause an individual who's private severe injury, emotional injury, irrespective of their public message. So what I'm doing is suggesting a number of thoughts of ways of trying to do what I'm trying to accomplish, to allow this tort to exist - -",
  "-- but not allow the existence of it to interfere with an important public message where that is a reasonable thing to do. Now, maybe this is impossible, this task. But I'd like your thoughts on it.",
  "And can you -- maybe this is a good point, but I would like to know what your response is. I'm not asking you in either a hostile nor friendly way. The -- assume for the moment that the language, I cannot find clear one way or the other. So I think it's ambiguous. At that point, what is your response, on that assumption that this brief on the other side from the American Academy of Pediatrics and 21 other physician and public health organizations -­ what the pediatricians here say is that, if you win, we're turning this over to judges and juries instead of the FDA and other specialized agencies, that the result could well be driving certain vaccines from the market, and basically, a lot of children will die. And that -­ that's their claim. And I think that their legal argument there is that wasn't Congress's purpose. Congress's purpose was the contrary. So leaving the language out of it, I would like you to respond to what I would call that purpose-related, fact-related argument by these particular people.",
  "Well, there is another case on that where we are going to have to go into -- which is, does that mean every bit of it has to be clear? Does it mean the intent has to be clear? That's a complicated area. But I will put that aside for the moment.",
  "Right. I've got -­",
  "But that's -- that's why I asked the question. Frankly, if I see the Academy of Pediatrics telling me one thing, and I in an earlier case wrote the other thing, I do tend to think I could have been wrong.",
  "And that's -- that's why I am asking you: Is that the best you can find on the other side, namely something I once wrote in a case? Or are there other -- are there other things?",
  "How does it do that? Look, I think a difficulty I have is this. Imagine vaccine X saves 10,000 lives, but inevitably 20 children will be killed. That's inevitable. Time period one. Five years passes. The manufacturer now realizes he could save three of those five people. All right. Is there anything in the law that requires him to tell the FDA that that is so?",
  "All right. If there is nothing that requires him to tell the FDA what comes along, what I think your opponent is saying is at that moment, it is no longer an unavoidable harm and there is nothing in this statute that says that unavoidable harms -- that avoidable harms are taken away from the courts. So what is your response to -- what is your response to that? He's saying all the unavoidable ones are taken away, but not the avoidable ones. And now we have an example. So what is your response to that?",
  "If you want to read it especially to mean unavoidable and avoidable. Let's assume you are right about that, or let's assume it is at least ambiguous. If that's so, then what is your response to the question I raised before, that is: That he says that if you allow judges and juries to decide only the question of avoidability, there will not be the harms that the childhood pediatricians thought there would be, because most people will go to the courts -­ to the vaccine court anyway. There are very few such cases, and there will not be enough liability to drive manufacturers from the market. You heard him respond to that. What is your response to that?",
  "That's a minor point, but I thought if you went into the vaccine court you had to sign something saying you weren't going to go into a tort case. I'm wrong about that?",
  "Do they get the information from the manufacturers? And -- I mean, would they find out if in fact there had been a change -­",
  "-- and it was now -- there is a safer alternative?",
  "Suppose then that in -­ suppose I look into this, which I will do, the CDC and what they do. And suppose I become convinced you are completely right, that this is a government agency that is top of this and the chances of something going wrong are very small and they will figure it all out, together with the manufacturers. Suppose I conclude that. What do I do about this word unavoidable?",
  "Now I can't say that the word unavoidable -- it's pretty hard to say that that word unavoidable means avoidable; and I am in fact -­ like to look to the purposes of this statute, that if something says \"day\" I can't say it means \"night.\" And so -- so what --what is it about this word that allows us to say that it's avoidable?",
  "To show that -- remember they only want to say, because of special circumstances this is an avoidable -- this is an avoidable injury. I think I am right on that. And -- and so the best place to look in your opinion, for me to look, to show that this word unavoidable includes that avoidable claim, is where?",
  "They are not lawyers; they are scientists.",
  "So they may not use these exact words, but you are saying whatever word they use, what they have is an ongoing process to say this is the best vaccine available; is that right?",
  "The committees have manufacturers on them and Government scientists and university people and others?",
  "The committees have manufacturers and Government scientists and university professors and others?",
  "Their argument is that the CDC will do it better than juries. That's what I heard him say.",
  "Was there a procedural issue in this case before the California Supreme Court?",
  "What was that?",
  "But if, in this case, they did reject it on a procedural ground, and it was a reasonable ground that they applied consistently, then the Ninth Circuit or the Federal courts couldn't consider the claim at all; is that right?",
  "If, in fact, the -- they are right, if in fact that the State was correct that this is procedurally barred -- they should have raised it earlier; they didn't -- and if that was correct and reasonable and proper under both Federal and State law, then you shouldn't be in this subject at all; is that right or not?",
  "So, normally, to decide a matter on a substantive -- to have a presumption that they were deciding it substantively rather than procedurally will help a defendant, though not in this case.",
  "But what they cite it for, actually, is they make a slightly different argument in their brief. They say going back to 1974, there are at least three cases in the Ninth Circuit that have said when the California Supreme Court says nothing, just denied, we take that as a decision to reach the Federal issue and deny it on the merits. Now, not in your case, but in most cases that will benefit a defendant, because it will avoid the question of whether there's an adequate and independent State ground of a procedural nature. So, what they're saying is that that's the Ninth Circuit's statement in three cases, and the California Supreme Court over a course of 30 years has never said to the contrary, which it had plenty of opportunity to do, and in other instances where the Ninth Circuit was wrong, it did do it. So, that, I think, is a fairly strong argument. Now, you're going to -- the only reason that you're not out of court on your own interpretation is because you'll say that the State waived the procedural issue. And then they'll come back and say so did you. So, what -- what is your response to all that?",
  "Well, look, for example, in Hunter v. Aispuro -- they quote it as saying the following: The California Supreme Court's denial of a State habeas petition, quote, \"without comment or citation constitutes, a decision on the merits of the Federal claims.\" End quote. And then they have three other cases roughly to the same effect. Now, what you're saying is that this Court should hold to the contrary, and by the way, in doing that, we will bar many Federal habeas petitioners from the Federal courts, because what it will mean is that there is an adequate and independent State ground in case after case, which perhaps is an irrelevant feature. But, nonetheless, the silence of the California Supreme Court is significant, I think, when faced with those pretty clear interpretations of what their silence means by the Ninth Circuit.",
  "Is it fair to say that this -- in this case, that every party in the lower courts assumed this was going to be a merits-related issue and that some deference was due, and that nobody ever said anything about it being a procedural issue where there would be a procedural bar of some kind that was either waived or not waived?",
  "The first time anybody mentioned this procedural issue was when?",
  "That was on the merits brief in opposition?",
  "There was nothing before that?",
  "Is there any reason not to do this? I'm just thinking from our point of view -- I mean, I think it's probably correct what you say: Nobody mentioned a word about this procedural issue until the brief in opposition on the merits, not the cert brief. And the reason they did was perfectly legitimate: We'd asked the question. Well, if we were wrong to do that, could -­ and if we took the opinion as being a question of reasonable deference, et cetera, and went into it, is there anything -- any reason not to put in that opinion somewhere, given Ylst and given the Ninth Circuit, it would be helpful if the California Supreme Court, for future reference, explained what their practice does in fact mean, whether it's procedural or whether it's on the merits?",
  "All right.",
  "But you have to, don't you? I mean, what's the alternative? I mean, imagine a case where it's clear there was a malpractice or an inadequate assistance, and it happened a long time ago and now you have to decide, well, was it prejudicial or not? It's prejudicial if in the absence of that he would have gone to trial or wouldn't have pleaded guilty, or -- and what's the alternative to trying to figure out whether that's so?",
  "It can't be the State always wins and it can't be the defendant always wins. So -- so what's the alternative?",
  "Oh, but that is -- isn't that -- sorry, maybe we are just quibbling. I -- I don't quite see it. That would seem to me to be going into the plea bargaining process. Would he have pleaded guilty, what would have happened?",
  "If -- if he had gone to trial, what's the sentence -- what's the range of sentence he could have gotten?",
  "And if they had gone back to the grand jury, as the prosecutor I guess could have done, it could have gone to the grand jury?",
  "It could have gone to the grand jury. Then what is the maximum he could have gotten?",
  "Might. See, that's the trouble. We have a lot of evidence, I think, here, at least by first glance, that -- a lot of evidence he shot the guy. A lot of evidence he carried -- kidnapped him. All right? And now the -- now, maybe it was accidental, but if it was accidental, it's still felony murder; and he received through the plea bargaining the minimum sentence he could get for that. You started out by saying that the -- the State court's conclusion that this was not prejudicial was clearly wrong. All right. If it's clearly wrong, what is it so clear, that he could get off if he went to trial?",
  "There is no -- there is no State court finding that this was not prejudicial?",
  "I'm not talking about Hill. I don't know the names of the cases associated. I thought that the court in the State court said -- but I might be wrong; I'd like to know -- made a finding that one, this was not ineffective assistance of counsel and two, it was not prejudicial.",
  "Now I haven't read this very thoroughly, so -- so you -- yet -- so you tell me if I'm wrong about that.",
  "Doesn't Strickland require that it be prejudicial?",
  "If I assume that the word \"fruitless\" and the reference to Strickland were a finding, that this is not prejudicial -- if I assume that for the sake of argument for the moment, what is it that you can show that shows it was prejudicial?",
  "That was the same question I think Justice -- Justice Sotomayor started with.",
  "Okay. I've got on the other -- I've got -- the other reason I asked the question, to be clear about it, is that -- is that he wouldn't have gone to trial in my mind unless he had a pretty good chance of getting a better deal. And what he -- like getting off. And what he got was the minimum. Okay? One thing I've written down is that the State would not have the confession. That's correct. Number two is he could say his brother is not a very good brother. Moreover he's a rather dubious character there, and bring all that -- stuff. Was there anything else?",
  "I don't want to miss anything.",
  "That is an irrelevant question. I don't see how we could go back to a possibly irrational state of mind. I mean, don't -­ when you're trying to figure out what a defendant would have done in the absence of an error in respect to a plea, don't you have to ask a question: What would a rational person have done. I mean, I would say that's a good question. I don't know the answer, but if we are trying to figure out he might have been totally irrational and would have gone to trial even though he was likely to end up in jail for life as opposed to 25 years, we should then reverse it and give him a trial? I'm rather disturbed by that.",
  "What do you actually think about this?",
  "They believe it. The jury believes it was an accident. Now, how does that get him a lighter sentence?",
  "No. The sentence is 25 years mandatory for felony murder. Now, the jury believes just as you said. It believes it was an accident; he never intended to pull the trigger. How does that get him a lighter sentence? That's my question.",
  "Isn't kidnapping a felony?",
  "Well, then, if he is kidnapped -- if he is convicted of the kidnapping and there was an accidental murder that took place, I believe that that would be felony murder.",
  "Yes. And the defense to kidnapping was what?",
  "Why do you feel the need to go beyond, say, what the AFL-CIO identifies as a normal oral failing -- filing? They use language like, at the initial stage of the grievance procedure, there is confrontation with an eye to fact finding, and the dispute is joined when the employee or the steward or supervisor come face-to-face to identify, to discuss, and hopefully to resolve a problem. Now that's a formal kind of relationship. It doesn't involve a cocktail party, and yet it is done orally. And there is a tradition as to how that works. But from you've said, I gather that you want to go well beyond that and provide that cocktail parties -- perhaps not cocktail parties, but just a tap on the shoulder would be sufficient, where I take it that would normally be sufficient in the grievance process.",
  "All right. Suppose I think that that provides a good precedent for -- for oral filings. What happens then? What am I supposed to do in your case?",
  "Yes, we are talking about a filing. In the grievance process -- I don't want to repeat it, but it seems to me form having read the brief that filing takes place without writing, provided that there are these other safeguards which are described. Now, I want to know in your opinion, is there a reason for not importing that into this system? I take it you win the case -- or maybe you lose it, I don't know how it works on the fact. I don't know what the filing was.",
  "There is a word \"filing\" in the AFL-CIO statute as well. So I am looking for a way of interpreting the one in light of the other. Do you favor that? Are you against that? If so, why or why not?",
  "Yes. Fine. It's a perfectly normal use of speech, I accept that. But what is it that would surround this use of speech on a particular occasion with enough formality that we know it isn't something that could pass unnoticed and bring in a whole lot of things like the cocktail party example, et cetera? I noticed there was a paragraph in the AFL-CIO -- that's why I brought it up. Is that the right standard? What we say here may take effect or have influence, so -- so I want to say it correctly. What kinds of oral complaints count as filing a complaint?",
  "But I would like more than that. The Government sees these statutes as a whole, so I would like the Government's assistance on what words to write to be able to get this right so it will not be too formal, it will not be too informal, it will do the job.",
  "All right. Now, fill in this blank then, there must be surrounding the oral complaint sufficient elements of formality such that -­",
  "But it's on a form. So we have got that -- that helps a lot. Also an employer could have a notice. Notice, if you really are upset because you think there is a violation going here, go to this microphone which is directly connected to the complaint department and cite the statute. That would work, too.",
  "But -- but there have been years and years of -- you have just said, of statutes like this, you say that many of them operate orally. All right. What kind of thing, if you can help, maybe you can't -- which is dangerous, but then we just try to do our best, and we don't have the labor law experience necessarily, but -- but what is the -- the form of words that we can use to separate the wheat from the chaff?",
  "Let me see if I can look, because in about 2 minutes you are going to hear, I suspect and the other side, say see, see, we told you, that's why you have to have it in writing.",
  "What about Justice Ginsburg's question?",
  "What about her question? In 1938 a lot of illiterate people couldn't have filed written complaints.",
  "Well, if they did, isn't it reasonable to think that they would have included in filing, in such circumstances, oral filing?",
  "No, that -- your problem is -- that in front of us, do we have to decide that now? We've granted a different question, etc. So -­",
  "You may not want to give up your first point.",
  "Right. Then it's odd that you say -- it -- I gather, as well, for about 50 or 60 years the relevant agencies have interpreted the -­ the statute the way that -- to include oral complaints. And that seems to me a fairly strong reason for continuing to do so, if -- where the language is so -- allows it and there aren't any strong reasons the other way.",
  "Maybe it's 30 years. Maybe it's 30.",
  "Well, Chevron deference would depend on an intent. I guess you are getting into an argument here that there's no reason to repeat in public. I mean, Justice Scalia and I don't necessarily agree on this. Why would you -­",
  "Why?",
  "How do we know? I mean, all right, if you want to get into it, this is a very minor sort of interstitial point in a statute that they administer, and there are lots of instances, I think where the Court has said, where these minor matters of how you work out the actual application of the word are implicitly delegate it to the agency to determine within the context of reasonable view.",
  "But not everything has to be done through formal rules. There -- there are many, many ways of agencies determining practice.",
  "Why? Why would it be different? If an agency work out a system of deciding when a person is really making a complaint, as opposed to an offhand remark, and that is good enough to run the government of the United States, where they have -­ where they are in this business, why -- why couldn't whatever their indicia are there, also be transplanted to the private sector -­",
  "-- and get that to work out all right -­",
  "-- in which case you would be left, if you are going to say that might work, then -- the you are left with the simple argument that you don't think that this statute means to apply to complaints to an employer, written or oral?",
  "Would you accept -- you think -- that a tenable interpretation? What this means is that written complaints are good enough to count as filings where you complained to your private employer, but written or oral count as a filing where you deal to -- with the government agency?",
  "No, it isn't.",
  "Yes, I agree with you.",
  "On the ground itself, is there anything in the legislative history of the statute that says it's limited to the government?",
  "That could be. It could be that they are thinking of malicious complaints and they are thinking of government agencies at the time, but neither their language nor their purpose, as history later shows, requires that limitation on scope.",
  "I assume that this whole case focuses on paragraph 33 of your complaint; is that right?",
  "And what is the \"but\"?",
  "So, what's -- look, 33 says the District Attorney has violated my rights under the law by refusing to give me the DNA evidence, so make him do it. That's how I read 33.",
  "But not the relief. That's your complaint. You explain why you think it violates Federal law for him not to do it. You ask him to do it. Is there anything else to this case?",
  "But that's why you are entitled to the relief.",
  "Is there anything else in the case that you want?",
  "You want the DNA evidence?",
  "You didn't agree with what the Chief Justice just said, did you? I noticed you were nodding your head.",
  "He said, and I -­",
  "I mean, if you agree with that, I guess there's nothing left of this case.",
  "But I -- but do you agree with that?",
  "I agree think that sounds like -- I would interpret his complaint as what he wants is the DNA. He thinks it's going to be exculpatory. He doesn't know that till he gets it. So look at Dotson. Dotson says that you go into habeas if winning -- i.e., getting the DNA -- would necessarily spell speedier release. End of the matter. I'm reading to you from Justice Scalia's concurrence where he quotes my majority with great praise.",
  "No, not whether you -- what he's worried about -- he can speak for himself -- but as I read the concurrence, he was worried that if you win and take 1983 away, all kinds of things will be stuffed into habeas which don't belong there. And that may be a true and correct criticism, but whether it is or not, he has agreed, indeed, nine members or seven members or something of the Court agreed, that the test I read to you is the test. And now, if that's the test, getting the DNA does not necessarily spell speedier release; it all depends on what the -- on what that DNA shows. So why isn't that end of the matter?",
  "So that's a totally different area, because in Dotson when -- I think what we did do was go through every of these -- every one of the prior cases, and they did involve for the most part the attack, as you say, on prison procedure. And those cases where the attack on the proceeding would have restored good-time credits, there it was shortening the -- the length of confinement. In those cases where there was a general attack on procedures, but the procedure would simply be carried on better later, like parole, there wasn't. You suddenly focused me on a whole new set of areas. Where in the case law is this different rule that the rule we just said has nothing to do with it, if it's in the case? That's basically what you are arguing. What should I read to show that you were right on that?",
  "In the particular -­",
  "I see your point, but I want to go back to try to understand this. And we have the Dotson point, and you said there are two other cases, Preiser and Heck. So what Dotson says about Preiser is that the plaintiff there wanted the shortening of his term of confinement. He wanted good-time credits to be restored. And as we read it then, the shortening of the term of confinement is what made it proper in habeas. But we added that if it hadn't been for that, if it hadn't attacked the duration of the physical confinement, it wouldn't be habeas; it would be 1983. In Heck, the same thing. They were establishing the basis for a damages claim that necessarily demonstrated the invalidity of the conviction. Where that was so, there would be habeas. Where that was not so, even if successful, it would not demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment, the action should be allowed to proceed in 1983. So as we read those two cases, they stood for the exact principle I described. Now, you want, perfectly fairly, to say: But we didn't read them correctly, or we shouldn't have read them as exclusively to say what I've just read. Fine. What is it, in your opinion, precisely, that we should have the principle of distinguishing the one 1983 from habeas corpus if we were to abandon as an exclusive test what we said, and I just read you in those three cases: Dotson, Preiser, Heck? What's your contrary approach?",
  "But if -- in Heck itself, we said a 1983 action, where it is -- even if successful, will not demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment, a 1983 action should be allowed to proceed. Now, I take it what you're suggesting is we say that sentence is wrong or overstated, that there is another circumstance.",
  "Even though it will not demonstrate that the judgment was wrong, it still should not be allowed in 1983 if it is, quote, \"related to\" the criminal case itself. Something like that is what you're proposing. Or what is it you're proposing?",
  "Say what it is, then. Say what it is.",
  "It's part of a process where you hope to demonstrate. Can you bring in habeas a motion, let's say, to examine police files?",
  "No, no. This isn't Brady. What you say is I have a right under criminal law here that everybody has that I can go back and take depositions of the -- you have a reason for doing it. You want to take their depositions because you want to show that something wasn't followed. Can you do that in habeas?",
  "Is there a Federal law -­ is there a Federal statute that -- you can't say yet whether it's invalid. We don't know. What we want is to get the information that will help us make that decision. We think there is a law that entitles us to that right. Can you bring that in habeas or not?",
  "The library. I want to use the prison library, same example.",
  "I want to use the prison library 9:00 to 3:00, because that's when I work on my efforts to upset my conviction. Now -- I mean, it's the same as Justice Kagan -­",
  "-- provided. What about that?",
  "How would you put the rule about when you have to renew a motion? You move for summary judgment. Can you say this? You've looked up the treatises and so forth. If the motion for summary judgment involves either a question of fact or a mixed question of fact and law, it has to be renewed. If it involves neither of the others, neither of those two things, but it's a pure question of law and not mixed, it doesn't have to be renewed.",
  "Is there any authority for that? I mean, is there any -- it seems to be roughly what you're trying to argue, roughly. At least it seems to me a rule that would make sense. Is it that -- what do you find related to that? It seems to me that must have been thought about before this minute.",
  "Not necessarily by you, but by somebody.",
  "Yes, but let's imagine it has nothing to do with qualified immunity.",
  "A bread-and-butter case.",
  "You can't appeal a denial of motion for summary judgment. But there's a trial and the lawyer forgets to renew the motion. So sometimes he's lost it; I guess sometimes he hasn't. I would think he would have lost it if it's a mixed question of fact or law or if it's a pure question of fact that the answer turns on. I would think he hadn't lost it if in fact it's a pure question of law. But is that the basic hornbook rule out of this context?",
  "But surely it has to be raised post-trial if your legal argument is: Look at the facts; the facts of this case as proved do not support liability. I mean, I would have thought that was a classic instance where you do have to make the motion. That's the whole point of having to renew it.",
  "Am I wrong?",
  "Why not?",
  "I mean, do you normally -­ forget this case. What the lawyer says is: Judge, they are never going to be able to prove that my client crossed the intersection. Okay? We go to trial. At trial, he wants to say: We've heard all the evidence now, and it doesn't show my client crossed the intersection, so not liable. Okay? Doesn't he have to renew it?",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay. Fine.",
  "Now, how is yours one bit different? Because what you're saying is that the evidence, when you look at it, will show the facts are such that there must have been qualified immunity under the law.",
  "Okay. When you go back -­ you're the one who has read these cases pretty thoroughly, and as I looked at it, I -- with the incomplete knowledge, I would have thought that Justice Ginsburg's statement of it is basically right. What Rule 50 is about is sufficiency of the evidence. And 50(a) involves we're saying it won't be sufficient. And 50(b) involves it wasn't sufficient. Then you could have the Chief Justice's rule. It would work perfectly. But apparently there's a Second Circuit case, and some things in the treatises, that says sometimes Rule 50(a) is being used for some other purpose. And that's what seems to be going wrong. Like if you have a pure question of law, you ought to be outside 50(a); you ought to be doing some other thing. You know, a question like: Was there collateral estoppel that means that he couldn't say he was a policeman because they litigated this 4 months ago? That's a pure question of law. So, what are these cases and that exception in the treatise about? What are they thinking of? What kinds of instances do they think come under 50(a) that aren't sufficiency of the evidence?",
  "Okay. Suppose we could say this: That when a lawyer uses 50(a) to make the kind of motion that does not involve sufficiency of the evidence but rather, in fact, could be made without 50(a), under those circumstances, he doesn't have to say 50(b). How would that work?",
  "Well, I don't know it would work fine, because it seems to me you have a lot of sufficiency of the evidence thing, but that's another question.",
  "They're not -­",
  "Your case, anyway, is a case, judging from what they wrote, which -- I'm back to where I started -- the mixed questions and the fact-based questions are you really have to renew your motion. And reading your opinion, it seems to me it's filled with determinations of fact. They're reviewing what the jury did and could have found, and on the basis of what they could have found, they say you're not entitled to -- or you are entitled to qualified immunity. So this would seem like a hornbook case where you have to make the motion, and if you have to make the motion, you didn't; and if you didn't, you don't go back and review the facts as the motion on the basis of the facts as they were before the trial. End of matter. What's wrong with that?",
  "No, no. I mean they went on the jury's resolution of the facts.",
  "For that reason, they can't take the facts as they were in your motion for summary judgment. They have to take them on the basis of -­ they can't just go back and review them on the -- yes.",
  "Is there any instance you've been able to think of where an Indian tribe could have a claim for money of some kind and some other kind of relief that they seek where they couldn't get it all in the Court of Claims?",
  "Declaratory judgment. Is there anything else?",
  "No injunctive relief.",
  "No matter what. Okay. Well, then they have a problem, because they might want -- they might want some money and they want an injunction. So what are they supposed to do?",
  "That's a big choice.",
  "Your basic point is this: You're just saying it's too bad, go to Congress. But you don't deny the basic point, which is that an Indian tribe may think the Bureau of Indian Affairs has really mismanaged everything and what they would like is some money, and also they want an injunction so they won't do it again. And now your view is, it's true, there is no way they can get that, because they have to go to two different courts, and really in your view they can't go to two different courts, period.",
  "And hardship is definite. It's just you are saying, that's what Congress wanted.",
  "Why isn't it just as bad as what I just said?",
  "The main thrust that I was raising was does this really get the Tribe into trouble? They have to forego one kind of relief for another. So what about injunctive relief, that's what he thought of, and Justice Scalia raises the point, well, they are not going to be entitled to injunctive relief anyway because the APA doesn't provide it, if I understand that correctly. So you are giving up the null set. You were giving up the null set.",
  "But it couldn't get that?",
  "It couldn't get that kind of relief in the Court of Claims?",
  "Yes, it could.",
  "What I'm trying to work out still in my mind, is if you say, look, Indian Tribe: You have to go to the court of claims, period. Period. You can't go to these other courts, I mean unless you give up the court of claims. Is the Indian Tribe going to really lose something it needs?",
  "I know you think yes. I realize that.",
  "And, what I want to ask you about -­",
  "-- is in section 2 -­",
  "-- of 1491 there is a sentence which says, about the court of claims, in any case including the 1505 Tucker Act, the court shall have the power to remand appropriate matters to any administrative or executive body or official with such direction as it is may deem proper and just. Now that seems awfully broad, so I'm thinking now, if they want money, they can get the money from the court of claims. If they want something like an injunction, they could ask the court of claims, tell the executive branch to behave the way we think they have to under the law and there's your authority.",
  "I'm just quoting. Now what's -- I want to know the response.",
  "Well, you want money; that causes the problem. If you don't want any money, you don't have a problem. You Just forget about it.",
  "Yes.",
  "I had under the impression that sometimes they sued for some money out of a fund, which would have been partial, and other times they sued for the value of the cotton, and other times they sued for the cotton itself, which in certain circumstances could have been worth a lot more. By the time of suit, it went up. I mean, do we know it was always duplicative in those cotton suits?",
  "Well, if the amount differs, then, why do you suppose the cotton belonged to the Indian Tribe? On the one hand, they want an accounting out of the money ever earned out of this cotton in the past and on the other hand, they want what the cotton is worth in the future on the -­",
  "That's Justice Scalia's question.",
  "What do you say about -- I think I read in one of these briefs that what I think is the most relevant similar statute, RFRA, has been held not to encompass the same word -- not to encompass the monetary relief, and also there was some legislative history where people testified and told Congress at the time that the word \"appropriate\" won't encompass monetary relief. Am I remembering that correctly?",
  "I was looking at the cases the best I can at the moment. I think you might say that there are a lot of cases which interpret the word \"appropriate relief\" to include monetary relief. And then there is some that don't. And to get a rule out of them, you would have to say, well, they are looking to context. And in context it sometimes is clear, sometimes occasionally not. But here, isn't this and maybe this was asked, but I want your answer. The context here, the words appropriate relief, govern both the prison situation and the land use situation, don't they? You are given an action when the government through a general land use regulation infringes somebody's right to build, for example. Now, wouldn't that kind of interference with the use of property quite often and normally require some kind of monetary compensation? This isn't just the odd thing in a prison, where it's talking about it might be called building a religious building or building some kind of parking, all kinds of things that have monetary compensation. Do you see my question?",
  "I know, but isn't it the same word that governs both?",
  "If it's the same word that governs both and if land cases very often involve claims for money, I would think that would cut against you. But that's why I ask. I want to get your response.",
  "But there are loads of cases that have nothing more than appropriate relief and in those cases context makes it clear. The only one really I thought strongly -- your strongest case seems to me to be RFRA.",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "I mean, so often, what I'm thinking of, a church wands to build, and they can't because of a land restriction. And it turns out that that land restriction violates this statute. And in the meantime they have had to rent buildings, they have had to maybe build somewhere else and they have had to do all kinds of things that cost money. And that's why I would think in that context money would be a natural thing.",
  "To fulfill appropriateness.",
  "Let me ask -- get this information from you. As I understand it, there are some cases that find the words \"appropriate relief\" in a statute to include damages and there's some that don't. Let's look at the ones that don't. There is some where it's pretty hard to do it because it's in a heading called \"injunction,\" and that's obvious. But there are only two statutes, really, where the courts have ever held in significant numbers that the word \"appropriate relief\" does not include money damages. One is the IDEA, the Disabilities Act, and the other is RFRA. Is there anything else that you've come across?",
  "Yes, but are there any others? I mean, I just want to get down on a piece of paper what I have to look at.",
  "All right. So you don't have any others, I'm judging from your hesitation.",
  "What?",
  "Why wouldn't you, if necessary, simply say that -- that a -- a video game that appeals to the prurient, shameful, or morbid interests of those 18 or under, but let's take 18, and it's not suitable in the community for those 18, and it has no redeeming importance of any kind, no serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for those 18, that at least as to those, you can't sell it without -- the parent can buy it, but the child can't buy it. So you can't sell to a 12-year-old something that would be horrible for an 18-year-old. Is that -­ would you be willing to accept that, if necessary, to make this okay on its face?",
  "Okay.",
  "But, on the principle, I mean, it's been quite some years, hasn't it, before this -- since this Court has held that one instance that courts -- that the country, legislatures, can regulate are fighting words? And we regulate fighting words, don't we?",
  "Because they provoke violence. And the American Psychological Association and the American Pediatric Association have said that certain kinds of video games here create violence when children are exposed. There are 80 people who think to the contrary. There are two huge things of meta­ studies that think that -- not to the contrary. All right. So what are we supposed to do?",
  "Talking about common sense, why isn't it common sense to say that if a parent wants his 13-year-old child to have a game where the child is going to sit there and imagine he's a torturer and impose gratuitous, painful, excruciating, torturing violence upon small children and women, and do this for an hour or so, and there is no social or redeeming value, it's not artistic, it's not literary, et cetera -- why isn't it common sense to say a State has the right to say, parent, if you want that for your 13-year-old, you go buy it yourself. Which I think is what they're saying.",
  "It does, it does. What it has is -- and I've looked at the studies, perhaps not as thoroughly as you, but it seemed to me that Dr. Ferguson and Dr. Anderson are in a disagreement. They aren't in that much of a disagreement actually, but they've looked in depth at a whole lot of video games, not movies they're talking about or other things; they're talking about video games. And both groups come to the conclusion that there is some tendency to increase violence. And the American Psychiatric -- Psychological Association and the American Pediatric Association sign on to a long list on -- I think it's the Anderson side that this does hurt children. I have to admit that if I'm supposed to be a sociological expert, I can't choose between them. But if I can say could a legislature have enough evidence to think there's harm, the answer is yes.",
  "Yes. They need additional help because many parents are not home when their children come home from school. Many parents have jobs, I -- we hope. And -- and when -- when their children are there, they do what they want. And all this says is, if you want that gratuitous torture of, let's say babies, to make it as bad as possible, what you do, parent, is you go buy it; don't let him buy it on his own, and he's 13 years old. Now, what's the common sense or what's the science of that?",
  "You're away from the common sense. If you're going back to the common sense of it, what common sense is there in having a state of the law that a State can forbid and says to the parent the child, the 13-year-old, cannot go in and buy a picture of a naked woman, but the 13-year-old child can go in and buy one of these video games as I have described? I've tried to take as bad a one as I could think of, gratuitous torture of children. Okay? Now, you can't buy a naked woman, but you can go and buy that, you say to the 13-year-old. Now -- now, what sense is there to that?",
  "You mean love is not something that people have tried to encourage children to understand and know about? I mean, what's the difference between sex and violence? Both, if anything?",
  "Thank you. I understand that.",
  "All right. So it's not susceptible. Throughout you've been arguing your point, which is fair. You have some experts who -- who favor you, and you make that point very strongly, and your point's a pretty good one and a serious one, that it's very hard to draw this line under traditional First Amendment standards. But I'd like you to deal with their point for a moment. And I take it their point is: There is no new First Amendment thing here. There is a category -- call them X -- which really are involving things like torturing children, et cetera. Maybe you don't like to sell them to anybody. You have them X'd or some special thing. But they exist, and they fit within a Miller-type definition. They are much worse than the simple girlie magazine that was involved there. And they will use traditional First Amendment tests; that is to say, there is speech at issue, that speech is being limited, it is being done for a good reason, compelling interest -- namely, this problem with the X videos and the torture and living it through -- and there is no less restrictive alternative that isn't also significantly less effective. See, I want you to deal with that directly, because what you have been doing for the most part is saying we have to be in some new, total new area, et cetera. But their argument is you don't have to be in some totally new area, et cetera. Apply traditional First Amendment standards, and we win. That's their argument, and I'd like to hear what you have to say about that, specifically.",
  "This is not an exception. It is the traditional strict scrutiny First Amendment test.",
  "All right. Then let's -­ to get you to focus on it, I'll say I've made the argument.",
  "Your answer -- your answer to the first question of Justice Alito and the Chief Justice was yes, isn't that -- that you are saying there's nothing they can do. So now, am I right about that or am I not right?",
  "I am right? Okay. All I wanted was an answer to that.",
  "Stick to the X things, maybe. Maybe it would restrict the total gratuitous torture. And if that's what it restricted, why is that such a terrible thing?",
  "And as you experimented with other things, as they did in the obscenity area, you could discover you could limit it to that.",
  "Well, you have your rules, so why wouldn't the first step be they'd follow your rules? Your rules. The X things would be limited to people who are over 18, and we'll see if we ever get prosecuted for a different one. And you might never.",
  "Why is this so complicated? I'm probably missing something.",
  "But the thing -- but it doesn't help you, I don't think, if it isn't complicated.",
  "Is the -- because of Burlington, we're only talking about a certain number of employees who could make an employer responsible.",
  "Right. So those are supervisory people, we'll call them.",
  "All right. Now, why don't we just stop there and just say we have a statute, the statute says that if -- if a bad motive was a motivating -- had to be a motivating factor, discriminatory -- a discriminatory motivating factor in the dismissal, then, unless you can prove an affirmative defense, you lose. Why do we have to have something special if one of these small group of employees happens to be the person who said the last words or happens to be somebody who told somebody who said the last words or happens to be somebody who told the somebody the something-or-other? You're just looking for one thing. And there could be five zillion fact situations. So why something special? Why did the Seventh Circuit say where it's not the guy who said the last words, you have to show, quote, \"singular influence\"? Why singular influence? Why not just what the statute says -­",
  "-- that it was -- that it led to the -- what she said, led to the discriminatory motive being a motivating factor, period, end of the matter. No special \"cat's paw\" rule, no special anything rule.",
  "Oh, no. Of course, you have to show proximate cause. You have to show cause. You always do. I'm just saying, why have a special rule? Why not have a special rule if somebody was on the second floor? You wouldn't think of that. So if you're not going to do it because the person's on the second floor, why do it because they happen to be somebody who told somebody, rather than somebody who was the person who was told?",
  "Well, fine. You're perfectly entitled to say that. But what I don't see that you're entitled to say are the words that the Seventh Circuit used, which is: You have to show jury that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding of singular influence.",
  "That doesn't just sound like it was a motivating cause. That sounds like it was something really special.",
  "Ah, okay. So why don't we say: Seventh Circuit, if that's your way of saying it is just a normal thing like cause, we accept that, but please don't use those words. And because you might have used -- you might have used them meaning something else, we will send this back so we're certain that what you are doing is applying the same test to everything. In other words, was it a motivating factor?",
  "All right. Then your -­ that seems like a good resolution of this case to me. I don't know if it does to them.",
  "Well, then you can't agree with me, because my question was why would that be? You have two people, A and B; they are both supervisors. In the one case, B fires the employee because he's in the Army, and he says it: Ha, ha, that's why I'm doing it. In the second case, he fires the employee because he thought the employee was -- in one of Justice Sotomayor's hypotheticals or anyone else, he fires him for a perfectly good reason, but A has lied about it. And the reason A lied about it was because she wanted to tell him a lie so B would fire the employee, and her reason is because he's in the Army. Those two situations -- the second seems to me one of 80 -- 80 million situations, fact-related, that could arise, and I don't know why we want a special standard for such a situation. Why not just ask the overall question: Was this action an action that was -­ in which the bad motive was a motivating factor? Forget psychoanalysis of A; B is good enough; or vice versa. That was my question.",
  "Because together they dismissed the employee.",
  "One by supplying the false statement, the other by acting on it.",
  "They are both agents. That's why I made them both Burlington people. I wanted to get them in the group. They both have the same Burlington status, so we get that issue out of it. And together they fire this individual. In the absence of either the one or the other, he wouldn't have been fired.",
  "I feel I'm going to get nowhere pursuing this hypothetical further. So I will drop it and say -­",
  "-- answer it as you wish or as you understand it.",
  "Nothing in the agency that I can find says that the agency really wanted a mix of options. I mean, they said it's up to the manufacturer. But in Geier which I think all of this could be just avoided.",
  "And the agency would simply say, do they want to have this to be a maximum or just the minimum. It's so easy to say that, but I haven't found agencies saying it. I don't know why.",
  "We are forced to deal with the situation we have; and the situation we have in Geier is filled with indications that they really wanted a mix because of the unusual circumstances present there.",
  "You have to point to something here that shows that.",
  "It also said -- it did say as a practical thing, not -- not some theoretical legal thing. Who is most likely to know what 40,000 pages of agency record actually mean and say? People in the agency. And the second most likely is the SG's office, because they will have to go tell them.",
  "So if the government continuously says, this is what the agency means and the agency is telling them, yes, this is what it means, the chances are they will come to a better, correct conclusion than I will with my law clerks -­",
  "-- because I have a lot to do. All right.",
  "That's the practical. I'm sorry, but that is the practical idea that I think underlies what was said in Geier.",
  "No, but it did -- we are dealing with 1989 primarily.",
  "And in 1989, I think -- we are at least quoted on the other side -- what the agency said was, well, we see these lap and shoulder belts are actually more effective. Now, we are reluctant to recommend them for the center seat or aisle seat because people might get caught in the spools. On the other hand, manufacturers may be able to work out that problem. Therefore, we encourage the manufacturer to try to figure out a way around it. And the SG, looking at all that stuff, says, you see, they didn't mind if manufacturers were put under another legal obligation to do it, because they'd have no objection to making the manufacturers do it, they are just not certain yet.",
  "Now that's -- that's how I read what was said.",
  "They wrote: \"Of course, in those cases where manufacturers are able to design and install lap/shoulder belts at seating positions adjacent to aisleways without interfering with the aisleway's purpose of allowing access to more rearward seating positions, NHTSA encourages the manufacturers to do so.\" It doesn't sound like they are against a tort suit that would require you to do so, because, in principle at least, all of those things should be taken into account.",
  "Those arguments are what I think Justice Sotomayor was saying: It is a huge problem for manufacturers. It's called tort suits in different places and different juries and different States. But that is beyond the scope of this case. If the agency wants to displace those tort suits often, all they have to do is say that the purpose is something like you are saying and that they are intended to be displaced.",
  "It doesn't have to. That's why I am only making this comment, rather than in the form of this question that maybe I don't understand why they don't. It would make our job simpler.",
  "Then is it constitutional if we get a new system? Here's what the system will be: The taxpayers who are religious will be able to check a box, and the check that they send to the IRS -- it's a possible system -- what happens is that that check is cashed by an official, and the cash is given to the local priest to say prayers for the individual who contributed the money. And, in your view, there is no one who could challenge that?",
  "The difference is, of course, that in the one case it's a deduction, and in this case you're paying it 100 percent with money that would otherwise go into the coffer.",
  "I understand that. But I'm interested in, conceptually, does the Government think that there is no one who could challenge that?",
  "So, if you go back into history, it could have been the case that the -- as long as they were fair to every religion, the first Congress could have funded prayers throughout the nation in churches for anyone to go and pray, and that would not have violated the Establishment Clause, or if it had, nobody could have challenged it.",
  "Flast is gone; is that right? Flast is gone. There is no more -- nothing more to Flast, because it just happened that nobody had thought of this system at the time of Flast.",
  "If they had, they could have had -- what?",
  "Why?",
  "No, but you don't need be, because all you have to do to get around it is to create what we have here.",
  "Something that worried me in Zelman is this, and I might get your answer. Probably Arizona spends some billions of dollars on public schools, doesn't it? I don't know what the exact amount is.",
  "Well, let's take 30 or 40 percent of that and spend it through this program on religious schools. Imagine that happens. At that point, people might get into considerable discussion about what qualifies, when it doesn't qualify, whether it's a valid school, or is it just teaching religion, and what the rules and regulations are. How is Arizona dealing with this problem? By saying there are no regulations, by saying that we're not -- is there a system for dealing with the legitimacy and the circumstances under which a particular religion's schools qualify for this program? Who decides and how?",
  "Yes.",
  "And that must be a set of regulations and rules.",
  "And when do they teach the religious part of their program?",
  "I mean, when does a private school -- normally the schools -- I mean, I'm not an expert, but what you have to do to be a school is a very complex thing, and you have all kinds of requirements that eat up quite a lot of the day. And I just wonder how the religion part fits in. Has there turned out to be no problem? When do they -- do they teach religion at 6:00 in the morning? Does it matter if the person's qualified? How does the -- I once had a case on this in the First Circuit, and it came out to be surprisingly complex, and I just wondered how -- if there turned out to be any problem at all in Arizona in this area.",
  "See, can I ask you -­",
  "So you assume that it is a -- I see your argument there. Now, in Zelman, the holding, I would think -- which I was not in agreement with, but it's now law, that a government can have a -- a spending program. And what they did was the government spent money in the form of vouchers to be given to private individuals to use for such education as they wish, that met certain standards, including religious schools. So what's the difference between the program here and the one that was held constitutional in Zelman?",
  "But who here says to the parent, who is going to the school, what is your religion?",
  "In other words, the STO gives a scholarship only to Catholics -­",
  "-- to go to Catholic schools, only to Jews to go to Jewish schools?",
  "Well, suppose they change one rule, and the rule that the STOs had was this: They said we will give you tuition if you otherwise qualify for your child to go to the school that you wish to go to, and if you are Jewish or you are Protestant and you want to go to St. Joseph's Catholic School, that's absolutely fine; they won't keep you out, and vice versa. Now, in your opinion, that then would be constitutional?",
  "Yes? The answer is yes?",
  "So the only thing you're challenging is the rule that they will not -- the STOs will not give the scholarship to a Protestant to go to a Catholic school.",
  "How do we know they would -- that that's the rule?",
  "Ah. Ah, but that's -­",
  "But that's -- that's different. You were complaining about is they would -­ look, I'm Jewish; I want my child, let's say, to go to St. Joseph's; and -- so now, do I qualify or not? The only thing -­",
  "Your -- your complaint is only with the STOs that wouldn't let me send the child.",
  "We know that they exist because?",
  "Well, if you didn't -­",
  "Let's suppose you didn't.",
  "What's the problem with that? That is to say, suppose that the government gives its money to put CAT scans in hospitals. And it has certain beneficiaries, and one group of beneficiaries is the Association of Catholic Hospitals, another is the Association Of Jewish Hospitals, another is a set of totally secular hospitals. So it gives the tax credits to all three. Now, of course, the Catholic group is going to give it to Catholic hospitals and so forth. What's wrong with that?",
  "What they do is they have government money, just like you claim this is, and they say we are going to give it to some -- to umbrella organizations, like the Association of Catholics, Jewish, or secular hospitals, and we expect them to distribute it. And they will, of course, distribute it to those who are their members. And in some cases, their members are religious organizations, and in some cases, they're not. Now, what's the difference between that and what happens here, leaving the student out of it?",
  "The beneficiaries of the government -- Catholic hospital -- government CAT scan program will be Catholic hospitals, because they're the ones who belong to the Catholic hospital association. Money will also go to the secular hospital association, as it goes -- would go to a secular STO here. So I don't see that part. That's the last prong we're talking about.",
  "The government says -­ that's the difference -- the government says -- it does give the money away on a religiously neutral basis. It gives it to hospital associations. It turns out that some of those naturally are supposed to give it to their members, all of whom will be religiously affiliated.",
  "But in Flast -- I've looked at it again briefly, and it seemed to use that wonderfully precise word \"nexus.\"",
  "And you're quite right that in Flast that was the case. But why isn't it -- given that it's a nexus in Flast, what was in Flast, why isn't it also a nexus where you have this complicated system which is designed to make the ordinary taxpayer pay a little more in this kind of instance, where what you've done is directly subtract from the treasury $5,000 cash to turn over, in the view of the plaintiffs, to a purely forbidden religious purpose?",
  "Was that -- was that in that instance in Flast? Does Flast rule out the possibility -­",
  "You are talking about the first sale doctrine. The perfectly consistent rationale would be whether there is a first sale. So -- so 109, though it doesn't say it, but if you look at the history and title, there has to be a transfer. So in fact, if a British publisher with a British right given by an American author or publisher makes this, 109 doesn't apply -- I mean, 109 doesn't apply until there's a sale. Now, that makes -- you -- you haven't adopted that. Nobody -- I guess maybe one of the amicus briefs does, but I don't see why that isn't perfectly sensible and I find no authority against it.",
  "I know it is, but it -- the trouble with your position is it gets everybody, I think, going to be -- I mean, I don't know what all these contracts say. There are hundreds of thousands of them, if not millions. What I don't see is why you don't just say: The first sale doctrine has always meant there was a transfer or sale. It meant that in 1792, when I took Phil Arita's antitrust course, and he used to bring it up. You go back to the 18th century. It's always meant there has to be a sale or transfer. So why don't we just read 109 that way, and there you give meaning to everything, and there is just no problem? Now, I raise that not because -- I raise it because since there's only a few people really supporting this, there must be some problem with what I say. So what is it?",
  "Of course, if you say there has to be a first sale, there is no problem. You block that British manufacturer from sending his books to the United States, but you don't block the person to whom he sells it. Gives meaning to everything.",
  "I mean, no, I'm putting that to you, because since you haven't advocated it, I must be missing something, and I'm not an expert in copyright law. What am I missing?",
  "Oh, you mean you are talking about jobbers? Somebody goes and buys, and so they're -- and so then you lose, because if that's what we are supposed to follow, those excerpts in the legislative history, then it would mean that a person who buys from the British publisher cannot import into the United States because 109 doesn't apply.",
  "I have to say, I didn't even see it in the legislative history. I didn't think they made a big deal about jobbers. I like history here. Go back to 1792.",
  "I do read legislative history, but I didn't really find anything that said that they were worried about an American and a British publisher dividing rights, and they want them to do that. There is no problem with that, because there has never been a sale. So they divide the rights. And there isn't even a problem with -- with buyers from the British publisher, because a reasonable vertically imposed territorial agreement or other restriction on resale is lawful.",
  "And if it's reasonable, they don't even need copyright.",
  "If it isn't reasonable, why should they have it?",
  "That's all you -- yes, I just want you to respond.",
  "Here. But in Europe, I guess, they were lawful.",
  "I think -- I think it's always been true.",
  "My question really wasn't to argue with you. My question was: Where in the legislative history does it say that the point of 602 is to prevent a foreign publisher from selling copies to a distributor and then that distributor resells them to the United States? I'm not saying it doesn't; it's just that I didn't focus on those particular words directly.",
  "Oh. In other words, somebody wanted that. I understand the industry wanted it. But -- but I -- is there anything in there that suggests that this is what Congress wanted to do, members of Congress? Even I draw the line somewhere.",
  "And it can. It can exclude legitimate copies before there's a first sale.",
  "And the -- the -­ question is -- I mean, the text seems to say 602 expands or falls within 106. All right? So that's what it says. It says -- it says it's an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies. That's the 106 right.",
  "And then 109 is an exception from 106. So it's automatically an exception from 602.",
  "Now, that's the text. And therefore, you are back at what the meaning of 109 is, if I understand your argument. And it seems to me that's the choice. If you are going to take 109 literally, then everything that comes into the United States can't, without the permission of the copyright holder, but for the exception in (a)(3), and a library that brings them in under (a)(3) cannot even lend out the books. That's one choice. And the other choice is to say that \"lawfully made\" means it's made without contravening any provision of the Act, if the Act were applicable.",
  "What's a third choice? Maybe you want a third choice.",
  "That's why I started with the first sale doctrine, because if you apply the first sale doctrine as it traditionally has been applied and if you believe that 109 incorporates that, there is loads of room for 602(a)(1) to act. That's all the instances where the British publisher published -- makes the book. What they do is they have a license and they try to send it to the United States and they can't without permission because of 602(a)(1), and then 109 doesn't come into play because there's been no first sale. That's the part of this case that I'm finding the hardest, because, literally, 109(a) -- as you correctly point out, 109 doesn't say that literally.",
  "That's all right.",
  "There's a whole brief filed that traces the history of that language, and I think comes to a somewhat different conclusion. Do you want to say anything about that? It was on the other side.",
  "The other side, if you go to -- you go to -- go to Home Depot and buy a desk, and how do you know -- are you worried that maybe on this desk it says there was a restriction somewhere, you could only use it for homes and not for offices? Does that kind of thing worry you?",
  "And the reason it doesn't is because there is a first sale doctrine. Now, aren't you importing those very things that don't worry us about Home Depot into the entire world of books, everything you are talking about?",
  "I found the brief I was looking for which is the American Intellectual Property Law Association. And they trace this back to Professor Nimmer's 1965 letter, and they say that the point there was that they were reading Bobbs-Merrill as it was a pre-emption question, that they thought that the copyright law was not pre-empting State law of contract, and State law of contract had the exception in it which applied the first sale doctrine. Now if that's the reasoning, that reasoning would seem to me to apply. We could look up what the State law is, but my guess is that the first sale doctrine applies just as much to goods that come from abroad as to goods that are here at home.",
  "What Nimmer said is, he said we want to be sure in his -- in bill back in '64, '65 -- not to invalidate any State law contractual restriction on the right of the owner of the particular copy to dispose, exhibit, et cetera the same.",
  "Is it -- is it -- the -­ the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question -- I was uncertain. Suppose a student is working 45 hours a week in the grounds department cutting lawns, and he does -­ cutting the school lawn, and he earns enough money to help with his way through college. Now, I thought, under this, that he is not within this statute because it's 45 hours and not 40?",
  "All right.",
  "That it's not -- okay. So -- so, what they're doing is -- it started out with the word \"student\" and the word \"service performed\" in the statute. Then, for many, many years, they have talked about the employment, how it has to be an incident to the study. And \"incident\" is the key word. And so now what they've done is interpret their own word \"incident\" as saying if it bulks too large in comparison with the -- with the studying, it's not incident to the study; it's a separate thing. And that's true whether it happens to be medical school or it happens to be lawn mowing. They can't -- they don't want it as so big in comparison to the study that it's not really part of trying to get the study. It's just too big. And they use the 40 for that.",
  "All right. Now, if you're going to admit the word \"incident to,\" if you're saying they have the right to put the word \"incident to,\" why don't they have the right to define \"incident to\" in part in terms of 40 hours a week?",
  "No, no, it didn't as interpreted. You see, it's not -- it's that -- I concede everything you say: It's a total learning experience, and it's a special learning experience. The problem I was having that I wanted your answer to is that they have for many, many years said: Just because it's a pure learning experience and nothing but a pure learning experience, you still can't get this exemption unless the work is incident to that experience. And by \"incident\" we mean it can't bulk too large -­",
  "-- in respect to the whole. So the problem for you is not that it's not education.",
  "It's that the work is the education.",
  "I looked it up in the dictionary, and the meaning number 1 b of \"incident\" is: an accompanying minor occurrence or -- occurrence or condition. Minor. In other words, there's the big thing, and then there's the incident. Now, if that's the meaning, well, this says 40 is trying to get at whether it's minor or the whole -­",
  "Well, that's because -­",
  "-- of the second meaning here. It's very surprising, I found, first reading the statute in the last case, and now I'm reading the dictionary.",
  "And here what it says is -­",
  "It says: something arising or resulting from something else of greater or principal import. So they're trying to work out, with that word \"incident,\" is the studying of greater or principal import? And what they're saying is, when it's 40 hours a week, this other thing, the studying, is not of greater import.",
  "Rather, it's, let's say, of equal import.",
  "If you have to draw the line -­",
  "That in this case presents no -- no issue. I mean, the -- if their holding is that in the -- in your habeas hearing in State court, the evidence presented in State court at that hearing was sufficient and was required -- required that State court to find that you win on this issue, the State court in holding to the contrary is objectively unreasonable, then you win. And why are we all here?",
  "I mention it not because it wouldn't -­",
  "That's -- again, it would be helpful -- maybe you can't do this from the top of your head, but when I looked at the Ninth Circuit en banc decision, I found a long discussion on page 79 following by Chief Judge Kozinski in dissent, from which I got the impression that the majority was not saying: We think the State court decision here was unreasonable or violated clearly established law, based on the record before the State court on habeas, State habeas. Now, you've just told me in the 70-page opinion by Judge Smith, there's a paragraph or something that says: Even were all this issue out of it, the extra evidence, we still think that looking just at the evidence before the State court habeas, and just at their decision, we think in light of all these things you now are bringing up that that was a -- was an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, or at least was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts; in other words, satisfied (d). Where does it say that? That would save me a lot of time if you know that off the top of your head.",
  "Well, that's very good.",
  "Well, there you are, and I should have asked Justice Scalia beforehand.",
  "But what about -­",
  "Is -- I just want to be as clear as possible. Justice Scalia read the sentence on page 35. I read the heading from what Judge Kozinski says, \"Our review is limited to the record presented in the state habeas petitions.\" That's what he says. All right. Now, you told me that the sentence he read means the majority there says if our record is limited to the record -- our review is limited to the record presented in the State habeas petitions, you still win.",
  "Okay. But that's not what it said. It said exactly what Justice Scalia said it said, so -- which is talking about the evidence coming in under (e)(2) or something. Now, I see a nightmare in front of me where I have to go through hundreds or thousands of pages to try to figure out whether they did or didn't mean our review is limited to the record presented in the State habeas petition.",
  "And I can ask you, is that conceded on both sides?",
  "Is this right, then? First, for you to win, the first thing we have to say is we're going to look at page 35, and they say, we're looking at the State court record, the State courts were, in effect, unreasonable. We have to say that was wrong. We have to look through the evidence and say that was wrong. Then you're at first base.",
  "And to get home, we now have to look at the new evidence, and there it's some combination of (a) there was nothing to have a hearing about because there's nothing here that lets you have a hearing; or (b) there was something to have a hearing about because this was so new that it was a new claim, and you should have gone to the State court first on that one, but there's no room to do it. They don't let you do it. So, okay, judge in the Federal court, you have the hearing, and now, when you have the hearing, first see if there was the diligence. And there wasn't. That gets you home. That's the whole argument.",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "Well, then why isn't this a part of the thing, if you have a new claim here, go to the State first?",
  "I thought that Discover Bank is the California case that sets it out; is that correct?",
  "So that's California law. And what they say in Discover Bank is -- they are talking about class waivers in both arbitration contracts and not arbitration contracts. And they say they are void when it's a consumer contract of adhesion, when they predictably involve small amounts of damages, when it is claimed that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme deliberately to cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money, and the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party from responsibility for its own fraud. Now, seems to -- those seem to be the principles that apply. Those principles apply to litigation. They apply to arbitration. What's the problem? They don't say anything there about the things you mention. They just mention four things, which I just read.",
  "No. I would guess it's like Switzerland having a law saying, we only buy milk from cows who are in pastures higher than 9,000 feet. That discriminates against milk from the rest of the continent. But to say we want cows that have passed the tuberculin test doesn't. So I guess we have to look at the particular case. And here, my impression is -- correct me if I am wrong -- the class arbitration exists. It's not a -- it's not like having a jury trial. You could have it in arbitration. You can have it in litigation. So where is the 9,000-foot cow, or whatever it is? Where is the discrimination?",
  "Why, why, why?",
  "Why? That's I think what Justice Kagan is getting at. If a State wants to have a doctrine which says, you have to have a seal of a certain kind on certain kinds of contracts, they've never done it before, but now they do it, and on that kind you have to have a seal both on the arbitration contract and on the other. And here what they've done is they have listed the four characteristics from Discover Bank, and they've said all contracts to do with litigation have to satisfy those four. At which point I think Justice Kagan said, so what if they've never done this before? They sure have done it now. And what's the basis for saying that the Arbitration Act or any other part of Federal law forbids California from doing that?",
  "Your brother says that the --",
  "You have to -- you would do it differently, because they might be telling the truth. The example that your brother lawyer gave is this: That we have a State and the State says, if you have a contract, in the dispute resolution provision, whether you have arbitration or not, that provision is void if it says you won't have a judge, and it's void if it says you won't have a jury, and it's void if it says that you will not go to the United States courthouse for deciding all Federal claims. That applies whether there is an arbitration clause or not an arbitration clause. Now, that would seem to me no subterfuge. It is absolutely clear. They are not lying. It just happens to prevent arbitration. And he says that's absolutely true of this one, that once you get into class actions you will discover you have something that really looks like a court case. You have to have discovery, you have dozens of lawyers involved, you have depositions, you are running off every 5 minutes to the judge or to somebody to say is this deposition good, bad or indifferent. You have methods for enforcing the deposition. You have all kinds of things. He can make a much bigger list than me. So he says: This case is like the case of California saying everybody can decide it any way they want as long as they do it before a Federal judge. Okay? Now what's your answer to that?",
  "But what's your answer to his specific effort to assimilate the issue in this case, which is the class action, to the made-up issue, which you concede is a discrimination?",
  "What about -- what about a rule that says what you have to have in any contract is a rule that all the rules of the Federal Civil Procedure apply to discovery, not necessarily in a courtroom, but you have to follow exactly those procedures?",
  "Okay. Now, why isn't this obstacle preemption?",
  "Where do we look to find the answer? I mean, I understand your answer and I know the other side's going to say: Well, this is a tremendous obstacle. If I have one person to deal with, I say: You want your $75, I will offer you $75, and if you don't take it and I turn out to be wrong, I'm going to give you $7,500. That's their system. Right? So they say the alternative is class action. There are a million customers. I'm faced with a claim for $75 million. I can't afford that. I'll settle it, even if I'm right. So if you have your rule, I'm going to be facing these things all the time. I'm not -- I'm not going to enter into arbitration agreements. I will take my chances in court. Okay? Now, that -- that's their argument. So it is empirical, in part: What do I look to? It's not logic. It's a question of where should I -- what should I read to show, in your opinion, you're right?",
  "Haven't you just pushed all the difficult questions into the word \"generally applicable\"? I imagine a fuel tax applies to everybody in the State, but then we exempt everybody who does business in the State with fuel.",
  "Except for railroads.",
  "All right, now. You want to call that not a generally applicable class? Do you want to call it a discrimination against railroads? It seems to me about the same question.",
  "All right. So why isn't the easiest thing to say, since there's so many other questions involved in discrimination: Yes, the clause applies? What counts is a discrimination is an obviously difficult question, and we will send it back for somebody else to wrestle with this, since it's so difficult.",
  "What is the choice?",
  "I realize that, but what they are worried about is somebody that's having passed on the property level -­",
  "-- thinks I have a great revenue-raising idea. What we do is tax the New York Central, and then they sit down with a bunch of lawyers and the lawyers say: Oh, great, they come through this State; what we'll do is we'll have a tax that applies to all fuel and then we will exempt everybody except the New York Central. All right. Great. We've now found a replacement of the revenue that they just said in Congress we couldn't have in the first three provisions.",
  "No, because you're saying that's not generally applicable. They are saying sure it is, read the first line, applies to everybody. You say no, no, no. That's a trick because of the second line. So now what we will do is we'll monkey around with it a little bit. And we will make it tough. All I'm saying is that's precisely the same question in that context as whether it's discriminates or not. I'm not saying it's an easy question. I'm just saying it might be clearer if we said, yes, the thing applies, now go work out the hard question of whether you had have got a discriminatory tax.",
  "The property taxes, the language is different.",
  "You are assuming how the Court will decide the word \"discriminate.\"",
  "I understand what you are saying, and so would every other judge. And of course, it's hard to figure out in these contexts what is real discrimination, but there could be obvious cases. And so why cut out the obvious cases simply because it's hard in a non-obvious case to figure it out?",
  "There is no way -- there is no way with the property -- the property tax is tough. And once you start taking exemptions into account, it's double tough, and there is very little need, is there? Every State in the country has property taxes and every State in the country has property taxes on businesses.",
  "And -- and it might not be so that every State in the country has particular taxes on diesel fuel. And it might be that they don't have taxes on rails, or it might be that they -- you see? So, I -- I -- that's how I am explaining to myself. What do you think?",
  "No, but it's not quite, because this is the same problem I was raising. You just shoved the difficult questions into generally applicable. But you might think of some new ways of doing it that they don't want. So I would worry about giving you just the decision where the word in the statute is \"discriminate,\" and nowhere does it say \"generally applicable.\" I'd somewhat worry about whether this statute shoves the same problems into two words that aren't there as to rather leaving those problems for resolution under the one word that is there.",
  "I'll believe you, I'll believe you.",
  "The word -- the word I was looking at was is 4, impose another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier providing transportation, subject to the jurisdiction of the board under this part. Now, I read all the words of 4, and I found the word \"discriminates,\" and I did not find the two words \"generally applicable.\"",
  "Yes, but in all these years where they never challenged it, did all these other States not only tax their diesel fuel, but at the same time exempt the diesel fuel tax from all their competitors.",
  "What's the rationale, that the trucks don't have to say it but the railroads do?",
  "Well -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. Finish. Are you finished?",
  "I didn't quite follow this. As I understand it, on what -- say: On what remedy will there be if you're right? This is what I don't understand. A child is born abroad. One parent is American; the other is foreign. If the two are married, that child is American only if the father or the mother -- one or the other -- has lived in the United States for now at least 2 years. It used to be more. Okay? Now it's 5 years after the age of 16. Now suppose they are not married, and suppose the American is the father. Same rule. Now suppose they are not married and the American is the mother. Now it's not 5 years or 2 years; you only have to have lived here for one year. Suppose I agree with you. I just don't see any sense to that whatsoever. I can't figure it out. They made a mistake about the immigration laws. Suppose I agree with you. Then why isn't the remedy, say: Okay, whether it is the father or the mother, the general rule applies. They have to have lived in the United States for 5 years or for 2 years? Now 2 years.",
  "Some people were lucky, and they are already citizens under this, and there we are, because their mother lived in the United States for one year. Those already are citizens. Nobody is going to take that away. We are just looking at a statute. And in the first part of the statute, they have in section (g) of 1401, the first rule I told you about. In 1409(a), the second rule, and in 1409(c), the third rule. Okay. If you are right about this, and it's totally unfair and there is no good reason whatsoever for distinguishing on the basis of gender, we strike (g). Okay? Now, that would seem to be normal, but that isn't going to help your client. So how do you get to some other thing that instead of striking (g)? What we do is strike all of (a) and strike the whole thing before, and shove them all into (g), which isn't so easy to do with this language. How do you get there?",
  "Fine. So we strike (g). What I'm worried about is, you want me to strike (a) -­ sorry, we strike (c). And you want me to strike 1409(a) and 1401(g), and shove the people who are there into (g), which is a little tough to do in the English language. But I want to know how you get there.",
  "Now, there's another slight problem with that, I would think. Reading this carefully, which I hope I have done, it seems to me it may also discriminate against fathers. And that's because (c) says that the woman has to have been physically present for a continuous period of one year. I read at least one article that says that word, \"continuous,\" doesn't appear with the fathers, and that they really mean it. That is, if somebody is living down in Texas and they happen to go visit on Christmas their father, who is -- or their grandmother or cousin or something who is across the border for 5 minutes, that they cannot take advantage of this clause (c). Is that true?",
  "I will ask the (g) that, but if it is true -- if it is true, then -- then I would think that the fathers are really worse off. I don't know if that helps you. And maybe it could turn out that that's really a problem. If it is really a problem, then the fathers are worse off. Does that help you with the remedy?",
  "The question is: I'm looking for a way -- I'm trying to be helpful in my question. I'm looking for a way that you can get to your result. Now I'm not saying I would do it, but I just want to know what the best way is of getting to that result, where you shove everyone into (c) instead of just cutting (c).",
  "That would help you. Is there a reason for doing that?",
  "I understand that, but what you are doing is applying a lesser standard to gender discrimination than is ordinarily applied to gender I discrimination. Now, is there any reason to do that? think that was the thrust of the question.",
  "All right. Now fine.",
  "If it's the government's position you do, does the same thing apply to racial discrimination? Do you also apply a lesser standard to racial discrimination?",
  "This is suddenly is cutting a big hole in the Fourteenth Amendment.",
  "You have -- we have the briefs that are filled with, you know, pros and cons about the statelessness business and whether it was real, and I've read those and I would like your comment on those, but I want to comment, too, on this very -­ what may be a very minor thing, but I did notice, prodded by an article, I have to say, that -- that for the women there is a sense in which its tougher -­",
  "-- and that's because of the continuous period. Now, I guess it depends on how that is enforced, but there could be a class of people, say, living in the border, near Canada or near Mexico where they step across the border on Christmas day to say hello to my cousin, and -- and does that stop them from taking advantage of that? Is it -- in other words, how is this enforced? Is it enforced with that rigidity?",
  "Which means that you can't stop with across the border? You can't -­",
  "Is there -- is there -­ well, is there or isn't there, to your knowledge? Is this enforced with total rigidity or is it enforced that maybe you could go once a month or you could go on your birthday, or what is the answer?",
  "In that situation you cannot go across the border?",
  "All right. So, if it's tough then and really is meant to be tough, then there is a -- what is the rationale for treating women in this respect worse than treating men?",
  "The 1 year, I grant you, the time 1 year is treating them better than the time 5 years. But the word \"continuous,\" it's really tough is what your answer leads me to believe, and they really mean it. I mean, then that's treating them worse than treating the men. And I would like to know what is the rationale for treating them worse?",
  "Is there -- is there anything that rings a bell in this in your mind, of -- I mean, the thing that goes the other way is the right of an American citizen to pass his American citizenship on to his children. And when we talk about -- when we talk about Congress's power over naturalization, is there anything that's drawn a distinction between the general power, which are people who are not citizens to become citizens, but what it seems to me intuitively is a different situation, of the right to pass your citizenship on? Does that ring any bell at all?",
  "I'm not saying there is such a right. I just wonder if it rings any bell at all that this has ever been discussed in anything you've come across.",
  "All right. Just looking -­ in trying to get your memory -- well, does something come to mind the opposite way that -- where the Court did go into a long exegesis about the law, including constitutional law, and then says at the end, well, but you are not entitled to memory -- to a remedy because of some other -­",

  "And as to the second, he files a Rule 35 motion.",
  "And when does he file the Rule 35 motion? Because it says at any time.",
  "No, it doesn't say that. It says a court may correct an illegal sentence \"at any time.\" I'm talking -­",

  "I have -- I'm not -- don't take what I have as my view. I just want the fact. I'm asking you a fact. When -- how and when does the person correct the legal error in his sentence?",
  "Where?",
  "And if the trial court says no, what does he do?",
  "Fine. Okay. So now we have two appeals. One is from the judgment of conviction; another is from the judgment imposing the sentence. Now, the Federal statute says a 1-year period of limitation shall apply from the date on which the judgment became final. Correct?",
  "Okay. When is the date on which the judgment of the sentence became final?",
  "And if they are not appealing -- they are not -- they are not at the same time, then what?",
  "Why not the sentence?",
  "In April, they affirm the conviction. In June, they affirm the sentence. Do those 2 months -- does the date on which the judgment became final by conclusion of direct review, does that run from April or from June?",
  "June. Okay. Now, suppose he doesn't -- suppose that there were no appeal from the -- I see. Our problem is that there is no appeal from the judgment -- from the sentence where he asks for correction as a matter of mercy and not law.",
  "There may be?",
  "What I'm trying to figure out is why, if you're willing to call, for purposes of one -- the 1-year statute begins to run from the time the direct appeal becomes final. Why is it a direct appeal of a sentence where you appeal the matter of law and it isn't a direct appeal of a sentence where you ask for mercy? It's the same rule. It's the same procedure.",
  "This would help you just as much, I imagine. I'm just trying to get it straight in my mind.",
  "I know. You see, my basic question is: Why -- look, two appeals; one judgment, one sentence. Okay? January, June. You're prepared to say the 1-year statute does not begin to -- to run until June. Fine. The Rule 35 motion, when you took an appeal, became final for purposes of the Federal habeas statute in June. So why doesn't the Rule 35 motion become final under (1)(a) of the habeas statute, whenever that's decided finally? Why is it collateral at all? Why isn't it direct, just as your first one was direct?",
  "Wait a minute. Judgment of what? Judgment of conviction -­",
  "-- or judgment of sentence?",
  "That's not the same reason that it doesn't become final when you haven't appealed your sentence yet, or when they haven't -- they didn't consolidate. I am quite confused, as you see, as to how this all works in Rhode Island. I -- Rhode Island -- I used to be on the First Circuit. I know it has some special ways of doing things that are sometimes different, and this is different.",
  "There must be in Rhode Island some complaints about the sentence.",
  "Both.",
  "That's called \"it's illegal.\"",
  "So now it's illegal.",
  "And the odd thing is that -- that kind of appeal takes place either days or possibly weeks after the defendant may already have appealed his conviction to the higher court.",
  "Is that right?",
  "That normally happens?",
  "And what I'm curious about is what happens if the court affirms that sentence, let's say 2 months after it already affirmed the conviction?",
  "Which is the judgment pursuant to which -- which is the judgment that became final by conclusion of direct review?",
  "Why?",
  "The person is not being held in custody pursuant to a judgment of the State court, or at least a relevant judgment, until the sentence has been appealed. Then there's the conclusion of direct review in respect to the judgment in respect to which he is being held in custody. I'm just reading the statute -­",
  "-- the Federal statute.",
  "Exactly.",
  "And that's why I don't -­ that's why I am confused. I look at the language of the Federal statute and it seems to me that this individual is not being held in custody pursuant to a judgment until that sentence is final.",
  "And the sentence is final in the lower court, but they say when the sentence is final at the conclusion of direct review in respect to that sentence, which hasn't even taken place yet.",
  "Okay. Then you're going to say -­",
  "-- all appeals in Rhode Island from sentences -- all appeals on their lawfulness or their mercy take place under Rule 35, and all of them are collateral.",
  "I guess if the situation were such that a lawyer who is representing a client and has to figure out has there been too much delay or not, suppose he looked into the situation thoroughly and he said, gee, I just have no idea, because half the cases come out one way and half of them come out the other way. Could he then go to the California Supreme Court and say, Court, look what you have been doing? And would the court then grant a hearing on that and possibly correct it?",
  "All right. So you're saying there is no such evidence.",
  "That's what I suspected reading this. But if there were such evidence is there a route in California that they could deal with it?",
  "Yes.",
  "Adequacy of notice, because no notice might be an inadequate notice.",
  "And if it's absolutely divided 50/50, you have no notice. You don't know what will happen. And it isn't a rule to say, oh, this is our rule, you don't know what will happen.",
  "I agree with you, we are in hypothetical, never-never land so far. But it's possible your opponents will convince us it's real land and not never-never land.",
  "Well, that's a puzzle to me. I mean, Justice Scalia's question was courts all the time -- they -- you used see all the time they don't decide an issue of whether it's filed too late because it's the simplest thing just to decide the merits. It's the same result. And sometimes they don't do that. But that happens often in a district court on appeal and triple in a supreme court which has hundreds or thousands of questions for review. So how do we know that that simple practice, which I've never heard of as attacked as unconstitutional -- how do we know that that isn't what's going on?",
  "All right, but that's -­ they -- what's your point? Eight hundred are silent. What does that show?",
  "Why?",
  "Well, I mean, but then you can make any claim against him. I mean, what I wonder -- maybe this is where I'm leading -- the California Supreme Court is not the only court in California where people file for habeas petitions, is it?",
  "Yes. So why, if there's inconsistency in this rule, wouldn't somebody go look at the decisions of the appellate courts which write their reasons down, and then you would know whether it is being decided -- applied inconsistently or not inconsistently. Why look at a blank wall? Why not look at people who write opinions? And then you'll find out.",
  "No, of course not. But is your claim -- are you conceding, or are you conceding, are you denying, are you just saying nothing about whether the practice in this rule, applying the rule of substantial unexcused delay, disqualifies you for -­ that's the rule, isn't it?",
  "All right. Are you saying it is being applied consistently or inconsistently or you do not know -­",
  "-- in all courts below the California Supreme Court?",
  "So you don't know. So what you've come -- what you've done your research on are questions that cannot be answered due to the fact that a supreme court normally doesn't say why when it denies something, but you haven't looked into the research that is readily obtainable, which is these are courts that write opinions. Is that -- have I gotten that correctly?",
  "Because if that's correct -­",
  "All right. Then I don't see why you didn't because it would be so easy, if you're right, to show this from the lower courts, but of course if you're wrong, it wouldn't be easy, then a blank wall is better than nothing. Now, what can you say that will disabuse me of the notion that I just expressed?",
  "No, no. But some are -­ there's a thing called sampling techniques, and sampling techniques are designed to limit the burden. I'm not saying it wouldn't be burdensome, but you have examined thousands of cases. And so I'm back to my original question. And statisticians, many of whom would like to help you perhaps you could find some, could do this for you, I think.",
  "The wrong court. And amicus did it from the time that -- that the case was filed, while the rule is you start the period of running from the case it was reasonably -- the person should reasonably have known his issue, which isn't the same time as the time his case was decided against him. So, yes.",
  "That's true.",
  "But it's like having rules; when you have rules and say 60 days or 90 days, you find impossible cases that you should have heard because it was the 91st day or it was the 92nd day, and then you give the people equitable discretion to depart from it, and pretty soon you get litigation over that. I mean, there's no perfect system.",
  "Well, what about -- that's why I go back to the lower courts. If there really is a problem here, why wouldn't the bar look into how well this practice is working in the lower courts and find out, well, what is the practice? How do they use it? Do we want more flexibility? Do we want more definite rules? That's -- I agree that you put your finger on a problem, an important problem. I'm not at all certain that the one system is better or required or compulsory.",
  "The receiver said the best statement that seemed to me to summarize it. It's in his brief on page 9. He has about two paragraphs. And as you read that two paragraphs, it sounds as if overcrowding is a big, big cause of this problem, which is horrendous, which if you think it's accurately described in the mental case in the first page, two paragraphs -- now, if that's a fair description from the record, it's a horrendous problem.",
  "What the receiver says is overcrowding is a big cause of it. And then he says: I think we've discovered you actually can provide care, and certainly our plan and turnaround plan believes we can provide constitutional levels of care no matter what the population is. So then you look to the care and turnaround plan and it says spend $8 billion building more buildings. And then the legislature rejected it. Okay?",
  "Now, there we are. More time; what's supposed to happen?",
  "Yes, it was 2.31 or something like that.",
  "And did they approve the 2.3 -- is that in place, 2.35? Did they approve that?",
  "Okay. So he said: We need 8 -­",
  "We need 8, and they approved 2.35.",
  "And is there any evidence here that suggests that 2.35 is sufficient to cure the constitutional violation?",
  "So I take it from your answer the answer is no, there is no evidence.",
  "Well, what he says -- what the receiver says about the 2.35, that it is a significant step farther. It is certainly better than no construction at all. However, that is not equivalent to a conclusion that that current compromise will result in sustainable constitutional health care at current population density levels. That's what he said about it. So -- so we have his views, and I'm back to my question: What else is supposed to happen?",
  "Which was your question initially.",
  "What would I look at to find this? It's a big record. What I did was I -- it refers to on-line evidence, and I went and looked at the pictures, and the pictures are pretty horrendous to me. And I would say page 10 of the religious group's brief, for example, shows you one of them. And what they're saying is, it's -- it's obvious. Just look at it. You cannot have mental health facilities that will stop people from killing themselves and you cannot have medical facilities that will stop staph and tubercular infection in conditions like this. And then you look at them. Now, you've looked at them. I've looked at them. And what is the answer to that? There's nothing in here that -- the special master said $8 billion is the answer.",
  "And they haven't come close. So how can I -- or you if you were in my position -- what would you say in an opinion that says that these three judges who have 200 pages of findings -- what would you say to -- as an answer to what I just said?",
  "What specifically will happen? I mean, at the moment, you know, we could go through -- we have all these briefs. I mean, there are all these experts, all the reports. Everybody is saying you need to spend the money. And we have -- if you really want to cure the constitutional violation, we have the legislature rejecting 8 billion but 2, which -­ 2.35, and so -- and nothing, and a void, and give us more time. I mean, I read the newspaper. It doesn't seem to me California has been voting a lot of money for new programs. The -- the -- what is it -- what is it specifically that would happen that would cure this problem were we to say -- I mean, a big human rights problem -- what would we say -- what would happen if we were to say, no, this panel's wrong? What would happen that would cure the problem?",
  "A constitutional problem which the State itself admits -­",
  "-- is constitutional, a State with a governor who has said publicly that there's this tremendous safety and health problem in the prisons. What -- what would happen?",
  "What is -- what is the number? I mean, I -- I was puzzled by the same thing that Justice Sotomayor was. I read, on page 253 of the appendix, a conclusion where the district court said it is our conclusion that they can reduce this by how many people? What is it -- 30,000? It's a lot.",
  "Thirty-five thousand. That this could be done safely.",
  "Preceding page, whatever that was -- I have it -- it was 253.",
  "There are about six pages where they summarize evidence from all kinds of criminologists that say, for example, there are 17,000 technical parole violators that are being sent to prison who haven't committed additional crimes, and they could perhaps be released from some of the time that they're spending in prison. Then they go on to this good time, which would, I guess, lead to people who are 50 years old or 60 years old who have been in prison for 40 years would be released at age 55 instead of age 75. I guess there's some category there.",
  "Then they had several other things. Okay. Now, what are some facts about that?",
  "Is there any likelihood -­",
  "Is there any evidence on -- I -- I see their suggestions that the technical parole violators go elsewhere -­",
  "-- that the elderly and infirm prisoners -­",
  "-- some of them be released.",
  "The good time credits for older people would have effect, be increased, and also, halfway houses and other kinds of prison facilities which used to be called less -- less physically restrictive punishments, or taking the money you save and building new prisons. Okay, that seems to be the gamut. Is there any evidence, statistically or otherwise -- because it used to be that States did rely on halfway houses, that relied upon -- they relied upon certain camps -- prison camps -­",
  "-- for example, and some of them were pretty tough. And there were a whole range of what used to be called intermediate punishments.",
  "All right. Is there any statistical evidence on the part -- on the point that is -- that Justice Alito raised -­",
  "-- as to whether these did or did not result in higher crime rates?",
  "So far we're just discussing, I take it, whether under (1) the other side is entitled to their benefits even if they weren't hurt, on a contract theory.",
  "All right. But I thought we took the case to decide a different issue.",
  "And that is -- I'll assume you're right -- it should have come under (3). But I don't know if that's harmful, whether it was (3) or (1). And the question I thought we were to decide was, if you're under (3), say, where equity is at issue, now equity is at issue and the district court says: Here we have 27,000 people, and now here's how I'm going to go about this. I'm going to look at this provision mistake here, and the mistake it seems to me was likely to cause them harm. And once that's shown -- and they showed it, it's likely to cause it harm; we can't be sure, but it's likely -- then it's up to your client to refute case by case that these guys were not -- or women were not really harmed. Okay? Now, that seems very sensible to me. And -­ and if that's the issue we're going to decide, I'd like to hear you explain why that isn't sensible. It's an equitable matter. This is simply a way of going about it. What's wrong with that?",
  "I agree, but I don't understand -- I'm with you on this one so far.",
  "You're sounding to me as if you're saying there wasn't likely harm. Okay.",
  "Are you conceding that the standard that they used, that the standard was -- the question that you raised at the beginning, whether -­ whether the showing of likely harm is sufficient in the absence of a rebuttal?",
  "All right. That's what I want to hear: What's the argument against that standard?",
  "All right. And does \"likely harm\" capture that idea?",
  "Why not? Why not?",
  "That's the kind of harm they mean. What they mean -­",
  "-- by harm is they were hurt, brought about by reliance.",
  "You object to this decision saying the following: Of course, the lower court said likely harm is necessary. As we understand it, given the context of equity, what that means here is that there was reason to believe -- reason to believe -- it was probable that, or some words like that, that there would have been harm caused by reliance on the -- the misstatement.",
  "Maybe it wouldn't be too hard. They're -- they're joined as members of the class in light of a certain set of characteristics, and the judge would find that, other things being equal, individuals who have that set of characteristics which in this circumstance make them members of the class would be harmed in all likelihood, okay? Done. Now, it's up to -- it's up to the -- the defendant then to show that in a particular case this individual wasn't harmed.",
  "Why?",
  "Well, it depends on the facts. Maybe they have a union or -­",
  "Okay. Are you finished with that?",
  "If you're finished. As I understand what you have been saying and written, you I don't mean that the SPD, the summary, is a contract? mean, one thing would be to say it's a part of the plan and moreover it's a contract, so therefore we enforce it according to terms. That's one view. But if you took that view, you get into problems such as were mentioned. The employer would write 10,000 pages because he knows it's an enforceable contract. Nobody would understand it. You'd have to worry about the time when it was less favorable than the written document. So call it a plan if you want, as long as you don't mean it's an enforceable contract. Now, there's a provision that deals with it, saying just what you said in response to Justice Alito. And what I don't understand is why wouldn't that provision govern? I take it there's a provision, 1054(g)(1), that says a plan cannot reduce the rate of accrual of future benefits unless there's written notice in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant. So I would have thought, I read that, I get what you've said in your brief. The summary was inadequate. It wouldn't have been understood, and, therefore, according to this particular provision, those provisions in the plan that reduce benefits are void. So now we enforce the plan with the -- in the absence of those particular void provisions, and you get what you want. Now, I thought that makes a lot of sense to me, except I don't see that anywhere in this case.",
  "So there's some reason it doesn't seem to appear in the opinions. It doesn't appear in the briefs. It doesn't appear anywhere until you just mentioned it in response to Justice Alito, or seemed to.",
  "It is?",
  "(h). He's right, it's (h).",
  "I understand that. So suppose we can't reach that, which would seem to be the logical thing to govern this, but we can't, okay? Then we only have two choices. The first choice is (1)(b), which seems to -- you want to use that by treating the summary as a contract, or we go to (3), in which case we're under equity. Now, between those two, the first one gets all the problems that we just were talking about. The second one would seem to be you're free and clear as long as you show some kind of reliance and harm, and then we're back to what I thought we granted this for, which is why not say if harm is likely, then the burden shifts?",
  "What happens in a trust law where, let's say, there are 10 or 50,000 beneficiaries in a trust, and -- and the trustee has indeed made an error. And now they can recover money only if, only if there really has been harm. Now, how do the -- how does trust law work that out? This can't be the first time this ever arose in history. We have a big class, and -­",
  "Could they here have gone -- could they also have said to the company: Look, why are you doing this? If interest rates fall, we're going to lose money. But interest rates might rise, and if interest rates rise, you'll lose money. So we're risk-averse, so what we would like to do is just make sure we get the same pension that we would under Plan A, and then if there's more on Plan B, add it in, and we'll risk the fact that interest rates might have gone up.",
  "So they could -- they might have talked the company into it.",
  "But the SPD is written by the fiduciary.",
  "And the other is written by the -- by the person who is giving the money, the employer. So now you're saying that it's a contract, even though it wasn't written by the employer and even though it could differ in dozens of ways from the actual -- from the actual plan document. Sometimes they'd be favorable to the employee, sometimes they'd be unfavorable, sometimes they'd be different but neutral. So what's the judge supposed to do? Forget about the basic document and just enforce this thing written by the fiduciary?",
  "Well, I said that there can be conflicts, sometimes favorable to the employee, sometimes unfavorable, sometimes neutral. So what we have is a document that's, by the way, supposed to be short, but I guess if we took your view it wouldn't be short anymore. And -- and it -- it could differ in any one of three ways; and I could think of seven other ways. So -- and we'll find seven others. So, what -- how is a judge supposed to react? Is he supposed to say that this two-page document is the contract, is the contract, and there are all kinds of conflicts -- what's supposed to happen?",
  "That isn't my question. My question is: One, why should a document written by a different person, the fiduciary, govern over the actual plan? Second, what happens when you have a favorable conflict? What happens when you have an unfavorable conflict? What happens when you have a neutral conflict?",
  "How should it be worked out?",
  "I think the fact that this individual in this case happened to be the same group or person is beside the point of my question.",
  "Is that true of the certificate of insurance? Is a certificate of insurance a simple document that any consumer is able to understand or -- or is supposed to be?",
  "Is there an example I could look at? Find one, on line -­",
  "Does it control when it's less favorable?",
  "Oh. It only controls when it's more favorable, but not when it's less favorable.",
  "What theory of contract law gets you to that conclusion?",
  "(j).",
  "Yes, but I still have the same question Justice Scalia had, which is -- which is why didn't this (h) thing apply here, because they didn't have -- their claim, the notice wasn't good, and if the notice wasn't good, then -- the plan didn't change, and if the plan didn't change, they should have gotten the money. Why didn't it -- why?",
  "7 and 3 -­",
  "Why does that show that? I mean, why doesn't it show acceptance of Crooker?",
  "I mean, if that -- Crooker was -- was interpreting section 2 -­",
  "-- that was the interpretation. Everyone had followed it, every court. Nobody disagreed. All your four arguments Judge Edwards went into thoroughly. Everyone but Judge Wilkey approved it. And so Congress reads that, and they make it specific in 7, but they say nothing about 2.",
  "How do you know? What we have is 7(E) in front of us; 7(E) says we want to be sure something like Crooker's interpretation of 2 applies with law enforcement. It's simply a case -- so they apply it with law enforcement. Absolutely now it's guaranteed. Crooker is not guaranteed because it could be overturned. You never know what will happen. But what in that suggests they don't want Crooker to apply to the Fed for example, or to the Navy, or to -- which is here storing -- it's storing explosives. Why would -- I mean, I can't get anything one way or the other from the fact they passed 7.",
  "Why should I get one rather than the other? For every argument you make, I can see an argument the other side -- that they make.",
  "What's your answer to that? It was a question, really.",
  "Well, why do you want to know? How wide the corridors are in some Federal buildings, and terrorists could use that to bad purpose, but we want to give it to the firemen because they'll use it for a good purpose. We want the policemen to know, we want different civic groups sometimes to know, but we want to keep a limitation. We want it restricted, restricted to minimize the chance it will get into the wrong hands. I mean, I don't see anything illogical about that. What's -- what's illogical about that?",
  "Why?",
  "Well, that's a different argument.",
  "I mean, your four arguments seem to me to be the same arguments that Judge Edwards and the D.C. Circuit considered, and they are excellent arguments, and there are arguments on both sides, and then they considered it and came to a conclusion. But this is a different argument you're making here, and I was addressing that.",
  "I mean, it's only addressed for law enforcement. It's -- there are many dangerous or -- for example, this isn't law enforcement; this is munitions. The Navy thinks, rightly or wrongly, I guess you can -- that they don't want these maps circulated because they think it would make it easier to blow up the munitions. They want the firemen to have them, they want the civil defense workers to have them, but they don't want people who might blow them up to have them.",
  "Now, that's -- that's their reasoning. Now, that isn't addressed, it seems to me, in 7, because 7 deals with law enforcement.",
  "How is it -- how is it broader? I -- I looked for the words. I just missed them, and you can point them out. When I read about the circumvention, what Crooker says is: \"We hold that since the document for which disclosure is sought meets the test of 'predominant internality,' and since its disclosure significantly risks circumvention of federal statutes or regulations,\" it is exempt. It didn't say anything about circumvention because there is a regulated entity and it is that regulated entity that will circumvent. It just spoke of circumvention, as far as I saw. But maybe there's another place where it talks about regulated entity. Is there?",
  "Oh, that's -- but that -­ if we're looking at Crooker, I just read the words \"would there be circumvention\" -­",
  "-- and it seemed to me, in this case, the Navy has plans and they use those plans to store munitions safely, and the risk that they worry about is someone will get ahold of the plans and use the positions of those munitions in order to make them unsafe, for example, blowing them up. So that seemed like a very serious circumvention of what the regulation was there for.",
  "That's correct, and I didn't find anything in Crooker that said -- and I don't know why you'd have such a theory. I don't know what the point of the theory would be, that you would care whether blowing up took place by somebody who technically was regulated by the Navy or blowing up took place by some other person, whom they're worried about.",
  "What happens -- I'm just curious -- on -- if you classify -- suppose you have a document, \"in case of emergency, these are the evacuation procedures\" of a big Federal building. And now you want to show that to the firemen, but you don't want it to be in the newspaper. All right. And the firemen don't have classifications, and they aren't cleared.",
  "But I guess if -- in order to see it, they'd have to be cleared.",
  "How long does it take, approximately, roughly, to clear a fireman so that he could, in fact, see the evacuation manual from the Federal building?",
  "Can you give me a rough idea?",
  "All right. Thank you.",
  "Thank you. Right.",
  "If you couldn't go return to Congress and you had to classify documents falling into the category that you previously thought dealt with in Crooker, how long would that take? How many documents would you guess there were in the Federal Government? Millions? Thousands?",
  "That wasn't my question. My question did not concern those documents that were requested. It concerns the category of documents that might be requested -­",
  "-- which is every document that might be requested.",
  "And I wonder if it ranges in the millions, tens of millions, hundreds of thousands, 5,000, or if it -­",
  "I thought -- this I'm confused about. I would think you would have to have a State which has a law that permits the attorney general to sue the governor. Wouldn't you?",
  "I mean, if the State law is the attorney general can't sue the governor, that's the end of it, isn't it? Or is it -­",
  "No. Suppose the State law is the governor of the State cannot bring a lawsuit against the attorney general, and vice versa. Okay? That's the State law. Now, under those circumstances, can either bring a lawsuit on a Federal right in Federal court?",
  "No, but I want just a yes or no answer. In your opinion, can an attorney general, where the State law says, black letter law, attorney general can never sue the governor; he's fired instantly if he tries. That's the law in this State, okay? Now, can that individual come into Federal court and sue on an Ex parte Young theory suing the governor?",
  "He could?",
  "Well, I don't -- I think that is a problem, and is that -­",
  "-- what we're saying here?",
  "But my -- excuse me -- I thought -­",
  "Suppose I'm right about this and you can't do it. You can't. You can't -- the Federal Government cannot tell a State how to organize itself. If it wants to have an attorney general that can never bring a lawsuit, that's up to the State, unless it's a due process problem. Now, suppose I believe that. Now, do you lose this case?",
  "Suing in his capacity as attorney general and under his -- that's the plaintiff, not the defendant. And he has no right to bring that suit, because -- it's not that he doesn't have a right; it's that he doesn't have authority. He's not a person that can do this kind of thing -­",
  "Yes, right. Exactly.",
  "That's your position.",
  "I'm with Justice Scalia on this. Well, I'll pass to the other side.",
  "Suppose you have a State which loves litigation.",
  "Forty-eight percent of the population are retired lawyers.",
  "Nothing pleases them more than to have everybody suing everybody else. So they pass a statute which says, for purposes of lawsuits in this State, every department can sue every other department. Now, if you have such a State, what in the Constitution stops the Federal Government from abiding by that rule and applying ordinary Ex parte Young rules, looking at the defendant, looking at horizon, and then, if the plaintiff happens to be a Federal agency suing another, say, well, if it complies with those first set, the fact that A sues B and they're both State agencies, that's the State's decision. What in the Constitution can prevent the State from deciding to organize what we'll call the legal heaven way?",
  "Okay. That's A. We can go into A later because I agree that would be an answer, if it's correct -- I mean, if that is what happened. That's a different question, whether Congress could restructure the State. That's a serious question. But my question was on the first. Can Congress stop the State from restructuring itself?",
  "If they wrote it down specifically in the law and said we'd love to have our agencies sue each other. They don't say Federal court. They just say we love to have our agencies sue each other. They don't mention the court.",
  "Why? What's undignified about allowing the State -­",
  "-- to live with the choice it made?",
  "No. The hypothetical was just -- Justice Sotomayor is totally right. I'm talking about Ex parte Young.",
  "I'm imagining -- I'm imagining a system where the State wants to let the AG, this organization, the sheriff of Middlesex County, the City of San Francisco -- they want to permit such entities to become plaintiffs against other parts of the State government in such a State if ordinary Ex parte Young requirements are met. What in the Constitution of the United States prohibits that suit from going ahead?",
  "It isn't that Ex parte Young, if I understand this right, which is why I mention it -- it isn't that Ex parte Young permits one part of a State to sue another part; it is a State permits one part of a State to sue another part, that that's common in the State, that the law requires it. And the question is, in that circumstance, should the Ex parte Young situation be treated differently?",
  "Am I right about the statement of the question in the case?",
  "In your experience -- this would be helpful -- would you characterize as common or uncommon situations where State agencies are given authority to sue other parts of the State? As I think it to myself, I think, well, City of Glendale v. State Water Authority, or Middlesex County Sheriff v. The Bureau of Prisons. That doesn't sound weird to me. It sounds as if there probably are a lot of such circumstances, but I don't know. What -- what do you think?",
  "Cities -- cities against -­ they must do that a lot.",
  "University of Massachusetts v. State Environmental Organization. Does that -- does that kind of suit sound familiar to you or -- or not?",
  "Right. Now, explain -­ this is good because that's very helpful to me -- the exact statement that Justice Scalia made, and you said yes, that's exactly right. And then it is the case that a citizen of the State could come into Federal court and sue the State official under Ex parte Young, but you say -- but the agency of the State can't do it, even though they have State litigating authority. And the reason that the latter is more injurious of the dignity interests of the State than the former is -­",
  "Have you found any case -­ are there a lot, a few, none -- where one State agency at a State level sues another in Federal court, period? Say they have \"arising under\" jurisdiction.",
  "Well, are there any?",
  "None?",
  "See, nagging at me is some kind of Article III problem.",
  "And maybe there is none. I don't know. It's -- there are none, though? None?",
  "No, no. It wouldn't have to. All -- they could get into all kinds of arguments about EPA and all kinds of Federal rights with each other. I would think.",
  "Yes.",
  "Are we supposed to still pay some attention to what we think Congress would have intended?",
  "All right. And if the answer is \"certainly,\" how likely do you think it is that Congress would have intended its statutes, in an ordinary case where two big businesses are suing each other and they've already had a day in court and now one of them wants to appeal and Congress writes in, if you miss the deadline, you can have it extended through excusable neglect, and you can even have it extended much later if nobody got a notice. That's with two big businesses. But if you have someone who served his country and was wounded and has post-traumatic stress syndrome or schizophrenia, to that person you say -- who has never had a day in court -- if you don't meet the deadline, you are out, no matter how excusable it is. How -- who in Congress would have likely thought such a thing?",
  "What is the relevance of that, if the veterans win? I mean, perhaps they are entitled to win. Is the idea that you would cut off their right to appeal because you are afraid they'd win?",
  "What do you mean, \"right\"? I thought within -- first of all, a donut costs a dollar, so I don't see much appeal there.",
  "But -- but don't we, throughout the statute books, try to work out from context, language, and objective purpose what a reasonable member of Congress would have intended, whether they thought about it or whether they didn't think about it, which would require X-rays into the brain that have not yet been invented?",
  "But Bowles itself made -­ made a major point, which I thought was relevant. Though I didn't join it, I thought it was relevant. And that is we look at the statute, if you are looking at the statute, and notice that there are exceptions written into it. And the fact that there are exceptions written into it lends some support to the notion that we, as a court, should not read other exceptions into it that weren't mentioned. Now, that's something the Court seemed to emphasize. And here, when I looked at this statute, I noticed there are no exceptions written into it. And, therefore, following Bowles rather than rejecting Bowles, it would seem that Bowles would support the reading of this statute to allow courts to read into it, because they don't mention anything themselves.",
  "That's the main thing. Leaving that out for a second, if you -- if you thought there can't be a rule that governs all of the thousands of different -- or many different statutes, you should look at the context. So sometimes you will see that Congress, given the context, probably did want to give the court some leeway to make exceptions -- where, for example, it's no fault of the litigant -- and in other instances, they didn't. Now, you've listed -- and Bowles, I thought, left that open. But -- but if it does leave it open, and I'm looking to those factors, you've mentioned one: That this is a long period of time, 120 days. You're right about that. Is there anything else?",
  "And what they found, one thing in the text, was that there were exceptions written in. That cuts against you. One thing cuts for you; that's the length of time. Is there anything else that cuts for you? I just want to be sure I have all of the factors that you're weighing.",
  "What is supposed to happen -- and I've probably seen this on page 16 of the Federal Circuit Bar's amicus brief. They list about 30 or 40 cases where the veteran perhaps wasn't represented and maybe had some stress syndrome, whatever it is. He just filed the paper in the wrong court, and the -- or the wrong agency, and that agency didn't get around to returning it to him in time so he could have met this deadline. What, in your opinion, is supposed to happen in those circumstances? Just say too bad, you're out of luck; there we are, you got the wrong address; no recovery?",
  "Well, in all these cases, actually, that they've raised in the brief, the veteran does get his appeal.",
  "So they could do it again.",
  "That's good.",
  "These people in footnote 3, did they get their appeal or didn't they?",
  "They did not?",
  "Okay. There's a problem.",
  "And so if we're in a void and the language doesn't have the exceptions -- and I think you can distinguish it from these other cases, and you have older cases that says unless Congress is clear, read it as non-jurisdictional, and nobody could say it was inequitable -- or rather to the contrary, nobody could say it was equitable to follow your position here, why isn't there a simple remedy? We take the opposite position?",
  "Except that for purposes of this, it governs. I'm just looking at the parts of it that did, in fact, make clear the special nature of the particular provision at issue in that case.",
  "All these agency matters are matters where there has never been judicial input. This is review of an agency action. The agency takes an action. No judge has looked at this. And the first time that you look at the rulemaking by the agency under the Hobbs Act, I guess, is when you go file it in the -­ in the court. So if a -- if a ruling against you here were to encompass a ruling under most review of agency action, would that be such a terribly unworkable thing?",
  "Cases -- what was the other case that you said decades -- what is an example of a case where a person, for an incredible, equitable strong reason, such as the wind blew his paper -- I don't know -- some tremendously equitable, strong reason he wants review of an agency action -­",
  "Yes. Right. The dog ate the court, and the -- the -- there is a case which says there is no extension of a -- of a deadline to file for review of an agency action, no matter how equitable your case? Which is our -- which is the Supreme Court case that holds that? I -- I am not familiar with it.",
  "Well, I'm only talking about agency actions, judicial review of agency action.",
  "Well, I know the rule, but I'm just saying -­",
  "I know the rule. I'm saying what's the case? Stone -- I understand you can make a case of Stone. Is there another?",
  "Is there a guideline that says that there cannot be a departure for rehabilitation after an initial sentencing that's set aside?",
  "No. So there's no guideline. So as far as the answer to Justice Ginsburg -- what I thought was her question, that is -­ the guidelines initially said that the Commission has the power to limit departures -­",
  "-- but it doesn't do it, except for race and gender -­",
  "-- and age. That's right. So under the guidelines, a judge can depart for any reason except those few forbidden things, which I think are properly forbidden.",
  "Yes. Yes. And -­",
  "And -- and that's still the law. That's still the law.",
  "And so it's -- it's the circuits that have made this thing up.",
  "Well, what would the source of law be to make up such a thing? I mean, what is the source -­",
  "What law gives the right to the -- to -- a -- a circuit, to make that up, would have to say it was an unreasonable thing to do. Now, I guess you could have an argument either way on that, but it doesn't strike me off the bat as unreasonable, where a person has rehabilitated himself, to take that into account.",
  "And we would have the power to say that.",
  "I wasn't going to bring that up.",
  "No -­",
  "Wait. Which guideline? What guideline prohibits that?",
  "Why?",
  "Why? Because the -- look, the -- that is not this case. This case, they never had a chance to consider whether Booker applies or not, so this is, I think, a special case. But think of 3742(g) in general. It's pretty easy to read that section as applied to instances where a judge, the initial sentencing judge, has decided on his own volition to apply the guidelines rather than not to apply them. Now, in such a case, he sentences the individual. There's then an appeal, and the appeal he's reversed on. What in the Constitution says there has to be a second chance to decide whether the guidelines or something else should apply? What in Apprendi says that? What in any of these cases says that? This is an Apprendi problem. As you know, I've dissented throughout; I think this is bad policy, but -- I've disagreed with everything, but forget that fact, important though it is.",
  "But the -- the thing that's worrying me about -- and I don't think -- I agree with you on policy, but what I'm -- what I'm having trouble with is: Is it better under the law to say yes, we can interpret 3742(g) so it can be constitutional, and then if in some cases it violates Apprendi, let the court say that in this case it violates Apprendi. But it just isn't clear to me, which is why I left it alone the first time. It's not clear. So -­ so -- as to when it is, when it isn't constitutional. You got my whole question there?",
  "And I'd appreciate as much answer as you can give me.",
  "You think that violates Apprendi?",
  "The answer to this case is, I don't think, too hard. You say it's at least questionable enough, 42(g) you could say, at least questionable enough that it's the same box as the ones that were excised.",
  "And then there has not been focus in the district court on what the district court would want to do, assuming he is free to apply the guidelines or not, on the remand decision that that judge has never made.",
  "Is that right?",
  "They didn't say -- forget that argument. What I was about -­",
  "I do have another point I'd like to get out, as long as I have this opportunity. It seems to me there's a considerable confusion, perhaps, only from my point of view, but this word \"variance\" -- I mean, why is it felt necessary to use the word \"variance\"? If it's true -- and it's not totally true, but if it's true the judge -- you can apply the guideline, apply it. Now, the guidelines themselves gives you the right to depart in every single case but, for example, a handful of factors such as race, where you really shouldn't change the thing just because of race. So what is the need for the variance? Now, maybe this 5K9-point whatever that is -- maybe there are a handful where there is a need, and maybe this is an example of it. But are there a lot, many, what -- can you just talk a little bit about it?",
  "It's just a policy statement. Does it enjoy the same status of law?",
  "Oh, I get it.",
  "But all those -- what you'd tend to do is take the parts that refer to the other statute and say they don't do anything. And does that ruin the provision it's in? The answer, I think, normally ws no, it doesn't ruin it at all. It makes sense. But this one is a tough one. I grant you that this one is a tough one. And my problem of course is I can think of a constitutional way of applying this, but it's a little far-fetched. And the far-fetched one makes me think that it's unconstitutional in the far-fetched nature of it, and I don't think it has a spillover.",
  "You see, the far-fetched one was the one that was brought out. I mean, not far-fetched. To -- to say in those circumstances that it is constitutional, where they're going to apply a new guideline and they don't have the evidence -- as much as I dissented in Apprendi, I think that one probably does violate Apprendi.",
  "And I think I have to stick up for that, don't I?",
  "They can check a box. They can check a box and the -- unless they're going to depart. Now, the part that's not necessary -- you could deal with later, but the part that's confusing me is where this word \"variance\" comes into, because I think the word \"departure\" would normally -- normally -- cover the matter. And then when it gets to the court of appeals, the court of appeals, whether they're inside the guideline or outside the guideline and have departed, reviews the matter for -- you know, inside and have departed or outside, those situations. It says in Booker the standard is to review for reasonableness. But where does this variance business come in?",
  "But the problem, to be very specific, is I think the following: The first sentencing, the judge applies the guideline. He says: There was $300,000 stolen from the bank. I look it up over here and I get sentence X. On appeal, the appellate court says: You should have counted the securities as money taken. So it's 1,300,000. So go and apply guideline Y. He goes back, looks at Y -- it's a very high number -- and thinks: Given certain circumstances which make this case unusual, I want to depart downward. Now, I would have thought that the judge's behavior in that second instance would have violated Apprendi, because that judge was either going to sentence even without the departure on the basis of his having taken some securities worth a million dollars which was not a fact that went to the jury. So there it is. Or he'd have to throw aside the guideline. But this statute says you can't throw aside the guidelines, and you can't depart for a reason that wasn't previously given. So this statute is -- is forcing him to sentence on the basis of a fact that was not found by a jury. I think that's the argument for saying it violates Apprendi. And I -- I don't see why it doesn't.",
  "But why can't -­",
  "Why can't they get -- the first question, to go back, is just a confusion in my mind: Why couldn't she bring this suit? And she says: I was discriminated against because they did A, B, C, D to him, and the remedy is cure the way in which I was discriminated against. And to cure that way, you would have to make the man whole in respect to those elements that we're discriminating against her. Do you give him back pay? Do you restore him? You do everything you would normally have to do, because otherwise she is suffering the kind of injury, though it was to him, that amounts to discrimination for opposing a practice. What's wrong with that theory?",
  "Why? Why?",
  "So what? She's hurt. Suppose it was a child that they -- what they -- or suppose they robbed -- they robbed the -- the judge's wife in order to get him to do something? And -- and that's a crime, and suppose there was a civil statute. The judge says: The way you cure what you did to get me to do something is you make me whole. And in that instance, it requires making her whole. What's the Article III problem? Well, anyway -­",
  "I don't know that this is crucial, but I'm -- I'm -- I'm just saying -­",
  "But that's because the award of money to be paid for somebody else, their absence of money didn't hurt you, but where there -- for example, if you're a trustee, you certainly can sue to get the beneficiary put back. There are dozens of cases where you can sue to get somebody else paid back money, and -- and why isn't this one of them? But anyway, I'm not -- I don't want to pursue it beyond a quick answer, because there are other things in this case.",
  "But you couldn't win on that under Burlington. I mean, I think that there are three separate issues here that have to be kept straight. No one can win in court unless they show there was a human being -- in this case, the woman -­ who suffered material -- who suffered serious harm, serious harm. And serious harm is defined as materially adverse action which might well have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. So unless she suffered that kind of serious harm, nobody wins. Then the next question is suppose, in the course of that, somebody else was hurt. And the person aggrieved provision suggests, because of the history of the word \"aggrieved,\" that more than just she can bring the lawsuit. That's our first question. And then our third question is, if the second question is yes, why can't the whole world do it? At least the barber who doesn't get the haircut anymore because the person fired doesn't have any money or the landlord who can't get his rent or the -- you know, we can go on indefinitely. Okay?",
  "So why don't we get to the second question? The second question is -- the word \"aggrieved\" has a history. I think it comes out of -­ what's the case? It's -- I think it comes out of FCC v. Sanders Brothers, which is a 1940 case, which said that sometimes where there's a statute using the word \"person aggrieved,\" that that means that a person can bring a lawsuit even though that person does not suffer injury of the type that the statute was meant to prevent against.",
  "That was picked up by the APA.",
  "It says \"person aggrieved.\"",
  "So we have a statute that says \"person aggrieved.\" Maybe it means it in a different sense, or maybe it means it in the APA sense, Sanders Brothers sense, which means, in principle, this plaintiff can sue. Now, you can argue against that if you want, but, I mean, that's where I'm starting from. And then we can have the third part, which is: Is there a way of limiting this?",
  "You don't have to. I'm -­ just a question.",
  "Quite a long question.",
  "No, you don't -­",
  "-- but it would be pretty hard to do that, because it's in black and white here.",
  "Now, that's -- that's why this is -- see, what Sanders Brothers did is the interest to be protected against had nothing to do with protecting competitors from competition. The Court says that. And it says: But here is a competitor trying to protect himself from competition; can he bring a suit? Well, normally not. But Congress used the word \"person aggrieved\" or \"adversely affected,\" and, therefore, they can. Now, that's the precedent that -- that -- that's harmful to you. I'm not certain. What about the third part? I have a suggestion, and I'd like your response, because I'm just playing with the thought: That the way to limit this is to say that where a person is being used, person B is hurt because -- in order to retaliate against person A, okay? That that is a person aggrieved where person B is being -- is hurt. The injury, the injury to B, not to A, is the means of hurting A. But where it is a consequence of hurting A, that doesn't fall within the statute. That gets rid of the bowling alley, it gets rid of the landlord, it gets rid of the shareholder, it gets rid of all the people who -- who are not the person retaliated against, but they suffer injury because he was retaliated against. It keeps the people who are being used as a means. They can bring the lawsuit.",
  "If, in fact, you set in motion hurting Mrs. Smith, the child, the wife, even the coworker, though that would be hard to get past Burlington, if you do that in order to hurt A, to retaliate against A, B can bring the suit. But if B is a person who is injured only because you retaliated A, that really wasn't the means, B can't bring a suit.",
  "That is the problem with my theory.",
  "But there are -- I do -- I think that it isn't so hard to find, in some of the sources that Justice Ginsburg mentioned and others, instances where the only kinds of suits that have been allowed are where it was like a family member or was being used as a means, and there never have been cases where they allowed somebody who was just suffering consequent injury. So it's quite possible I can be borne out, though I think your criticism is a pretty good one.",
  "I'm not sure why the employer's intent comes into this. A is the person who is being retaliated against, and the issue would be: Did the employer take such action against B as the A would think, quite reasonably -- he'd have to reasonably think that the action that the employer took was retaliation, was meant to be -- whatever those words were -- was -- might well have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.",
  "Well, you'd have to show he had a retaliatory intent, that's true, but that's true however he retaliates.",
  "What -- what happens if the president of the oil company, knowing that the statement is false, says: We have discovered 42 trillion barrels of oil in Yucatan. He writes it on a piece of paper; he gives it to the board of trustees; they think it's true and they issue it. Joe Smith buys stock and later loses money. Can Joe Smith sue the president of Yucatan, of the oil company, for having made an untrue statement of material fact?",
  "What he is, is he didn't issue it. What he did was he gave it to the board of trustees, who issued it.",
  "He's the president of the company.",
  "No, no. I'm asking what happens. Is there recovery?",
  "He is running the business, the daily affairs, of the company. Of course, the president of a company is an authorized agent of the company, and so, yes.",
  "Now, if he's subject to liability, why isn't your firm -- your client, subject to liability, who, after all, run every affair of the fund?",
  "Yes, that's what a president does. The president of a company manages the company.",
  "And if the president is liable, why isn't the group of people who do everything for the company -­",
  "-- why aren't they liable?",
  "No, you have to explain it to me more. I'm not being difficult. I understand this less well than you think I do -­",
  "-- and I want to know. That's an obvious, naive question, and I'd like an answer that anyone could understand.",
  "I get it. In other words, you're saying, on the papers here, it's -- it's the trustees that manage everything.",
  "That govern everything, and these are like helpers?",
  "They do a lot as helpers. Now, let me suggest to you, if that's one possible distinction, what about this distinction: That the managers of a fund, even though they are outsourced people brought in, are liable as principals, not aiders or abettors, if -- following criminal law here -- if -­ they are principals if they get the false statement to the public through a conduit, the conduit being an entity or person that is unaware of the falsity of the statement. That's LaFave on criminal law. What is -­ what about that?",
  "What is it that -- I'm unclear on this. That's why I use the oil company example. Plain, ordinary -- the top executives in the oil company write the false statement. They give it to a board that doesn't know it's false, and the board puts it out in its name. Now, it seems to me it ought to be clear at this point in securities law whether those -- the president and vice president are or are not liable under this 10-b, the (B) part.",
  "And they are liable.",
  "You're saying they are liable?",
  "All right. Then their response to that is: This is not like the president of the oil company, and the reason that it's not is something to do with the nature of the -- the obligation that runs between the managers and the fund, which is somehow different between -- you understand it better than I. Can you say what it is and what you think your response is?",
  "All right. So you're saying -- you're saying it shouldn't matter that if they issued -- it's worse if they run the whole company than if they're just the president?",
  "All right. Now, at that point, we get into a problem, and the problem is how do we distinguish an aider or abettor from a principal?",
  "At that point, I am uncertain indeed, and that's why I put out this for comment, this suggestion that you follow criminal law here and say at least they're a principal if they have a high position, they participate in it, they do all these things you say, and the entity that they're fooling in the first instance is simply a conduit, and, therefore, you cannot say it's a scheme, because this other part of the scheme wasn't part of it.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "What's the difference between substantial assistance and -- and doing it?",
  "There's a distinction. You want to say what the distinction is. So I would -­ consistent with the view there is no aiding and abetting liability, you still would win your case.",
  "He may just be some poor associate, his first day at work. The law firm sent him over there, and there he got stuck down in the boiler room. And somebody said why don't you write something that will get everybody to sell things, and -- and why don't you say we're a thousand tons of oil instead of only a ton? There he is. He writes it out. You think he's liable?",
  "No, no, he knows. He knows.",
  "At some level he knows: I shouldn't be saying they found a thousand tons of oil when they only found 50. Okay? And four people told him to go do something like that, but he's the guy who wrote it. I'd say he didn't behave well, but I don't think he's the principal.",
  "They didn't say what words to write.",
  "They gave him the general idea, and then he did it. He created the words, to use your phrase. When you say \"creating the words,\" he's a great writer.",
  "Ah, now we have \"sufficiently involved.\" Once we're into sufficiently involved, we're back into what is sufficient to make the person the principal rather than the aider and the abettor, and apparently creating or writing the statement is not clear whether it is or is not sufficient. So we're back into the problem.",
  "I'm interested in your test. I'm interested in your test, not the -­",
  "Actually, there is. I mean, it seemed to me when I read this, it sounded a little familiar, and I think whoever wrote it in Arizona copied it out of the Administrative Procedure Act. I mean, you read the definition of \"license\" in the Administrative Procedure Act -­",
  "-- and this is awfully close.",
  "That's right. It might have meant something different; Congress might have. But what is, then -- I read the SEIU brief. I thought that was pretty interesting. Is that something you adopt as what the Congress did mean? I mean, what do you think Congress did mean, and what evidence is there -- if it didn't mean the APA definition, what evidence is there for that?",
  "The main -- the main anomaly seemed to me to be this, that in the Federal Act, as -- that was the first point that the Chamber made, that it's a fairly careful balance. There are a group of people in Arizona, they may look as if they come from Mexico or speak with an Hispanic accent, and you're not certain whether they in fact are illegals or that they're legal. Now, think of that category. Congress has passed a statute that gives the employer just as much incentive to verify, so there's no discrimination, as to dismiss, so there's no illegal hiring. It's absolutely balanced. A $1,000 fine for the one, a $1,000 fine for the other. So Arizona comes along and says: I'll tell you what, if you discriminate, you know what happens to you? Nothing. But if you hire an illegal immigrant, your business is dead. That's just one thing they do. Now, how can you reconcile that intent to prevent discrimination against people because of their appearance or accent -­ how do you reconcile that with Arizona's law? If you're a businessman, every incentive under that law is to call close questions against hiring this person. Under the Federal law, every incentive is to look at it carefully.",
  "Is the I-9 -- I do have a question on the I-9. I'm not certain. I thought under Federal law that if the employee -- the employer isn't certain, but the employee says here's my Social Security card, here's the driver's license. The employer looks at that, he's home free; is that right? But under Federal -- under your law, under Arizona law, he's not home free, and, moreover -­ because he -- it may -- he's not home free. He still could be prosecuted. Is that right or not?",
  "So if he shows the driver's license -- under -- under Arizona law, if the -- if he shows a driver's license and Social Security card, the worker, the employer looks at it, the employer cannot be prosecuted?",
  "Yes or no?",
  "All right. So -- I thought in reading it that it creates some kind of presumption, but he is not home free?",
  "But under Federal law he is home free.",
  "So then he's home free? Look, I don't -- I'm trying to understand. Maybe it's not enough time to explain it, but I thought Federal law requires this E-9 business or whatever that E review is. And I was worried about the E review which it seemed to require because it seemed to me in 20 percent of the cases where the notice is this guy is not authorized; we don't have any record that he's authorized to work -- 20 percent of those are wrong, and he is authorized to work. So the employer who follows that is really going to fire 20 percent of the people who will be absolutely entitled to work. And so I'd just like you to address those points, as you wish.",
  "If they fail to do it, then they cannot receive any, quote, \"grant, loan, or performance-based incentive,\" end quote, from the State. That's what the law says, isn't it?",
  "All right. I would think then the answer to Justice Scalia's question is, yes, there is that penalty. It isn't simply hortatory.",
  "You don't go to jail.",
  "What you do is you lose any grant, loan, or performance-based incentive. Is that right?",
  "Now, what I was trying to get is -- what I was looking at specifically is Federal law says, if you look at the driver's license and Social Security card -- those are I-9 docs -- then the employer has established an affirmative defense and has not violated the law. That's what it says. You know the cite -- 27a or whatever. Okay? That's the Federal law. Arizona law that I was reading -- maybe there's another place I should read -- is it says, on determining whether he's an unauthorized alien, the court -- the court shall consider the Federal Government's determination. It creates a rebuttable presumption. That means it might be rebutted. Okay? So I see a difference there. And the reason that that's relevant is because, my first question, if I you are an employer, prior to your law, it's 50/50. better verify because if I'm discriminating, you know, da, da, da. And it's not that hard. I just look at the driver's license and I look at -- I'm home free, and the Social Security card, and if I hire an illegal immigrant, the same thing, da, da, da. Okay? So same both ways. Your law: Employer, look at the driver's license and Social Security, you are not home free. Employer, if it turns out that you've been hiring this illegal immigrant and he's not an American, your business is finished. But what happens if I discriminate? Under our law? Nothing. Now, that was the original point they made. That's why I brought up this question of difference in standards. And I want to be absolutely clear what your answer to that is.",
  "Well, where? Where is it in the statute, then? Because what I read were the words \"rebuttable presumption,\" and I might be reading the wrong words.",
  "So tell me where it is.",
  "Okay. So the -­",
  "Okay, thank you. I see that.",
  "The main point -- I mean, I'll check that. I think maybe I was mistaken, perhaps, in that I was looking at the other section.",
  "But then we're still stuck with this enormous discrepancy in penalty. I mean, I'm characterizing it as enormous, but it seems like the -­ you know, it's even on discrimination versus under the Federal law. It's not even -- your business is out to lunch, gone, and on the other side it has nothing. What about that one?",
  "The savings clause itself, the word \"licensing\" -- not everyone looks at this, but I did look at the legislative history. And when you look at that paragraph on page 39 of the red brief, it seems to me that that paragraph says what it means. It says precisely what it is. It says -- the first thing it says is that, look, if you're found to have violated this -- where is it? It's page -- there it is. Suppose somebody has been found to have violated the sanctions provision in the Federal legislation. Now, you've found -- he has been found by the Federal Government. Then what the State does, it can revoke his license. Okay? That's one thing. And the second thing it says it wants -- doesn't want to pre-empt \"'fitness to do business laws,' such as State farm labor contracting laws or forestry laws.\" In other words, it's thinking of some precise set of licenses, and that's why this licensing thing was there. And the very next part of this Federal law are conforming amendments, and those conforming amendments apply to departments of government that were concerned with maintaining State farm labor contractor laws. Now, I grant you, you have to go beyond the text, but some of us do because we get enlightenment. And going beyond that text, it seems to me we should follow what that House report says. Now, what is your response to that?",
  "Yes, I've got -­",
  "I said yes, I've got broad licensing -- but let's deal with the part where you look at their explanation as to why they put those words there.",
  "Why \"to be sure\"?",
  "Of course, you can also read Mead and decide what it says. Being in the majority, I thought the dissent's characterization was not what it said. I mean, the dissent -­",
  "The dissent can write what it wants to write. But I don't think that that was what Mead said, but I guess there's disagreement about that. What did you think?",
  "No, no. But I -- I'm sorry. You're an informed reader, and I -- I thought Mead definitely did not say that. That was the dissent's characterization of what it said.",
  "That is one indicator.",
  "But not exclusive.",
  "Why not? Can't an agency interpret its own rules? I thought there was a long line of cases, Udall v. -- whatever it was. I mean, there are like 50 of them -­",
  "-- where an agency can interpret its own rules, and if it has authority to make the rule, it can decide that it means something different. Why not? Where -- where in the law does it say they can't do that?",
  "But at the Board -- I mean, isn't there realism in this? When you read what the Board later said in -- in these reports, you'd say, well, is this what the Board now thinks? And what in the law prevents the Board, which is in charge of its own regulations, from telling us what it thinks, if it's in good faith and isn't making up some kind of ex-post rationalization? That's the word used, you know, in the brief case.",
  "It doesn't say \"specific interest rate.\" I mean, my understanding of it -- and I'm asking, so you can correct me if that isn't so -- is there's a regulation, Regulation Z.",
  "And then the staff put out some commentary and says here's what that means, among other things: That the creditor can increase the rate at its discretion, and you've got to give notice. You have to give notice, but you have to give some more notice if the original notice does not include specific terms for an increase. And then they give an example. Suppose the increase could occur under the creditor's contract reservation right to increase the periodic rate.",
  "That's a little obscure. As I say it, I'm not sure what I'm talking about. So then, later on, the Board puts out another -- not called official staff commentary, but they say: We'll tell you what that specific -- word \"specific\" terms mean. It means when they didn't say anything about the interest rate or they didn't say when in fact they were going to increase the interest rate from X to Y, then they didn't give specific notice. But they did give specific notice if they told you when it would increase, by default -- when you default. And they did give specific notice when they told you what the maximum it would go up to was, like 8 percent or 18 or whatever it is. Okay? So that's the Board's interpretation of its official staff commentary, which in turn is an interpretation of the reg. So if we're supposed to defer to their interpretation of their own reg -- I mean, my goodness, wouldn't we defer like double to their own interpretation of their own staff commentary, which is an interpretation of a reg which they have an authority to issue under the -- you see my point.",
  "I mean, that would be an argument you could make. You could say that -- that their interpretation here exceeds their authority under the statute. Now, of course, if you're right about that, all this stuff goes out the window.",
  "But it's a pretty hard argument to make that one, I think.",
  "So in your view, that's staff commentary, the staff thing means -­",

  "This is the same kind of question, but suppose I don't really know how drug companies operate. I suspect, but I don't know, that where you have a serious drug, people are hurt all the time and they blame the drug. So probably drug companies operate in an environment where they get all kinds of complaints and some are valid, some are not; who knows? People are frightened.",
  "Okay. Now, I don't know that. But you say at the beginning your client says: Look, we get complaints all the time; you know, just put up with it if you buy our stock. Now, I don't know to what extent that's true. I don't know how that fits in. I don't know whether their complaint is unusual or not unusual or general. Who is supposed to decide that? The judge at the complaint stage? Or the judge after you get some evidence on it? Or the jury? And the same is true of scienter, after all, because the scienter, you see -­ and you have to plead that with particularity. Okay. What's my -- what's your answer? What's the -- what's -- I mean, Justice Kagan has an interesting view of this, and could be, that she's putting forward and others might have a different view. Who is to decide this?",
  "Well, we don't know. You see, what they're saying is we have one respectable doctor, studier, at -- you know, in Colorado. He, by the way, has an abstract which isn't in the complaint, which says that they do allege that it's zinc that's the problem, a free zinc ion. And they say we also have 25 people who were hurt and some burning sensations in people where it didn't rise to that level. You know, I don't know. I don't know if that's within the range of expectation of drug companies as part of the normal course of business which investors should know about, and I suspect a district judge doesn't know, either. So how does it work where we in fact just don't know whether this does or not arise above the background noise of a drug company?",
  "Oh, no, it can't be. I mean, all right -- I'm sorry. I don't mean to take a position yet. But -­",
  "But, look -- I mean, Albert Einstein had the theory of relativity without any empirical evidence, okay? So we could get the greatest doctor in the world, and he has dozens of theories, and the theories are very sound, and all that fits in here is an allegation he now has learned that it's the free zinc ion that counts.",
  "And that could be devastating to a drug even though there isn't one person yet who has been hurt. So I don't see how we can say -­",
  "-- this statistical significance always works or always doesn't work.",
  "They did. They said -­ they said the free zinc ion was -- that word on this was told to your client by a person who knows a lot about it, is apparently reputable, and was told to a person who also knows a lot about it. Huh. I think they're saying you ought to have been very nervous at that point. That isn't just a usual background noise, okay? So I'm back to my question, which is -- you can answer the other one too if you like. But, I mean -- but my question is: Who is supposed to decide, how?",
  "I know, and we're back at my question -­",
  "The question is: The facts that are pleaded is -- I think it's assumed that this is above the normal background noise -- they certainly argue that at length -- that there was this free zinc ion conversation, that there are 25 people who were hurt, and there is a lot of burning sensation going on, even though it doesn't rise to the level of people being hurt, and that's supported by some of the zinc sulfate studies in the fish -­",

  "We're not saying -- you're saying if you are a scientist -- now we're back to Justice Scalia's questions and the others.",
  "No, because the sulfate -­ you see in the abstract, which they didn't put in the complaint, that the problem that they saw arising out of the zinc sulfate studies was the free zinc ion.",
  "All right -­",
  "The trouble is, you know, the truth is I don't know -­",
  "And so I'm back to my question.",
  "How would you write -­ look, I'm asking how do you write this, because what -­ where I think where the other side has a point is if -­ with these -- this is a big class of these kinds of things, you know, vitamins, all kinds of things like that, and if we say that they have to disclose too much, what will happen is people won't pay attention to it, you know. And if -- if you have, you know, 4,000 pages of small print saying everything that was ever reported, what really happens in -- in such instances is the public pays no attention, and they think -- and it will hide the things that are actually important. So how would you write some words -­ assuming that you're right, that their test is wrong -­ but how would you write some words that will put a disclosure obligation such that it's not going to be overkill and it is going to get incidents that rise above the background noise, and those are the incidents that are -- that would be significant for a reasonable investor?",
  "Okay, I'll go back and read what you have just said, and -- I will, because it will be in the transcript, and -- and the -- this case -- I -- you are very good, your clients and the lawyers -­",
  "-- at writing complaints. All right? So they've alleged in this complaint everything they can show, and I -- I suspect -- and during the class period. And what it doesn't say is that very helpful chart that you put in the brief, in the pocket. It doesn't say they ever showed that to the company. All it says is there was a phone call and this individual from -- from Colorado said something, which it doesn't specify, about zinc and the -- and the number of deaths.",
  "Okay. I get that. Can I just ask you one question in response to -- just picking up on the last -- what about the need for a, quote, \"strong inference of scienter,\" end quote, and does this complaint show more than a borderline situation where it doesn't strongly infer that the person intended to mislead the defendant? What about that argument?",
  "Well, page 49 of their brief -- they have two pages on it -- it does not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.",
  "No, no, I mean -- I just want to know why -- if their inference on materiality is enough to survive the background noise reply, is it enough to show a strong inference that they did do this intending to mislead, a strong inference of scienter?",
  "Given the same conditions. But is there any evidence, or can you say anything from the record or any other place, going back to 1950 -- I assume in 1950 people knew how much the different landowners were taking out of the stream of the river in Wyoming to use for irrigation and other such purposes. They knew that. Is there any indication they knew at that time how much each individual landowner was putting back? I think the answer is \"no.\" But I'd be very interested if it's \"yes.\" And I think it would help you a lot if it's \"yes,\" because I'm -­",

  "-- where in the record I find something that says that they knew how much each individual landowner is putting back into this river in Wyoming. And I think you can't answer that question, can you?",
  "Oh, they didn't? In other words, they didn't know how much is coming back, but you're coming in and saying what they were -- what they were regulating here is they're saying, not only you get -- you maintain a right to take out 100,000 units to do your irrigation, but you have to put back 80,000, but they didn't even know what the number was, whether it was 80, 70, or 60, and the appropriation law is ambiguous? I think -- I think I can go that far with you to say it's ambiguous, but I don't see how I can go further. I mean, that's my basic question. It's -­ did you see what it was? Was I clear? Not too?",
  "I'm saying, how can you read this treaty to require landowners to put back amounts into the river that they didn't even know what they were?",
  "Yes, I think that is what -- the answer is yes, isn't it?",
  "That's back where -- that's where I was here, too. See, I can't get too far -- I mean, you have the word \"depletion\" in that definition. I -- I -- that might help you. But I'm thinking in accordance with the doctrine of appropriation, what does that doctrine, that legal doctrine, say about use and return? And that's why we're -- we're -- why I was thinking it seems totally unclear. It talks about seepage, the cases, which I gather is different from return. Okay. So could they have really meant net? And what struck me is that they couldn't, which -- which you were beginning to address, too, is that they couldn't have meant net because the water law at that time is unlikely to have meant net for the reason that they didn't -- you don't know what's coming back. Do you see? It's not just -- I see your point. Your point is, well, Wyoming knew how much was going into Wyoming. But that's not my point. My point is what -- what's the water law? What's the law of appropriation at that time in respect to return flows? And if people didn't measure return flows in general, I suspect in an ambiguous area they would have analogized it to seepage, which is what the -- what the Special Master thought.",
  "Yes, they -­",
  "Uh-huh.",

  "You read it with a different emphasis. Justice Scalia read it with -­ beneficial use is that use by which the water supply of a drainage basin \"is depleted\" when usefully employed by the activities of man. And you read it: By which the water supply of a drainage basin is depleted \"when usefully employed by the activities of man.\" So that it is a definition in respect to how you use it, not amounts. But if you emphasize the word \"depleted,\" it could be read as referring to amounts, and not quality of use, not nature. And -­",
  "Yes, well -­",
  "And so, on your theory in that situation where there isn't enough for all the pre-1950 people, it's Wyoming that gets all the water? And on their theory, it's surprising -- surprise, surprise -- it's Montana that gets all the water?",
  "And there's no way to read this contract -- this compact so it's share and share alike?",
  "There's no fair way to decide this case?",
  "So your linguistic argument is they didn't use the word \"diversion\" because they didn't want to throw the mill race example into the definition -­",
  "Yes, they didn't want mill races in the definition, so they purposely didn't use the word \"diversion\"; that's why they used the word \"depletion.\"",

  "Right. Can I ask you -­",
  "Now, first, the word \"distributor\" hurts you, so I'm going to take that out, and I imagine a hypothetical -- I know your case differs from that, but I'm going to ask them how it differs, not you, okay? Now, a person walks into a shop in either West Virginia or the country of India where they make pots. They're very nice pots made, actually, in West Virginia. And the potter makes several thousand a year, and this individual says: Mr. Potter, I want to sell your pots; send me a thousand each year. Where are you going to sell them? Everywhere. Great. Okay? That's it. Now, suppose that the law were, as it could be perhaps, that it is sufficient for jurisdiction throughout the United States that the distributor or independent buyer said good, I'm selling them everywhere I can. And two or three end up in New Mexico, but it doesn't matter where they end up. Suppose that was sufficient to find jurisdiction. You've prepared for this case. I want to know in your opinion, if that were the rule -- that's all that's necessary -- what cases in this Court in your opinion would that conflict with? I mean, I'm thinking of the facts. I'm not thinking of statements of law or whatever, but you can bring those in, too. I want to write those down because I want to read those cases, and you know them better than me.",
  "I don't know what a convenience test is. Assume I'm very ignorant, which isn't too far from the truth. I would like you to tell me, are there any cases which we would actually be conflicting with were we to say all that's necessary to assert jurisdiction in every State is that a buyer walks into a shop where the manufacturer of pots makes pots and tells the potter I'm going to sell everywhere I can, and the potter says good, okay. Now -- and he buys the pots. Now, if that were the rule, can you find a case that that actually conflicts with?",
  "Asahi, okay.",
  "Additional conduct?",
  "What I have written down in my notes, which you can add to -­",
  "-- is that there are three things that happened. One -- it's the equivalent of the potter. One thing that happened, we have to take it as, I think, an independent company, whether you want to call them a distributor or not. I didn't see a difference there. An independent company goes to a firm somewhere in the world and says: I will buy your product and sell it in the United States. And the guy says good. And that's true whether it's a woman's cooperative in southern India or whether it's the biggest company in the world, okay? That's the first thing. The second thing is that an executive of that company went to seven trade shows in the United States. And the third thing is that two, three, or four machines ended up in New Jersey. Now, is there anything other than that? And there's a lot of rhetoric, and there are all kinds of characterizations, but when I looked for facts, I found those three, and I want to be sure I have them all.",
  "I do. Now, then my question following from that, if I have those are the three facts, what worries me is the exact opposite of what the New -- the New Jersey Supreme Court said. It said in worldwide markets this is a good thing. I think I worry about it, because I'm worried about the woman's cooperative in India, I'm worried about the Chinese development, I'm worried about development everywhere. We have a lot of small businesses. And I'd worry -­ now, maybe the worry is legally irrelevant -- but I'd worry about a rule of law that subjects every small business in every developing company -- in every developing country to have to be aware of the law in 50 States simply because they agreed to sell to an independent company who is going to sell to America, plus your two factors. And really the third is none, because if it hadn't ended up somewhere, there'd have been no accident.",
  "Now, that's my basic concern here.",
  "Yes. Okay, but you see what my -- my problem is a sort of policy problem that may be irrelevant, but I -- I don't see how the world's going to work or develop if in fact every small business everywhere in the world has to know, you know, the law of every 50 States and hire lawyers and come here, rather than making the accident victim go there. Now, it's tough on the accident victim, but the other is also tough. So -- so that's -- that's sort of the -- I'm sketching out my concerns here. You -­",
  "All right.",
  "What would you say?",
  "Yes.",
  "Trade shows.",
  "Well, that's the same as the first; that's a sale to the entity.",

  "-- and then that manufacturer, that potter in West Virginia, now has to go to wherever he ends up -- wherever that pot ends up?",
  "Ah. Ah.",
  "We turn it on that? We turn it on whether the independent buyer -- the independent buyer walked into the shop or whether the seller found that there was an independent buyer? Is that what this case should turn on? I mean, I'm nervous. I see a lot of rather deep issues here, and I -- that's what are making me nervous.",
  "I want to -­",
  "You've thought about it more than I. So -­",
  "What if -­",
  "Yes, well -­",
  "But what I'm thinking is this -- this area of law has treated States as if they're foreign countries, in a certain way analogous to. If that -- and I'm trying to -- let me ask: What you said at one point, that if an independent company comes to a business, however small, in the United States and says give us some of your product, we're going to sell it everywhere in the world we can, fine. And they do. A couple go -- get into some very -- Burma or whatever, Myanmar. And right now, it's the law that consumers in all those countries sue in that country if they're hurt. Is that really the law? Is there something you can cite me to on that?",
  "And what does it -- what does it say?",
  "Yes, and we're one?",
  "And are we one?",
  "Did you refer to that? Do you have a citation to that in -­",
  "-- in your brief?",

  "That's right. Twenty -­ no, well, the record said seven.",
  "Is that in the record?",
  "Okay. All right. Is there a difference between that, do you think, and -- I just read in the paper the other day there's some Ethiopian or some foreign country -- it's a very poor country -­ and they're selling goats, and they're sending some to the United States for some kind of festival purpose or something. Now, he said I have a site on the Internet. All right. Now, all of these people, however small, I mean, many, many will have Internet sites, and some of them might have an Internet site that's accessed by American buyers, as this man did.",
  "All right. Is there any difference between that and your trade shows?",
  "Yes.",
  "No, no, don't use the characterization. I mean, I'm -- see, I'm trying to figure out does this count as purposefully availed?",
  "Okay. So the answer is going to be, in this case, if we say you win -­",
  "-- then everyone with a -­ with a -- everyone with an Internet site who also sells to a buyer who says anywhere in the world, perhaps -- I don't know how far that reaches -- seems pretty filled with implications.",
  "But it's the same, you think? It's the same -- I thought it might -­",
  "So, why -- why -- I mean, you've heard the argument in the last case. I mean, it seemed that potentially can subject the smallest manufacturer to liability throughout the world because it uses the Internet. And -- and that -- I don't know what the foreign policy -- you've heard treaties discussed, et cetera. Do you want to say anything?",
  "But looking at it categorically, I've always thought, means you look to see not just what the elements are on paper, but whether the elements as -- as used in reality in the State are applied to cases that do present -- in general, you apply it to cases that do present a serious risk of physical injury. And you'd think the answer is we don't know because no one's gone and looked. You could do it through sampling, but no one's gone and looked. I've just said that's my view of it. The -- the -- so what do we do? I mean, I can deal with a lot of other States, but Arizona has exactly the same classification of felony when you use a vehicle and when you use a vehicle creating a serious risk of physical harm to others. It's in the same provision, same statute, same category. How do we work with that, in your opinion?",
  "Are you following what I'm doing? You understand the difference between Arizona and 46 other States?",
  "In the other States, they grade it. But here they don't.",
  "Indiana -- I'm sorry.",
  "Well, I still -- look, what I'm thinking of -- and I need a little explanation -- we look to see in (b), and it says it's a class D felony if a vehicle is used. That's (A) under (1). Am I right?",
  "Okay. Then we look to (B) under (1), and it's also a class D felony -- in other words, the same -- if a vehicle is operated in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury.",
  "So a prosecutor looking at that will say: Why don't I just charge (A); what's the point of charging (B)? I mean, it makes no difference apparently. It's simpler to prove (A).",
  "I can deal with it more easily then, at least I have -- but what's worrying me now is what we're supposed to do is: Is the offense an offense that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another?",
  "So we're here trying to decide whether the (A) one does.",
  "And the answer is I don't know, and the reason I don't know is I don't know how that offense language of (A) is applied in Indiana.",
  "My problem is there is arguably not here a gradation. Suppose it only had (A). If it only had (A), for me -- I'm not saying for you -- this wouldn't be a tough case. That is to say, I can't imagine a person running away from a police in a car where there isn't a real risk to other people. He's speeding, you know. I would think -- I don't see how you get away from the policeman unless you speed, and there are going to be pedestrians. Who knows? But I think that was pretty -- at least as bad -- at least as much of a risk as burglary. So that would be the end of the case. It would be simple. At least assume that. Now, then, however, suppose we have a State which says: But it's a worse thing to run away and create a risk. In a separate provision. It's a worse thing. All right? Then I'd say, huh, now I'm not so sure. Why didn't they charge the worse thing? This must be reserved for cases where it isn't. So here we have a rather weird situation. They're saying it's a different thing but not a worse thing. So now I say: Well, why didn't they charge -- Huh? Now I don't know. I don't know why they didn't charge the separate special one. I don't know what the facts are. I'm puzzled. Now, that's your case. That's where I needed the enlightenment. So, what's the enlightenment?",
  "Am I right about -- when you replied to Justice Scalia, I thought that he had said that we were dealing with a statute, and you seemed to agree, that said it is a crime to flee a policeman after being ordered to stop. But I thought we were dealing with a statute that says it is a crime to flee a policeman after being ordered to stop, in a vehicle.",
  "And so you're -- okay.",
  "Suppose you have one of 36 States which treat this -- treat the general offense as a misdemeanor and then make it a felony if you put somebody at risk. Just reading that statute, you'd think those 36 States, when they have the general offense, do something where the guy acted pretty trivially; and where it's a felony, he actually put somebody at risk, sped off -- wouldn't that be your normal instinct in just guessing from the -- from the language?",
  "How are we supposed to treat those, where there's a misdemeanor -­",
  "In your opinion, it's just a misdemeanor, we also treat it the same way; say it's a violent felony?",
  "All right. Then that's actually my question. Are we supposed to, in this Federal statute, try to track whether it's a misdemeanor, what the language is? We're going to have a nightmare of a Federal law for States to -- for judges to figure this out. I mean, every little variation in thousands and thousands of possible variations could make a difference as to whether it's violent or not, depending on data which no one will have.",
  "What are the objections to adding in the alternative \"or in bad faith\"?",
  "Objectively? I mean, what we're trying to rule out is they -- they hitch -- they get this bright idea, the police: We'll go knock at every door. You know. So what about that, objectively determined bad faith?",
  "My point is a solely unlawfulness test would allow the police to get into the habit of just knocking at every door, but if you say that also it has to survive a bad-faith test, where bad faith is objectively, not subjectively, determined, then you will rule out the possibility of the police hatching -- which I don't know if they would, but hatching such a plan.",
  "Well, there are circuits who have adopted a bad-faith test in the alternative with other things than the word \"unlawful.\" The Second Circuit uses only the word \"unlawful,\" and I thought we took this case to iron out that discrepancy. And if we did, I'd like to know your objection to ironing it out by taking the Second Circuit test but adding on an objectively determined bad-faith rule.",
  "Well, the police say: Oh, I don't want to get a warrant. It's such a bore. We have other things to do. I have a great idea; let's knock at the door, and then as soon as he starts moving around, I know what his going to the -- going into the bathroom means, and we'll hear that, and we'll be able to get in.",
  "Hey, great idea. Okay? Now suppose that's the record.",
  "No, no. I mean to add: And, in fact, there's probable cause.",
  "In addition, he smelled the marijuana. I just was trying to stick to the relevant points.",
  "Yes. All right. Add that to the hypothetical.",
  "Correct. That's what I mean, and I don't always spell it out.",
  "All right. So you agree that -- that the court below is wrong because what they say, as I read it, is irrespective of how reasonably the police behave, if it is reasonably foreseeable that their tactic will create exigent circumstances -- and I would think it's reasonably foreseeable, when you knock on the door very politely and say \"The police,\" that somebody might shout out \"Hide the pot\"; all right?",
  "That if that's reasonable foreseeable, says the court, then that violates the Fourth Amendment. But we have the Second Circuit that says as long as the police behaved unlawfully, it -­ lawfully, lawfully -- it does not violate the Fourth Amendment; and we have the First Circuit that has some kind of bad-faith test plus an unreasonable or improper test; and we have the Fourth and Eighth circuits that yet have some different kind of test. And one of the things I'd be interested in hearing your view on at some point is just what the Chief Justice said, that assuming from your point of view this is a hypothetical case, nonetheless we would like your view on which of those tests or some other test is the appropriate test and why. That was the question he started with and Justice Kennedy started with, and I'd also be interested in your view on that.",
  "But you said -- just add on to that. Look, the question presented that they raised: Which of the five tests currently being used by the U.S. court of appeals is proper? Now, you've said something about your view on that, but I'd like you to say anything else you'd like to say about that, which of the five tests, or some sixth test if you like, and you tell me the words that you would like us to use when we answer that question.",
  "Which is?",
  "No, no, no. But the test you're using there, the key word is \"unreasonable.\"",
  "Okay. And the reason you choose the word \"unreasonable\" rather than the Second Circuit's test of \"unlawful\" is?",
  "But your test is -- I mean, it's not wild. It just says it says \"unreasonable\" in the Fourth Amendment. Probably when they act lawfully, they are acting reasonably and not unreasonably, but it could be sometimes they're not. That's your view?",
  "No test. All right.",
  "A totally different party -- if a person, say an intervenor, joins a litigation late, and there have been a lot of procedural rulings, I guess that that intervenor takes the case as he finds it. Now, he could go to the judge and say: Judge, I want you to reconsider your procedural ruling in light of the fact I'm here. How does the situation I've just sketched differ from this one? I mean, you have a client who's coming to the litigation late. He's separate from the litigation, I know, but he could send a representative to the judge and say: Judge, I want you to reconsider in light of the fact I'm joining. Now, I know I'm not joining; in fact, I'm bringing a different case. But I'm thinking of the -- of the Chief Justice's hypo, here and I'm -- and I'm trying to apply it. And is your client analogous to that person who joins litigation late?",
  "Did it ever happen -- did you ever come across an instance before where in a Federal court a judge in the district court says, no, you can't have a certification, no; and then a different plaintiff went to a different Federal court in a different part of the country and asked for a similar certification? Have you ever found anything like that in precedent, that it's in two Federal courts rather than the State/Federal?",
  "And did they say -- did they say in -- in that case that the second judge is bound as a matter of stare decisis, or is he bound as a matter of collateral estoppel?",
  "So it's the same issue as here?",
  "Do we know that in the record, that the attorneys didn't even know about each other's cases? Is that borne out? I mean, is that an issue?",
  "The two questions I'd have is, first of all -- Justice Sotomayor, sorry; I did not -- I did have her question, because what that suggests is, in this case, it's not unfair to hold your client in this case. And you just read the two circuit court opinions here, and you think this is a defense coming out of long in the past that doesn't have much substance to it. That was her question, I think, as I understood it.",
  "In other words, it's not unfair. But let me give you the other question because, sometime in your argument, I'd like you to get to that. And that is, if we accept as a principle of law what was said in Reynolds, a criminal case or whatever, and apply it to government contracting, where sophisticated contractors are perfectly capable of negotiating their own contract, we are not just throwing a monkey wrench into the gears of government contracting; we're throwing the whole monkey. That's my second question.",
  "One, that this isn't a case that calls for it; and, two, the threat to government contracting by changing from Reynolds to here is overwhelming. Now, I'd like your views on both of those.",
  "That's exactly my problem, because when I looked at Reynolds, Reynolds doesn't hold anything in your favor. It holds the opposite way. It says to you -- in a criminal case, we said it was unconscionable for the government both to prosecute and not to -- not to tell them a secret, okay? And it says such a rationale has no application in a civil forum where the government is not the moving party. It doesn't say anything about where the government is the moving party.",
  "And Exhibit A that it is not unconscionable here consists of the two opinions of the Federal Circuit. I mean -- now, what do you want me to read to get over that impression?",
  "It didn't limit it. It said the rationale is unconscionable. Now, I don't even have to go that far. I can go to \"fundamentally unfair.\" All I want to know is what should I read to get over my unfortunate impression, which I got out of the two opinions that I did read, that there was nothing unfair? Okay? What do you want me to read to get over that impression -­",
  "-- which I think you do want me to read something.",
  "Okay.",
  "How do you -­",
  "So it isn't -- it isn't a big practical problem. All right. Let me ask then, I was -- misimpression. Would you go back to Justice Kennedy's question for a minute? I'm -- I -- I don't quite see -- if you would discuss it a little bit -- how you do this as a matter of constitutional law, because the Due Process Clause is tied to fundamental unfairness, and I think the answer has to be in this kind of circumstance, secret block or not, it depends. It depends on many things. So, would you write this as a matter of constitutional law? Would it -- shouldn't it be written as a matter of Federal common law of contracts? Shouldn't it be written as an exposition of the superior knowledge doctrine, which seems totally open to it? And -- or shouldn't it be written as a matter of discovery law, which is what the district judge who ended up thinking -- the Court of Claims judge says, gee, I don't really know. I mean, that's how I read it. How would you -- would you speak about this for a minute?",
  "Can you go back to that for one second? I understand the due process issue, which is Brandeis's issue in Crowell. I think I can -- you're not going to say anything that I can't read in the brief on that. But the other one is worrying me, the structural issue. So imagine there's no due process concern whatsoever. Now, when I looked at Crowell, your case would seem to fall right in it. It is an adjudication under the law as such, you know, between two people -­ whatever that famous line is. You're captured by that one. So the question is: Can you get out of it with later cases? And you point to Schor to get out of it. And Schor, as I read it, is an all-factors case, that when she talks in the structural part of -­ about -- when Justice O'Connor is talking about the non-due process part, the structural part, just what you said, that there isn't a hard-and-fast rule, that there are a bunch of factors that we should look at. At least that's how I read it. And you were reading it as a hard-and-fast rule which means you win. Now -- now, who's -- should I just read this case further and make up my mind about that, or is there something you want to say about it?",
  "Well, you know, that's what she says. And the -- and what you're interested in there, the key thing is not fairness; the key thing is maintaining the integrity of the judicial system. In Crowell, Justice Hughes says you've made that integrity as long as there were review of matters of fact, the independent decision by a court of questions of law, and reservation to the court of constitutional facts which have never been heard of since. Okay? So we have this case. And your issue is, after all, something that for many, many decades or longer has been the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding. The bankruptcy judge is an adjunct to the court. It is well-established, this kind of review. Every part of Crowell is met. So what is -- what is essential to the integrity of the judicial process that requires you to have a de novo hearing before a district court rather than the kind of review that's given here?",
  "In which case?",
  "Well, Marathon, you know, you had four, four and -- and who knows what it stands for. And then we have a sentence of what it stands for, and if you read that one sentence, I don't think you can say it's a slam-dunk for you.",
  "Of the -- of Marathon and saying, where four and four judges really reject a decision like Crowell, which is a kind of foundation stone?",
  "True, but it's also a -­",
  "If -- if we were to decide this case, and suppose we decide every other question and suppose you lost, then wouldn't we send it back for you -- if you're right on that, for the Ninth Circuit to decide about that as an independent basis for no jurisdiction?",
  "I had to make that premise in order to -­",
  "If it's that hard, why don't we just DIG the case? I guess that -­",
  "Well, but his basic argument I think is that in Marathon -­",
  "Make it totally fair. Nobody is being treated unfairly. Structurally, it does injure the -- the prestige or something or the structure or the integrity of the Federal Government -- judiciary, Federal judiciary -- to allow the bankruptcy judge to adjudicate a direct claim; why is a counterclaim different?",
  "So what is Santa Clara County supposed do? They -- they think they're being overcharged. And in your opinion, they -- the company doesn't, but they do. So what are they supposed to do if they're right? How do they get the money?",
  "I'm interested in procedurally what are they supposed to do?",
  "The manufacturer says: Okay, you're wrong. I'm not; I'm undercharging you. Now what happens.",
  "He's busy.",
  "Well, Why can't they -- can they, for example, file a claim with the -- with the Secretary and say we would like the Secretary to order them to give us the money; they're violating this? They go to an administrative law judge. Is there an administrative remedy of some kind that would be reviewable in the courts for reasonableness?",
  "Okay. So why is it reasonable, then, to think that the Secretary would have entered into a contract which is going to benefit them and there's no remedy?",
  "But normally under the law from Marbury v. Madison onward, where there's a wrong, there's a remedy.",
  "And the remedy could be administrative, could be judicial, et cetera. But you're saying there's none?",
  "But in such cases, there very often is an administrative remedy -­",
  "-- and the person always -­ any individual in the United States can go ask any agency to do anything, and there is even review in instances of a refusal to withhold -- a withholding of action.",
  "Is there here? You said there was.",
  "Suppose that the State of California says we'd like our counties to be able to enforce this. Then what happens?",
  "Well, suppose that California -- if California wants to say we could bring this suit like Massachusetts did, you agree they could. And then they say, all right, but we don't have the time; we want the counties to do it. Couldn't they do that?",
  "Well, what's the difference between -­",
  "What's the difference between a State doing it itself through its attorney general and the State saying we'd like the county to do it through its county attorney?",
  "All right. California comes to you tomorrow and says the attorney general says: You know, this is a problem. You don't have time to enforce this. There should be some enforcement, and we want to enforce it. And, moreover, we'd like each county affected to enforce it. Do you have the authority? Is there any reason you wouldn't say go ahead?",
  "I'm trying to analogize it to the Massachusetts one. You say they can just go ahead and do it, and they say, you know, Santa Clara County is just as big as Rhode Island. And you say the AG of Rhode Island can bring the suit; am I right? And so why can't the -- why can't Santa Clara do it?",
  "Well, that's true -- that's true, you know, of -- I was thinking maximum resale price maintenance. You could -- the distributor and the manufacturer agree on the maximum resale price. Pretty unlikely that they intend the consumers who are intended to benefit to be able to have a lawsuit. And I think, well, gee, I don't know. And what the Government is arguing is, sure, the point you make favors you, but they say there are two major points here that favor them about background. I want to hear what your reply is. One of them is Congress, in the statute that it incorporated here, didn't want a private person to be able to enforce it. And the second one is it's going to create a mess. All right? So they say those are two background features here that favor them. So what's your response?",
  "What do you think about -- is the -- I'm not sure I'm right at all here, but as I understand the development of this argument today, it's open to you and the other 57 counties to go to the State AG, and you say you bring the lawsuit, okay? Or make us -- make me -- the lawyer says make me an assistant AG for this purpose. And I launch the lawsuit in the name of California, and then I can get to the same place. What do you think of that?",
  "Are there any examples that you have? That is, in the last 35 years, has there been any instance where the Justice Department or some other law enforcement agency compiled a file for law enforcement purposes, that in that file there were, for whatever reasons, a bunch of conversations about the organization's strategy, and it did not interfere to release it with -- with anybody's personal privacy, but it might interfere with that organization's strategy, and so the organization, whatever it was, the NRDC or something, was very upset about it? Did you find a single example or a thousand examples? Or how many examples did you find of that happening?",
  "Well, one reason might be that this has really never been a problem because all the legitimate -- or most of them, anyway -- that these organizations that have interests in privacy are actually taken care of by the other 17 exemptions here.",
  "This may be the first one. That's why I want to know, is there -- one of the things you would have looked for is an example of a real problem of the kind you're talking about. I'm not saying you don't have one. I would just like to know if you found any, and what they are, so I could read them.",
  "I mean, one possible reason you don't find them is because it's very rare that a law enforcement agency is going to try to subpoena the top strategy of the -- of the NRDC, confidential strategy. There might not be too many such records. It -- another reason might be is that they don't really care. Another reason might be -- I don't know. But if you haven't found any examples, what we're back to -- or -- and maybe there are actual examples of that -- of what you said to Justice Ginsburg of the other instance, where the -- what was that first one?",
  "I'd like to know about the example. What was the first one again?",
  "They're worried about saying something mean about a regulator. Okay. Yes, fine. Are there examples of that? Is this the first one, and what's the empirical state?",
  "What do you say about the one thing -- the strongest point against you, I think, is a single sentence in that TVA case. It's only one sentence, but it's there in the opinion, and I think what it's saying, Justice Roberts says, well, he already finished, he just finished saying nobody -- Congress hasn't violated some rule against creating a system of regulation in this statute because it isn't regulation. But then he said, but even if it were, even if it were, and if your complaint was that Congress has acted outside its authority, which they might have thought at that time, in creating a system, TVA, that competes with local systems, even if that were so, the appellants, absent the State or their officers, would have no standing in this suit to raise the question. Okay, now, that -- they put quite a lot on to that. That is what it says. So are we supposed to say, well, that was an ill-considered dicta? Or are we supposed to say it was just wrong? Are we supposed to say the law has changed? What in your view are we supposed to -- or is different. What in your view are we supposed to say?",
  "So it comes out of left field, and it's an overall \"any, even, if.\" So that suggests it's just dicta and doesn't count.",
  "Why didn't it just consider it as outside the Commerce Clause? I mean, they had a whole lot of law, but what is the distinction between saying, as they said then, \"Court, the TVA regulates electricity rates in Memphis and that's beyond the power of Congress to enact\"?",
  "In this case, which -­ because of the Tenth Amendment and a lot of other things.",
  "And this case seems the same, saying it's beyond the power of Congress to enact because of the treaty.",
  "Yes.",
  "How do we know that? I'm not doubting you; I just want to know.",
  "Yes.",
  "That single sentence doesn't seem -- I'm trying to figure it out. It doesn't seem to refer to just all Tenth Amendment claims. There's a footnote and it talks about no standing in this suit. Then if you look back at the lower court case, it seemed to be referring to a particular argument where the challengers had said the Property Clause doesn't give authority to the government to pass this. The reply was, that was true in Alabama, and the Court said it was okay. Then the challengers say: Oh, but Alabama agreed. And then Georgia doesn't agree. And it was in that context that Georgia says it doesn't make any difference. But if Georgia was going to disagree or agree, if that's what it turned on, we better have Georgia say whether they agree or disagree, and not have people who aren't Georgia. That's what he seems to be saying to me at the moment. If I'm right, what's comparable to that in this case? Is there some claim that she's making that it would be constitutional if they agreed in the State and it wouldn't be if not? I don't think so. I think she means it's constitutional irrespective.",
  "Yes. Yes. So if that's so, then how can we take this sentence as barred?",
  "Yes. It just says \"in this case.\"",
  "No, he cites. He gives a footnote and you read the page and you get an idea.",
  "Is -- is it right that the Rules Committee then changed it, and it basically said the way the defendant here thinks it should be is that's what it should be? Isn't that what happened?",
  "Okay -- now -­",
  "The Rules Committee said count calendar days.",
  "They changed the rule.",
  "And now you think that the Federal courts are right in saying, judge, when you have a Speedy Trial Act case, look to Rule 45; you think that's right to do?",
  "Okay. So why shouldn't this defendant whose case was on appeal get the advantage of that?",
  "I know it was under a different rule. But where -- normally with cases where you have a new rule come in, it does apply to the advantage of the people who were then on appeal. Is there something special about this, that Federal rules don't, or you just -- too bad, we thought it was a really erroneous thing that they had, we used to have, and we've corrected it, but just -- he's still on appeal, it doesn't apply to him? Is there some law on that?",
  "I understand. I understand they followed the rule at the time.",
  "They've changed the rule. His case is still on appeal. Why shouldn't he get the advantage of the new rule?",
  "It wasn't anybody's fault. Why shouldn't we go back and say do it again, and now, let's -- since his case is still on appeal, it's the same question. What's the argument against doing that? Why can't we? I'm sure there's some rule out there that says we can't do this, but I want to know what it is because it seems fair.",
  "Any other reason?",
  "I mean, I'm thinking that we normally -- although all this is quite true, what Justice Scalia says, normally we do apply new rules to those who are on appeal at the time.",
  "It matters because the trial judges have to know what to do, and while your reading might fit the language in ordinary English better, I think it does. It's also possible to read those words \"delay resulting from\" as simply referring to a period of time; and the statute is saying these periods of time are excluded from accounting. Now, the virtue of that is just what Justice Ginsburg started with; all the trial judges know how to do it; the lawyers don't get mixed up; and the problem with what you're arguing for, in my mind -- if you want to say anything more about it, do -- is that it seems very unworkable to strike trying to figure out what causes what.",
  "Sorry, I don't understand that. Don't the guidelines provide for departures?",
  "Well -- and aren't you giving a guideline sentence, if you give your reasons as is required by the Sentencing Commission in 6B1.2 and you say -- the judge says, I think this is a special case and, therefore, I am giving a lower sentence? Just as he's required to do under the guidelines in order to accept a C type agreement.",
  "Well, how could it not be? Wouldn't the judge have to say it's not tied to the guidelines, because I am varying and I no longer wish to apply the guideline? If he doesn't say that, isn't he applying the guideline?",
  "Whether he gives the specific robbery 3-point whatever it is, 17 months, or whether he says, I have a special case and I depart under section 5 of the guidelines. Both of those are guideline sentences, aren't they?",
  "I don't understand why you resist that. I mean, that's precisely what the guidelines say. The only ones that aren't guideline sentences are -- are dismissal charges, where it's an agreement to dismiss. But a type B, type C -- the guidelines themselves say that the judge, here's what you do. Judge, you look and see if the guidelines sentence is there. Is it a guideline sentence? If it is, you can approve it. If it isn't, you can't. I mean, that's my reading of what it says. So -- so why do you resist that conclusion?",
  "And, of course, the judge now could depart from the guidelines -- I mean, \"vary,\" whatever that word -- technical word, is -- \"vary.\" He can say, I'm not going to apply the guidelines at all. But if he is going to apply the guidelines, isn't that what they tell him to do? I've always thought that. You may tell me I'm mistaken.",
  "Well, how could it not be, since the judge has no power if he is to apply the guideline -­",
  "-- to accept any agreement other than agreement that corresponds with the guideline? That's what it says. It says the court should accept a recommended sentence or a C -- the specific sentence -- only if the court is satisfied either that it is within the applicable guideline range or if it's based on a departure under the guidelines. That seems to me what it says. Isn't that what it says?",
  "Okay. Then if that's so, every sentence is -- you're going to say no?",
  "I mean, I thought that was helping you, but if you want to say no, go say no and explain why that is.",
  "Yes.",
  "How?",
  "Give me an example.",
  "What?",
  "Yes.",
  "Are we supposed to psychoanalyze the judge? The judge says on his writing, checks the box: This is a guideline sentence. It is robbery. It is precisely within the robbery range. But I -- I am going to give it the low end of the range because I believe that the -- he has a lovely mother and family and so forth. Okay? You're saying that isn't based on the guideline. No? Okay. Is that the point?",
  "What he does is he applies the guideline sentence. He has to do that. Now, within that range, he has applied the guideline sentence, he got the information. He says, I am satisfied it applies -- done. Now are we supposed to look further and say what his true reason is? Is that what you're saying?",
  "You were -- you were just at the very point when we decided Booker, is that right? It was -- your -- your sentencing took place in July 2005 and we came out with Booker in -­",
  "All right. So it's quite possible the judge wasn't totally -- but I mean -- I agree; it's much more complicated after Booker. I don't know how to treat yours.",
  "It's on the cusp.",
  "All right. You want us to decide this case. I completely agree with what Justice Alito is saying, Justice Scalia, that maybe the world after Booker is different. And I have not thought that one through. I am thinking this case is a pre-Booker case. It is not real. I am thinking it is on the cusp, so how am I to treat this case? If it is a case where the guidelines apply, if it is such a case -- and I think maybe everyone here has assumed throughout that it was. Am I right about that? Were you saying this is a case where the guidelines do not apply, where they are not binding? I mean, where pre-Booker doesn't count?",
  "How do you want us to take this, pre-Booker or post-Booker?",
  "I know, you think the -- I think it is completely different regardless. So let's avoid that controversy at the moment, and you tell me whether you want me to take it pre-Booker or post-Booker.",
  "I want you -­",
  "All right. So you want to -- you want to set aside this post-Booker?",
  "Then perhaps we should have the pre-argument. If we are taking this pre-Booker, I would have throughout it is QED.",
  "I mean, imagine that the that the Sentencing Commission -- imagine. It is not true, but imagine that the Sentencing Commission had written the following words: \"Plea bargaining over sentences is above,\" as many argued they should. They write those words. Then they write the next word, \"exception.\" There is an exception, however; you are permitted to plea bargain about a sentence insofar as you argue about the range, where, within the range, it applies. And of course when you apply the guidelines, as when you always apply the guidelines, here or elsewhere, departure is an unusual case. Now, suppose those were the words that the Commission had written. Could -- how -- is it possible under those circumstances you would still be arguing this sentence under the -- plea bargaining abolished except over where within the range -- is it possible you would be arguing that this is not based on the guidelines?",
  "Oh, it is, because of (a)(4). It used to be -­",
  "-- because it says in the sentencing guidelines, Judge, you will apply the guideline, unless you find a circumstance the Commission did not adequately take into account and in respect to that, you may and must consult policy statements, but guidelines and other materials. That is what it says. Okay? So take I am right on that. Assume I am right. You can disagree with me, and I will look into it.",
  "I want an answer to my hypothetical, because I am trying to figure out how to think about it, and you will help me if you answer my hypothetical.",
  "Yes, that's right. That's what they wanted to do. Okay? Now, that is correct. But you can still have them.",
  "You could still have them, but they allow them only for the purpose of where within the range the sentence will lie. Okay?",
  "Fine.",
  "Correct. Now I would like -- because if they wrote those words, C agreements are abolished, but for where within the range -- okay? You agree it would be based on the guidelines. Now what I'd like you to do is to look at section 6B, whatever that is.",
  "Exactly.",
  "You tell me how this differs from what I just said.",
  "It's only if. The words there are \"only if.\" It said should accept the recommended sentence or a plea agreement requiring imposition of a specific sentence only if the court is satisfied either that such sentence is appropriate within the guidelines, or departure.",
  "I am? I'm reading 6B1.3, I am reading commentary on the policy statement.",
  "Yes. I am reading the commentary on the -­",
  "Yes.",
  "I think you're right. You see that is why I am having such a hard time. I am having a hard time because first I put myself back in the Commission days, and there the Commission did want to abolish C.",
  "And then that is what it intended to do and that is what it said it did, but for what we are talking about. Now, you first raised the question of did they have the authority to do that and I agree with you that that is a legitimate question. I made you assume it away, but I think it is a legitimate question. Now we have the additional question of how Booker/Fanfan changes that and for what and when. Do you see why I am puzzled and why I was asking you rather harshly to start with my hypothetical?",
  "How do you say, I am not certain that willful blindness would support the conclusion below. The standard, the district court or the trial court said really, negligence, as I read it. The circuit said deliberate disregard of a known risk. Well, how much of a risk? I mean, the business world there is always a risk and we are talking about a complicated world, probably quite a lot of risk. And so I think that standard would create a great deal of uncertainty. Willful blindness has a tradition. So are you okay with willful blindness and we say we are afraid they did not do it, i.e., we are afraid, we do not know what they really meant here and so send it back and do it again. I am sure you wouldn't be overjoyed. But do you think that would be a reasonable result?",
  "What are you supposed to say known risk, sure he says he looked at five. And he says anybody can figure this thing out, all you do is put the little gizmos between the two sides, you know, and you have an inside and outside and you just suspend the inside with little bars of some kind. I do not know what, chewing gum or something, and he says anybody could figure that out, it couldn't possibly be bad. And so that is their view, but how much of a risk, they will say little risk, big risk. So you see why I think we should send it back. Now you tell me why that is not -­",
  "I am not saying they are right in that, I bet they would lose. But my problem is do I accept the words deliberate disregard of the known risk or do I say the more traditional accompaniment to knowledge is willful blindness, which for all its obscurity, at least has a history.",
  "I don't think that is the part they are complaining about.",
  "The difference, they say, between (b) and (c) is that (c) applies to a person who makes some really special thing that looks like a Japanese kabuki theater costume, and it's actually made out of metal and it's really -- has a very bizarre thing, and it is only used -- good use is to do this infringing thing. But (b) could apply to somebody who makes plastic shields. (B) can apply that -- (b) could apply to anybody who makes anything; is that right?",
  "Well, the argument is that the words \"actively induced\" are meant to be something greater than knowing, not something less than knowing. Because otherwise, you're going to hold Aluminum Company of America, if that still exists, liable when it makes these aluminum sheets, because somebody uses an aluminum sheet apparently, et cetera. You see the problem. It is quite different when you make this weird kabuki-looking thing that only has one use, and they -- and that's why it should be -- it should be harder to hold that person to contributory infringement, not easier. Now, that's their argument. What do you say.",
  "I'd like to get, really, an answer from you on Justice Kennedy's question, because at the moment I am not worried about your case. You, of course, are. I understand that. But the -- I am worried about Alcoa or the little backyard maker of clay pots, or -- I mean, millions and millions of people make things that are used in millions and millions of ways. And I am worried about what kind of burden we are supposed to impose on them. I see three candidates. One is, you're liable if you should have known. Two is, you're liable if you consciously disregarded a -- a risk, a known risk; that is sort of like a -- you know, the Model Penal Code, sort of. And third is willful blindness. Is there a fourth? And if there is not, what do you choose among those three? No, not what you choose. What should we choose?",
  "So is that -- is that another standard? Maybe that is an example of what it is to be willfully blind. If, in fact, you go out and you copy something, it could well be patented, and you do not tell your lawyer, go look up this one, that is willfully blind.",
  "That is why you say they are the same. I don't want to put words in your mouth.",
  "That is where I am. At the moment, the should have known or willful blindness, the disregard -- the problem, and it seems like a real problem, is know what, exactly? Well, know there is a risk. Well, at that point half the country in the business world is very upset because there is always a risk.",
  "And the other problem is if you -- as you move away from that and say, no, no, I mean a real risk -- I mean a huge risk -- I mean a risk that in fact, you almost knew that this was it -- now I can do it with my tone of voice, but I need the words to put in there that are going to calm people's fears that they are not suddenly going to be held liable because there is some fairly small risk of this. So what words would I use?",
  "I know this case; I am not worried about. I am worried about what I said.",
  "I do not want to just resolve the case.",
  "The reason we took the case is because there seemed a bunch of standards floating around. Now I know our interests differ in this matter, but I would appreciate any help you can give me about what I am thinking now is words that will quantify the risk that you had to have known about, a risk; so that it doesn't look like some small thing that is always there that looks like some giant thing that is pretty close to actually -­",
  "Well, I've heard about that.",
  "Yes, it would.",
  "-- my problem, is a high probability that. You have to be -- you have to consciously, that is the model penal code, that is the -- you know, torts -- you have to consciously disregard a high probability that this item was patented and also meet the other requirements that are part of active inducement. That is what your thought is?",
  "I know your client doesn't care. But still we have to write this. So what about the answer? To follow it up a little bit, it is knowledge -- you're familiar with these areas, so you're helpful, and -- and it is a knowledge or a known -- or consciously disregarding a known risk where the risk consists of a high probability that that item that you are inducing to be produced will infringe a patent.",
  "Well, though -­",
  "Well, that's where I exactly am. I mean, the -- the brief that I found very, very interesting is that filed by the Association of American Universities and the Advancement For Science and the Council on Education, and they seem to take the line that you are -- I don't know how far you want to pursue it. They say the strongest analogy is with government employees, and if you look at government employees the basic rule is, the Federal Government paid for it, they should have the invention. And the way they do it is not to deny the employee the right to have the invention, but they insist upon an assignment, assignment of an exclusive license. And there are cases which are cited here that suggest that, even if the employee tries to run his way around that and simply goes and before the government can get it assigns the interest to a third party, that that third party assignment is void as a matter of public policy; and that the assignment to the government of the exclusive right is valid as a matter of law, a legal implication from the executive order in the circumstance. That brings me back to where Justice Ginsburg was, and Justice Kennedy. The analogy is so strong. The government has paid for it. There is a statute here that really seems to assume, though not explicitly say, that the universities will have title -­ that we simply copy what happened in this other area and say that an effort to assign by the employee in contravention of what this statute takes as its basic assumption, and a contract, is void as a matter of public policy, because the exclusive license is assumed to be assumed -- to be assigned to the university, though I don't need the second part; for this case, the first part suffices.",
  "Is that before the executive order or after?",
  "No, no. I understand that.",
  "And if the employee seeks to assign to a third party in contravention of his agreement, rules and regulations, et cetera, what happens to that assignment?",
  "The facts are that he was supposed to give it to -­",
  "No, there's no -- what there is, is an agreement with the government that says any invention you will assign to the government. That's the agreement.",
  "And now, in violation of that agreement, he assigns it to a third party. What happens to that assignment?",
  "And what the Court said -­ my reading of it, must be yours -- is in the cases they cite, that assignment to the third party is void as a matter of law because it's contrary to public policy. That was my reading of it, and I'm questioning you about that because I might not have read it correctly.",
  "Well, you have -- you have here L-I v. Montgomery, Li v. Montgomery -­",
  "Well, am I right or not in your opinion.",
  "Yes, and then your clients would be out there arguing, oh, but you, see you can't assign a future interests in the fruits from black acre; I mean, you can promise to do it, but black acre isn't even around yet. And so when somebody ran in and got those fruits, well, then now we have a fight; and in law the second person wins, and in equity maybe the first person can get an injunction. I don't know. But I guess people would raise that kind of argument, wouldn't they?",
  "So if fact -­",
  "The reason it's relevant you to, of course, if that's so, Senator Bayh and Senator Dole passed a law which could so easily be subverted by individual inventions and third-party companies that there might be a large class of cases where neither the university nor the government would actually get much of a benefit from research that the taxpayer had funded.",
  "Because?",
  "Because most people perhaps thought that they had made a valid assignment.",
  "But it's also remarkable the other way, that here we have many statutes that took the principle that when the government pays for an invention, the invention vests in the government. Now, there's that statute, that background. Not all of them, but some. NASA, various others.",
  "All right, that's fine.",
  "Yes, I know that; I know that; that isn't my point.",
  "My point is that it's somewhat remarkable because of this new statute, now that happens to only to inventions in those areas that are inventions of the contractor who, by the way, invents nothing. Human beings invent things, not entities like universities.",
  "And on your view what that means is it applies to nothing. It only applies to those things that the contractor freely or not freely decides to get from his employee -- if he uses the right words and so forth. That also seems a little surprising, that there could be such a hole in what used to be public ownership of such matters. I'm not -- I don't mean to be -- I started off sounding a little sarcastic. I didn't mean to be. I mean to be -- serious question.",
  "Your answer is not as bad as I think.",
  "And -- okay. Now.",
  "What about -- what about the provision that says there shall be -- this is a provision of the law, that the universities are supposed to enter into contracts, funding contracts with the government to make this thing effective. Hmm -- effective. Effective for what? Effective just to apply to some of the things that universities got money to pay for? Or to a lot of them, to all of them?",
  "It's my understanding here that -- that the problem in this case -- tell me if I'm wrong -- is because cocaine can become -- can be a salt. People sniff it often, I guess, if it's a salt. And that's bad. And then there's a kind that's worse, that's freebase or crack, and that isn't a salt and it isn't a poodle and it isn't an acid. It takes a base form, right?",
  "And so that's why they have a higher punishment. Then the odd problem is that maybe a cocaine leaf, but certainly cocaine paste, which are more primitive forms, also have a chemical-based solution, they too. So they've written this statute that sounds like -- that sounds like \"Who's your father's son who's not your brother?\" It takes a long time to figure it out. All right. So would you have an objection -- and I wonder if the other side would have an objection -- if what we said this word \"cocaine base\" in (iii) means is that it is cocaine in the chemical form of a base after it has been processed beyond the stage of coca paste? And that's how we read it. That would seem to exempt the things they're most worried about, the paste and the leaves. And I'm not going to repeat the same stupid joke, poodles and fruits, but you see the point. Is there any objection from the point of the government to define it in that way, or the other side? And why?",
  "No, I don't care how it was made. All we do is test it. Now, all we have to do is test it, and then we look to see if it's a leaf. That isn't tough, I don't think. And then we have to look and see if it's this yellow stuff that looks like paste, and I guess that isn't too tough, either. So those are the only things you have to do. You have to test it, look and see if it's a leaf, look and see if it's a paste. Now, even the -- I mean, I say \"even.\" I mean, certainly the DEA could do that.",
  "Certainly they could, right?",
  "No, that's what I want to know.",
  "We got that part. Right.",
  "That's fine.",
  "Can you make it in -­",
  "But you define it in your brief, and this is very interesting to me -- you talk about it being a yellow substance that came directly from grinding up leaves, something like that. You have the definition there. It's written. Take that definition that you wrote, and what you've said that's very interesting to me that I would like to know, is that, that substance, in some significant amount of time is actually more addictive, more dangerous than the salt, which is ordinarily sniffed? Now, is that what you're saying, because I received from this material the contrary impression. I had the impression that the yellow paste that comes from the leaf directly is, if anything, less addictive and less harmful, if anything, than the salt which you sniff. Now, which is it?",
  "Or if -­",
  "Go ahead.",
  "So now if I want to find a citation for the authority that paste, yellow, made out of leaves is in fact more dangerous and Congress could have thought that than -- more dangerous than ordinary salt sniffed, I will read what? Because that -- that -- I did have that wrong impression.",
  "Well, what you've referred to, in other words. I -- I mean, I trust your brief implicitly, but I don't know on the scientific matter or the congressional. I would like to know what to read on that.",
  "What page is that of the brief? You don't have to read it. I'll read it.",
  "Okay, I'll read that. Thank you.",
  "Yes, but she says there's no way -- and she does cite this professor from Yale and so forth, who says if the stuff has the base in it, it can be abused in ways that if it has the salt in it, it can't be abused. That's all we can look at.",
  "That's her point. That's her point. You can respond to that if you want.",
  "She says there is a reason. It's because it contains base, and for many years, it was smoked in Latin America and can be smoked here. That's her reason. Now, your response is, it's a bad reason?",
  "Same circumstance. Was there a seizure? No -- no professor -- no policeman?",
  "School nurse?",
  "Seizure?",
  "And so, it's not a seizure if exactly the same thing happens but there is no outside person there, but it is a seizure if there's an outside person?",
  "That's the rule as to whether there's a seizure?",
  "No, no, no, whether there's a seizure?",
  "Okay. What makes it a seizure? Go inside and speak to the principal, I saw you push the child at recess. We want to find out who was pushing you. Go inside and talk to the principal. Seizure?",
  "Everybody is going to stay 5 minutes after class, too much talking today. Seizure?",
  "Well, that's what I need to know, because I don't know see if there is no seizure, how it could have been an unreasonable thing, if there isn't even a seizure.",
  "You're not free to leave class.",
  "Go to the principal's office. Too much talking.",
  "Suppose that we dismiss the case as improvidently granted, while indicating in an opinion some of the questions that we find difficult such, for example, as the seizure question, et cetera; what kind of impact would that have in your opinion?",
  "Yes, if -- while indicating the reasons being in part that there are difficult questions here, suggesting what they are. What would the -- impact would that have?",
  "So what -- why -- imagine everything here is the same. That is, what I imagine happened here is that an individual wrote and asked for a FOIA request. Did Schindler Elevator file a certain kind of statement. And you say that's not a report. Now, imagine everything the same except the person who asks is called Joe Smith, fraud officer for the agency. Everything else is the same. Now is it a report?",
  "All right.",
  "That is exactly what happened here.",
  "No, no, it says, please tell me any documents that they filed that says da, da, da, something like that, okay? Now, we have the same thing, word for word, except the person who makes the request is not Mrs. Mary Jones from the public, the person who makes the request is the fraud officer for the agency that's worried about being defrauded. And all I'm interested in is, are they both not reports? Is one a report and not the other? Or are they both reports?",
  "I'm just telling you the facts. The facts are just what I said.",
  "Everything the same except he signs his name, \"fraud officer.\"",
  "All right. So, then, if a person who is an outside person gets a hold of two documents, one, the request, and two the response, which is to say, yes, I found 15 reports, they're all signed by Mickey Mouse, okay? And he bases a complaint, there is no such person as Mickey Mouse, it's a fraud, okay? Then you go right ahead and bring the qui tam because it wasn't falling within the exception. Is that right, in the Government's view?",
  "No, no, you're repeating -- I'm trying to show you what the problem is in my mind. I -- I can't quite work out the right definition, and that's what I'm trying to get enlightened on.",
  "I'm not trying to make a difficult question. All I want is your enlightenment about how when I write these two cases down, should I distinguish them? Should I say they're both the same or what?",
  "You say in most. In my circumstance -­",
  "In both circumstances.",
  "But it's not just -­",
  "It's not just chain of custody. I think the Chief Justice is trying to get at this problem, or I am: Lab technician Jones looks at a vial, and it's blue. She says to Smith, \"it's blue.\" Smith turns a lever on a machine to B. Jason sees the B and goes into court -- you make him go into court; that's our case. And what I wonder is, is the defendant now entitled to the following instruction: Jury, because he's in court, he can say that the machine read B, but that proves nothing about the vial, nothing. All it proves is what someone said in the laboratory to another person, and those two people aren't in court. Now, that's -- you see, that's the problem, I think, of the intermediate step. I'd either like to be told I'm wrong about that, you don't have to have them, or explain whatever you'd like.",
  "You might want that in order to show the machine says X, Y, Z, but that's only as good as the stuff that was put into it. So you're going to have to show that this was his blood put into it. And many, many people might have handled it, and there might be a routine so that they all check a box when it's sealed and they get it. Is it your understanding if you lose these cases -- this case that you then have to take into court all those people?",
  "Yes, but the reason I asked the question is because I don't think it is normally contested. It's normally a business record of some kind. However, what I was looking for is a distinction, because in the future I don't see why it wouldn't be contested, unless there's a distinction.",
  "Are there States -- are there States that do require a -- a -- a prosecutor to produce everyone who has handled something in a chain of custody at a -- at a laboratory, a criminal -- you know, normal business? Are there States that do require that? If so, could you tell me a couple, because I -­",
  "What about medical reports that are aimed at a particular known victim of a crime and thus will end up in trial? For example, a graph, a graph which the nurse keeps, which is a statement by the nurse that the patient's temperature on such and such a day was 98.6 or whatever, and normally that graph would be introduced; but are there any States that wouldn't require -- would say, oh, no, you have to produce the nurse? You have to produce the doctor for all medical records? Which of course, are known by the keeper that they will be used at the criminal trial. Are there any States that require that?",
  "Are there any States that require ordinary business records perhaps of the most ordinary kind, which always are statements that somebody did something on a particular day? When those business records happen to be kept before with the knowledge that they'll probably be introduced at the trial, are there States that require the man or woman who made the business record to come into court?",
  "Suppose -- suppose that a prosecutor reads the statute, there must be an affidavit that says this witness is material. And there is irrefutable evidence that the prosecutor said to colleagues and others: I do not intend to try this person, ever, no matter what; I just want to ask him questions. In that case, has the statute been violated because he is not material?",
  "I'm not saying it's this case. I'm saying it's a hypothetical case.",
  "And the reason it is not material is because the prosecutor has no intention whatsoever of ever bringing this person as a witness in any trial.",
  "All right.",
  "If materiality is violated, does not then that -- that prosecutor -- since he had no intention of bringing him to trial or of having him as a witness at a trial, that prosecutor would not be immune?",
  "-- yes.",
  "Well, how does -- how does it -­",
  "I would like to go back to the statute. If an officer fills out an affidavit for a search and says there were drugs in the house, so I want to search it, and it turns out he was lying, you would have a damages action?",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "No, no. I'm saying the officer, because he told a lie.",
  "All right. Now here it says that the person filling out the affidavit has to say he is a material witness. So suppose that the plaintiffs were to prove that the individual who signed that was not telling the truth in saying he is a material instant -- witness because not just but for, but there was no possibility he would call this individual, none. And that's what they have to prove. It's really very hard burden of proof. Now, one, would that interfere significantly with law enforcement? And, two, how do you distinguish it from the drug case?",
  "But in the case of the agent, you're prepared to say that we will allow the plaintiff to go into his motive to the extent that the plaintiff can show there is no possibility he intended to call this individual?",
  "Is there -- is there anything to be said for simplicity? The normal rule is when the police violate the Fourth Amendment you exclude the evidence. That's the rule. Then there are some exceptions, good faith, et cetera. But that's the normal rule. You have a new law in this Court. The new law says, now this is a violation; we didn't previously think it is, but it is; and that applies to the case in front us and to other cases on direct appeal. The reason that's simple is that's what we've always done. And somebody says let's make an exception here, bring in the exception, good faith, and we say no. Why? Not because any of the policy arguments are wrong, but just because, as this last 40 minutes demonstrates, once we do that it's so complicated, only 14 people are going to understand it and they're not going to understand it, either.",
  "That's very optimistic.",
  "So that's why, isn't it -­ that's why the normal rule has been that the person litigating the case gets the advantage of the new rule, as do other people whose initial appeals are not final, and there we are. That's a rule existing, I guess, for a long time. I guess these other people have to have raised the question in their case. They have to have asked for it. They can't -- they have to follow normal rules. Has that caused havoc, or has that caused things -- the legal system, even before -­",
  "I would have thought it was more for this Court, actually, anyway. I don't know if it has to be the words \"overruling.\" My recollection was: Has the Court created a new rule of law? I think it goes back to Cardozo, Sunburst or something, that if the Court creates a new rule of law, then does it apply prospective, retroactively? And the worked-out position was it applies retroactively, but to the litigant and to those whose appeals are not final if they raised it.",
  "And you want to change that, it seems to me.",
  "You're hiving off the -­ the suppression. I understand.",
  "I don't understand the answer you gave to Justice Alito. Maybe I mixed it up. The police stop the car without cause.",
  "So illegal stop. And you say as a result of the stop they found out all these things in the records, that he had no license, right?",
  "So that shouldn't be introduced into his trial for driving without a license.",
  "All right. Now the question I had heard put was, suppose after they got this information, they don't arrest him then, but he gets into the car again and starts driving. You said then they could arrest him?",
  "Is that right? Why? Why isn't -- why isn't that just as much the fruit of the poisonous tree? They found out he doesn't have a license by the record which came to them from an illegal stop. I just don't understand it. Did I get you right as to what you said?",
  "So therefore they couldn't arrest him. So what they do is they -- is that right?",
  "They see -- they see he -­ they stopped him, they get the records, wrongly. They see he has no license. He says: How did you know? Because we just looked at your license. That was illegal; good-bye, gets into the car and drives off, and they can do nothing?",
  "Is that right or not? Is that right?",
  "I -- how could they --­ they can impound the car.",
  "Because?",
  "Because?",
  "Well, what -- what is that word, the \"bad faith\"? I take it your rule is identical if when they wrongly stop the car, they look up the records, the records say he has no license, and in addition, he's wanted on 17 drug warrants and for 3 triple axe murders. Again, you can't do anything about it?",
  "What? Can you? You cannot do anything about it or you can?",
  "What? How?",
  "Why?",
  "So if, in fact, a policeman stops a person without cause and learns as a result of that that there are many warrants outstanding against him, he then can arrest the person, and -- but can he introduce those warrants into court as evidence or whatever if it's relevant?",
  "Suppose the way that the policeman stops the person and gets the information illegally is he takes an axe and breaks into the house, the policeman, and thereby -- what I'm showing -- I just think this case has lots of implications, and I'm looking for a rule here that's going to work in a lot of different situations.",
  "Well, you say that if, in fact, he learns that this man from the public records is a triple axe murderer -­",
  "-- he can do nothing about it, I said? And you said no, he can do something about it. I just wanted to know the distinction.",
  "It happens to be a description of the individual, not a warrant, he gets from the public record which is read off to him when he calls in, a description: A red tie. Can he use that and introduce it into evidence? I mean, is this case about -- what's it about, driving? Or does it have broader implications? I thought that the Court had held that any public record at all is immune. Is that right? Immune from the normal fruit of the poisonous tree rule.",
  "Yes, and I was testing that. I want to know: Is that, in your opinion, a correct rule in all cases?",
  "I mean, not an incorrect rule, the opposite rule. No rule.",
  "He made a mistake and said: I'm driving the car.",
  "He made a mistake. He said in court: I was driving the core -- car. He never should have said it. All right, now once he said it, now we know he's driving the car.",
  "So now you're saying why does this case even come up? Because once you have his name, the second he said it in court you could go up looking his -- you could go look at his -- his records anyway; you could find all these -- the facts about him which I guess could you bring in.",
  "So this case shouldn't be a special rule, it should just be a case of -- what is it called? It's a doctrine, you would have found it anyway; inevitable discovery.",
  "But they're only inevitably discovered if he makes a mistake of saying what his name is. No, no, not that -- the mistake of saying: I was driving the car. And then, as Justice Scalia pointed out, maybe you could suppress that, so it would -- it would -­",
  "Wait. One -­",
  "Why is -­",
  "Why? The facts of this case, I find confusing. Let's imagine the policeman goes with a hatchet and breaks into somebody's house illegally.",
  "And there, he sees on the desk the name is Dagwood. With other information, he goes to a certain alley and starts shouting \"Dagwood\" and people shower him with drugs. You have no doubt, if that is the fruit of the poisonous tree, an out, correct?",
  "I mean, that's how they -­ they knew the name, they got the evidence, they get to the place. Without the name, they wouldn't have gotten the drugs.",
  "Okay. Out, right?",
  "Yes, illegally. Very illegally.",
  "His name.",
  "Yes, correct.",
  "I just wondered if you were going to also say in my example, which I could make more realistic with more time, which you don't want to give me, the -- but -- that he uses the name, and as a result gets all kinds of evidence in the form of drugs, murder victims, whatever you want. Have you any doubt that that would be suppressible?",
  "They're not suppressible simply because you get them through a name? You break into a house, get a name; as a result of the name, you know what criminal enterprise to go to; as a result of that criminal enterprise going to, you get every evidence under the sun, absolute direct connection. And you say that's not suppressible?",
  "Okay, okay. I just wanted to know the ultimate response.",
  "Now assume it's the opposite response. If it's the opposite response, for state of argument, how is it any different whether he's showered with drugs or showered with government records?",
  "I know. I wanted you to assume the opposite. I got -- you win if my hypothetical -- if it's not even drugs, it's not even government records. But if it is drugs, why isn't it government records? This won't hurt you very much, because often there will be an alternative source, but suppose there isn't. Why are government records different from drugs?",
  "Well, what about this test which comes from three cases, the first being Berkemer, the second Stansbury, and the third I'll tell you in a second? It is that those -- what are -- in considering a reasonable person for this purpose and avoiding subjective states of mind, you would look at objective circumstances, known to both the officer and the suspect that are likely relevant to the way a person would understand his situation. All right? So both would be both mental illness and age and -- I don't know, whether you speak English, and a lot of other things would be relevant, provided they are things that are relevant to how a person would understand his situation and are known to both the officer and the individual. The third case, of course, is my dissent in Alvarez.",
  "But nothing in the majority conflicts with that, that I can see, except the holding. I thought I lost the case, but apparently it's up again, so I don't see why that isn't a perfectly good test. But if you're not going to support it, then I've got no support.",
  "No, no, but I mean what Justice Scalia was really asking is, do you favor something like this test that I read, which is open as to circumstance? Anything could fit in that blank, as long as both policemen and the -- and the individual know it and it is relevant as to how he understands the circumstance, whether he's likely free to go or not.",
  "Thank you. Yes, that's right.",
  "You would add none? No others? No other characteristics?",
  "Well, I mean here.",
  "There's a big sign jail cell, the door is unlocked. When you want to leave, leave. Is he in custody?",
  "Is he in custody? It's a jail cell, but a big sign, \"Go ahead, leave, go when you want.\" Is he free to leave?",
  "Yeah, so do I.",
  "I'll just tell you one other circumstance.",
  "He only speaks Spanish.",
  "Ukrainian is the only thing he speaks. Now are you willing to take that into account?",
  "Thank you. Now, I'll say another fact. Exactly the same, except there are very steep steps and he's in a wheelchair. Are you willing to take that into account?",
  "Okay. Then why aren't you willing to take into account an ambiguous situation as was true in Alvarado, a tough situation where it's pretty unclear; he was brought there by his parents and there are all these things around that might suggest to a 20-year-old, yeah, you could leave, but to a 12-year-old, \"no.\" If the judge can take into account whether he's in a wheelchair, whether he just speaks Ukrainian, whether in fact a thing -- you have to swim through a pool and he doesn't know how to swim -- I mean, all kinds of things like that; why can't he take into account in a proper situation before he thinks he's in custody or not, things they both know including whether he's 8 years old or 22?",
  "And it's obvious whether he's 8-year-old or 2 2, too. I'll tell you that.",
  "Right. And you have to think like a Ukrainian speaker or think like a -- a -- a -- like a person who knows he's in a wheelchair before you know he can't get up those steep steps.",
  "What is exactly the -- the difference?",
  "I haven't said that. What the opinion said, which unfortunately may mean nothing unless it's promoted to the status of majority, is you look to those factors that are relevant to, known to both policeman and the suspect, and are known to be relevant to the likelihood that a person -- a likely person, not him -- that are known likely relevant to an ordinary person's belief -- this kind of a person -­ that he thinks he's free to go.",
  "That's all. What's wrong with that?",
  "Well, if it's right, then you -­",
  "You know the sentence I'm referring to in my dissent, presumably? We hope. When I have set forth the test which was not accepted.",
  "I'm -- I live always in hope.",
  "Well, I mean, the thing about known to both and relevant to a likely belief as to whether he's in custody or not. Now, are you willing to accept that as a proper statement of the law?",
  "Fine.",
  "Well, then, perfect.",
  "Why? Why is that? We've seen two cases that seem like blue moon, once in a blue moon. Alvarado is a odd set of circumstances. And what is the terrible thing, the awful thing that has to happen if the officer isn't sure whether this individual thinks he's in custody or not? Suppose the officer just isn't sure. What terrible thing happens?",
  "What is the answer to that question?",
  "Oh, well, you over Mirandize. The terrible thing that happens is you have to give them a Miranda warning. Now -- now, that is the terrible thing. Now -- now -- now, why is that a burden on the criminal justice system that sometimes in ambiguous circumstances or because this kid is very young, he might not understand it quite as well, and the officer sees that, the kid sees it, and so the officer has to give him a Miranda warning.",
  "Now, what happens to destroy the criminal justice system? You can see from my overstatement, I tend to suspect nothing, but you tell me.",
  "Why not the first thing, hey, kid, we're here talking, but you want to leave, just open the door and leave. Go. Nobody's keeping you here. Why isn't that the first thing, if he's really free to go?",
  "Oh, oh, oh, I see, I see.",
  "He's not free to leave? Okay. Well, then, why not warn him?",
  "Why? Maybe you can explain this to me, too. You have a blind person there. Everyone -­ you don't know how blind. He's somewhat blind. A deaf person. How hard of hearing? We're not sure. So the policeman goes a little overboard. You are free to leave, or shows it to him, or makes sure he gets it in. Okay? Why is that so tough to do where you also have a 12-year-old? If he really is free to leave, just make clear that he knows it.",
  "But that isn't -- to me, anyway, that is not the question. I don't think anybody is asking anybody to think like anything else. All it is, when you face a younger child, and he is free to go, and you mean he's free to go, you just sort of err a little bit on the safe side and make sure he understands it. That's all. Nobody has to think like anybody. All they have to think is let's err somewhat on the safe side. Now why is that tough?",
  "It doesn't -- I'm still curious -- are you finished?",
  "Think of what the Government says should happen. You should give them a form and the form should say do you have money to pay or not. All right. So, what did happen? Did the judge ever ask him?",
  "Did he bring some proof of employment?",
  "All right. So, why would you put him in jail? He has no job.",
  "You mean he didn't believe him about what? That he had no money?",
  "Okay. So, he -- he thought he did have the money.",
  "Do we -­",
  "I'm actually trying to find -­",
  "Just out of curiosity -­",
  "Fine, but I'd like to ask a different question. I'm trying to find out what happened here that was different from what the Government suggests. The Government suggests provide a piece of paper and to ask certain questions. What I'd like to know is what's different in this proceeding from what the Government suggests?",
  "That would have -- perhaps on no one else, but could have an effect on the way I decide the case.",
  "I understand there was no -- look. If he asked the questions orally -­",
  "-- I might be tempted to say it doesn't matter. So, I'm trying to say what really differed from what the Government wants?",
  "And skip that one. What I'm trying to figure out -- and I'm sorry, I may be the only one trying to -- I'm trying to figure out what, in general, is the fairness of such situations in -- where the woman is normally the one with the child, the man is normally the one who doesn't pay. Is it true, for example, that in most such situations across the country, the woman has a lawyer, but the man doesn't? Is that true or isn't it true? There must be some organization that's studied that.",
  "Okay. So, the answer to what I think of, in my own mind only, as very relevant, whether the woman has a lawyer but the man doesn't, is: I don't know.",
  "And that is the answer? We don't have good information on that?",
  "Okay. Fine. Yes.",
  "Did anybody look at housing courts?",
  "I mean, housing courts -- I would think it's fairly common somebody owes somebody $25, or whatever it is, the judge says pay it into court, and what happens if they don't pay it into court?",
  "Is there a case like that?",
  "Yes, but I mean somebody might think that having to go off and patrol a thing in a rough area is something that happens with a sudden stop: You run a risk of turning your leg. I agree with you about the snake. Is there any case about the snake?",
  "Okay. So the furthest -­ the furthest -- the furthest that you go is the case of sudden stop in the wilderness, gets off, rough area, and twists his ankle.",
  "I don't know. Is that proximate cause or not? Maybe it isn't.",
  "You could have been bitten by a snake when you're getting out of t car.",
  "But there has been no such case, to your knowledge?",
  "As I read the statute -- as I read the statute, it insists, as interpreted in Rogers, that the negligence has to play a part in producing, and in the snake case the negligence doesn't matter. It's simply the timing, et cetera. And is -­ that's how I read it.",
  "And I guess that's how courts have read it. I'm not sure; you know. And I suspect from the answers I've gotten so far there's never been a court that read it differently.",
  "I don't know if they said this, but I mean, as I read it, I thought the reason that negligence doesn't play a part is the act which was negligent played a part, of course; it was \"but for\"; but the fact that it is negligent is totally irrelevant, because it's not within the risk in any sense whatsoever. Now as I -- you know the area. I don't put -- don't just agree with me because I'm saying it. Is that roughly the -­",
  "How about eggshell skull?",
  "It is not foreseeable.",
  "You're just saying, it's all foreseeable, not foreseeable.",
  "Can you -- can you tell me on that, because I take it you agree with Justice Ginsburg about Buckley. In Buckley the Court says, public financing is a means of eliminating the improper influence of large private corporations, furthers a significant government interest. We both agree that's what it says?",
  "I take it that's what it means. All right. Now, your objection is how much do they pay.",
  "Here they have a trigger, not -- not quantitatively. But here they say it's okay to finance a public candidate publicly, okay to do that. Now, what we're going to do is give them a million dollars to start with, up to $3 million to spend, depending on how much their opponents spend. Now, you think that's unconstitutional? My question to you is, what would be a constitutional system in your opinion?",
  "That would be helpful.",
  "I'm not interested in Buckley. I'm interested in your opinion. You object to the amount being paid in installments. What, in your opinion, would be a constitutional system? I don't need to repeat my question, which I just did, but I want that answer, your answer to that.",
  "Do you think that if Joe Smith doesn't have much money, takes public finance at all, that that could discourage some other people, Brown and Johnson, from running?",
  "No, there's not -- it's not going to -- it's not going to be a situation where government paying a million dollars to Smith to help him in the campaign would discourage some other person from running?",
  "If we -- if we say, you can file a brief and if you do, other people can file, is that my -- forget the briefs. It's too farfetched.",
  "I did -- I did think you would give the other answer, to tell you the truth, because I just don't see why giving somebody a million dollars might not discourage a -- a poorer candidate from running.",
  "No, no. Joe, the guy who wants it, it's voluntary for him; but his opponents can't do anything about that. I'm just saying Joe takes the money, so Brown and Smith say: Oh my God, he has a million dollars, forget it. I'll stay home. I won't run.",
  "And you say that just doesn't happen?",
  "Never happens? Okay.",
  "And I gather that people who have looked into the Arizona scheme also say what you think will happen never happens, either.",
  "So should we look at both instances?",
  "And what about -- it's a general question. Answer this if you wish. Don't if you don't want to, and the same goes for your opponent. But as I hear this argument, what's going through my mind is we are deeply into the details of a very complex bill. McCain-Feingold is hundreds of pages, and we cannot possibly test each provision which is related to the others on such a test of whether it equalizes or incentivizes or some other thing, because the answer is normally we don't know. And it is better to say it's all illegal than to subject these things to death by a thousand cuts, because we don't know what will happen when we start tinkering with one provision rather than another. That thought went through my mind as I've heard this discussion. Comment or not upon it as you wish.",
  "Is the -- is the common question of law or fact whether, given the training which central management knew -­",
  "-- given the facts about what people say and how they behave, many of which central management knew, and given the results which central management knew or should have known, should central management under the law have withdrawn some of the subjective discretion in order to stop these results?",
  "If that is a fair way to put it, is that a question that every one of the women in this class shares in common?",
  "If you just spend one second, remember my question. We've got a common issue. Why isn't that enough at least to support a (b)(2) injunctive action?",
  "That sounds like the merits you're getting to. His point, remember, is this is just certification. So, my question is: Assuming they can support it with evidence, why can't they have their (b)(2) class, at least on an injunctive relief?",
  "That's what I wondered. You haven't really argued that, so maybe I'm missing something, and this question may be better for the other side, but this statute, as you go through it, has some elements. The first are facts about the world, killing people; the second has to do with intent, and then they talk about all these different things to stop him from going to a Federal officer; the third says no state of mind need be proved with respect to the fact he works for the Feds. So, therefore, it's not part of intent. Now, if it's a circumstance that is an element of the offense and it is not part of the intent of the defendant, then isn't it an element, like all other elements, that you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt?",
  "You didn't argue it, so nobody's ever adopted this, so I feel I might be barking up the wrong tree. Now, I grant you, you're not the leaf on the tree that's going to give me the answer I need, which is why I'm wrong, but -- but did you -­ you've researched this and haven't really argued this point. So, why not?",
  "I take it you were not the trial lawyer?",
  "Oh, you were?",
  "Anyway, you've made a fine argument here, even if you didn't make it -­",
  "Okay, where do we get this -­",
  "I do have a question I would like to ask at some point. Are you finished?",
  "Because this is very interesting. I normally think purpose is important. In this one I don't, and suppose I'm right, purpose has nothing to do with this. The problem here is with the words \"intent\" and \"prevent.\"",
  "And it's how they're used in ordinary English. So let me give you an example, even odder than Justice Alito's. But I think it illustrates the point -- the question. Imagine you put your son in his room, and they say why do you keep your son in his room doing his homework? Because I wanted to prevent him from going to the movies. That's why. Now, when you say that, we would impute, correctly, you wanted to prevent him from going to a Hollywood movie. You wanted to prevent him from going to an old movie, prevent him from going to a new movie, but prevent him from going to a Lithuanian movie? Now, why does that sound so odd? Because there's no realistic possibility that he would go to a Lithuanian movie. Okay.",
  "Now, if that's the problem, if that's the problem, the words that capture that problem, are their words \"realistic likelihood,\" not the words \"possibility.\" So if I have to choose between those two, and that is the problem, why don't I choose their solution?",
  "All right.",
  "They use realistic likelihood and if someone were to tell me in my odd example there is no realistic likelihood he would go to a Lithuanian movie, that seems to describe perfectly whether I would or would not say in trying to prevent him from going to the movies, you try to prevent him from going to a Lithuanian movie. And your -- yours doesn't -- I mean it's a -- I agree it may not make that much difference, but we have to choose some form of words.",
  "No, it wouldn't have been okay, but you don't normally say of a person when a thing is really weird, but he wants it to happen that doesn't do it for that -- it's so unlikely. I shoot an arrow into the air hoping it will fall on my enemy. All right? It's not going to. But if it does, we say he intended it. You see, that -- that's the kind of linguistic problem that I think is present.",
  "It's not awkwardly constructed. It's trying to get odd possibilities, and if it is trying to get those odd possibilities about which we normally would say he did intend to prevent that from happening, then those things we're trying to leave out are those where there is no realistic possibility that they would happen.",
  "Then let's take their words.",
  "I think the question was.",
  "I'm slightly regretting bringing that up.",
  "You agree basically on the point?",
  "I think where you have -­ where somebody tries to prevent a general thing, we normally say you also prevent -- tries to prevent those things that are specific that fall within the general term, but not every oddball example.",
  "And what you want is something that rules out the oddball examples. And your words are \"reasonable likelihood,\" and you'll say if it's an oddball example, you can't hold him guilty of that, if it turns out that in this case the Federal example is an oddball example. My question really is to you: If you win on that, then are you going to go back and argue there was not one piece of evidence whatsoever that there was any reasonable likelihood that the Feds would investigate your case?",
  "So what are you supposed to do if your company happens by chance to come across a very, very high correlation between people who take your generic drug and who get seriously ill? And now what you know is that nobody else has really found that, but, my goodness, there you are; it happened that it was associated, a special group or something. What are you supposed to do?",
  "And so are they saying that you -- is it conceded in this case that you did tell the FDA everything you knew about that?",
  "Or is that a point in dispute?",
  "Well, how would it conflict? Suppose the State said: Here is what we want; we notice that it says in the Federal law that you must keep your warnings up to date, and if you find an association, you must revise your warning. Now, we understand you can't do that without FDA approval. But as far as our State is concerned, we think that when you come across this serious problem you have to tell the FDA in some form or other, a reasonable form, about it. Would that law -- is there anything Federal that that law would conflict with?",
  "What I wonder -- see, I wonder if that's this case. I wonder if this case is what they're saying is: Oh, we concede you told the FDA every single thing, so they were just as informed as you are about the risks here, but you did not add the words: And please change our -- your permission, so that we can change the warning. Is that what this case is about?",
  "When they come up here they might say this isn't just what this case is about.",
  "Yeah.",
  "So your argument is that if we run across this tremendous, really serious -- I can make an imaginary as serious as you want -- really a serious problem, and you're saying the State has no right to say -- even if we purposely didn't tell anybody, they can't get involved because they can't get involved with our failure to tell the FDA anything because that's Federal, and we can't -- they can't get involved with our failure to try to change the warning because that's taken care of by our obligation to tell them, which we didn't fulfill?",
  "It appears also that the -­ it's Buckman, it seems to me, the relevant case, not Wyeth, because what -- if -- you're now saying, I've learned, that -- that they have a set of FDA duties; they must tell the FDA every detail.",
  "That sounds awfully familiar to Buckman, where the State claim was basically a claim of fraud on the FDA. And we said it's not up to the State to -- to -- they can't bring -- have a claim for fraud on the FDA. The FDA has to enforce their own stuff. And why isn't the same true here, that the FDA has to enforce their own legal requirement to tell us everything you know? What's the answer to that?",
  "No, because Levine involves the Wyeth case, right?",
  "No. The -- the difference there is the difference that the SG points out: There is a broad-ranging obligation for the initial drugmaker to tell the FDA all kinds of things and change the warnings. But here the FDA tells us they have no power to change their warnings. They can't, unlike Levine. They have to copy the original maker. So -- I'm -- I'm just referring there to the whole SG brief.",
  "Be sure you answer, please, my original question.",
  "Suppose they had. Suppose that -- is a generic required to file adverse incident reports?",
  "Okay. Now, imagine a company that files every adverse incident report, complies completely; period. Now, in your view does it have an additional obligation?",
  "And what is that?",
  "Okay.",
  "Now, their argument is that in respect to their failure to do the first, that's Buckman. That is similar to Buckman.",
  "Now. And that's what I -­ now, as to the second, it just doesn't add anything. The FDA has all that information.",
  "All right. Now, why is it?",
  "Your basic argument, I'm getting this now, that -- I think -- is that the failure is, where State law has a right to enter, is to require them to keep track of adverse incidents and other things in the -- and do their best to change the label, which will consist of going to the FDA, likely, and asking them to change.",
  "Where would I read this? As I read the statute, the statute says the cheap system here is where they provide -- they have a duty to provide the incumbent interconnection, okay? That requires some physical stuff.",
  "Okay. And they have to -- they -- you have to -- you're not charged a lot for that; there's a limit on what they can charge you for the interconnection.",
  "Now, somebody is going to have to decide whether if Pacific Tel and Tel is being tried to forced to connect with Maine, you know, they have to pay for a wire across country to get the interconnection or not. That seems unreasonable. Across the street, maybe they do. My candidate would normally be the FCC or some regulator decides that kind of thing, and it's up to them to say whether this is or is not what's needed for interconnection. That would be an intuitive account I would have, without having read the statute in depth. So, now what do I read to find out how this works? What is it that distinguishes something that is ridiculous, like my California example, from something that makes a lot of sense, like they're next door and have to make 50 feet of wire.",
  "Michigan blue --",
  "Where -- where -- 28a, okay.",
  "Okay. So, it's up to the State commission.",
  "This is the FCC speaking?",
  "All right. And the State commission says -- they say it's up to the State commission. And the State commission here said?",
  "Do you read --",
  "Can I go back to my question? Because I haven't gotten an answer.",
  "You see, I would think -- you said, well, this is an existing facility.",
  "But my intuition would be that makes no difference whatsoever. You could have some kind of mechanism that connects two companies. Now, half of it is a simple wire and half of it is bells and whistles. And so, we have to decide which part is the part that's necessary for the interconnection and which part is some kind of -- well, I don't know, extra bells and whistles, and therefore, since it's not an impairment kind of problem, they have to pay full price for it. That, again, seems like the kind of job that Congress would leave up to a commission, but I guess I want you to tell me: Who's to decide that kind of thing, and how do we decide it?",
  "I don't know what it is. Often, these things are not distance. Often, a connection is all kinds of complex things, you know? And some are necessary and some aren't. But I can -- can't you imagine with me the same kind of California problem arising, but it just arises in -- in kind, rather than in distance?",
  "My -- if I'm so far off base you can't get the question, forget it.",
  "I mean, I might not be able to get an answer.",
  "You don't have to think it's that.",
  "Where do I find that?",
  "So, what's the definition difference between entrance facility and interconnection facility? How do we know which is which?",
  "No, no, I'm not. I want to know what's the difference. Tell me in English what the difference is.",
  "No, no. I mean, how do we know which is which? We see some big lines and stuff in it; how do we know which is which?",
  "I don't -- what I -- there's no way for you all to go to the FCC and decide what part of this thing is -- or any State regulator, what part of it is -- part of what's necessary to facilitate interconnection and what part of it is really providing the work primarily of the -- simply transporting services?",
  "What part is doing something else?",
  "There's no way to do that?",
  "Okay, so a judge has to say, on the basis of what, on the basis -- the judge has to say on the basis of the statute, which just uses the word \"interconnection\"?",
  "Yes. But the -- the --",
  "It doesn't help because it's a network element if it's in (3), and what this is, is something that's going to be needed to -- to interconnect. If it's -- if it's in -- if it's in the first one. And I don't know which is which, and I gather that sometimes it would be tough. And what courts use to do with the ICC when they got into this kind of situation is a doctrine called primary jurisdiction, and they'd ask them for a brief. All right? So, if that's what we've done hypothetically, we have the brief.",
  "Now, why don't we have to follow the brief?",
  "That's not what the statute says. The statute says the carriers have a duty to provide interconnection.",
  "Now, in carrying out a duty to provide, you say that's just picking a point. Somebody could equally well say, no, it's a duty to provide means to get to the point. Now, either of those seem equally consistent with the language.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, it doesn't say that, but it doesn't say the opposite. And, therefore, you might have an agency reasonably deciding that to provide -- to fulfill that duty, you must provide equipment reasonably necessary to allow the competitor to connect. That's equally sensible.",
  "Yes.",
  "Apparently, you have an agency that never really said one way or the other.",
  "I don't see what the other -- I didn't hear anything that said they said the other. They've said when you have wires and you're using the wires for communication, then they don't fall outside this; that's true. But if you're using them for interconnection, and they're necessary to use for interconnection, maybe it does fall inside this. I don't --",
  "Excluded -- they excluded transport -- all transport to the point of interconnection, where you could not provide the facility to interconnect unless you had the transport? Is that what they did?",
  "Did they do that? Yes or no? I bet the answer is no.",
  "All right.",
  "But there are -- there are cases, I think, in primary jurisdiction where what a district court has done, anyway, is to hold the case while the ICC went and had a proceeding. And I'm sure that hasn't been used in a long time.",
  "It is?",
  "Well, maybe this is the case for it.",
  "It all didn't matter because, in fact, they got the TELRIC rates under (c)(3) until they changed the impairment part?",
  "So, who cared? And now after that, they care.",
  "And now -- now -- now the other side cares, of course. And so, now -- now we're faced with a situation where they're just putting this in the brief for the first time, but they can't base it on anything the commission actually did?",
  "Amd I'm glad it's right because I don't know what I'm talking about.",
  "I have one question here I would like to get your view on. I'll assume that the language is open enough in the history so that we could make what would be a change, I think it would be a change. The reasons as I get from the brief for doing that are because there are two types of errors: It's a bad thing not to give protection to an invention that deserves it; and it is just as bad a thing to give protection to an invention that doesn't deserve it. Both can seriously harm the economy. And you are also saying that the Patent Office is out of control, not through its own fault, but there are too few people and too many inventions. And therefore type two error is a real risk. So I'm turning you to and say: Well, what should we do about it? I know your proposal. But we have also seen in these briefs the following proposal: One, somebody who thinks there is a type two error, go back to the Patent Office and ask for reconsideration. That's pretty good. We get the experts to look at it again. And then that's coupled with: Tell the district judges to stick very closely to their job, allow the clear and convincing standard to apply to facts, and by that we mean brute facts, and let them decide the brute facts, but let the judge decide whether that amounts to obviousness, novelty, or any of the other prerequisites. Now, I've gotten that out of the amicus briefs, some of which say they support you but they really don't. So I would like -- I would like your views on those two suggestions as being sufficient to cure the problem that you point to.",
  "I'm getting that out of the American Intellectual Property Law Association. I don't blame them for my phrasing of it, but that is what struck the thought in my mind that careful instructions limiting the juries to brute facts and giving the judge the notion, the job of characterizing that -- you heard what I said -- that that will go a long way towards curing the problem you're worried about.",
  "It might not in your situation. But the problem is in principle as it's put to us that the office and the Federal Circuit emerge giving protection to things that aren't really novel, that aren't really advances on the prior art, et cetera. Now, if that's the problem, and you carefully instruct the jury, the bad fake patents will go away because the judge will say: Look, this metal case called a battery leakproof is not really novel.",
  "No, no. The judge says: I want you to find if this metal container is leak proof. Jury: Yes. Now it's up to the judge.",
  "All those first principles are along the lines of how important patents are and what a disaster is it is to the person once they're invalidated. Okay. I think the other side will say: In today's world, where nobody really understands this technology very well, a worse disaster for the country is to have protection given to things that don't deserve it because they act as a block on trade, they act as monopolies, and they will tie the country up in individual monopolies that will raise prices to consumers, et cetera. You can imagine my spelling out this argument.",
  "So I can't work out in my own mind whether in today's world these first principles cut for the patentee or cut for the challenger to the patent.",
  "And the first are not?",
  "What about the rule where -- I'm trying this on, I don't buy it necessarily -- the -- the heightened standard exists where the Patent Office did consider it or could have considered it had the infringer asked for reconsideration? In other words, put the burden on the infringing party to use this procedure, and if he does use it, it's going to get a heightened burden if he loses -­",
  "And if he doesn't use it, it should get a heightened burden because he should have used it.",
  "The statute itself doesn't -- we're all going on history here, I mean, and history brought up to date with the words of the statute I don't think cover it either way. They talk about presumption, but put that to the side.",
  "I wanted your opinion on that as the validity or a useful instruction for juries.",
  "I'm not asking that question. I'm asking the question of whether in your experience as a patent lawyer or -- would -- what we're trying to do is we're trying to get a better tool, if possible, to separate the sheep from the goats. That's what we're after, I think, and so what is that better tool?",
  "Well, the Senate report says that the provisions we've been talking about make clear a defendant should not be sent to prison only because the prison has a program that might be good for him. Drug dependence in the committee's view generally should not play a role in the decision whether or not to incarcerate the offender. Is there something that conflicts with that? Because that was pretty clear indication of the committee's view.",
  "You put a great deal of weight on the word only. I guess if it's a dual motive we don't really know what would have happened in the absence of one of the motives. So should we send the whole thing back for resentencing?",
  "Can the courts set a tax?",
  "Well, I suppose cost-effective -- suppose your complaint is the same but you alleged, what I get from reading these might be the best way to deal with the problem. I would like the court to impose a tax of $20 a ton on carbon, right? And we bring all the polluters in, and the same injury that you have, everything's the same, you have 14 experts who say this is how to get it done. It's cost-effective, it will lead to substitution, it will actually bring about a world without global warming, and so let's do it. Now, does the district judge, in your opinion, have the power to enter that order?",
  "All right, now next question is going to be, if he does not have the power to enter that order, which could be proved to be extremely effective, and least possible harm to the consumer, why does he have the power to enter the order you want?",
  "Oh, this will. This is addressed to that. It says abate the nuisance, here's how you're going to do it. You're going to put a $20 a tax ton on carbon, and lo and behold, you will discover that nuisance will be abated. And we bring in 15 economists.",

  "Suppose we have the Union Trust Company, a private company that has 5,000 trust accounts. One day the president of the company says to the lawyer: Mr. Smith's account is in a special situation. Will you please look into what we should do for him as trustee? There's no implication for any other account. There's no threat of litigation. I just want to know what we're supposed to do. Now, I take it the document that is subsequently written would be open for Mr. Smith to get; is that right?",
  "Yes, okay. Now, why should the government be treated differently were the situation identical to what I just proposed?",
  "I would like to get an answer to my question.",
  "My question, to go back to it, was imagine that the government has a thousand trust accounts for a thousand tribes.",
  "And imagine that several of them consist of nothing more than $500,000 in cash.",
  "And one day the Secretary of the Interior says to a lawyer: I fear there is kind of a difficult fiduciary problem arising into account number 302, which is owned by such and such tribe. There is no threat of litigation. As far as I can tell, the answer to this will have no implication for anything else in the government. Will you please look at it and give me a memo what to do? Now, why should that memo not be given to the lawyer for the tribe if in the identical case of the Union Trust Company you would give the lawyer -- the memo to the beneficiary?",
  "You're saying, one, we're not really a trustee totally?",
  "Okay. Now, if we treated -- the courts treated you as a trustee really and totally -­",
  "-- in this very limited situation I described, what harm would befall the government?",
  "I have a question on that particular point, and there may be an obvious answer to this which I just couldn't find. But if the lawyer is in the government and he writes a memo, then -- and if it's available to a litigant who litigates against the government, as it would be here, then why isn't it available to the entire world via the Freedom of Information Act?",
  "That's certainly true, they're not. But I just wonder, what is it in FOIA that would make this not available to the world?",
  "Well, that just -- that just says it may or may not be coextensive. Reading the statute, it says you have to make all inter- agency or all memos available of a certain type, which I think this would fall into. Then exception 5 protects, among other things, attorney-client memos that are privileged because they're inter-agency or intra-agency memos that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation.",
  "Now, they are available if you win. And so, if you win that exception doesn't seem to apply. And if it doesn't seem to apply, that's what was -- then the whole world can get this memo. And what I'm wondering is there must -- either there is a very obvious answer to that, which there could be, or there isn't. If there is an obvious answer, that's the end of it.",
  "If there isn't an obvious answer, I'll have to go away and worry about it.",
  "I know you don't want that, and what I'm looking is how you prevent that.",
  "Does that happen a lot? I mean, I -- I -- I'm not -- does that happen a lot? I mean, are there a lot of instances where the lawyers who work for all -- the retirement funds are huge. There must be cases coming up all the time. And all the advice of the lawyers is just available -­",
  "I know that. I'm just worried about the -- the attorney-client privilege is somewhat sacred, and suddenly making everything available to the whole public has got me worried.

  "Is that in the -­",
  "How am I going to find it? I couldn't get how you spell it.",
  "Can I -- I'm trying this question out. Try to give me your best answer. If I don't have it clear enough, just forgive it and go on to another. As I'm understanding this case with Basic, the idea is there is a presumption. Somebody lies and says there's an oil well I found oil in. A lot of people buy on the stock market. It turns out there was no oil, and a lot of people say they lost money. All right. The point of the stock market presumption is to say: Smith, you're a typical plaintiff and this presumption is going to help you by the following. We're going to say what happened to the typical person on the stock market during that period happened to you, and there are a lot of people who bought and sold on the stork market. And that's why efficient markets is needed to show at the certification stage, because if there weren't certification -- if that isn't shown, the whole thing falls apart. But what you're just saying on terms of whether the revelation lowered the price has nothing to do with the question of what happened to the typical person, Smith, happened to you, nothing to do with it. It has to do with whether anybody was hurt. Now, that has nothing to do with the certification stage. That's the win or lose stage. Now, that's how I'm understanding it at the moment. So what's wrong with the way I understand it?",
  "Does your rule apply in all fraud cases? That is, a thousand farmers say, Mr. Jackson was our common buying agent, and the defendant lied to Mr. Jackson, and he relied on the lie. It is a common issue whether he relied on the lie or he didn't rely on the lie. I can understand somebody saying at the certification stage they have to see whether he's really a common agent. But let's imagine that's assumed. The only question left is, did he rely or not rely? Is that a question for the merits or is that a question for the common -- for the -­",
  "So you're saying in the case that I just gave you reliance is for the merits?",
  "Whether he really relied or didn't rely, the common agent is for the merits?",
  "Is that -- is that your answer is?",
  "No. A thousand people say Mr. Jackson is our common buying agent, and the defendant lied to this common buying agent, and he represented us. Relied on that. I'm asking if you that issue of reliance in an appropriate case is for the certification stage?",
  "Yes.",
  "And they also have to prove there is a lie?",
  "Okay.",
  "All right, suppose -­ suppose that the Federal Trade Commission after a 3-year study of pharmaceutical manufacturing practices, decides -- finds the following. They say: We have found that when drugs are sold to doctors it is very important that the doctor find out what's curable, what the drug does, how much it costs; and by the way, all those things apply no matter who the doctor is. Who the doctor is, is irrelevant. And therefore marketing that focuses upon who the doctor is and what his previous practices were is irrelevant and harmful and false; and therefore we find that it is a false and deceptive practice under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to use the following prior practices of the doctor in selling him new drugs, because it's irrelevant and because it's false and because it's harmful. And they enact that as a -- as a rule of the Federal Trade Commission. Does the Constitution of the United States forbid them, having made those findings in detail, from controlling advertising to prevent what they have determined is a false and misleading practice?",

  "They could do that?",
  "All right, fine. If they could do that, why can't they do this?",
  "Well, this is information -- see, this is information that starts off being collected because the government requires it to be collected. So it's there for that reason. And the government says we want you to get this information, it's done for this purpose, so, you know, other purposes, and we don't want it to be used for commercial advertising purposes. That's what they say they've done in this statute.",

  "Yes.",

But my -- my basic question is, as you know, with judges, and I guess you have a very vague statute which was quoted to you, and what we have are subsidiary rules with ethics commissioners. I have in my office -­ they're not commissioners; they're committees of judges. And I have in my office seven volumes which I look at when there's a question, as others do, and those seven volumes contain dozens of opinions of a committee trying to apply vague statutes and vague rules -- not constitutionally vague, but generally. So what's wrong with Nevada doing exactly the same thing here?",
  "Oh, so you're saying that the difference is that we're judges?",
  "You mean Congress and legislators and Executive Branch people couldn't have exactly the same system?",
  "And they have general rules? It's called the common law system.",
  "You didn't answer my question, which is since the Judiciary uses what's called the common law method, why is it impermissible for the Executive Branch or the Legislative Branch also to use a common law, case-by-case method of elucidating through example what a general -- what a general provision means?",

  "I think his argument is -- I don't see -- that the Ethics Commission at least in part relied upon the fact that he was the campaign manager, and he is saying, I think, as I understand it, or at least I have this question, that an ethics commission cannot disqualify a legislator on the ground, even in part, that an individual had a political association with him previously.",
  "It may be a new argument in this Court, I don't know.",
  "Is that a new argument in this Court, as I've stated it to you?",
  "You made that argument below?",
  "Why?",
  "I'm -- I'm not certain of this. I find this a difficult case. It seems to me the Government is prepared to concede that if an individual has a Federal right that he'd like to enforce and someone is trying to block it by asserting a State law that he thinks is pre-empted, he can go ahead. If it looks as if the State is going to take something from him that a Federal law guarantees and he has a defense that he'd like to make to that under Federal law, the State law that seems to allow it is pre-empted, he can make it. Our problem arises where neither of those things is true. So, we say, what is true here? What kind of Federal claim does he have? And the word is that rates have to be -- that the rate that the State has to pay back to the doctor has to be \"sufficient.\" Okay, \"sufficient.\" That's basically the word.",
  "All right. So, I see three possibilities. One is you say, sure, let all the doctors go and sue. There are only 50,000 kinds of reimbursement. Maybe there are a million. I don't know how many. And they only take place in, what, say, 400,000 counties. And we will have Federal judges reaching different views about what is sufficient in each of those different places. And sometimes they will agree. Did Congress want that? Well, hmm, a problem. The second way of going about it is cure that and say: You win, but you have to use primary jurisdiction, and you have to get the government's view on it, Judge; and before you decide, you have to pay attention.",
  "There's a long line of cases. I have one more thing --",
  "-- then you'll get all three.",
  "Yes.",
  "If I want your view, I want your view on whether the right approach -- you're saying what's the status quo pending. And I want your view on these three possibilities.",
  "One is the possibility the judges just do it in all the different places, try to figure out what's sufficient. The second is the possibility that we try primary jurisdiction, and that's the -- then the curlicue on that is what do you do pending? And, you know, that's your injunction.",
  "Yes, yes. And the third possibility is you say: I'm just sorry that the -- this is just too vague, the \"sufficient\" et cetera. It has to be centralized. There's no way to work this out with all these different judges and different kinds of rates and different kinds of provisions. And so, this is an instance where you cannot bring your claim that something violates the Supremacy Clause because you don't have a Federal right to a thing, and they're not trying to take away a thing that the Federal right gives you, et cetera. All right. Do you see those three possibilities?",
  "And what I wanted you to do is to address them.",
  "Yes.",
  "You think primary jurisdiction is the way to do it.",
  "You see, I see a practical problem, and I'm -- the practical problem is millions of rates all judged by the term \"sufficient,\" and instead of the agency in charge deciding what's sufficient, we do have a lot of judges.",
  "Right.",
  "There must be a limit. There must be a limit because if there is not a limit on what you can do under Ex parte Young, I can go in my office and I look at the statute books and they are just filled with statutes, and I -- Federal; and if I had all the State statute books, it would be 15 offices or 20 or 100. And I know perfectly well that a lot of those statutes in the Federal books have to do with agencies, and they give jobs to agencies, and it's perfectly apparent that the ones who run those statutes in many instances are the agencies, and really judges are out of it. Now, if I adopt your line, it seems to me I am saying that any time that a person has an individual of saying that a State law is contrary to one of those statutes, he can run right into court. And I can see we've done that where he has some kind of right that he's protecting that's threatened in some way or that he wants to assert. I can see that we could do that in the foreign policy case like Burma; I can see that we could do that where Federal voting rights are at stake, which are very important. But a principle that says you can do that any time you want seems to me a little -- it's -- it seems to me the real fear of far-reaching in this extent that it just stops the agency from doing their business at the behest of anyone who would like to assert a State law, or States -- it's a mess, in other words.",
  "No, no. Your people have your problem.",
  "But some other people have another problem.",
  "The doctors want to be paid more money or at least not paid as much as they were; I understand that.",
  "Yes.",
  "So, is there a medical exception?",
  "Is there a medical exception? Is it that you can have this generalized claim if you're a doctor, but not others?",
  "That doesn't mean -- that doesn't mean SORNA doesn't apply; it means 2250 doesn't apply.",
  "Is that right?",
  "I mean, it might be a metaphysical, but it may be that Congress intended the statute to apply to people like your client, but the question is when the initial registration has to take place. And I took you as saying until the Attorney General acts, we don't know. So, 2250 doesn't -­ doesn't criminalize a failure until he can know when he's supposed to register.",
  "That's right. Okay.",
  "So, why -­",
  "So -­",
  "Leaving the language aside, I'd like to go back to what Justice Sotomayor was asking. We are talking, it seems to me, about section 2250. He was convicted of violating, criminally, that section. So, I have no problem about the statute applying to all these people; it's a question of how it applies. All right. Imagine with me that we have an individual who was convicted a year ago and sentenced to a 5-year term. Does the statute apply to him?",
  "Yes, correct.",
  "Yes, correct.",
  "Of course, it does. Of course, it does. Now, he hasn't registered yet. He's in jail for 4 more years. So, has he violated 2250 so far?",
  "Not? Thank you. So, a person who has recently -- recently -­ committed the crime, is in prison, is under an obligation to register, is yet not in violation because the time for initially registration -- registering has not yet expired. Now let's go back to a person who is far less certain how it applies. He committed the crime 10 or 15 years ago. He has long since been released from prison. There are, as you point out, several categories. One is a person who has to -- who should, under Michigan State law, register, but he didn't. Another is a person who did and moved. You know, there are several categories. Now, is he in violation of 2250? Your point is he is immediately, even though it was much less clear that it applied to him, much less clear. And much less clear -- in fact, it doesn't say when he is supposed to register, but still 2250 applies to him. I just wonder how that could be, particularly when we have three sentences, indeed, which seem to me to tell the Attorney General, certainly, please deal with that kind of a case.",
  "I thought he was convicted of a crime.",
  "I thought he was convicted of a crime under 2250. That's why I asked the question. And his lawyer said, in response to my question, that one of the things she wants to argue is that he cannot be convicted under 2250 until he is under a legal obligation to register, and that initial registration is not a legal obligation until the Attorney General makes his rules. I thought that was the argument.",
  "So, subsection (c) says he has to, not later than 3 days -­",
  "In other words, you're reading (c) as saying, to go back to my example, the person who was convicted last year and has 4 more years to do his initial registration -- nonetheless, if he changes his name, if he stops being a student while in prison, he has to register tomorrow or the day after. I would say if that's your reading of those two sections, it's -- it's going to confuse everybody who is in prison, as it did confuse me.",
  "All right. Then I take it your reading is he does not have to fulfill (c) until after he has to have initially registered. And so, we're back to the question of why you treat somebody who committed the crime long ago with less clarity, with less time to initially register, with more confusion from one jurisdiction than another, than you would treat a person who was convicted last year, is still in jail, and has 4 more years to register. That's why I read (d) as trying to sort that kind of thing out.",
  "I see. Your view is that they have to register initially when?",
  "No, no, I'm just saying take my example. The person is in Michigan. Michigan does have a sex registration thing, but he never actually did it. So, now this Federal Act comes in, and now when is he supposed to register? When's his initial registration?",
  "Oh, reasonable time.",
  "And what is a reasonable time?",
  "In 3 business days, he's supposed to go out and do that, and if he doesn't do it, he has committed a Federal crime which makes no mention of it, no mention at all, and he's just supposed to guess that that's 3 business days because he's a lawyer; is that why?",
  "I don't understand. Could you answer the original question that Justice Sotomayor asked? She said: What happens in Arizona? You said a prisoner, or defendant, he has been convicted, gone through his first round of appeal. He is given a form, which you said is a simple form: Do you want to proceed in collateral review? And he answers yes. Then does Arizona appoint a lawyer or not?",
  "All right. Then what are we arguing about? He had his lawyer.",
  "Ah. So, now you're talking about the second round. You're talking about does he have a right to a lawyer when he wants to claim that the first lawyer that they gave him on collateral review was ineffective?",
  "What is the issue?",
  "Yes.",
  "All right. So, why - - that's what I thought, actually. And I don't understand what all the briefs are about, and I must be missing something, about whether they're all going to have to appoint lawyers or not in these different States. It seems to me that has nothing to do with this case. This case comes out of a State that does appoint lawyers, and the question is whether you, your client, should have from your point of view at least one full, effective chance to say: Every lawyer I have been appointed, I've gotten 100, and they are all terrible. And -- or whether the State can block that from being heard in habeas, by saying, oh, no, we gave him 19, and the claim that all 19 were ineffective he can't even raise. That's the issue; is that it?",
  "No, no, no. But I'm not - - I'm not ridiculing as it sounded your claim. I'm saying maybe that's right. Maybe he's not going to win the claim, probably. But the question is, if his claim is in Federal habeas, I have gotten 102 lawyers in 102 proceedings and every one of them was absolutely ineffective, perhaps that habeas judge has to look at it and say, oh, I see, he's claiming he's never had one full effective chance to claim that his trial lawyer was ineffective because the other 19 were just as bad. I have to look at it if I'm a trial judge. Now, that's not a silly argument in my opinion; that could be a winning argument. I just want to know is that basically your argument?",
  "Okay.",
  "Now let's start at ground zero. Sorry. Everyone else - -",
  "But you can -- you can have a -- you don't have to give him a counsel. Look, the State did give him a counsel on first collateral review; that counsel was supposed to, according to him, raise the claim my trial counsel was no good. Now we go to the next round. The State says: I'm sorry, you are on your own here; we're not giving you a lawyer anymore. Okay. That may count. He now has to know he has to make the argument himself. And, therefore, he goes and makes the argument himself, and now he's in habeas and he can argue they got it all wrong. He's not blocked.",
  "All right. So, what - - there isn't an issue in this case about giving people counsel, on that view. There is an issue about if you do give them counsel, then they have to be able to have an argument later that you did it ineffectively. That's a different matter; that's a question of whether you're blocked in habeas and can't even make the claim. All right, forget it. I will ask the other - -",
  "Yes, okay.",
  "All right. This is -- I'll not -- we'll say this is my argument. I don't want to make this your friend's argument. In Arizona, there was a trial, and defendant thinks trial counsel was inadequate. Then there was a collateral review, and Arizona appoints a lawyer for that. And after that, the Arizona courts thought, no, he was adequate at trial. This particular defendant wants to say that that lawyer was inadequate, too. In fact, it was the same one. Hardly surprising. All right? That's his view. Now, when he makes that argument in Federal court, I guess he's going to be met with the claim, since Arizona didn't have to appoint the lawyer for collateral review, it doesn't matter what that lawyer does. Is that right?",
  "Yes.",
  "No, but don't -- don't guess where I'm going here because maybe nobody wants to go there.",
  "Just follow the questions. The question is, if he tries to make the claim he does, want to say that my first lawyer was no good at trial, and my second lawyer, who by coincidence was the same in the collateral proceeding, was no good either, then the State comes in and says: You can't make that -- you can't make that argument now because we had a proceeding called the collateral review proceeding. We didn't have to give you a lawyer there. But even if that lawyer was inadequate, you lose because we didn't have to give you one. Am I right about that?",
  "That's all I want to know.",
  "Yes.",
  "All right -- no, no. You say -- I'll answer it. It is enough to give him a lawyer. Okay? It is enough. But you have to give him an adequate lawyer if you give him one. If you give him one. You don't have to give him one. But if you give him one, it has to be adequate. Now, what about that?",
  "All right, but would that -- it does. That's what I think we're at. Now, why not say this, that every defendant has to have one fair shot at claiming -- they can make the claim that his trial lawyer was inadequate? And the State doesn't have to give him a lawyer at collateral review, but if it does, then that lawyer, he can say, couldn't make that claim because he was inadequate. So, you say, fine, they can make that argument in habeas. I bet they never win it. But somebody might. He can make it. So, what would happen would be that the habeas judge in Federal habeas would read the piece of paper. He'd say, what's the ground for thinking this? And then he'd make his normal kinds of judgments. Now, what is -- is there anything wrong with that view? Is it absolutely blocked by precedent? It seems to me it would relieve the concerns of the States about worrying about having to appoint a lot of lawyers, and it gives him a fair shot to make his argument.",
  "Because?",
  "Well, that's -- that's where you'd have to make the exception. You'd say, if you give him a counsel, he does have the right to an effective assistance of counsel insofar as the ineffectiveness would prevent him from raising a claim that, to be fair, the trial itself has to be -- has to -- he has to have that about the trial itself. That exception. There would be that exception. Now, is there something in those cases that blocks that exception?",
  "Well, in a sense it does, but he's never going to win the infinite continuum.",
  "You never have to give him a lawyer at all.",
  "What about not going that far? What about saying: In this case -- in this case, Arizona did give him a lawyer. In this case, it was the same lawyer. In this case, the proceeding was filed prior to the completion of the appeal and ended before the completion of the appeal. So, for this case, this counts as the one round of proceedings, and, therefore, his client can in fact assert that that single individual who was his lawyer was incompetent in those proceedings that ended -- didn't end prior to the termination of the appeal, ended first.",
  "No, but it didn't face the issue of what about a claim that you have a constitutional right to bring up at least once? And this is the first time he was able to bring it up. So in other words, Coleman didn't face this problem. It's as if you couldn't bring up the claim that the judge was sleeping until you got to collateral proceedings. A State could have such a rule. I don't know why they would, but they could. But if they did, it would be your first chance ever to attack that trial process, and so isn't Coleman, in its effort to bar relitigation, actually rather beside the point?",
  "No.",
  "No, no, we're saying it the same way, just as if his lawyer, when he could raise the fact that the judge was sleeping, didn't raise it because he was staring at the ceiling and had been drinking too much. Just as he could raise that point in habeas, because it's his first chance to do it, so he could raise the point that the lawyer, the first time that he had the chance to raise the ineffectiveness of trial counsel, was incompetent, et cetera.",
  "Before you get to the court, could I ask you about what the State attorney, the prosecuting attorney, knew? Did the prosecuting attorney know that these two individuals from New York were representing this person?",
  "All right. So you think you have -- in your view, the counsel of record knew that these two people in New York were part of the representation. Did the counsel -- I mean, not the counsel of record; the counsel for the State. Did the counsel know that they hadn't gotten the notice?",
  "Is there any reason to think that the State attorney or whoever was prosecuting thought that the local counsel was likely not to do much?",
  "Yes? Okay.",
  "All right. Now, so it's possible -- we'll find out later -- that the State -- the prosecuting attorney who works for the State knew all those things: One, he's represented by counsel in New York; two, they didn't get the notice; three, the local attorney isn't going to do anything; and conclusion: They likely knew he didn't get the notice, but they are asserting that this is an adequate State ground to bar him coming into habeas; is that the correct posture of the case?",
  "So, all we have to decide is whether under these circumstances the State attorney's knowledge of all those facts mean that the State cannot assert this is an adequate State ground.",
  "Is it -- is it -- I'm still unclear on one factual thing. Did the State's attorneys know that the letters had come back?",
  "Should they have known?",
  "Do they check the -- do they check the docket every so often to see what's happened?",
  "Why did --",
  "All right. If we have to send it back, I guess we'd have to say what the rule is. So, what -- what is the rule? What about a rule that says, where in fact attorneys do abandon the client and the local attorney does as a matter of practice in the State do virtually nothing except to facilitate foreign representation, and where the State had cause to believe -- cause to believe -- that all that was true, then the State cannot assert this as an adequate ground. That's all.",
  "Because?",
  "Irrespective of what the rules were, you'd have to show -- he would have to show that, in fact, in the State it is a practice such that the local counsel doesn't do much of anything except facilitate, because this is a state of mind as to whether the State -- and the State knows that. If he shows both of those things and shows that the letter came back and shows this was abandonment or close thereto, then the State ought to know that this individual has no idea about filing a piece of paper and thinks somebody else is doing it. And that's enough to say this is not adequate State ground that would block Federal habeas. Now, your argument against that is what?",
  "It seems in the briefs -- there's certainly a lot in the briefs that seemed to say that.",
  "Suppose the policeman had said: I'm taking you away with me for 20 minutes, period. Takes him away, puts him in a place, asks him questions for 20 minutes. All right? Does he have to Mirandize him?",
  "No, those are the totality.",
  "I just gave you the totality.",
  "No, no, no. I'm taking you to a special room, and in this special room, I'm going to ask you questions for 20 minutes.",
  "There's no other circumstance. That's it. Everything else is the same as here, except he added those words. Now what?",
  "Not in custody.",
  "He's only going to be there for 20 minutes.",
  "He would have thought he could leave after 20 minutes.",
  "Okay.",
  "Now, outside -- we walk outside, there's a policeman in the street, and he says to someone who's a suspect: Come with me; I'm taking you to jail; I'm going to ask you questions for 20 minutes. He takes him to a barred room; he can't get out for 20 minutes. He has to Mirandize him?",
  "What's the difference?",
  "I'm curious to go back a second. I thought Justice Sotomayor's question was: Imagine Smith in Germany. He has written a book. It's there, already exists, but it has no copyright protection in the United States. So, after this, would he be more willing to send it to the United States? And I take it your answer is no. The reason is because I can go and buy a copy and sell it in the United States even without this law. Is that right or wrong?",
  "Well, see, that's what -- -- isn't that the question? The question is, now that Smith has the same protection in the United States that Germany gave him, doesn't that give him an incentive to send his book to the U.S.? I'm thinking about that one. I thought: Not much, because I can go buy it today without this law and bring it to the United States and sell as many as I want. But nonetheless --",
  "What is -- that's not right?",
  "Well, don't just jump on my answer as being correct if it's not.",
  "All right. Then the answer --",
  "No, but it was -- in Eldred the main difference is that in Eldred, there was a law that might, at least in principle, have elicited a new book. And in this case, by definition, there is no benefit given to anything at all that is not already created.",
  "By -- how? How does it give any benefit to anything that isn't already created?",
  "How does this provision do that? I think maybe there are other provisions, but I thought this provision is talking solely about books, for example, that are already created.",
  "Is it not? I may have been misreading, it but I certainly got that out of, like, 42 briefs and --",
  "Oh, oh. You say --",
  "Well then, you know, as you also know from the 42 briefs, that there's a lot of argument that you could comply in other ways that are less restrictive. And whether that's true or not, is that -- there what you're saying is -- if I parody it, it's not a fair reading I'm going to give -- but what you're saying is we are -- here have a law which says that libraries, music lovers, book buyers will either pay more money for things already in existence or will simply be unable to get them if they're orphans, on the one hand, so that other countries will impose similar kinds of restrictions upon their music lovers, music goers, libraries and -- so that they pay more for our works that are already in -- that are already produced, or simply can't use them because they can't find who owns them. Now, that's in parody form, for succinctness, what I think the argument is on the other side --",
  "-- and they'll say no copyright law -- with your exception of when the country was founded -- no copyright law has served that kind of purpose. That's served often by tariffs --",
  "-- but not by copyright law.",
  "Not necessarily. There are three categories. One is the category of the people who you couldn't, because of the country; that's Egypt, I think, and Russia. The second is the category of the people -- of sound recordings, and their third is the category, which is not the null set, of people who did not comply with certain registration requirements. For example, I believe that the widow of Samuel Brittan failed to renew her copyright. And there are probably many that failed to renew the copyright after 28 years, and the reason that they didn't is because they didn't think there was much money in it. And those are the very works that the libraries want to get ahold of and put in their databases.",
  "That's true but for one text. They say that text has to do with progress. And when they read it historically in light of Macaulay, in light of the Statute of Anne, in light of going back to Venice and the copyrights, in light of going back to letters between Madison and Jefferson -- that term has always meant produce at least one new thing. And here there is not one new thing.",
  "All right.",
  "It couldn't have been. That must be somewhat overstated, mustn't it? Because the only concern is not about protecting new works in the foreign countries. The concern, as I understand it, was that we've had things in copyright for many years, and we want retroactive protection there. The countries that didn't give it, like Japan, were not kicked out of the Berne Convention. Rather, we pursued them in the WTO for many years, and I guess somebody might pursue us. And then you get into an argument about whether there are other ways. Now, is that strong enough to overcome what these briefs are full of? I'll give you an example. Save The Music is charged with looking for Jewish music in the periods '30s, '40s, and '50s. Other organizations might find a treasure trove of literature that was -- that was copyrighted in Czechoslovakia or in Warsaw, and they want to put it on the Web, and they want people to listen to it. But they have no more idea of how to track down the person on that, and they aren't protected by any notice requirements because they aren't reliance parties. We're told by Barbara Ringer, former registrar, that there are millions of such instances where people would like to go back and would like to put music, literature, film, et cetera, in a form that people can use it today, and there's no way to do it without their becoming scofflaws or without their having millions of dollars to hire infinite numbers of trackers and lawyers. Now, that's the argument that's made on the other side, as the interest in communication that's important. What do you say?",
  "Well, here we have ASCAP. We have ASCAP. I agree with you that it is a general problem. It may be diminished in the United States, but it still exists. And I guess the argument here is, well, don't make it millions of times worse.",
  "Well, what do you -- Barbara Ringer said a million. She numbers it in the millions. Do you want to say, too?",
  "What is your take -- what is your reaction to a less dramatic kind of holding? Suppose we were to say the truth is that the particular individual here does have some religious obligations in teaching and quite a lot that aren't. So, she's sort of on the edge. At the same time, there is a statute which, whether it applies or not, you could take the principle, and it says a religious organization like your client may require that she conform to the religious tenets of the organization. So, Congress focused on this. And the district court looks at it, and suppose it were to decide: That's true, but there's no evidence here at all that religious tenets had anything to do with her being dismissed. No one mentioned them. She didn't know about them. I didn't until I read the very excellent brief filed by the Lutherans that explained the nature of taking civil suits. No one said that to her, whether it was in someone's mind or not. She found out on motion for summary judgment. So, therefore, this wasn't an effort by the religious organization to express its tenets. She was dismissed. She could have -- they could have had a defense, but it doesn't apply, and, therefore, even though she's sort of like a minister, she loses. What are your objections to that?",
  "Did anyone mention that to her?",
  "Really? My law clerk couldn't find it. Can you tell me where -- where someone did say the reason we're dismissing you is because of our religious doctrine that you cannot bring civil suits?",
  "I mean, does anyone explain to her, which she might not have known, that this is a religious doctrine that you are supposed to go to the synod or whatever, and you're not supposed to go to court?",
  "Of course, they wanted to fire her because she threatened to sue them. But what I'm wondering is, is there anywhere before the motion for summary judgment where someone explains to her, our motivation here is due to our religious tenet?",
  "No, no. I understand that. But I went on a different piece of -- matter, that the people who were involved in this were doing it for religious rather than civil reasons. I'm just wondering what the evidence is that they knew there was such a doctrine, that they were motivated by the religious doctrine, and that they expressed that to her. I just -- I'll look at page 55. Is there anything else I should look at?",
  "I'm looking for a citation in the record? I just wonder, is there anything you want me to read other than page 55?",
  "Suppose that's the central tenet. Suppose you have a religion and the central tenet is: You have a problem with what we do, go to the synod; don't go to court. And that applies to civil actions of all kinds. All right? So, would that not be protected by the First Amendment?",
  "Your view is it's not protected?",
  "So that, in fact, if they want to choose to the priest, you could go to the Catholic Church and say they have to be women. I mean, you couldn't say that. That's obvious. So, how are you distinguishing this?",
  "You're saying that going to church -- sorry -- that going to court is a more fundamental interest than a woman obtaining the job that she wants, which happens in this case to be a Catholic priest. But that's the distinction you're making.",
  "Well, why? I don't know why that doesn't -- I mean, you may be right, but it isn't obvious to me that the one is the more important than the other.",
  "Yes, but then you have to say that it's more important to let people go to court to sue about sex discrimination than it is for a woman to get a job. I can't say that one way or the other. So -- so, I'm stuck. And since I'm really -- this is tough and I'm stuck on this, I don't see how you can avoid going into religion to some degree. You have to decide if this is really a minister, for example, and what kind of minister. That gets you right involved. Or if you're not going to do that, you're going to go look to see what are their religious tenets? And that gets you right involved. I just can't see a way of getting out of something -- of getting out of the whole thing. I don't see how to do it. So, suppose you said in case of doubt like that, we'll try what Congress suggested. And now we have here a borderline case of ministry, not the heartland case. So, you say, all right, where you have a borderline case the constitutional issue goes away, and what Congress said is okay. So, now what you have to prove is you have to prove that -- the church has to show that the applicant was disciplined, or whatever, because she didn't conform to the religious tenets. All right? That's what they have to show. And I'm sorry; they maybe only make a prima facie case, but they got to show it, and if they don't show that there was at least some evidence to that effect and that somebody knew about the religious tenet and there was something like that -- maybe it's in the air, as is obvious with Justice Alito's question, but where it isn't in the air, you'd have to make a showing. Now -- now, I see that's an interference, but I don't see how you avoid an interference someplace or the other. Otherwise, you're going to get into who is a minister. So, what's the answer to this dilemma? At the moment I'm making an argument for following what Congress said, go back and try it that way, and if they can show in this case and she shows in this case nobody ever thought of the religious tenet, nobody told me, they didn't read it, then she's going to win. And if they come in and show that they really did this because of their religious tenet, they'll win. What about that?",
  "Well, it does have the virtue of deciding a statutory question before a tough constitutional question. And I agree, with what we sometimes do, that seems bizarre, but I thought that was the basic rule.",
  "No, but that isn't -- but that isn't the problem. The problem, it seems to me, is I don't know how substantial these interests are religiously. I don't know how substantial the religion itself considers what they do from a religious perspective. So, let's go back to Justice Alito's problem. And now on the ministerial issue, we call the synods, we call the how certain was it, how central is it to the heart of the religion, what they're actually doing, and we replicate exactly what he said, in respect to the problem of religious tenet, now in respect to the problem of religious minister. And maybe you can tell me we don't have to go into the one or the other, but I've had enough of these cases in the lower court to know they are really hard. People believe really different things, and I see no way to avoid going into one or the other, and, therefore, I think, rather than try this constitutional matter, let's go to the one Congress suggested.",
  "Now, what do you - - that's - -",
  "That's the state of the argument that you're walking into, I think.",
  "No. I don't agree with that. I think -- I think what it says is a religious organization may require that all applicants and employees conform to the religious tenets. It put that in the section defining defenses. The defenses are part of the right, and when it forbids retaliation, it says forbids retaliation against an individual for the exercise of any right granted. And, therefore, I don't believe that a person who has failed to violate the substantive section could be held up normally. I mean, I don't - -",
  "I can think it's pretty easy to read that exception, even though it's in a different subchapter, into the retaliation exception. And assume for me that that's so.",
  "I think the question is, is there any difference between the two?",
  "Well, why wouldn't they have been -- I mean, as I understand it, if a person of a certain set -- and it's the same set in both, virtually, the same set of people -- where they're injured on navigable waters or piers and docks and so forth, it's the Longshore Act. And if you're on the platform, it's this Act, so far. And the benefits are the same.",
  "Okay. So, the only thing that extending this does, I think he says, is imagine a person who worked on a platform goes to get some platform bits repaired miles from the sea. Now, that person would not be covered by Longshore Act, would he?",
  "No. And he would be covered by this, if they're right, but not if Clement is right.",
  "Okay. So, he's saying what point was there for Congress to do that?",
  "Let me give you an example. It might help. A longshoreman is working on a dock. Someone tells him: There is a winch here that's broken; take it to the plant to have it repaired, which is 100 miles inland. He does it, and he's hurt at the plant. He is not covered, correct?",
  "Correct. Yes, that's right. So, he's not covered.",
  "But if the same thing happens on the platform, under your theory he is covered. Now, your opponent is asking a reasonable question. That seems to be about the only difference that he can think of, whether it's the one Act or the other, and why would Congress have done that? That's his question, and I'd like to hear the answer.",
  "So, your answer is basically there are many statutes like this, they all have some kind of OCSLA-type requirement, it's the Longshore Act that was rather stingy, and we don't know why.",
  "Why?",
  "Because of the workmen's compensation?",
  "Does it carry over who's an employee from the Longshoreman Act? Which defines an employee as a maritime worker, and then defines that and has exceptions and so forth, and this has a couple more. That's who the employee is; is that right?",
  "Why? I mean, normally a lawyer just looks to see what the docket is. And when there's a case that seems to affect his case, he asks for cert. And our practice normally, since I have been here, is where it implicates a case, you hold it until the case is decided. Then the writing judge or other people look through it and see if in fact it really does affect it, and if it does, we GVR. I mean, as a practicing lawyer here, have you discovered instances where we've failed to do that, do you think?",
  "I'm having trouble following it. It may be my fault. But I -- but the -- suppose the Supreme Court has now some kind of interpretation of something that's new. All right. Now, there are going to be a wide range of people that that many might apply to whose convictions became final or just about final in State courts at different times. So, it's obviously always going to be somewhat unfair and somewhat arbitrary that it applies to some and not to others. So, what is the problem here? What -- the reading of the statute on the other side says: I'll tell you who it applies to or who it doesn't apply to. It doesn't apply to people where the last State court decision was made before the Supreme Court made its decision. That's it. Now, that's arbitrary somewhat, but you have to cut and draw a line somewhere.",
  "What's the problem? Why is that complicated?",
  "Yes.",
  "But the person would say: Look, the State supreme court has -- you -- we're under a decision here the exact opposite of what the United States Supreme Court held. Will you please either take our case and hear it or at least send it back to the lower court? And wouldn't most State supreme courts do it?",
  "How does that happen if -- let's imagine Smith is convicted of some kind of disorderly conduct, and he goes through the State courts and it's upheld. And then at some time thereafter -- I leave vague how -- how much time. Maybe it's a couple of months or something. The Supreme Court says that particular kind of conduct is protected by the First Amendment. So, now it falls within the exception for you can't criminalize this. Now, habeas is filed. Smith files habeas. Well, how can he get that heard? Because this particular provision says that unless it was clear at the time under, in your view, of the State statute -- the final State decision on the matter, he can't get into habeas. Now, it wasn't clear.",
  "He goes to State court under a collateral review.",
  "Suppose there is no such --",
  "So this is quite far out, but conceivable. You'd argue that in the State court, the State -- you'd have to go to collateral review in State court and argue that they now have to apply the new rule.",
  "It's not impossible to get out, because he says here's -- bring your collateral State. And Now, the collateral State, you're imagining, says, no, we can't have it --",
  "-- because it's time-barred.",
  "Then you go into habeas, and you say the time bar is no good --",
  "And it's such an important opinion, you know, for all the reasons in Teague, that what they did is to time-bar and they wouldn't hear it. Okay, so you hear it. And the claim is that they made a mistake. That State court that wouldn't hear it made a mistake in not hearing it and deciding it for me. Okay? So, now we have a State court thing to review.",
  "That's true, but -- but it may save a little time at least if -- we're in an arcane area of the law, to me. It was created by Robert Jackson, Attorney General, and by Thornburgh, Attorney General. And if we're starting with that, what that says is we have a list over here of excludable things, and we have a list of deportable things. And if you're deported for a reason that shows up on that first list, than the AG could waive it. That's basically the outline I have. And also I have, which isn't quite right, that in that first list there's something called -- big letters -- CIMT or something, crime of moral turpitude. And all the things on this second list, the big issue is, is it a crime of moral turpitude? And, as I looked through the opinions, this is what I got out of them. And This is tentative. I got out, just as you say, there are two things in the second list which are not crimes of moral turpitude. They consist of illegal entry crimes and gun crimes. And there are special reasons for the first, and the second is debatable; but they've been consistent with that. Then there are things that are on both lists, they are a crime of moral turpitude. I counted at least eight cases saying, for example, rape, burglary, manslaughter, second-degree robbery, indecency with a child, and probably some others are all crimes of moral turpitude. So, it clicks in, okay? Then I find Blake, and Blake says sexual abuse of a minor is not a crime of moral turpitude. That's a little surprising. But it gives us a reason: Because -- and this was the problem here. It talks about there has to be substantial -- there has to be similar language in the two lists. I don't know where that one came from. It had certainly not been in the earlier cases. And now we have this case, which is voluntary manslaughter. I would have thought that voluntary manslaughter is right at the heart of the lists that they said the things are crimes of moral turpitude, and not like visa crimes or gun crimes, if I had read the cases. So, where do I end up? Well, what I end up with this, and this is what I would like you to reply to. Justice Brandies once said something like we have to know before we can say whether an agency opinion is right or wrong, what they're talking about. I felt perplexity after I had read through these decisions. In other words, I don't understand it. So, I would like you to explain to me why this all fits together and how, if you can do that. I couldn't get that clear explanation from the brief, and I suspect it is not your fault.",
  "Yes, yes. The one that was worrying me: rape, burglary, manslaughter, second-degree robbery, indecency with a -­",
  "All those cases -- there are about seven or eight of them.",
  "Don't look to the conviction. That may be his approach. My approach is look to the category.",
  "Look to the category. And the category here is not -- you know, the category isn't crime; the category is what kind of a crime. And this is a crime of violence. In the statute, or if you look at what was charged, it's called voluntary manslaughter. Either way, I would think those categories as categories fall within \"crime of moral turpitude.\"",
  "Thank you.",
  "Can we go back to second on this very interesting -- suppose I say, okay, I concede. I'd only do it for the sake of this question. You're absolutely right in your categorization. The right category is crime of violence. And then I look at the statute, which is 8 U.S.C. 1101(43), which you probably know by heart, and I look at the definition of gun crimes, and I look at crime of violence. My non-schooled reaction is, well, gun crimes, I can see why they said that wasn't really a crime of moral turpitude, because there are a lot of registration requirements, there are all kinds of different things that drug -- gun dealers have to do, and you could commit that crime in various ways that don't involve moral turpitude. I can understand that, sort of. At least, I could see how somebody else might have understood it that way. Now, I think crimes of violence, I say, hey, I am having trouble here. Why don't you try to list a few crimes of violence that when they come into the country you're going to say, oh, that wasn't a crime of moral turpitude? And by the way, I am not asking you to list specific examples; I am asking you to list categories. List categories of crimes of violence that when the person comes in, you're going to say, hmm, no moral turpitude there.",
  "That's not a crime of -­ that's not a moral turpitude, simple assault? You're going to just hit somebody?",
  "Burglary -- isn't burglary where it might be an occupied building?",
  "Well, no, no. A warehouse. I am being a little quibbling now. Of course, my basic concern -­",
  "Oh, really? Okay.",
  "So, there are some. There are some.",
  "This is a little odd, but what I'm afraid of -­",
  "Okay. What I'm afraid of is this: That once you put this in your category, that you say crimes of violence are not crimes of moral turpitude, then to a large extent you have said good-bye, Justice or Attorney General Robert Jackson.",
  "You're saying good-bye to Jackson and Thornburgh, because you have driven such a wedge between these two statutes that there's hardly anybody who would be able to qualify for the Jackson- Thornburgh approach to this statute.",
  "I overstate slightly, but you see my point.",
  "You're also telling me that -- I didn't know this; I learn something in every argument -- that if we have Jack the cat burglar who was burgling dozens of office buildings -- and abroad -- and assaults people and hits them over the head or whatever with his -- I guess with his fists, that we have no way of excluding that person, should he try -- I've heard criticisms of our immigration policy, but this seems surprising to me, that we have no way of excluding that person who is filled with simple burglary of office buildings and assaults.",
  "All right. He has only done it once; we have to let him in.",
  "I take it they haven't decided. So -­",
  "Well, which is it you're doing? I mean, I imagine -- I thought you were saying you always need reasonable suspicion. So, I imagine a case where the person is going to be arrested, put into the general prison population. There is a warrant out against him for second-degree murder, and the policeman stopping him for a traffic offense arrests him because he knows he is wanted on a warrant in another place. And the jail has a policy that says when you're -- come in here because of second-degree murder, we strip search you. Okay? Can they do that under your rule or not?",
  "That's all they know.",
  "Then you do not want to -­ then you are not saying it always has to be reasonable suspicion.",
  "Oh, all right. Well, that isn't helping me.",
  "What helps me is to know what the category of things is that the jail in your opinion is going to have to look into the characteristics of this individual person, and when I look at the ABA, they talk about minor arrests.",
  "And when I look at some of the cases, there's a long list, like violence, drugs, and so forth, where you don't have to, where you can just use a general -- the fact that he was arrested -­",
  "-- for the thing. But there are other ones, minor ones, where you do. So, what's your rule on that?",
  "Okay. Then the next question which we'll get -­",
  "-- who is a minor offender and how do you administer that rule?",
  "All right. That's what I'm -­",
  "Unfortunately, I'm asking you and not them, and it's the same question.",
  "How do you want us to write this so that jail personnel all over the country -­",
  "-- have to be able to follow it and know exactly what they're supposed to do.",
  "You said before was 2 feet is too close, but 5 feet is okay. Are you sticking with that?",
  "Yes.",
  "Visual observation from more than 2 feet, or less than 2 feet?",
  "Okay. What happened? Do we know? Was the search within 2 feet or not within 2 feet?",
  "We don't know.",
  "Try the ABA. The ABA is minor offenses, not drugs, not violence, and there you have to have reasonable suspicion. Now, I've read through the briefs, and I can't find a lot of contrabanders that were caught in that category. In fact, my law clerk thinks it's one out of 64,000 or less. So -- so, what is the justification for a rule to avoid reasonable suspicion in that category?",
  "It's a conclusion -­",
  "-- and we have a lot of practical experience because different States have different rules, and San Francisco came in with I think the toughest on your side, for your side. I just say, looking through that, it's very hard to find somebody who really was in this minor offender category, who really was found to have contraband. So, what should I look at to show that my initial reaction from a quick reading is wrong.",
  "I mean, do I just say this is a -­",
  "Is there any evidence -- I count seven or eight States anyway that have some variation of the reasonable suspicion rule like what they want, roughly. Is there any evidence at all that in those seven or eight States, there is more contraband being smuggled in?",
  "That's my -- that's my problem. I don't -- I overstated the -- the strength of your evidence. I was just trying to throw it out -- or I understated it. San Francisco's point is really that 30 to 60 percent or some very high percentage of people who come in for minor crimes are high on drugs or have been -- and there is just that footnote really which has a few examples. Definitely, they're there in this category. So, would it be helpful if you included in the excluded part people who are high on drugs? You see? So, we give you the high on drugs people. It's the drug offense, and those who are high on drugs and those -- I mean, is there a way of drawing this rule that we can even catch most of the people in footnote 50 -­",
  "But it's obvious that the simplest thing for any prison official is say do it for everybody.",
  "And so, the fact they do it for everybody and don't try to make some exclusion for traffic violators or something might be consistent with little or no evidence; it might be consistent with some. That's why I keep looking for it.",
  "Well, you -- first, there's nothing about this in the Sixth Amendment, is there? I mean, the text of the Sixth Amendment talks about criminal prosecutions requiring the assistance of counsel for defense, period.",
  "Okay. So, there's nothing in the Sixth Amendment that has these qualifications. I haven't seen anything in any case which was other than case specific. That is, this issue hasn't been decided before, not to my knowledge. The language can be taken out of those cases, as you've very properly done. And so, there's nothing that I could find in the cases. Nothing in the Sixth Amendment itself. In 95 percent of the cases, they do plead guilty. And what's the problem about ordering the prosecution to simply repeat the offer he gave before? Well, I mean, I don't really see if there - - and prejudice? What if a person's been executed? If he had gotten the -- if he had gotten the plea offer, he would have pled guilty for 50 years in jail, okay? That's my imaginary case. I can think of one where there's prejudice. He's dead. All right? So, what's the answer in my imaginary case, if it's not in the amendment, not in -- not a holding, et cetera?",
  "I don't want to -- I want to stop you there because I don't understand it. The suggestion is -- I'm not taking this case; I'm making up a hypothetical since we're discussing it really based on the next case. The defendant never heard the offer, never heard it. It is crystal clear that if he'd heard it, he would have accepted it. Okay? I'm trying to separate out difficulties of this case, which strikes me as difficult because of the facts, from the principle. And what I want you to do is to tell me why I shouldn't accept the principle, and then we can worry about what's a clear case.",
  "Death. Let's say death.",
  "He shows that never did he ever become aware, because his lawyer was sleeping and moved on vacation and never told him about the plea offer. That's my hypothetical.",
  "All right. If you don't want to do the capital case? I'm still trying to get to the principle.",
  "I'll change my hypothetical and say all that happened was that this perfect trial, because of mandatory sentencing rules, led him to prison for 50 years, as compared with a plea bargain which would have given him 2 years. Now, he is in prison for 48 years more, and I consider that that's at least harmful to him. So, where the amendment doesn't speak of it, where the misbehavior of the lawyer is crystal clear, where it's 48 years more in prison, what is it that bars what seems to me obvious that an inadequate assistance of counsel, remedial through a specific decree saying reinstitute the offer, led to enormous unfairness and prejudice?",
  "The lists are legion where people don't get the sentence that they deserve because, for example, the lawyer was inadequate. I mean - -",
  "It wouldn't be a problem. The problem with Justice Alito's hypothetical, I take it, is what the order would say is that the prosecution has to, for a reasonable time, extend the same offer. And then if it's accepted, you go to the judge. The judge doesn't have to accept the plea.",
  "You can't make him do that. But I have a bigger problem with this case, which is - - which I may be the only one to have. But as I've looked at it, I don't see ineffective assistance of counsel within the AEDPA meaning. That is, you have two courts in the State which have said this is not ineffective. And as I look at it, it's somewhat ambiguous at best. And we have the Sixth Circuit saying it is. Well, I know both sides agree, but I mean, both sides couldn't make us decide a case by saying there's a murder when in fact it's not. I mean -- so, what am I supposed to do about that? I find this a tough case. I've read the record, and in my own opinion at this moment, perhaps no one else's, there is no ineffective assistance of counsel such that the Sixth Circuit could set that aside -- a contrary finding of the State court. What do I do?",
  "Well, why? Why? I mean, why wouldn't the remedy be, as -- judging what you said before, is an order saying to the prosecution re-institute the plea bargain and give him whatever, a week or whatever it is? Now, we imagine the defendant says I accept. So, then they go to the judge, just as they would have before.",
  "And the judge has the freedom to accept that or to reject it.",
  "If he rejects it, there is no plea agreement. Now the defendant must plead. He can plead guilty or not guilty. And whatever flows from that, flows from it.",
  "He does. He does. His suggestion is perfect, but mine is more perfect.",
  "You could do it. You don't have to -- you would -- he's right, you would have to, under my suggestion, have a new trial, even though there was a trial that took place 2 years ago or whatever it is, correct?",
  "But that isn't the end of the argument.",
  "Well, what's wrong -- let me go back because I'm now becoming convinced -- I'm trying out what Justice Scalia suggested. Maybe that does work better. What -- what you'd say is, first, throw the defendant out, unless you are convinced that not only is there ineffective assistance, but also it would have made a difference; he would have accepted the plea bargain.",
  "So, now they have to hold the plea bargain open. They then do it. They then go to the judge, like any plea bargain. Ninety percent of the time the judge will say fine, and that's the end of it.",
  "But should the judge decide that this is a case where he would reject a plea bargain for any one of a variety of reasons, then our assumption was wrong, and we reinstate the previous trial. Now, the -- just say it's over? You were tried, you were convicted, that's the end of it. Now, what's wrong with that as a remedy? I mean, what's -- why is that -- why does that muck up the criminal justice system in some way? That's, I think, pretty much what Justice Scalia suggested, and I -- and I am now trying that out, because the more I think about it, the more I think maybe that's okay.",
  "Yes, but I - -",
  "I mean, aren't we taking this on -- isn't there an assumption that there's a finding, or some lower court judge made a finding that if he had known about the better deal that was offered, he would have taken it?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, then that's a causal problem. You're saying that, even if he had accepted it, it would have gone to the judge, and the judge would have turned it down anyway. The judge wouldn't have accepted it.",
  "Is that your point?",
  "Well, then there's a - - somebody must have found somewhere that this made a difference.",
  "That the failure to tell him about the special offer of the misdemeanor did in fact make a difference because he would have accepted it and he would have ended up with it.",
  "Yes.",
  "This is on the basic question - -",
  "Well, the -- the question -- I make a counter-assumption. The problem that I -- I have the feeling that I'd like you and the others to comment on, is that you're worried deeply about a practical problem, and that the practical problem is that it would be too easy, as just was suggested by the question, to find that the lawyer, after the defendant is convicted, did a bad job during the plea negotiation, in which case everybody will get two or three bites at the apple. And one of the reasons for that is every brief has been lifting the standards, particularly in respect to prejudice, from Hill, which was addressing a different question. It was addressing the question of missed -- bad performance by the lawyer at trial. And that's hard to track what the effects are, and it isn't that hard to say the trial was unfair, give him a new one. That won't work here, I don't think. So suppose what we did, instead of saying there was no right, you simply said you have to prove with some certainty, work out a standard, that there really was inadequate assistance during the plea bargaining, and you have to show something more than a reasonable probability that this would have led to the plea, et cetera. You have to show that it would have happened. Or you have a -- in other words, you have two tougher standards for this area, but you don't reject the idea of inadequate assistance of counsel during the plea bargaining stage. I'd like people's views, insofar as they are willing to give them, on that question.",
  "Yes, but what about as a constitutional violation that, in a context of a world where 95 percent of all people in prison are there as a result of bargaining and guilty pleas arranged with prosecutors -- in that context, it's fundamentally unfair to deprive a person of his liberty for 40 years instead of 6 months because the lawyer which he is guaranteed fell down on the basic, fundamental, obvious duty of communicating the relevant plea agreement?",
  "So, is there any support for me?",
  "But, now, you've read these cases, and now we're right on what I think is the point, because we've both defined a possible constitutional right, but there's a practical problem. All right? Now, the States and others have dealt with this on your side - -",
  "-- for the last 30 years. And, presumably, you, but not me, have read a lot more cases. Now, have they developed -- as you look across those cases, are there some States or places that have developed reasonably tough standards in respect to what counts as ineffective assistance and in respect to whether it made a difference that would help to alleviate the concern that this would turn into a great mess? Which it hasn't, apparently.",
  "Why? Because you have to show a causal connection. So, you'd have to show - - show in the causal connection that he would have taken that deal.",
  "And if -- if you're going to use the words \"reasonable probability\" that he would have taken it, it might be fairly easy to show. And that's where in the back of my mind I'm thinking that maybe we want something tougher than reasonable probability, that you have to show that it really would have made a difference.",
  "The specific case where the State remedy is not available is?",
  "No, no, no, no. Your - -",
  "Your allegation which you believe states a valid claim under Bivens action but not under State law is?",
  "I don't understand specifically what they are. I mean, it sounds to me that if a person (a) deliberately starves somebody to death, for example, or deliberately gives him something which will make him sick when he eats it, that that would at least be negligence and would arise under ordinary State tort law. So, I'm curious to know what your claim is that does not arise under ordinary State tort law?",
  "No, give me -- don't answer my -- forget my hypothetical. Tell me your specific claim that does not arise under State tort law. That's all I want to know. Which is the same question I heard -- I just didn't hear the answer to.",
  "I heard the answer in general.",
  "I want to know specifically what you say they did to your client that doesn't make out a State tort claim.",
  "I heard you say - -",
  "-- that. I just want to know what it is physically you say the defendant did to your client, so that I can evaluate your statement that California gives no tort remedy for that.",
  "Sorry, I don't mean to sound irritated, but I just have trouble getting my question across.",
  "All right. They failed to give him adequate food for what? So he could live, or for what?",
  "They gave him -- and if a person in California who has charge of -- of a ward or someone fails adequately to nourish that ward, you're saying California tort law gives no remedy?",
  "I would call it like negligence, you give a remedy. If it's not negligent, it's deliberate? Or what?",
  "It seems odd to me because the Eighth Amendment says cruel and unusual punishment. So, you have to have a cruel treatment. And where a person deliberately or negligently subjects someone else to cruel treatment, my -- my law school recollection of many years ago is that there ordinarily is a tort action. So, that's what I'd like you -- I'm suspicious of your statement that there isn't.",
  "Therefore, I ask for some elaboration of that.",
  "When I went to law school, which was many years ago, instead of talking about, like, starvation cases or medical malpractice, they talked about a general thing called negligence.",
  "And it seemed to apply to doctors, and then it was medical malpractice, and it applied to others, and -- and is there something here that wouldn't fall in that general kind of rubric or the general terms of California tort law?",
  "And I know, I don't want you just to repeat yourself.",
  "So, I guess I have the best answer I have.",
  "I would find that rather surprising, too, actually.",
  "Because I -- I think what they're asking to do is fine. On their theory, you have no problem because you go back and show to the court that there is no remedy in California for shackling a person, I guess, deliberately, with knowledge that that would cause severe pain, and if you can show that, then you're going to have your Bivens action in respect to that.",
  "That -- what they're saying is that you're not going to be able to show that; so, it doesn't worry them.",
  "But what is the reason why, if we give absolute immunity to the witness at a trial, we give absolute immunity to the prosecutors and government officials at the trial, and a grand jury is sort of like a trial, at least it's testimony under oath. And in addition there's this special thing about grand juries being secret, which, if you allow people who are annoyed -- and they'd be quite rightly angry. They've been acquitted. They had to go through this process. They want to sue somebody. If we let them sue, you'll wreck the secrecy in a lot of cases. So, I see a reason for treating the grand jury even more strictly. What's the reason for treating it less strictly?",
  "Suppose I don't accept that. Suppose I say, yes, I accept that, there's a relationship, but exactly what happened in 1871 is not precisely always the convincing feature for me. So, I read what the situation is today, and it is, I think, as I described it. So, given the situation today, my question remains.",
  "You can't disagree with my question.",
  "I would like an answer to my question.",
  "Is it different from -- I mean, I find the Solicitor General -- it's my fault, I'm sure -- I don't understand the position they're taking. I mean, I think in every case there's some evidence about what goes on outside the courtroom or the grand jury room, and then there is some evidence about what went on inside. And I don't know when you're supposed to introduce what. So, I'm guessing that -- that whatever the rule is about when you can use what parts of what, that if you win, the rule about when you should use or when you still can use the testimony that's given in the grand jury room is the same as the rule that says when you can use the testimony of a witness at trial. See, I would have thought that immunity means you can't use that testimony, but I'm told I'm wrong about that. You sometimes can use it. So, then I don't know when you can use it and when you can't. Maybe you know. You've studied this case. I admit I haven't studied it as thoroughly as I hope you have.",
  "Yes.",
  "When you say absolutely immune, I'm thinking of a typical case as follows: Smith says to his friend: I hate that rat Jones. I am going to go and lie and say he stole my horse. Next step, he goes to the grand jury or someone and says: Jones stole my horse. Third step, he's in the grand jury room saying: Jones stole my horse. Fourth, he's at trial. Okay? So, what comes in and what doesn't? And can you bring a case in the first place?",
  "I'm at sea. Whatever you can help me with, I'd be happy.",
  "There's always something else. He didn't think of this thing for the first time in the grand jury room. The defendant thought of this thing outside the grand jury room before he even got to the grand jury, and he probably told somebody about it, or he could have, or at least there's the evidence he walked to the grand jury room. Okay? So, there's always something outside the grand jury.",
  "Is the prosecutor immune? I know the prosecutor is not immune or the complaining witness is not when they get an arrest warrant. Is the prosecutor immune when he is taking the step of getting an information or indictment?",
  "He is immune?",
  "All right. So, this is equivalent to doing that. That's a prosecutorial function. The prosecution would be immune.",
  "Of course, this isn't a prosecutor; this is a subordinate. The person here is the defendant who is not the prosecutor - -",
  "Is there any subordinate government official involved when a prosecutor gets an information, files an information or -- the way you get somebody indicted is you have an indictment, which is a grand jury, I guess.",
  "Or an information.",
  "All right. When you get the information, is it just somebody from the district attorney's office or the prosecutor's office, or is there somebody else there? Is there a policeman there that gives any - -",
  "Can be, okay. If there is, has he ever been held immune or not? The prosecutor is immune. Now he's there with an assistant, the policeman to back him up. Is there any law on that, whether the policeman is immune?",
  "No, the arrest warrant, he's not immune. We know he's not that. It's just he files the information.",
  "No.",
  "No.",
  "Are there States that have -- or are there any jurisdictions where they don't give immunity to grand jury testimony for complaining witnesses or others?",
  "Today are there a lot?",
  "But, I mean, is there any way to find out what's happened? Have they been -- have the grand juries been undermined? Have they not been undermined? I mean, what has actually happened in those places?",
  "Can you give me an example of one or two States that allow these actions?",
  "For how long have they had that?",
  "For how long?",
  "And -- and have there been many such grand jury actions?",
  "But what are -- I mean, what are we arguing about? It's a -- he should have filled in the blank and said there's a Speedy Trial Act issue, and he didn't. The judge didn't. He should have done it; he didn't.",
  "So, now I am the court of appeals judge, I get this, and I say, oh, my God, he forgot to fill in the right number; I'll tell you what, I'll fill it in, and I'll sign my name. Is that legal?",
  "I'm a judge in the court of appeals. I have the case here. I say -- I say: Oh, my God, I've read the appendix. I don't always read appendices, but sometimes I do. And I notice that there's blank here, and it's supposed to say Speedy Trial Act. So, I get out my pen, and I say Speedy Trial Act, SB. I sign it. Okay? Now, is everything okay?",
  "All right. So, what are we arguing about? Why not just say, look, this is like the Copyright Act registration requirement?",
  "I mean, it's not jurisdictional in the sense that the court has to look through all these appendices itself to see that everything is perfect. It's just something you should do. And if you didn't do it, then in an appropriate case, the judge could do it himself or waive it or whatever makes sense in the circumstance. What's wrong with that?",
  "Well, suppose we say -- if they entered judgment without it, we will assume, nunc pro tunc, they did it.",
  "What is the horrible thing about that?",
  "You tell me. This is a statute the purpose of which was to speed things up, which was to help courts of appeals by eliminating dross --",
  "-- while focusing on issues that really do have constitutional issues. Now, suddenly what's worrying me -- and I don't have the definite answer -- is if I adopt your interpretation, this is jurisdictional, I am somehow increasing the workload of the courts of appeals because they will have to have staff people going through to see whether every i is dotted and every t crossed and they did have all the right things there, and the pain of doing that is if you don't do it, then you have to do these things over again. It will be too late. People will get another argument.",
  "Well, why then? I mean, you can read the statute differently. You can say: I'm now the court of appeals judge. I look at it. Lo and behold, there are two blanks. But on the basis of what I've read in the briefs and the record, I can say that the appellant has made a substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right. I know the record, and he has these things there. And also, I know what they are. Okay? So, I fill in the blanks, or the chief judge of the circuit fills in the blanks with the panel's approval. Now, the only reason for doing that is that it saves everybody a lot of time and that it costs nobody anything. So -- so, why not, since the language permits it, do that?",
  "Well, yes, you're giving the conclusion.",
  "I've just said the statute doesn't. They can take the appeal, and they're not going to get anywhere because of this error of the lower court judge --",
  "-- unless the court of appeals, having looked at the record a little bit, discovers that there is a substantial constitutional question, and they know what it is, and then they fill in the blanks.",
  "And in the language -- it allows that, I believe, and the purpose would allow it, for, after all, the purpose is to be more efficient, not less efficient. And I can't think of any harm that's done reading it that way. So, you tell me what is the harm that's done.",
  "No, no. They can't, you see, because I'd have to be able to fill in those blanks, or goodbye. So, it doesn't get any meritless ones up there. The only ones that come up are merit -- merited.",
  "Oh no, if there's an insurmountable obstacle -- although, as in this case perhaps we don't reach the constitutional issue -- there is one there, so it is appealable, but we say we do not reach it because there is this impossible procedural obstacle that here blocks it. There we have a system that seems more efficient and seems what is being argued, and all we have to do is say this is not a jurisdictional requirement in (2) or (3), and there we have it. Now, what's wrong with it?",
  "-- if I say that.",
  "So, I could just sign this tomorrow and that would moot this case and get rid of it.",
  "What does that mean?",
  "What is - -",
  "Go ahead. You were saying on a case that all you want to do is red-flag it for the judge.",
  "All right. Now, how does that differ from what exists in I think every State and certainly in the Federal Rules in Rule 403? The judge may exclude evidence if its relevance is outweighed by its prejudice or misleading the jury. So, why, in any instance where you think that this statement about to come in is unreliable for various reasons, you say: Judge, will you please look please look at Rule 403? I have some experts over here and whatever else you want that would show that this is misleading to the jury. For all the reasons you have said in your brief, right? All right. So -- so, since that is already the law and it does apply to every piece of evidence, including all the things we've been talking about, what is it that you want to change?",
  "I didn't say what's different about it. I'm not looking for a difference. I'm looking -- I'm saying they're all the same. And, indeed, we do what you want right now. It's called Rule 403 in the Federal system. What I'm asking you is what is it you want done, since all you want is the judge to look at it carefully, that is not done at this moment?",
  "No, but, judges don't, I'm sure -- I'm not 100 percent sure; you'd have to ask a trial judge. But I am sure there are instances where judges say under Rule 403: I conclude it is misleading and it is prejudicial and it can't be made up for; therefore, I exclude it. All right? That happens. Now, since that's what you want the judge to do, I repeat my question: What is the difference between what you're asking for and what already exists in the law?",
  "Unless -- well, go ahead.",
  "Whoa, wait. Let me stop you there, because now what you seem to be saying is it isn't the case that you simply want the judge to look at this with care; rather, you want the judge to change her result. You want sometimes this to be excluded where under 403 it is sometimes not excluded. All right. Now, I asked, if that's what you want, that's a different matter. That's a substantive standard. And so, you're proposing a different substantive standard, and I want to know what it is.",
  "Well, suppose somebody goes -- he goes to a country where we have no extradition treaty, takes all his assets and writes a postcard to the IRS every -- once a month saying ha-ha-ha.",
  "I mean, why wouldn't that be an attempt to evade? That's why he went; he didn't like to pay his taxes.",
  "Well, 7201. Why can't you -- well, why doesn't that violate 7201? I mean, my simple question really is you are a drafter, imagine you are a drafter, and you are charged with drafting section (43). And you read -- you try to get the fraud and deceit crimes, okay? So now we read 76 -- 7206(1) and (2). And you see for both of those, you can't be convicted unless you materially and willfully make a false statement. So, you think, hey, I don't need a special section on that one. But then you go to 7201, and you say, oh, my God, I just thought, somebody might violate this by going off to some special country, taking all his assets and writing ha-ha-ha. Now, there's no fraud and deceit in that. He's totally open about it. But he sure has evaded it. So, therefore, I better write a special section. Now, that's the simple-minded argument, but what's wrong with it?",
  "But what about -- what about -- suppose that didn't even exist here, 7201. Suppose we only had 7206, and the question before us was, does 7206 fit within the term \"aggravated felony\"; i.e., does it involve fraud or deceit? So, we read 7206; it doesn't say anything about fraud or deceit. It says perjury and making a false statement. So, then we go look up what were the torts of fraud and deceit. And he's right. Fraud traditionally requires an intent to get another person to act, but you don't have to have that intent to violate 7206. And deceit -- it not only involves that; it also involves the person having acted. So, the traditional tort of deceit, you have to intend the acts, and he actually has to have acted to his detriment. Fraud, you have the first of those and second. You read the statute and say, well, say neither of those is present here. This is just perjury, which isn't good, but it's not fraud or deceit. And there we are, not in the statute. What's the answer to that?",
  "No, no, not always. But here we were dealing with a very serious statute, aggravated felonies. That has terrible consequences for the persons who fall within it.",
  "So -- and in most of these M's and A's and B's and C's, and so forth, they refer to statutes by number so most of it, though not all of it, is very specific. So, when we read these words \"fraud\" and \"deceit\" here, why don't we say fraud and deceit means fraud and deceit?",
  "The traditional elements.",
  "No, no, no.",
  "You have to prove that the -- the liar intended reliance to -- to his detriment.",
  "Which he may or may not have done. I mean, when you commit -- a person who commits perjury may or may not have intended that a victim rely to his detriment. Which you don't have to prove here.",
  "Deceit can mean that. You're absolutely right.",
  "No, the tort didn't involve that. The tort involved the same element of fraud which you don't want to rely on.",
  "Is there any -- is there any evidence of what -- I mean is there any argument other than that you just think that and you could argue the other way? I mean, can we get anywhere?",
  "Let me go up to start with Justice Ginsburg's first question. I mean, if this falls within it, 7206, this fraud, what about perjury? Is every perjury statute within it? And what about lying to an FBI agent? And what about lying to a government official, which is -- which is -- you know, there are all kinds of statutes on that one.",
  "Are all those aggravated felonies?",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "The government's view is that, of course, you have to meet the other requirements. But as far as the words \"fraud\" or \"deceit\" is concerned, aggravated felony picks up every perjury statute, every lying statute, lying to an FBI agent, lying to this or lying to that. And has that been the consistent policy of the immigration service? Have they deported people where the other two conditions are fulfilled?",
  "But all I need are a few. I mean, I just wonder, is it the policy of the INS and the government to deport people where these other things are met -- which they would be perhaps rarely; I don't know -- but to deport them where the crime, the underlying crime, is perjury, lying to an FBI agent or lying to other government officials?",
  "What are then the reasons that -- because your friend says that this is an a fortiori case from everything, because all of these words -- every time the word \"exclusive power\" has appeared in any source -- I think that's what you're saying -- it is meant that the President can act without supporting authority from Congress. But there never has been a case or a suggestion that the President can act where Congress has legislated to the contrary. Now, I think that's the -- that's the argument. And so, what -- I would like to hear what you have to say about that argument.",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "All right. Now -­",
  "But my question is, what leads you to that conclusion?",
  "What are -- there are very, very few cases I can ever think of where -- where the President -- where the Court has said the President can act contrary to a statute. And so, the point of my question was to get you to talk about -­",
  "-- why, even though this is a fortiori.",
  "I just want -- I don't want the time to elapse. You can finish that if you'd like. I'd just like somewhere a few words about the political question, which you don't believe in. From reading your brief, I would say you don't believe in it much. And my question on the political question for either of you is this: that -- that this is an area of foreign affairs. It's an area of -- of, you know, recognition. We know that. Never has this Court or anyone else held that Congress can go ahead in this area over a law passed by Congress. But it is passports, which both regulate. And our real problem is these are words that are officially said and they are detailed words, and those words may really disrupt coherent foreign policy. Viewed that way, there are billions of words that might have the same effect. And do we know that these words will and some other words won't? No, judges don't know that. And, therefore, when you get into this area, the best thing to do is avoid multifarious pronouncements by various departments of government on one question; do not respect the views of other branches; and, judges, stay out of it. Let them work it out by themselves. I just want a word from either you and really Mr. Lewin on -- on that.",
  "What -- what is the question that I think people are driving at, at least as I understand them and certainly share the concern, is that if you win this case, then there is nothing to prevent the police or the government from monitoring 24 hours a day the public movement of every citizen of the United States. And -- and the difference between the monitoring and what happened in the past is memories are fallible; computers aren't. And no one, or at least very rarely, sends human beings to follow people 24 hours a day. That occasionally happens. But with the machines, you can. So, if you win, you suddenly produce what sounds like 1984 from their brief. I understand they have an interest in perhaps dramatizing that, but -- but maybe overly. But it still sounds like it. And so, what protection is there, if any, once we accept your view of the case, from this slight futuristic scenario that's just been painted and is done more so in their briefs?",
  "Of course, that's true. And they do have a limit. In this case, they say Knotts involved a single journey, or let's say it involved four journeys. And let's say it involved four journeys in 2 days. This involves every journey for a month. So, they say whatever the line is that's going to protect us, it's short of every journey in a month. So, I'm not asking -- I'm saying I accept your point there. And what do you say is the limit?",
  "Well, there is the same kind of guidance that you have in any case of this Court that uses the technique which is used sometimes, and I think it's used for example in the bribing the judge case, you know, with campaign contributions. You draw an outer limit, you say you can't go beyond that. We know within that, there is no standard. We'll leave it for the lower courts to work out, and we'll review it over time. That's not necessarily desirable, but that is a method this Court has sometimes used.",
  "But even if it's wrong, I want to know, are you saying there is no limit or are you suggesting one?",
  "But they won't -- they won't and probably couldn't physically. Start with the other end. Start -- what would a democratic society look like if a large number of people did think that the government was tracking their every movement over long periods of time. And once you reject that, you have to have a reason under the Fourth Amendment and a principle. And what I'm looking for is the reason and the principle that would reject that, but wouldn't also reject 24 hours a day for 28 days.",
  "Do you see where I'm -- and that's what I'm listening very hard to find.",
  "It's not a violation unless, in addition to a search, it is an unreasonable search. And since you already -- and the same is true of seizure, isn't it?",
  "So, you already have - - everybody agrees it's at least a search. So, what do you care whether there's the -- and there's a case called Karo which says whether it's a trespass doesn't really matter. The question is the reasonableness of it. And that's what I think -- I mean, you can argue trespass as much as you want, but I'll still have in mind is it reasonable.",
  "And I think that's the question we've been debating. And I would like to know from you -- what they are saying is that the parade of horribles we can worry with -- worry about when it comes up; the police have many, many people that they suspect of all kinds of things ranging from kidnappings of lost children to terrorism to all kinds of crimes. They're willing to go as far as reasonable suspicion in a pinch. And they say at least with that, you will avoid the 1984 scenario, and you will in fact allow the police to do their work with doing no more than subjecting the person to really good knowledge of where he's going on the open highway. Now, I -- they probably put it better than I did, but I'd appreciate your views on that.",
  "And, in fact, those cameras in London actually enabled them, if you watched, I got the impression, to track the bomber who was going to blow up the airport in Glasgow and to stop him before he did. So, there are many people who will say that that kind of surveillance is worthwhile, and there are others like you who will say, no, that's a bad thing. But that isn't the issue exactly in front of us.",
  "And what Justice Kagan wanted to know is why not.",
  "Oh, my goodness. Here, I I can read -- sorry, I just had that expression because I'm reading: \"The existence of a physical trespass is only marginally relevant to the question of whether the Fourth Amendment has been violated, however, for an actual trespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish a constitutional violation.\" That's Karo. So, you can talk if you'd like. It's your hour. But I would really be very interested in hearing you on the assumption that the real issue here is whether this is reasonable.",
  "Can you take it to Congress the other way? I mean, can you say that a general search of this kind is not constitutional under the Fourth Amendment, but should Congress pick out a subset thereof, say, the -- terrorism or where there is reasonable cause or like the FISA court or special courts to issue special kinds of warrants, that that's a different question which we could decide at a later time? That's a negative way of -- I mean, that way favors you in the result, but I've -- I've been looking for -- if there is a way of going to Congress to create the situations where they can do it, rather than the situations where they can't.",
  "What is this? I mean, I thought -- I may -- I thought the issue is that there were some notes, and the first note, which was made on the day, the policeman says that Boatner said he could not supply a description of the perpetrator, other than to say they were black males. Then he said they had golden teeth and a low-cut haircut. And 5 days later, he said he could not ID anyone because he couldn't see faces. Then he said he'd only glanced at the first man. He couldn't tell if they had their faces covered and didn't see anyone. Then he said, I could not ID, would not know them if I saw them. And another set of police notes says he said that he could not identify any of the perpetrators of the murder. So, I guess those are all notes that the - - the prosecution did not give to the defense. So, if you were a defense lawyer, whatever this other stuff is, I guess you would have been pretty happy to have those notes because you might have tried to impeach his identification.",
  "And so, what are -- you're saying that I guess it would have made no difference?",
  "Then I'd like to hear that because it seems on its face that it certainly could have made a difference, that if he had those notes that he could have tried to impeach him and said where did this sudden recognition come from.",
  "So, I take it that your - -",
  "Is it that you mean immaterial, or is it that you mean that it wasn't prejudicial because there's so much other evidence, there was no reasonable probability it would have made a difference in the trial?",
  "Okay. So, we can forget the word \"material.\" Now, you're saying there's so much other evidence here against him that it wouldn't have made any difference.",
  "Now, I can understand that argument.",
  "But I don't know if it's right. That is -- that is -- now I think I can go back to Justice Kennedy's question, put it in those terms, and say, well, why wouldn't -- this could have made a difference. I mean, here, we have this witness who said all of these great things for your side, and within a space of hours, he has been telling the policemen that he can't identify anybody, he doesn't know. I mean, what -- that sounds like there's a probability that would have made a difference. Why not?",
  "It's so odd that -- I mean, look, it seems like here it is 5 days after the shooting and well before, I guess, that this witness saw any mug shots or did anything. And he says, I could not identify anyone, because he couldn't see the faces of the people. And now you're saying later, which you introduce into trial, his having looked at the faces of people and identified them from their faces. Now, previously, he said he couldn't see their faces. All right. And in Louisiana, the State of Louisiana, the prosecution and the judges say that isn't -- you don't have to turn over that statement that he couldn't see the faces made earlier.",
  "What?",
  "Oh, you mean all these - - all these statements that we have here, you're saying, all referred to people other than the defendant.",
  "All right. Well, was there a finding on that?",
  "Perhaps the defense would have liked to say they did apply to the defendant.",
  "This was not at the scene.",
  "So, you're - -",
  "All right. He says, I can't identify - -",
  "He says, I can't identify anyone because I couldn't see faces. Okay? That's what it says here, at least in my notes that my law clerks gathered. And - -",
  "All right, I -- and my point then is this seems very odd, I mean, really unusual that in the State of Louisiana that they have some kind of system that doesn't turn that statement over to the defense.",
  "I'm not surprised they're correct.",
  "What am I supposed to do -- I have a quick procedural question, which I think is similar to Justice Ginsburg's. Suppose this is three sections, the State law, and some of them have three parts. Suppose I thought, well, the word \"buy\" -- I mean, \"buy\" might cover an awful lot of things that don't have much to do with operations. Maybe sometimes they do. Suppose I ended up thinking that, but I thought you were right about all the rest of it. What am I supposed to do?",
  "No, no, no. I'm just doing that hypothetically.",
  "Yes.",
  "But what I discover is there are at least 11 different provisions in this, and I have exactly Justice Scalia's question. Do we have to write an 11-part opinion where we treat each of these different things, which are different, separately and analyze it? I'm not trying to get out of the work. I just want to know.",
  "Suppose we agree with you about that. We say, if I agree with you about that, there we are; you're supposed to pick up this animal which is on the slaughterhouse floor and kill it right away. That seems to have to do with operations. All the rest of these other 10 provisions are just variations on that theme, according to the Government, and we send it back for them to argue this out below.",
  "Well, there are 10 other parts. There are 10 other parts.",
  "But in any case, it's - - look, this is a simple question that occurs. I am an inspector at a federally inspected meat facility. I look around, and there is a -- a cow and it's lying down. All right? It seems to me that your law says I have to go over and see that it is immediately euthanized. Now, how is that not what is forbidden, a requirement -- the exact words are -- \"in addition to or different from the Federal requirements governing the operations of that Federal meatpacking facility.\" The Federal law does not require me immediately to go over and euthanize the cow. Your law does require me to go over and immediately euthanize the cow. And, therefore, your law seems an additional requirement in respect to the operations of a -- a federally inspected meatpacking facility. Now, that seems to me the obvious, simple argument that people have been making, and I would like to know your obvious, simple answer.",
  "It does, you're right. You're right. I see where you're going. It says we're talking about regulations that are within the scope of the Act. But I have assumed that that means we're not talking about airplanes; we're talking about the subject matter of the Act. And so, is this the kind of regulation that is within the subject matter of the Act? And it seems to be. It has to do with how you slaughter animals. It has to -- I mean, if you're going to be so specific as you say the only things that are within the scope of the Act are the specific requirements that are there already in the Federal Act, then this prohibition against extra regulations means nothing. I mean, it can't mean that. So, it just means the subject matter. And now, if it means the subject matter, then why don't you lose?",
  "What do you mean, instead of? What is the scope of the Act? Are you saying the scope of the Act refers only to those particular provisions that are already in the Act, requirements already there?",
  "Yes? Then why did they put in something saying you can't add anything?",
  "I -- I didn't see your argument, and now I see it. Okay. So, I understand where you're going. But then if I look at section 610 of the Act, it has a whole bunch of prohibitions, including prohibitions and references to how you slaughter animals, and including how you slaughter animals humanely. So, there, how do you say that this provision which talks about euthanizing an animal that you look around and it's lying down -- how is that not within the scope of the Act? I'm not saying that they have that particular thing, but the subject matter, slaughtering animals, indeed humanely, is something the Act absolutely deals with.",
  "No, I didn't say that. I said yes, it's part of the operations, but also it's the subject matter with which the Act deals. The Act deals with the humane slaughter of animals and other forms of slaughter of animals. So, how -- how is -- so, I repeat my question.",
  "Okay. I see. That's what you said before - -",
  "What I'm concerned about I think is the same thing that the Chief Justice mentioned, the particular language in Napier. And whatever -- however this might come out today if Napier were decided again, it did come out the way it did. And Justice Brandeis did write it, and it's been the law a long time. And the argument is made in Napier that this particular State regulation is aimed at preventing sickness and disease, not at making locomotives safe, and, therefore, it's not pre-empted. And the answer to that was not sickness and disease are an object of the statute, too. The answer was the Federal and the State statutes are directed to the same subject, the equipment of locomotives; and, therefore, it is pre-empted. Now, how could we come out in your favor without overturning what seems to be that key sentence in Napier? That is the problem that's bothering me.",
  "I see. Okay. That's a - - the problem with (a) is that it's been followed and followed and followed and followed, and really read for all its worth, and so forth. So -- so one question is, to what extent can I go back and revise that sentence? That's (a). Okay? What's (b)?",
  "Not -- now, is there any way that you could win your case -- reasonably, in a reasonable way, not some far-out way -- but you win your case on this, and it does not affect the manufacturers' way of dealing with their equipment?",
  "What is that?",
  "You just -- you just said that, which I think you certainly have the right to bring a claim, don't you, to say the repair shop doesn't have adequate warnings. And if -- if that's -- if the railroad's at fault in that, or the manufacturers or the owner of the repair shop, everybody who ever puts the asbestos in there is negligent in not putting up adequate warnings. What's wrong with that?",
  "What about -- what about not - -",
  "What about getting away from the equipment and saying the failure here is not to fail to put it on the equipment; it's to fail to put it in the repair shop?",
  "There's something I'm not seeing.",
  "So, what's the difference then? How do you do it? How do you -- how do you - - what is it you're thinking of that the manufacturer's going to have to do in respect to his locomotive in order to comply with the State law about warning that is not going to mean that he changes the locomotive when it runs on the railroad?",
  "Well, give me an example.",
  "Does that have anything to do with this case, the removal, never further -- no further use of a bit of a locomotive?",
  "No. Okay. Let's get to this case.",
  "Oh, I didn't know anybody denied that, that the State could regulate the repair shop, indeed require what warnings they wish, indeed require what equipment workers have to have. I thought we're only talking about those rules of State law that would affect what the manufacturer has to put by way of design in his locomotive.",
  "And that's what I'm having trouble thinking of one that would only affect repair shops and repairs, but -- maybe there's some kind of equipment that you could stick on the front of it, and it is a hook or something -- and it holds something, and before it goes back on the line, you take it off and put it in a locker. And -- but, you know, the more I thought along those lines, I thought I'm getting into outer space. This isn't reality. So - -",
  "All right. Now, does that have more than theoretical value in this case?",
  "Why would their law be pre-empted, a State law that says since the railroad knows that asbestos is dangerous when revealed and since it would be revealed in a repair shop, the railroad has to provide the repair shops with appropriate worker safety equipment; or alternatively, and lesser, the railroad has to provide for the repair shop's documents to be given to the workers which explain the risks and how they can overcome them. Now, in respect to that, which I'll lump under various kinds of failure-to-warn claims, how does the Act pre-empt those? It doesn't affect design of the railroad, nor does it affect the use. Neither.",
  "But -- no, no, no. That argument would prevent States doing what they can do lawfully, which is to regulate the repair shop because with any given repair, with many of them, you could say, well, we wouldn't have to -- we can just change the locomotive design, for example. It carries beds with it so that the workers who are repairing it get adequate sleep. I mean, that isn't an answer to the argument that it doesn't affect design to say, well, they could comply with it by changing design, I don't think.",
  "No, what they're saying is - -",
  "What they're saying is because when you open up the box, something no one does on line, you will expose yourself to risk, and what we are saying is, therefore, you must post a notice that tells workers about those risks. And, indeed, if there is a conflict, conflict pre-emption will take care of it. But why should that kind of thing fall within the scope of field pre-emption even under Napier, which, of course, referred to equipment while this rule doesn't? It refers to a sign. You're not going to change the equipment.",
  "All right. So, the basic reason seemed to me that it might mean \"may,\" and I'm following up on the Chief Justice here, who withdrew this interesting part of his question. The -- the Congress seemed to want to have ordinary people be able to go into small claims court in a State and bring an action for $500 because they were pestered by these salesmen on the phone in violation of the Act. Now, if you're right, they could go into Federal court. But so could the defense. And so, any case they bring in small claims court, I guess, could be removed, couldn't it? And how is that -- am I right about that?",
  "Well --",
  "Well, why wouldn't they -- I mean, you know, if they're really pests -- I'm not saying they're all pests; some might be. But if they're pests and they want to drag it out, what they do is they just remove it from small claims court. They tell their lawyer: Remove everything, remove everything. And so, what was Congress's objective, seemingly to provide a simple, clear, easy thing for the average American to do when he's pestered, suddenly becomes a major legal problem since the defense lawyer is instructed remove every case to Federal court. Now, that's something that's bothering me. So, I'd like to know what your response is.",
  "Oh, it's not self-defeating, because we keep it up, and the word will get around.",
  "And in case, by the way, anyone doubts it, before he even files it -- one of the things that we'll instruct our salesmen to say is: If you sue us, we're going to remove it to -- you know, there are many ways of it getting around.",
  "Okay, what's the second?",
  "Okay.",
  "All right.",
  "But is there any reason to think before you brought this suit that people thought they could remove it to Federal court?",
  "All right. Aside from the individual ones, what's actually worrying me, which I've tried to bring out, is I'm pretty certain Congress in this statute was trying to protect the average person who can't afford a lawyer who is pestered with these calls. That's their object. And I can think that if you can bring this suit in Federal court, so can the defendants.",
  "And, therefore, I think, gee, I'm not so sure about this. They don't gain much advantage, the plaintiffs, by being able to go into Federal court, and there could be some advantage on the defense side to making things more complex, raising legal fees. Okay? So, that's where I am at this moment. Now, I'm asking you this because I would like your best answer to disabuse me of this notion which cuts against your case.",
  "What happens --",
  "Well, this is the part that's worrying me. On your side, it's hard, and it's an unusual statute, but the -- certainly -- and I agree with you that the language of the statute suggesting a kind of reverse pre-emption, something like that, and certainly Senator Hollings' comment, and certainly the fact that they specifically provide for an attorney general to bring an action in State court suggests that they wanted the smaller private actions in State -- I mean, in Federal court -- in State court; that favors you. All right. But then I thought, as you were speaking, what about diversity jurisdiction? And -- and I don't see why there wouldn't diversity jurisdiction in terms of trying to get these out-of-State people. And if there's diversity jurisdiction, why in heaven's name would they want to say but there is no \"arising under\" jurisdiction?",
  "So, I'm -- so, I'm pushed the other way by that. So -- so, what do you think? What do you think?",
  "I know. But why, if you were sitting in Congress and somebody did tell you -- Senator Hollings apparently never thought of this -- but say to Senator Hollings, Senator, there will be diversity jurisdiction here. And he, when he thinks about it, says, hey, great, that's wonderful, because these people are all in State A, and they're phoning people in State B. Now, if that was his reaction, then someone would say what about \"arising under\" jurisdiction? And what I'm thinking is, if I imaginatively put myself in his position, I think, huh, why not?",
  "What?",
  "That's true. So, there's a \"flooding the courts\" problem.",
  "Well, why wouldn't the -- the problem that Justice Scalia just identified or you were talking about suggest -- actually favor their side, that that \"in conformity with State law\" is talking about procedure? I mean, imagine that State law has a 2-year limitation period or a 1-year. You see -- I don't know what the limitation period is here. It may be longer. And so, what happens is where you go into -- if the attorney general brings the action, you're going to say it's 4 years, but if it's in a State court and a private person, it would be 1 year? That doesn't seem to me to make sense. It then seems to make sense if you interpret that provision as saying what court you could go into in the State. If the State permits you to go to the superior court or the small claims court or the -- in other words, procedural rules.",
  "It did, but look what -- well, how do you get out of the mess then -- what happens when the State attorney general brings an action in a Federal court, as he is permitted to do? What statute of limitation or substantive rule do you apply?",
  "But that's now really odd because we are then going to get different statutes of limitations, depending upon whether a State attorney general or an individual --",
  "So, let me just be -- use an example, a hypothetical based on the next case, really. I was thinking Congress passes a law, says you can't phone people between 7:00 at night and 7:00 in the morning and try to sell them something. Okay? That's the law.",
  "And anyone who gets such a phone call gets $500 in damages automatically if they sue in court if they receive such a call. The harm was getting the call. So, my grandmother, who is always complaining no one ever calls her, loved the telephone call. She loved it. Best thing happened to her in a month. Okay? Now, can she sue?",
  "So, in other words, if the FDA bans a substance on the ground that 98 percent of the people it hurts, and there's some kind of automatic recovery, $500, anybody who bought the substance because it wasn't supposed to be sold, and she's one of the 2 percent that it helped --",
  "-- can't sue?",
  "Well, here she was exposed, or the plaintiff was exposed, to the kind of transaction that Congress said was harmful as a general matter, just like the example you gave.",
  "Suppose Congress makes a finding, and this is the finding: We think that lawyers or whoever is engaged in these who hire title insurance companies should hire the best one on the merits, not on the basis of which one will give them the biggest kickback. We think that's so because that will help keep people secure. Everyone in such -- who buys a house will feel more secure knowing that the market worked there. We can't prove who feels insecure and who doesn't. We think in general they would. And so, we give everybody the right to recover $500 if they are injured where the injury consists of being engaged in a transaction where the title insurance company was not chosen on the merits but was chosen in whole or in part on the basis of a kickback. And they write that right into the statute. So, therefore, there is no doubt that the plaintiff here suffered the harm that Congress sought to forbid. That harm was being engaged in a transaction where the title insurance company was not chosen on the merits but partly in terms of a kickback. Now, what in the Constitution forbids Congress from doing that?",
  "What is the -- I think -- this is very interesting and informative to me. Go back to the middle category. As I'm now seeing it, you have a version of the middle category that the Chief Justice was asking. And -- and call it Congress sometimes passes a statute that creates a pariah. It could be a substance. It could be a form of behavior. It could be a structure of an industry. And then once it does that, it makes that unlawful. And now what it's done, it is more unusual than I ever thought. It comes up in the loyalty context, fiduciary, but we're not talking about fiduciary. It says it is a harm and you will earn money if you deal with a pariah, assuming it wasn't your fault. Now, that's where I have ended up with your answers to the Chief, and now, having put it that way, I can find loads of examples in my mind where there's a trustee or fiduciary involved. I can think of an example in the qui tam context, but to think of one right on point is a little hard, though I thought there must be some.",
  "The what?",
  "You mean you can sue in court even if what you come in and you say, they breached my contract, and as a result, I made $10,000 I wouldn't have otherwise made? And when the judge says \"And what damages do you seek,\" you say?",
  "And you can do that?",
  "No liquidated --",
  "All right. Okay.",
  "Justice Scalia has a point, because, I mean, as I heard him, he was -- he was reiterating what used to be called a prudential rule of standing. It wasn't constitutional, but you looked to see if the statute is meant to protect this kind of person against that kind of harm. All right? And if not, there's lack of prudential standing. Well, if that's the test, his case would fall outside it, because the tax law is not meant to protect the plaintiff there, but this case would fall within it.",
  "That's what we said in Merck. I mean, wasn't Merck just like that? It says a cause of action can be or whatever -- may not be brought -- may be brought not later than the earlier of 2 years after the discovery of the facts or 5 years after the violation. I take it that means 5 years after the violation. Forget about the discovery of the facts.",
  "Because they were both --",
  "There are two different doctrines, I gather. One is equitable -- equitable tolling. The other is sometimes called equitable estoppel or fraudulent concealment. But -- whatever you call them, if you take your position, a person who really thinks he doesn't have to file and so he doesn't file will be liable forever. There will be no statute of limitations because the plaintiff will never find out. Maybe 50 years later. All right? If you take the opposite position, then you will prevent plaintiffs in borderline cases from bringing suits because they aren't going to find out that somebody thinks it's a borderline case. I see one harm one way, one harm the other way. You're arguing that the second harm is the worst harm. Okay, why? What's the argument?",
  "No, I'm making it for you -- I'm making your argument. I'm trying to.",
  "I'm saying it's something on your side and something the other side. He's arguing you're wrong because if there's no bad conduct by the defendant, he honestly thinks he doesn't have to file, then the statute never runs. Okay?",
  "But on the other hand, his position leads to the plaintiff never being able to sue in borderline cases. Which is worse?",
  "It's worked out, but I don't understand it. I mean, why not just treat it like a special -- regular statute of limitations? You say that the profit is made on day one. It was made by an insider, and if your client finds out about it or reasonably should have found out about it, then the statute begins to run.",
  "Otherwise it's tolled, period. Simple, same as every other statute. What's wrong with that?",
  "But there are people, you see, who don't know. There are always borderline cases. Some people, whether it's this one or not, think maybe they don't have to file. They think they're outside the statute. So, they don't. Okay? You are protected. If they don't file, and you wouldn't reasonably find out about it, fine. But when you find out about it or should have, not fine. It's very simple and makes everything logical. It seems to be fair to your client, certainly.",
  "What happens in a 12 or 13 case, just your typical case -- and this must arise fairly often -- in year 1, on January 1, the farm or the ship or whatever is the subject goes into chapter 12 or 13. They have a lot of pre-1 debt. Then in year 2 and year 3, the proceedings are going on, but the farm is operating, so is the ship, or whatever. And they earn -- they run up debts during that time. People give them fertilizer -- they give them, you know, all kinds of things. So, they have a lot of debts that they've run up in that time. Now it draws to a close, at the end of year 3. Now, what about those debts that have been run up during that time? There isn't a separate bankruptcy estate for tax purposes, I understand. But if Joe Smith has loaned his farm some money during that time, and it comes time to look at the future income to subtract the prepetition debts, does his debt get wound up and get some priority in that process, or is he just at the end of the queue?",
  "All right. Well, if he gets priority, then why in heaven's name shouldn't a tax get priority?",
  "That's your point.",
  "And if it does, then, of course, the exception that Senator Grassley put in applies to that. So, that's a question I should ask them, given your answer.",
  "The -- what you say to me makes a great deal of sense, but I think one of their stronger arguments is, it may make sense. But, unfortunately, even if Senator Grassley and the others wanted it, they didn't do it right technically. They didn't amend the right provision of the code, and whoever's fault that is, is beside the point. So, there's no way to get the words to get to the result that you want. I'll tell you the best I could do -- and I see a problem with it -- is you say that -- you go to 1226(b)(1), and it says that any unpaid claim of the kind specified in 507(a)(2); and 507(a)(2) talks about administrative expenses and refers you to 503; and 503 includes taxes and administrative expenses; and then you say it's -- at 1220 whatever it is, what did I just say?",
  "It's like an Abbott and Costello movie.",
  "The -- the -- you get to 1226(b)(1), and it says that that's -- shall be paid any unpaid payments of that kind, including administrative expenses. And -- and so, then you have 1222(a), which refers to that, and then the amendment applies to that. But, now, what I did was I sloughed over by talking too quickly -- it talked about \"claim\" -- of a \"claim,\" it says, any unpaid claim of the kind specified in 507(a)(2). And when you look to 507(a)(2), it talks about claims and expenses; and then in (2) there, it refers to administrative expenses. And so, I think the Government says they left out what was key to you, the word \"expenses.\" All right? Now, I don't know what I'm doing when I start tinkering with this Bankruptcy Code. And is that just true, what they say? It does leave out the word \"expenses.\" Will -- will we cause untold harm if we were to read the word \"claims\" there to include expenses?",
  "No, but I was thinking, suppose I do it by reading the word \"claims\" --",
  "-- in 5 -- in 1226, when it says \"any unpaid claim\" --",
  "Which is what you want to have include taxes --",
  "-- to read that word as including both the 507(a) claims, which are in (1)(a), (1)(b), and -- and also administrative expenses in (2). Can I do that?",
  "But that doesn't answer my first question, what actually happens? I mean, this isn't the first year of chapter 12 and 13.",
  "And there must be instances where the -- where the debts run up postpetition are pretty big --",
  "-- and there isn't enough money to go around, and they're going to have to be paid out of future income along with the prepetition debts. And it can be done, but there is a question of priorities, and the Government is saying there is no priority -- I think they're saying that -- for a postpetition debt. And -- and you're saying, oh, but of course there is. So, what actually happens? There have been perhaps thousands and thousands of cases, haven't there?",
  "Get paid, if necessary, by assigning priorities?",
  "And so, to look to a hornbook on bankruptcy law which just tells me what you've just said, I would look where?",
  "Just following up on that --",
  "-- I'm looking for what I'd call past practice, where there must be a lot --",
  "-- that would shed some light on this. So, I see -- your point that we cannot call these taxes administrative expenses is because when that's defined in 503 for the entire code --",
  "-- it talks about administrative expenses incurred by the estate.",
  "And so, you're saying here are three people who incurred their own taxes. One is section -- section 12; one is section 13; and one is individuals in section 11. Is that right?",
  "At least that's my --",
  "Yes. Okay. So, we have three categories of people that -- where the taxes, literally taken, they incur postpetition taxes. Now, the bite would come up if it turned out, when they were getting around to settle these things, that there isn't enough money to pay fully the postpetition or let's -- no, to pay fully domestic support obligations, wages, and also Federal taxes. Isn't that -- that's where it's going to show up, because the question will be, do you have to shave the Federal taxes because they're coming in to be paid as an administrative expense priority which is only there as number 2, I think, in light of number 1. Or do you not shave them at all? If they're liable personally, there isn't any reduction in the amount of the Federal Government -- if they're allowed because it's one of the estate's expenses basically, using the estate very, very loosely, then they would have to take a reduction, too. Am I right? Are you following it?",
  "No. The administrative expenses don't have to be paid in full if there isn't enough money for them too in unsecured claims for domestic support obligations, because administrative expenses is the second priority; it isn't the first.",
  "Okay.",
  "How would it show up? I mean, what difference -- suppose -- suppose you -- in 11 individual, 12, or 13, what's the difference whether you treated it as an administrative expense or not, as long as they all have to be paid anyway, you say?",
  "No. I mean, how would we know? How would we know --",
  "Yes.",
  "I know. Let's imagine you're absolutely right. They mean to treat them differently.",
  "They mean to treat the postpetition tax obligation to the Federal Government not as an administrative expense. But this is an instance where the business will continue, and, therefore, you have said in order to continue, you have to pay all your tax liability and all your administrative expenses.",
  "Therefore, what difference does it make whether you do or whether you don't treat them as administrative expenses? What is the operational difference?",
  "Can you tell me what your response is to the Government's argument that the Privacy Commission which was set up understood the word \"actual damages\" at the time the way they understand it? What's your response to that? I -- are they right about that in your opinion?",
  "No, I'm asking you what --",
  "Okay.",
  "So, am I right in saying your -- you would agree with them that that is how the Privacy Commission understood the Act, but in your opinion, the Privacy Commission was wrong?",
  "And by \"pain and suffering,\" they mean mental pain and suffering?",
  "Thank you.",
  "This would save me some time possibly, but my guess is, and you may know, that every State or many States have statutes or tort laws or something against invasion of privacy. Now, you may know how many. And -- and if you know how many, that's helpful. And of those, if you know how many, how many of them, and perhaps all, provide damages for mental suffering caused by a violation of that particular tort-like provision? Do you know anything about those statistics?",
  "Do you know enough to know if they've done so through the use of a term like \"actual damages,\" that one or analogous thereto, or whether they've had to have some special form of words?",
  "Okay.",
  "At -- wait -- at common law, if you have a minute. Suppose a plaintiff proved that this particular violation of privacy was so terrible he was in bed for a week, he couldn't go to his family's wedding. I mean, the absolute -- the clearest possible proof. Now, would that have been considered general damages or not? So, it wasn't presumed. It wasn't speculative. It wasn't anything. It's absolute -- tied up. Definite. Would that have been considered general damages, or -- or would it have been considered special?",
  "No matter how well proved. No matter how clearly proved.",
  "No matter how clearly they are proved.",
  "And -- and I can look -- to verify that, I look at what definition where?",
  "If you look that up --",
  "It's pretty interesting, because I did go back and look at the '79 Senate report on S.1, which was the whole reform from beginning to end, and my reading of that section suggests to me that they thought past practice was exactly what they wrote in this statute. All right. Now -- at least that's how I read it. Maybe I didn't read it carefully enough. But I thought they were thinking that the Federal judge does have the power to sentence concurrently or consecutively with a term that a Federal court or a State court has imposed in the past, but -- but you can't do this monkey business that they're -- I agree with you on that. There was nothing about trying to make something concurrent or consecutive with a -- a State term that hasn't yet been imposed. You couldn't do it; you can't do it; it just gets into a -- at least not with a consecutive.",
  "You're talking linguistically, but I thought one Congress probably did have it in mind. I agree with you about that. But leave that out. How do you do it? You are a Federal judge. The point of the Federal guideline is to create a sentence with qualifications that reflects the real conduct in the world that the defendant engaged in. All right? So, we work that out. That's now 3 years. Now, our problem is that the State judge may eat up some of that 3 years or may make the sentence concurrent when it should be consecutive, because the conduct's different. So, I, the Federal judge, say: You are convicted of a drug crime; you get 3 years. I know there's a question here about whether there's a separate gun crime. That's State. Now, I want these 3 years to run consecutive with the State conviction for a separate behavior. Okay? Now, that's what I want. Now, if it's in the past, the State sentence, I can do it. But where it hasn't been happening yet, how do I do it? I say I want it consecutive, but the State court judge who later will have control of the case can say: I put my extra 2 years and make it concurrent with the State sentence. You see? It's a problem. It's a practical problem. Now, maybe I'm wrong in what I've just said, which is why I said it, because I'm prepared to have you tell me I'm wrong, there is no practical problem. But I want to hear it.",
  "All right. Good.",
  "That's why I asked.",
  "No --",
  "There has not been a conviction.",
  "How does the judge stop the State court judge later from making his conviction for a separate form of behavior run concurrently with the Federal sentence? How does he stop that? What power does he have over State courts?",
  "Correct. Then how can he stop it?",
  "My point --",
  "You may have missed my point. My point is because he can't stop it is why you're right in this case.",
  "Nobody found that out in 1980 -- in 1980 or '79. If you look through the Senate report on that, they don't refer to any of those cases. They write it as if it was just as Justice Scalia and the -- and the Government said. And, honestly, my question really is the same one -- maybe I didn't put it clearly, but I think you understood it -- that the reason that they want the Federal judge to be able to shape his sentence in light of other sentences that either the Federal courts or the State courts have given in the past is because you can do it so that a single behavior gets a single sentence and a different behavior is going to be sentenced consecutively, presumptively. But you just can't do that where the State court hasn't yet acted, because -- at least you can't do it in the consecutive case, because the State court judge sees what you did, and he may decide: I don't want it to be consecutive. So, here I am; I write in my sentence to be served concurrently with the Federal court sentence. Now, you can have every agency you want in the Federal Government, but there's no way to get around that. You can't force that State judge to do something different, and you can't muck around with your Federal sentence in a way that will make it consecutive to a State court sentence that says it's going to run concurrent. So, there's a practical problem, and that's why it's left out. It's quite -- I mean, when I finished reading it, I thought this is very logical.",
  "Can you tell me what the answer to that is?",
  "I don't deny that there are many instances where you could get it to work, particularly where you're going concurrent. I do deny that there's -- it's all smooth sailing. There are a lot of cases you can't get it to work. I don't want to repeat myself again. I've given you the example. I gave him the example. And I want to know how you would overcome that could be quite common situation where the State judge hasn't done it yet; so, there's no way to require the Federal court sentence to be served consecutively, if the State judge decides it shouldn't be.",
  "He can do that.",
  "Oh, I know.",
  "I don't deny there can be some. I say there is a concern that if he were to say in a different case, I want the gun thing which is going to State court to be consecutive, that he can't control that. Because the State court judge could say I want my gun sentence, State, to run concurrently with Federal.",
  "Oh, well, now we're getting awfully complicated.",
  "Well, I'd be a little worried in this case at deciding whether section -- what is that section -- the place of imprisonment, section 3621(b), whether that does or does not give the power to the Bureau of Prisons, the power that they've assumed for many, many years. Do we have to decide that question here? I didn't realize I was deciding that. I thought I was just deciding whether -- whether the judge, the sentencing judge, has the power to impose, say, a consecutive sentence, say my sentence will run consecutively to a State court sentence that has not yet been imposed. I thought that was all I had to decide.",
  "I don't think you have to. I mean, maybe we do have to get to that.",
  "Well, let me ask you this then: Is it -- is it -- if we want the judge to be able to say this particular prisoner will serve his Federal sentence after the State gun sentence is served or, alternatively, with the State gun sentence, the 3621 says that -- that the judge can, if that sentence, State sentence, has not yet been imposed, we don't know what it is -- we don't know if it will be imposed. We don't know what they're going to say. We don't know whether they're going to sentence him to -- count his time, time served in the Federal jail. I mean, I don't know what they're going to say in Federal prison. But he can write down what he wants, as (4) is \"any statement by the court that imposed the sentence.\" A statement \"concerning the purposes for which the sentence of imprisonment\" has been imposed. You would say I'm trying to get a single behavior punished once with 4 years, and then that separate behavior I would like punished by 2 years more. Okay? So, you write it down and the Bureau of Prisons follows it. And if they don't follow it, they could get reversed by a district court, abuse of discretion. Now, will that solve the problem.",
  "No, it isn't a tie. It's -- I mean, there's one thing on each side. On your side is the fact that the sentencing judge, Federal, is trying to figure out his own sentence, and he does -- either he does want or he doesn't want that particular individual to serve additional time, should a State court judge later decide on some related or unrelated matter. All right? And if that were all that was at issue, and the choice is between his saying -- just doing it, writing it in the sentence, or he's writing down his reasons what he'd like to have happen and letting the Bureau implement that as best they can under the section we are talking about. That's on the one side. And that says let the judge do it; don't give the implementation. On the other side is to let the judge do it risks complex interference with the second to sentence, who is the State court judge. It may be you're right that there's some way of working it out, but it sounds complicated to me, particularly in -- in the consecutive case. So, we have federalism principles on one hand, versus the judge, versus the bureaucracy on the other. And so, it isn't so easy. That's -- that's why I think this is not such an easy case.",
  "No, no. It's the State court judge that wants to sentence a person to an unrelated offense --",
  "-- but he wants -- he decides he wants it to run -- concurrently with the -- ongoing Federal sentence. There's no way to stop it.",
  "All right. Then you -- but you can't break this thing down. Either they have the power in the Federal district court under this particular provision, with all its presumptions, to run this mechanism, the one that's in the statute, in respect to State court sentences that have not yet been imposed or they do not have that power. We can't break it down and say sometimes you have it, and sometimes you don't.",
  "To what --",
  "To what extent are we supposed to take things that aren't in the affidavit or the warrant itself as relevant? I mean, the one thing that bothers me as I read the affidavit, it doesn't say someone else is living in the house. At least I didn't see that. And then the statement that Justice Sotomayor said, well, that's later on in a deposition. So -- so, if I were the magistrate sitting there and I read the -- the affidavit, I might think I did have cause, at least it's close maybe, but -- to allow them to search for all the guns in the house. I might think they all belonged to him. And, anyway, I might think he thought that this could be used to -- other guns could be used to go after her again. But when I read he says, oh, I had no cause at all for thinking that -- why isn't that the end of it, if we're supposed to take that into account?",
  "But he didn't say much about the gang.",
  "I'm asking you a specific question. I mean, if I were supposed to take into account his statement, I had no reason -- to paraphrase it a little -- for thinking that any of these guns, other guns, were going to be used for any purpose that's illegal -- if he'd said that afterwards, if I take that into account, I say, why isn't that the end of the case? He had no cause to ask for the other guns, period. Now, that was --",
  "-- the question, I think roughly, that you were being asked, and I would like to hear the answer. I thought the answer would be: I don't have the right to take it into account. Now, do I or don't I?",
  "Wait. Before him?",
  "Or before the -- is -- do I look at the affidavits and the warrant, or do I also look at things that are in neither of those documents but were in the officer's head?",
  "All right. So, if I look at whether he was in good faith, if he has any training at all, I would guess that if he thought that there is no -- I don't remember the exact words -- no reason, no reason to believe there would be any weapons in the house, no reason to believe there would be any handguns in the house, and then I say, I want a warrant to search for handguns in the house, it looks like you're asking for a warrant to search for that for which you have no reason to believe it's there. Now, that I would have thought was not good faith. That was contrary to the Fourth Amendment. Why isn't it?",
  "Even though you can search a person's house -- why don't I search the person's house for an atomic bomb? And I say: Why are you doing that? He says: I have no reason to believe it's there. But that is a constitutional search?",
  "What cause is there to think -- what cause is there to think that the gang guns will be used to commit a crime?",
  "Yes, but what's the difference between what you just said and the situation here? You say, if he sees the gun next to the bed, for example, or in the closet, and he's in the house looking for the sawed-off shotgun, he could seize it. He can't unless he has probable cause to think it might be used for a crime.",
  "And so, how did that change? How did that change suddenly because he happened to see in the house something in the closet, and nothing else changed? Why now suddenly can he take it?",
  "No, but your argument is there was no probable cause for thinking that the guns in the house, if there were other guns, would be used for a crime. Now, your opponent, your brother there, said when I suggested that: Oh, no, that's wrong; there is probable cause to think that any guns in the house would be used for a crime. He hasn't killed the girl yet, and one gun's as good as another. And he might well take one of those other guns and kill her. So, there's probable cause to believe that the guns that are in the house, or at least one could reasonably think so, would be used for a crime. That was his response. Then, as to whether they're likely to be in the house, well, we know this: We know he has a sawed-off shotgun, and we know he is a member of a gang, which is defined as a group of people engaged in definable criminal activity, creating an atmosphere of fear and intimidation. So, well, people like that have guns. And when -- where they live, there may well be other guns. So, it is reasonable for me to think there are other guns in the house and reasonable for me to thin k that other guns in the house would be used for killing this girl if he can get to her. Okay, that's the argument. Now, what's the response?",
  "And you don't have to -- you have to show more than that there's no probable cause. You have to show it wasn't reasonable to think that there was probable cause.",
  "He's a member of a gang which often has guns, and this expert knows that members of gangs have guns. And the definition of \"gang\" suggests they're likely to have guns, whether it's illegal to have them or not illegal.",
  "That's how he knows that. That's how he knows.",
  "If that is the -- we're using a purely objective standard, another fact that I just want your reaction on is where he says, \"I told you never to call the cops on me.\" Now, he has tried to throw her out of the window or something. He -- he's shot at her. He's trying to kill her in five different ways, and he's shouting: I'm going to kill you and I told you never to call the cops on me. When I first read that I thought, well, maybe he has some -- maybe this is explained in part not just domestic, but he has something to hide. He's afraid she's going to tell the police something. Now -- now, could a person reasonably read those words and think he has something to hide here? His -- and there's something going on, and it's not just domestic? Where does that lead us if we --",
  "Can we read it that way? And if we do read it that way, where does that lead you?",
  "Can I bring you back for a minute, please, to the statute? And if you -- it's in page 3 of the blue brief. And in just reading it, I might be missing something which you will point out to me, I'm sure. But if you get the statute at the bottom of the page, it says, as I -- if you've got it there, right?",
  "Okay. It says, \"If the [NDA] holder\" -- now that's -- that's Novo -- \"holder of the approval\" -- \"the approval holder for the drug, a\" -- I'm skipping words -- \"a use of which is claimed by the patent\" -- and that's what you are doing. And what is that use? Well, I look at page 12, and the use is \"a method for improving glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\" So, that's the use that you're -- that's the use that's claimed by the patent. If you bring \"a patent infringement action against the [ANDA] applicant\" -- that's them -- \"the [ANDA] applicant may assert a counterclaim\" -- which they want to do -- \"seeking an order requiring the holder to correct...the patent information on the ground that the patent does not claim...an approved method of using the drug.\" So, I look at that with those words -- I've skipped words. I look at those words, and I say that's what they're saying. They're saying the use that -- that your patent does not cover a portion of the set of things described by your use. And, therefore, they would like to correct the description so that the description no longer covers something that you do not have -- a use that you do not have a patent on. Now, that would seem to me to fit within those literal words. And, of course, the purpose is what we've been arguing about. But just looking at the literal words, why doesn't it fit?",
  "In other words, you're saying that the -- this -- a method for improving glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes mellitus is not patent information.",
  "I know, but are you saying it is patent information?",
  "You know, I know that argument.",
  "You don't need that argument.",
  "If you're right that patent information in this particular provision does not have anything to do with, or at least does not cover, the words about diabetes I just read, well, then I guess this section would have nothing to do with it because those are the words they want corrected, aren't they?",
  "Yes, but what it also says is this -- and that's what I want to go back to this literal statutory argument. We took the words -- because this is what you can correct. What you can correct, the statute says, is you can correct \"patent information submitted by the holder under subsection (b) or (c).\" So, we look at (b), and what (b) says is (b) tells us that you're supposed to submit, in respect to where you claim the use of a drug, the patent number and the expiration date. So, so far, that seems to support you. But then we look at the regulations which the FDA promulgated, I take it promulgated in respect to (b) and (c), particularly the sentence I read or maybe some similar sentence. And it tells you that you have to provide the description of the patented method of use as required for publication. So, now I go back and look to what you did provide. And what you did provide was you provided -- you said that what we do, we have a method for improving glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. That seems to fit directly under (3) of the FDA's requirement, and that FDA requirement was an expansion of (b). And, therefore, it sounds to me as if when they say \"correct,\" \"correct the patent information,\" it includes the sentence that you put there that they'd like to see corrected. Now, what's wrong with that?",
  "The Government -- now, the Government, which is representing all the government agencies, whether the FDA signs it or not, tells us that that language, that (b) and (c) language, about patent information as interpreted by the regs does cover this stuff.",
  "And this is about the most technical statute I ever read --",
  "-- and -- and when I'm talking about patent information among (b) and (c), we have the Government telling us that that covers this. And why don't I just stop right there and say thank goodness I'm out of this case -- and I'm not out of it.",
  "If it doesn't have a fixed meaning. I mean, wouldn't you think -- I suspect the answer is you do think that -- a district judge has a lot of power in many, many areas, and in one of those areas, some district judge sometime could make a horrendous mistake that really wrecks a case, and in such a matter, the court of appeals, if it sees a really horrendous error, will probably have the authority to say you went beyond whatever standard applies, at least here, at least -- okay, we agree on that one. So, they use some words, \"effectiveness,\" whatever the words are, \"interest of justice,\" just to reflect that fact. I mean, that's what I think what happened. Then your complaint is he didn't abuse his -- he didn't really abuse anything; he made a good decision, the district judge. Isn't that what that comes down to?",
  "What's important?",
  "All right. So, what's bothering you is the way they applied it.",
  "And they applied it in circumstances that you think -- the district judge was actually -- his decision was fine. You don't have the power to set that aside because it was within -- it's within the scope of any kind of standard you want to call it, including calling it \"interests of justice.\" Am I right in thinking that, that that's really your concern?",
  "All right. So, what you really want us to do is to look at the record of the case, go through it, and say, here, whatever words you're going to use, the district court acted within his discretion in saying don't change the counsel. Is that what you -- is that what I'm supposed to do? I'm trying to get at what you want me to do.",
  "No, I'm not --",
  "I didn't mean literally \"whatever words you use.\"",
  "I'm trying to figure out what you want me to do. One is to go back and search all the cases that use some words for a standard, which, as you can tell, I'm reluctant to think that that's meaningful in this case. The other is to look at the record to see if he acted within what you would normally think of as the district court's discretionary authority.",
  "The Ninth Circuit -- I see -- I think I see what they were trying to get at. They want -- they don't see anything practical here to do except to try to get the judge, the district judge, to focus on the question of whether the petition should be amended to assert this kind of claim about the new physical evidence; is that right?",
  "That's where they're trying to go. Okay. Now, suppose you lose this case. Suppose you -- they were to say -- suppose this Court said, well, to tell you the truth, that district judge was operating within his authority in saying that this counsel can continue to represent him. But we know subsequently relations broke down, and now there is a new counsel. All right? Can't the new counsel go back to the district court and say, Judge, we'd like to amend the petition so that you will consider, you know, whether it should be amended to include this physical evidence claim? Couldn't he do that?",
  "And what did --",
  "And the judge -- I think you answered this, but I can't remember the answer. What happened when he filed the 60(b)? Did they amend the petition or did they consider the thing or not?",
  "So, there's no -- in other words, what the Ninth Circuit in my view is trying to do is they've worked out some complicated way of trying to get the district court to consider the motion about the new physical evidence.",
  "And if that -- if that's right, then unless you -- there's no way to get there. I don't see how you get there under the law. And so, that's my --",
  "But what do you think? I'd just like to know what he's --",
  "Yes, I would have thought -- yes. You can -- sorry, go ahead.",
  "You were going to agree with that. And --",
  "I know. I mean, I'm sure you've looked at this probably. But the most -- one of the more interesting things I've found in these briefs were the references to Wigmore. So, I went back and read what Wigmore said about scientific evidence, expert evidence, and business records. And he certainly concedes and agrees with Justice Scalia, and those opinions are filled with hearsay. I mean, there's no expert who isn't relying on what his teachers told him in college, which reflects dozens of out-of-court statements given to dozens of people who wrote them up in books. So, expert opinion is always based on hearsay, almost, and -- and so are business records. They are filled with hearsay. But Wigmore writes a treatise, doesn't he, where he says exceptions have been recognized since the 17th century or earlier to cover that kind of material? So, my question for you is why shouldn't we recognize a similar, related kind of exception here? We're trying to discover the meaning of \"testimonial.\" The difference here is a police lab or a lab that reports to a police lab. The individuals there probably know that there is a fairly good chance that what they say will be used in a criminal trial. They don't know it for sure, but they're controlled by the canons, by accreditation, by tests of reliability, by the fact that they're not normally interested in the results of a trial, as here they couldn't care less; they don't even care if it is used in a trial. And all the Wigmore factors for both exceptions could support a similar exception here, which would have the following virtue: It would have the virtue of not requiring 10 people to come in and testify, whom the defense is, of course, free to call; and it would also have the virtue of removing the temptation for prosecutors to stop relying on the more reliable evidence, DNA, and instead encourage them to rely on the less reliable evidence; namely, the eyewitness testimony in a case. Now, that -- that really is all my questions in one.",
  "Because I understand every argument you're making as fitting it in with hearsay. I agree with that. And I also agree to a degree with the testimonial point. And I see the need for an exception, and Wigmore provides all the reasons, and since we're interpreting that word \"testimonial,\" don't we have the power, and why shouldn't we create one out of the word \"testimonial\"?",
  "Well, I'll go further in your direction --",
  "Yes, but Wigmore actually believed that the Confrontation Clause simply encapsulated the hearsay rule.",
  "I'm asking you the question, and I -- I'll go further in your direction. I'll go further, because I would say what about saying this: that not only do we recognize the exception, but it isn't a full exception; that if the defendant can show some reason to believe that either the laboratory is not properly accredited, it isn't doing things properly; or that the individual technician has something personal or knows about -- about the defendant that makes it suspect, immediately the presumption that the exception applies disappears, and the prosecutor has to call the -- the witness. You can say, well, we shouldn't make that up, but I believe if you go back to the 18th century, you'll discover that your interpretation of the Confrontation Clause was not there. So -- so, that's what's basing my question, and I'd like your reaction. It's a long question, considers an exception, and I'd like you to give me your reaction to that.",
  "I did, but I --",
  "And I mean it because I see extending those cases from one individual from a laboratory being familiar with the results to requiring, in ordinary cases, the calling of what could be up to 10 technicians -- I see that as making a sea change in normal criminal law practices, and my motive is as I said: I fear it will push the system in the direction of relying on less reliable eyewitness testimony rather than more reliable technical laboratory DNA-type evidence. Now, you have my -- I've made the point, and I really want to get your response.",
  "That's true whenever -- whenever an expert -- an expert makes a statement. There is a conceptual difference between their testifying to something out of court for its truth and that being the basis for the expert opinion. In the one case, she's relying upon a statement in order to form her opinion; and in the other case, she's introducing the statement. And you're saying, in this case, that's a distinction without a difference. Isn't that what's going on?",
  "All right. But still there is the conceptual difference. And as long as there is that conceptual difference, don't we have a basis for distinguishing this case from Melendez?",
  "Yes. Yes, but your question --",
  "All right. But then, how do you -- that's -- I see that. I will spare you the reasons why I think the law of nature doctrine exists, because they are not relevant to my question. My question is I think it's hornbook law that the law of nature cannot be patented.",
  "It is also hornbook law that the application of a law of nature can be patented.",
  "All right. So, in this case, what I think the claim is, is that we are applying a law of nature. Now, we read the words of applying it: Administer a drug, determine the level. And then it uses the word \"wherein,\" which I'll ask them what that means. But -- but -- so, they say those two words, administer the drug, determine the level, are the application of the law of nature that they found. Now, there's something odd about that in your view --",
  "-- at least. And I want to know what.",
  "All right. Suppose it didn't. Suppose I discover that if I take aspirin, someone takes aspirin, I discover they have to take aspirin for a headache, and, you know, I see an amazing thing: If you look at a person's little finger, and you notice the color, it shows the aspirin, you need a little more; unless it's a different color, you need a little less. Now, I've discovered a law of nature --",
  "-- and I may have spent millions on that. And I can't patent that law of nature, but I say I didn't; I said apply it. I said look at his little finger.",
  "Okay? Is that a good patent or isn't it?",
  "Why not?",
  "If you can tell me why not, I'll have an understanding of where you're coming from.",
  "Ah. Now, we're into the problem. And that is the problem of how much you have to add.",
  "If you look at the Court's cases, they seem to say Flook, one thing, and Diehr, another thing. And so, what is your view about how much has to be added to make it an application of a law of nature? And how would you put that in words?",
  "You are getting warmer, but --",
  "But the -- the words, look, \"a simple conventional step.\" Hmmm. You see, whether it's true in this case or not, discovering natural laws is often a very expensive process.",
  "And there's lots of investment to be protected.",
  "But they can't, okay? So, now you're going to say, well, what do they have to add to that? And now we run into problems, because if you have to just not look at the law of nature, don't look at it when you decide whether it's novel, that not only runs into conflict with prior cases, but it doesn't make much sense because really the novel thing is often the law of nature. But you say you have to add something.",
  "What?",
  "And now, that's -- what do you have to add? And it can't be that you take the law of nature out and look to whether the rest of it meets the patent criteria. It's -- it's pretty clear in the law, and I can give you reasons why, but forget the reasons. But, look, what do you want to say the rest of it has to add up to?",
  "You're going on a limitation thing. So, you're going to say reject all the 15 fancy hypotheticals I'll also spare you.",
  "But it's pretty easy to think of the same problem you have, you know, which doesn't have this infinity in it.",
  "Which unfortunately we have to deal with.",
  "Yes, but what my opinion lacked, frankly, and that's sometimes the virtue of a dissent in such a case, it lacked -- and Novartis points this out very well in their brief -- it lacked an explanation as to why what I thought was a patent just said observe the correlation.",
  "Why isn't that an application of the law of nature? And if you look to LabCorp's dissent to find an answer to that question, you're better than I, because I couldn't find it.",
  "Why? Why is the question.",
  "Look, anything can be transformed into a process. Look at those real estate ones, the -- I mean, you know, lawyers ones. I have a way of making a great argument in the Supreme Court. You know, you could patent some of your arguments.",
  "Why not cut them off at the pass? That is, if you're really prepared to say -- it has to do with process, not machines. In the 19th century, not many patent processes were granted. So, they're rather special because of the special problem the Chief just noticed. So, why not --",
  "-- cut them off at the pass, if you're prepared to say --",
  "Well, I'll add a little bit to this because I am questioning what you say here in the other direction. You say if you just look at everything minus the law of nature, hmm, and that is a process that's otherwise known or obvious in light of the prior art, you can't patent it. That seems to me maybe it goes too far the other direction, because we know that a lot of work goes into these laws of nature.",
  "Yes, but I -- all right. So, there are both parts, but I'm more interested in --",
  "Yes, but this drug is patentable because it's a -- it's a -- what is the third word? You know, it's a combination of nature. What's the -- it's a composition of matter.",
  "No, they don't have to be.",
  "You'd say -- you would say that where it's a new use there were some specifications, and the specifications limited the area to over here, I think -- and tell me if I'm wrong because I'm really asking just a question. They limit it over here, you see. And now we have a new use, and we're saying this composition of matter is being used over here. So, aren't you getting a -- simply a different area where you're using a composition of matter.",
  "That isn't a process patent.",
  "Is a process --",
  "All right. I'll think about it.",
  "I thought of two examples that will try to get you to talk about the problem that's really bothering me here, anyway.",
  "Well. A patent for -- we've discovered, at some expense, what counts as too little fertilizer and what counts as too much to make plants grow, a certain kind of fertilizer, very common. Less than an quarter of an inch, forget it; more than half an inch, you're going to burn the plant. Imagine that. Law of nature, absolutely, about the chemicals in the fertilizer. Patent: A method for determining when there's too little or too much fertilizer. Put some fertilizer in a field and measure how much there is, wherein less than a quarter of an inch is too little and wherein more than half an inch is too much. Second example. Einstein never lived, but at a vast expense, you invented E equals MC squared, okay, a method for measuring energy which is very useful that comes out of a cyclotron. Put some stuff in a cyclotron, measure the stuff in and measure how much it comes out, and keep -- wherein -- wherein the missing part is -- think about -- wherein -- no, it says wherein the missing part will be calculated as an amount of energy according to a formula E equals MC squared. Yes. If your patent is valid, why aren't the two I just mentioned?",
  "And if you -- if the two I just mentioned are valid, there is something wrong with this picture.",
  "Where is -- where is lack of novelty? Nobody has these numbers before. They always thought it was a quarter, an eighth of an inch, and -- it's huge novelty.",
  "I mean, my point --",
  "Assume with me the eighth versus quarter of an inch, which is the law of nature part, is not obvious.",
  "No, no. My question is, what has to be added to a law of nature to make it a patentable process?",
  "And if you put too little in the answer to that question, I believe I can take things like E equals MC squared and make them patentable.",
  "And if you put too much in, you're going to wreck your own case. So, I'm very interested in hearing --",
  "What about a process that all the steps are -- it's a process to -- to generate some useful information.",
  "All right? Fine. And the only new thing about it is the useful information. Anything like that in history, any patent case that you can -- that comes to mind that you say that was okay? Can you think of one?",
  "What? Good. That's what I would like to know.",
  "No, no. That's not what I'm thinking of. I'm thinking of a patent to find useful information that chickens can only eat so much chicken food. That nobody has ever known before, you know. Okay. Now -- or something like that. But they tell you the useful information that's going to be found right in the patent. In other words, we have a patent to discover some useful information, and here is the useful information, and now here's -- see, this is what their complaint is.",
  "But you don't know what you're going to find because you don't know how much ore you're going to find? Let's see. Okay. Let me think about it. Thank you.",
  "What's your view? What's your view?",
  "You should not lose it.",
  "You can't lift a boat over Niagara Falls. And I -- and I read somewhere that -- I hope I'm wrong, but I have a feeling I read somewhere that the land under Niagara Falls has long been considered to be navigable, and, therefore, it's owned by the United States.",
  "It's owned by the State. Oh, you mean the navigable -- I get mixed up in that. The --",
  "The navigable ones are owned by the State. Okay. Everybody's thought the land under Niagara Falls is owned by the State. Oh, dear, because that sort of wrecks our nice theory that all the steps, all the little bits of it that are non -- that are --",
  "Okay. Now we have to define what's an extended strip.",
  "Okay. So, how much are we wrecking if we just say, look, the bit that's nonnavigable is different from the bit that's navigable?",
  "Period. Doesn't matter if it's 5 feet of land or not. What are we wrecking?",
  "A quick question which you could probably answer just by saying we decided not to. But I was somewhat curious. It's really the United States v. Montana in this, who owns the land, and it's a question of Federal law. It's going to be highly factual no matter what this happens. Made for this Court's original jurisdiction. And -- and normally in original jurisdiction, we appoint a master, it's worked out, and we review the master's report. We can't do that here because it's a case -- why didn't you go into, or why couldn't you go into, a quiet title action in Federal court?",
  "Just out of -- I mean, to waste your time for a second, why do the feds own the land underneath the -- and why -- under the nonnavigable parts? And why do the feds own the land under a nonnavigable stream?",
  "I mean, little creeks somewhere which you'd think, gee, those belong to the State, but turns out the feds own the land underneath the little creek; is that right?",
  "Yes.",
  "I see. So, the rule is, on the nonnavigable streams, it depends on what the conveyance was at the time of statehood, and those are individual matters, and sometimes --",
  "-- you'll see the feds own them and sometimes the States.",
  "Is that right?",
  "Okay.",
  "But, now, Montello was a case -- to follow up this same question. Montello, I take it, was not a title case. Montello was a regulation of the stream case. So, I can understand perfectly well why that language in Montello applies for the reason Justice Kennedy just said. Now, I grant you that they -- in later title cases, this Court has taken the same words and written them. But is there an instance in the later title cases where that language has played a controlling role?",
  "What case should I look at to see that it was really meant that that -- this -- see, start where Justice Scalia was and then say what Justice Kennedy just said --",
  "-- and then thinking, well -- I'm thinking, well, Montello was a case that involved a different purpose, and now the later cases, although they quoted the language, it didn't have a role. Am I right or not?",
  "All right. So, how do I find that out? If I start with a practical premise of not wanting to interrupt expectations, I also believe that it's the most common thing in the world for electric power companies to put hydroelectric facilities where there are waterfalls or rapids, and that's true all over the country. So, what's the status quo with the -- you know, somebody could count up how many hydroelectric plants there are on waterfalls. And what's the general view? Have those hydroelectric companies been thinking that they are leasing or buying from the feds or from the States? I mean, I don't know what's happened in the past. And I have looked at the briefs. I can't get a very good picture.",
  "When you say \"wreak havoc,\" do you mean to say that the States have leased those strips with the waterfalls which are impassable to hydroelectric companies, and the leases will have to be renegotiated or something like that?",
  "Why? You say \"practical.\" The order itself says that. It says you don't do it, you're going to get penalized up to 32.5, which is now 37.",
  "How can they bring an action? I'd like some clarification here. The Corps's regs say the Corps will accept an after-the-fact permit. I mean, one after -- if they applied tomorrow, the day after getting this order, you'd run up against the reg, which says we won't give you any after the fact -- we won't even consider this matter, until any required initial corrective measures are made. And then, just to be safe, they say that no permit application will be accepted unless the Corps determines that concurrent processing of an after-the-fact permit application is clearly appropriate. \"Clearly.\" So, I looked at those two things and said, of course, you can't apply to the Corps of Engineers; they're not going to accept it unless you have a very unusual case. So, I expect you to tell me why I'm wrong about that, if I am, or how many after-the-fact permit applications has the Corps of Engineers accepted. Maybe there are a lot.",
  "Okay. All right. I agree. Then, if we agree, then look, for 75 years the courts have interpreted statutes with an eye towards permitting judicial review, not the opposite.",
  "And yet -- so, here you're saying this statute that says nothing about it precludes review, and then the second thing you say is that this isn't final. So, I read the order. It looks like about as final a thing as I've ever seen. So, tell me why I'm wrong on those two points.",
  "Okay. If it doesn't - -",
  "-- you're on the final part.",
  "Is there anything you've got by -- I mean, I'm -- you've got me now into the area; we're applying the APA; and the question is Abbott Labs and is it final? Well, here there doesn't seem anything more for the agency to do, and here the -- the person whom the order is directed against is being hurt a lot. So, the only thing I -- left in my mind here is the order itself does say come in and talk to us about this. Which may suggest it isn't final. So, do you have any information on that point? That is, have you looked up or has the EPA told you that really when we issue these things, in fact people come in and we modify them X percent of the time?",
  "Do you have any impression that you could tell us?",
  "Do they - -",
  "This is not a warning. I mean, really all you have to do is look at it. I was quite moved by the fact when I looked at it, it didn't say a warning. It said this is an order. It looks extremely formal. I even overstated in your favor the question of negotiating because it doesn't say negotiating about changing the order; it says negotiating about amending the order. And -- so, this is not just a warning, is it?",
  "No, but the - -",
  "More of a -- that's what I'm trying to get you to talk about just for one minute. I mean, you're talking about a huge upheaval. My honest impression is that it is the Government here that is fighting 75 years of practice - -",
  "-- because -- because the issue is the Abbott Labs issue of finality.",
  "And, of course, a warning isn't reviewable. But this seems to meet the test where that fails. Now, please correct me if I'm wrong about the agency practice. I can't find support for you - -",
  "I do, actually, because I see their point better than I did. This, I think, is what they're worried about: They're worried that when you get judicial review of this kind of order, the court doesn't refer on factfinding that isn't made on a record. The substantial evidence test applies to factfinding made on a record, or 556/557. And so, they'll have a hard time -- or a harder time -- in each of these cases subjecting it to judicial factfinding. And they think that the purpose of this, the purpose of this procedure given to them by statute was to call it -- the shots in favor of them, because there might be thousands of these things, and they can't prepare all that formal thing. Now, I -- I see that as a -- as a -- now I understand their concern. I'm not saying they're right. I understand their concern. So, if you want to comment, is there some way to accommodate their concern that also accommodates judicial review? Or are we just in a kind of -- they're in a Hobson's choice, in a sense.",
  "They want the power because they have thousands of these things. They investigate it, and they find the facts. They think it's sufficient, but judicial factfinding is carried out before a judge who doesn't have their experience, et cetera, and, therefore, there is a risk of incorrect decisionmaking, at least too -- under the statute, it would be too pro-homeowner rather too pro-environment. That's why it's more of a dilemma than I thought.",
  "Well, they might -- the might change their -- their system here, if you -- if you win this, and provide for various kinds of pre-order procedure or post-order procedure where they'd be open to change. I see a number of possibilities. I can see their dilemma.",
  "There has to be a reasonable -- some kind of justification. Can you work with the word \"equitable\"? I mean, this was an equitable action, and could you say that the -- to the district court, well, of course, you -- assuming you'd win on the second question. But on the first question, this is not an on/off thing. That's your real objection to the de novo standard. You say: But these are equitable actions, and generally an individual should not be allowed to run around the PTO. So, you better have some kind of reason, but leave it up to the -- to the district courts to work with that word \"equitable\" and to -- it seems to me there will be a lot of shading cases here where you can't quite tell if it is new or isn't new and some parts are and some aren't. But just leave it up to the district court and say: Take into account the fact that people should not be allowed to run around the PTO and work equity. That's kicking the ball back. Now, if you like that, let me know. If you don't like it, tell me what we -- why -- what should we -- you want an absolute rule? Tell me why.",
  "And if it says there isn't, then it can't hear it? I mean, imagine you're sitting there as a district judge, you think: Oh, my God, they should have presented it, but this is the key matter forever. Do I really pay no attention to it at all?",
  "Except you have a history here.",
  "You have the history of the pre-APA section 145 where they apparently did take the evidence in.",
  "Do you think -- in terms of the second question on the standard of review, I'm somewhat -- I'd like your response to the approach, that where there's ambiguity -- I mean, you're going to win if there's no ambiguity. But if there's ambiguity, I think that 1946 makes a difference. That is, preceding that time, every agency went its own way, and you had dozens of specialized methods of review. And the whole purpose of 50 years of administrative law has been to try to create uniformity across agencies in a vast Federal Government. And now, what was obviously worrying me in the first case and this case, too - -",
  "-- is that we're chipping away at that, and that will be very hard for lawyers and for ordinary people to understand if we suddenly go back and create specialized rules in favor of each agency that always wants a specialized rule, of course; they think what they do is terribly important, which it is, I'm sure. But that's -- that's why I'm saying if ambiguity on the standard of review, you go with uniformity.",
  "That's -- that begs the question in a sense because they're interlinked. I mean, the same reasons would support that it's not a trial de novo even if you introduce some new evidence.",
  "It is a -- it is an old trial with some new evidence, and there will be a thousand different variations on that theme.",
  "All right. So, the new part -- I get that.",
  "All right. Well, if you're willing to accept that, then what about broadening that to prevent people from running around the PTO, and simply saying unless the -- unless the person, the potential patentee, unless he wants to -- unless he has shown he can show that he's innocent, that is to say it wasn't deliberate, it wasn't negligent, it wasn't a part of a trial -- of a strategy, unless he shows he was totally without sin in some form of words in not introducing the evidence the first time, he can't introduce it now?",
  "Well, say that. Say unless he can show that there was good cause for his not having introduced it before the PTO, he -- the -- the court now won't consider it.",
  "My goodness. Suppose you're a lawyer, back to the Chief Justice's question, as you are, and you have the client there, and you're thinking, you know, if he puts all his evidence before the PTO, and they say no, we've had it. I mean, there we are. But if we hold back something, well, then we're going to get not -- get de novo review and a district court. Boy! But if we're too obvious about holding back something, we run into the estoppel rule. My goodness. You're -- you're in a mess, it seems to me, trying to advise a client what to do in that situation. Better not say hold something back; on the other hand, if he does he's pretty -- how do you deal -- you see?",
  "That's what they said they're doing. I mean, I count in the -- about eight times in the house plan, the State house plan, and several times in the senate plan where it's clear, and I think it's fairly clear in the U.S. House plan, they say things like: \"The court began by considering the uncontested districts from the enacted plan that embraced neutral districting principles, although it wasn't required to give any deference.\" And you say they're wrong about that. \"The court attempted to embrace as many of the uncontested districts as possible.\" So, after I got finished reading their opinions, I thought, well, there may be a difference between what you say and they say, but I'm not sure that there is a difference that's reflected in the maps. And so, it's now January 9th. We have to have something in effect by February 1st. They said that they're paying attention to what the legislature did. And when I looked at the maps, as far as I can tell, they include -- some more, some less, most in the State senate -- but they include a lot of the State's changes. So, what am I supposed to do? I mean, I can't tell whether you're right or wrong without looking district by district by district by district. What am I supposed to do on January 9th?",
  "In which -- in which - -",
  "Okay. El Paso County in the original plan I guess was -- like number 16. I've got it in front of me. And they split it, and it was split somewhat differently or not. Okay.",
  "No, no, right. It's a whole - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. Correct.",
  "So -- all right. All right. Now, why was that wrong? Why is that wrong? Tell me why it's wrong for them to do that.",
  "No, no, I didn't say that. I said, in their way of thinking, they are taking the map into account. Now, to sit -- the enacted one. If I disagree with that, I can't disagree at the level of principle; I have to disagree at the level of particular districts. That's why I asked you the question. So, you point to district 16, and I say, very well, tell me what they did wrong and why? Because, remember, they are facing a challenge that's based on section 5, part purpose. And the district court there said, in the D.C., you don't survive -- I can't give you a summary judgment on that; purpose here may have been violated. All right. Now, you tell me what's wrong with district 16, which I guess is your strongest case. That would be helpful.",
  "Tell me -- tell me what's the problem?",
  "What they said they were doing. They couldn't have lost sight at the level of generality because at the level of generality they said we're trying to take into account the map. I'm just repeating myself. I want to know what is wrong with the drawing of district 16, what they did, given that there's a section 5 challenge based on purpose?",
  "Do you have an idea of when? MR. SRINIVASAN. And by way of guidance on that, what I would - -",
  "Do you have -- what is that based on?",
  "Yes, I read -- I read -- I read the opinion and what she said on the phone and so forth.",
  "It seems to me that it's a complicated case. Let's suppose you're completely right on your time schedule. Then they'll decide something. How could any human being redraw maps in 5 days or 10 days where you'll have different -- six different positions? I mean, I think it's impossible. How can you -- I don't see how you could do it.",
  "Well, I think there's -- it seemed to me from reading it, I -- I didn't think that the judge there is ready to grant preclearance.",
  "But the other thing in sending it back, I read the brief, and then I read the opinions. I don't think I have -- I'm not being too generous to the opinions, but I thought what they were saying throughout is we didn't try to draw extra coalition or extra opportunity districts; they emerged. They say \"emerged\" about seven times. They emerged as we tried to apply equal vote principles. And it's hardly surprising that it would, considering that the population growth is primarily due to the minority expansion. So, they didn't seem to me -- now, why do you want us to send it back to get more explanation when that seems to be the explanation, and to me at first blush, it seems like a perfectly good explanation.",
  "What he says two sentences before, if I can be helpful to read it, the fourth new district, district 33, was drawn in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex \"to reflect population growth in that area.\" All right?",
  "Then he goes on to say just what Justice Scalia says. And I -- I did read that as saying, well, when you apply -- I read it consistent what they've said in -- elsewhere, which is that what they're doing is population grows; you have to have one person, one vote; the legislature itself in the new plan did create a minority, whatever you -- the opportunity district here; so, we're following what they did; we're taking into account population, and it turns out to be, and we do create it as -- in which case there is some ambiguity here.",
  "It's peculiar because in the circumstance where the extra assessment is all going to go to chargeable activities, in fact that means economically speaking the following year the objector will be better off, not worse off, because there is a higher percentage of the total fee that's being paid to chargeable activities. So, this special assessment that Justice Sotomayor and the Chief Justice were talking about is one that will benefit the objector, if he keeps quiet and says nothing. So, it's a little hard to imagine the frame of mind that would say I need the notice because now I might object, whereas I wouldn't have before.",
  "Yes, I see that point. Can I ask you -- oh, are you -- you want to pursue that further, or are we - -",
  "All right. Let me give you this example.",
  "And now I -- but I think I see what your answer is. Imagine it's year two. In year one, expenditures broke down so that it was 70 percent chargeable, 30 percent not chargeable. Got that?",
  "And normally, under Hudson, that means in year two the deal is the objectors pay 70 percent, right?",
  "In the middle of year two, surprisingly, something comes up. Something comes up. A surprise to the union, and they want to have a special assessment. And you're saying they just can't without going through this procedure all over again?",
  "All right. So, this is a peculiar rule that you have asked us to adopt. The rule is that where there is a special assessment and it will make all the objectors better off, they have to have a special notice that they can object. But where the rule is that we're going to take money we already collected from them and spend it for a totally political purpose, we don't give them a special notice and they don't have to object. Now, that seems totally backwards, but I understand why you get there, and my suspicion is - - which you can confirm, is that's the only administrable system you can think of.",
  "Right. But in my hypothetical - -",
  "Yes, but the hypothetical, if I could continue with it, is -- is perhaps unrealistic, but they have 20 bishops and 14 most honest people in the United States, and they've all absolutely guaranteed, and everybody agrees, that this goes to chargeable activity. And where I was going with my question, which you see where I was -- you're with me on this, right?",
  "And combine the two. What I'm trying to point out and get your response is that you've been forced into this position to create a workable system. Now, why is that workable system one whit better than the workable system we already have, which is all this washes out in a fair manner the following year, that there is an inevitable year's lag? It doesn't work perfectly, but it's as good as any other, and all we have to say is it's better than yours. Now, why is yours better than that?",
  "They're useful to me.",
  "Do you get -- does your Hudson notice tell you about what's going to happen next year? I thought your Hudson notice told you this was the breakdown for the last year, and as far as we can tell, that's what it will be next year, but -- but things could change. What does the Hudson notice tell you?",
  "But am I right in my description of it?",
  "All right.",
  "Can you think of for a second -- to go back to Justice Sotomayor. Now, I would like you to see, I think, why she asked the question. As I understand it, the way it works now is at the beginning of, say, September -- say it goes September -- September. September of year two, we look back to year one, and we see what the percentages were. And now we in the union calculate a budget for year two. And we go and get approval or opt-outs on that basis. Now, what I thought coming in here is that the problem was going to be, if you have to have a new notice in the middle of the year for special political assessments, you're going to discover that half the time you don't know if they're special political assessments. It's an impossible line to draw. It's really tough. You're making the argument that however you draw the line, we're on the right side of it, not the wrong side. Isn't that what -- basically what you're saying? It's not a special assessment. It wasn't really -- et cetera. Okay. Now -- but there's a new argument that's come along that I hadn't focused on, that we can avoid the administrative problem by saying all special assessments require a new notice, whether they're for political purposes or not. Hence the question that I was trying to get -- I was very interested in your answer. If we had that rule, which avoids the problem of saying which is which, how does that affect the union? Not necessarily yours but unions in general. How often is it that you draw up your budget for year two in September, you put it into effect, and then during the year, you discover you need more money from people for any reason, and, therefore, you change what you thought they were going to contribute? How often, if you can give us an estimate -- and you're in a better position than I. Does it happen a lot, rarely, a little? What do you want to say?",
  "No, but the -- the problem if you win in this case, and then there is this other way of getting to the same -- the same result, is that the other way of getting to the same result, while permissible, is far less transparent. And people won't understand it, and it -- it encourages a kind of slyness that seems highly undesirable. And the virtue of the present system is that it does require some forced loans, that's true, but it does wash out in the wash, and it ends up being fair to the objectors. And it's simply hard to think of a better system that doesn't provide more administrative problems than the existing one.",
  "So, that's -- go ahead.",
  "Could you -- could you digress for one minute to help me understand the procedural posture of this case. When it was here last time, we were dealing with an issue called \"fleeting expletives,\" and that was Fox. And the Fox case involved just that. They didn't really, or we didn't, or the Court didn't, attack the 2001 order which is now at issue. And then, without it going back to the commission, the Second Circuit decided it on a ground that sets aside the 2001 order. Now, can we here just decide the fleeting expletive case, because the fleeting expletive case has to do with one subset of applications of the 2001 order and has to do with part 2(2) or something. I mean, it has -- and how you interpret the words \"material dwells on or repeats.\" Now, that I -- that I understand how to get at. The ABC case raises -- doesn't raise fleeting expletives. It wasn't fleeting. And it raises the question of the validity of -- under vagueness grounds, of 2001 industry guidance and how that's been applied. But the Second Circuit didn't deal with that case. It sent it back to the commission. So, has there been a commission decision recently which has reviewed the basic arguments being made here about the validity of the 2001 industry guidance as applied? Has there been such a thing? Alternatively, has there been an appeals court holding on the -- or analysis of the ABC case?",
  "Right.",
  "But they didn't -- they didn't in that case --",
  "-- and they sent the ABC case back. I see your --",
  "Yes.",
  "I see.",
  "All right. When this ABC case was argued in front of the commission -- I have here about 30 briefs at least, maybe 40, and they are filled with very good arguments. Were those arguments made to the commission in the context of the ABC case? Because as it comes up here, we are -- whereas I thought when we granted cert, quite honestly, that this was Fox coming back, as I've read the brief it isn't at all. This is a new case, nothing to do with what we decided before. This is the case of ABC, period. And it is an attack on the 2001 guidelines, not fleeting expletives. And, therefore, I want to know, at least satisfy myself, that this Fox -- this ABC case has gone through ordinary procedures and, indeed, these arguments have all been made in front of the commission and they've been rejected.",
  "I'm not saying every one, but has the essence of these arguments.",
  "All right. So, suppose we take that particular line. You didn't argue -- I mean, Fox didn't argue -- Fox was worried about the fleeting expletive policy in Golden Globe. I doubt in Golden Globe, when it was before the commission, they raised all these vagueness challenges to the whole 2001 policy. So, why -- here you've taken a much broader stance now, though you didn't before. I mean, do you want to say anything about what I think is the basic issue that Fox raises? We don't have to overrule Pacifica. What Fox was penalized for was two women on television who basically used a fleeting expletive which seems to be naturally part of their vocabulary.",
  "And -- and we're worried about small stations that cannot censor people because they don't know what they're going to say. All right. That was what we wrote, I think in -- in my opinion, anyway. We were worried about that.",
  "Are you abandoning that argument?",
  "It's an ABC argument primarily, but you made that argument in the Second Circuit. What I'm fishing with -- you don't have to comment more, but -- is, do we have to reach that argument? Except it's --",
  "-- very, very broad --",
  "Yes.",
  "This wasn't -- I mean, I -- don't know about this instance. It's called \"Nude Awakening.\" It's about the sexual awakening of a child. You ran it, your client, after 10 o'clock on both coasts, and they choose to run it at 9 o'clock for some unknown reason in the Midwest. Maybe they thought -- I don't know, whatever. But the --",
  "But -- all right. So, my point is what the FCC terribly told you to do was run it 1 hour later in the Midwest, just as you did on the coast.",
  "And -- and why is that not -- I'm not saying -- taking this point of view, but I'm saying why isn't that just time, manner, and circumstance that puts you to very little trouble and allows everybody to see it and, therefore, is constitutional?",
  "Because you wanted to make more money from it, I understand that. And maybe people would have been a little bit inconvenienced, but the inconvenience -- they made a judgment that looking at this show is not like \"Private Ryan.\" It's about sexual awakening. They are showing a part of a nude woman. The viewer is supposed to put himself in the position of the boy who's seeing her, and the whole thing was titillating. Now, they might be wrong. There are two sides to that argument. And so, I guess what you're arguing is -- if I were to say, is that a reasonable view? I guess I'd have to say it. But you have to say much -- you're telling me I have to say much more than that.",
  "All right.",
  "I see where you're going -- the question.",
  "Which -- you haven't seen where I'm going. I wanted you to say just exactly what you said, and you did, which I thank you.",
  "And -- and my question, which I've been trying to get so you'd see very precisely what it is, is why don't I just say, if you're right, just what you said? And say this is an instance, case by case, in which, for the reasons, then I quote you, that the First Amendment forbids the application of the guideline to this case. In other words, what I'm driving at is the basic thing that's worrying me here: Does this case in front of us really call for the earthshaking decision that you all have argued for in the -- in the briefs? And that's what I'm trying to figure out, and that's why I am particularly worried about whether or not this whole big argument here was presented to the FCC about whether we have to reach that far. Now do you see where I was trying to get?",
  "All right.",
  "My law clerk found 17.",
  "My law clerk found -- sorry.",
  "But your only conclusion from that is that they can't have any rule.",
  "That their -- what is -- I looked through the briefs; I don't see what you're -- tell me where in these briefs do you suggest what the rule ought to be.",
  "Yes. All right.",
  "Yes.",
  "Where are they in the briefs? Can you just cite the pages where I will find the alternatives to the present system that don't jump obscenity alone?",
  "Why are you separating four things? I mean, I've heard, it seems to me, three separate rationales. One, the easiest, is in (D) itself. Sometimes a woman could have a miscarriage, and of course she has to stay home. And that isn't covered by (A), (B), or (C). So, we cover it in (D), you know. And then we put the men in too because we don't want to make this incentive just to not hire women. That's one. The second one was the one Justice Ginsburg brought up, that there is a gap in the pregnancy law which won't work unless you have to give people some medical leave. So, here it is, (D). And the third one, which I think was related to what Justice Alito just said, is when -- you have to read it together to understand the third one. You get 12 weeks all together. All right? Now, that means, once you put in (D), this Act will have less of a bad effect. The bad effect of the Act is if you protect the women, then the -- the employers say, well, we're not going to hire women, perfect; we have to give them 12 leaves; we'd have to give the men -- terrible, it's a terrible disincentive. But then they worked out how to lessen the disincentive. And the way you do that, you say 12 weeks overall. And now look what happens. A woman wants to take, say, 12 weeks to look after her family, and she gets separately sick, 4 more weeks. But how many does she get? Answer: Twelve, right? Twelve. You could answer that part.",
  "Now let's think of the man. Let's think of the man. The man would like to look after the family, say, for 6 weeks. And he gets sick 4 weeks. How many weeks have we got?",
  "Ten. Thank you.",
  "All right.",
  "So -- perfect. So, now the employer is sitting -- and it will work with other numbers. I don't rely on those alone.",
  "But now look what happens. Without this Act, he's got a woman who is going to be out of there -- I mean, with the Act -- see, unless we put in four -- unless we put in the fourth part of it, we have a woman who's gone for 12 weeks and a man who's gone maybe for 6 but maybe for zero, okay? Maybe for 6. With the Act, the woman's gone for 12, the man's gone for 10. You see? And so, the comparison there -- and it will work with whatever numbers you want. The comparison there is very different. And the comparison doesn't - - doesn't totally erase the problem with the woman, but it may reduce it to a size where the Act itself will no longer act as such a disincentive to hiring a woman. We have three different rationales. All of them are related to a serious problem, which is the problem of discrimination against women because the employers think they'll be home more. And so, you see the conclusion I'm drawing? Yes, okay. So -- so, where are we?",
  "No, it doesn't have to, of course. But the whole point of the question that I was asking was, sure, what helps you by doing it separately is it helps your case. But if we look at what Congress was trying to do, they were trying to do it as a whole. That's my point that I want you to answer. And they're trying to do it as a whole because, no matter what numbers I use, if I look at it without (D) -- is it (D)? Yes, (D). If I look at it without (D), the ratio will disfavor the woman. And if I look at it with (D), suddenly the ratio from the point of view of the employer of the disadvantage of hiring a woman over - - over hiring a man -- it goes way down. And that helps women. And that is why, I think -- reading this and listening, a major reason why they put in (D) as part of the other, because working with that 12-week limitation and the whole rest of the statute, we now have a statute that doesn't defeat itself. We now have a statute that actually can achieve the end of leading employers to not discriminate against women. Not perfectly, but there's a big improvement. And that's the -- that's the argument I'm making. You have to read it as a whole to see that. And that's what I -- I wonder if there's an answer to that. Of course, I'm at the moment thinking there isn't an answer to it, but I asked the question because I want to hear what you say.",
  "He was.",
  "He was -- he's absolutely right, and that's why this isn't a health spa thing, (D). This is -- in fact, has two independent reasons, that all -- the miscarriage reason and the Pregnancy Act reason. And so, it isn't just saying go to a health spa. But I mean, I don't want to put arguments in your mouth, which I just have, which you wouldn't like there anyway, because -- but I would appreciate your going on with this discussion in respect to what Justice Alito and I have been talking about, and I'd be interested in what you think.",
  "Would you then go back -- I did have the same question Justice Alito asked, and I'd like to hear the answer. The answer -- that there - - I'll add one footnote, perhaps, which -- make it a more complete answer, and that is that it makes very little sense to me when a worker becomes disabled on January 1, 1990, for example. He is now disabled. And so, we calculate what his wage was. His wage was $200 a week. And now we say: But that shouldn't exceed twice the average weekly wage, and we're not going to apply it to him. You're going to apply it to him at some random date. His wage that he's getting paid is figured out as of January 1, 1990.",
  "But the maximum that it could be is figured out as of January 1, 1998, when he finishes a proceeding. Now, I just -- for both reasons, why would you distinguish and why would you get that result? For those two reasons, it doesn't seem to make much sense to me, your reading of it, while theirs does make sense. Now, you explain why that is.",
  "But you think -- you think it is not stupid because you think it is a good idea to give a lot of work to the Department of Labor and that all the employers who are going to do this voluntarily and there will never be a problem with it -- all should be encouraged to go and get a certificate from the Department of Labor. All right. I'll take that as - - something. And now, why is it I can't read the statute the way that it seems to make somewhat more sense? I don't see any words here that stop me from reading it.",
  "Where now there exactly? It says -- you mean in (c)?",
  "You just told me that just has to do with permanent or total disability, and this is far - -",
  "But why -- why don't they both? I mean, as I read it naturally, it says that - - we now have a special thing, you know, which these people are the dead ones and the widows are getting it and the permanently disabled people, and the -- this individual, and the Secretary, the Secretary or his delegate is going to calculate this thing all the time. And they've got a special thing here for -- for permanent people, permanently disabled, and they're saying as to those people, we're giving them a break. They can't look for more work. They can't look for - - they're dead, for example, and they can't find other sources of income. And so, we say that, that if the average wage goes up and their wage was higher to begin with, we will raise it a bit.",
  "And that applies not only to the people who are just getting this for the first time in the relevant period; it also applies to all those who have been getting it. It applies to both groups. Well, that makes sense to me.",
  "Yes. Right.",
  "Right.",
  "So, the whole thing applies just to the permanently disabled and the death things. What says it applies to anybody else?",
  "The whole thing. The whole -- the whole -- all of (c). That's -- in my thing here, that's seven lines. All of (c) applies to permanently disabled and those who died.",
  "Oh, yes. Oh.",
  "I feel slightly like an Abbott and Costello movie, but I'm getting this - -",
  "I see. Is your argument this now -- I'm sorry to be so slow. But that, look, there is a statute here; it that says compensation cannot exceed more than 200 percent of the annual weekly -- or the weekly wage. Then in (3), it says how to calculate that particular number. And then you go over to (c), and (c) says that calculated number applies to those newly awarded compensation. And you're saying \"newly awarded compensation\" means somebody got it through an award, not somebody got it automatically. And since somebody got it -- had to get it through an award or it wouldn't apply when you just get it because they pay for it, it just doesn't apply. You have to go get the award. And the word you're turning on is \"newly awarded.\"",
  "That's the argument?",
  "Like Abbott and Costello, I don't know what I'm talking about. But I do -- I do - -",
  "I was -- I was - -",
  "Now I fully understand your argument.",
  "What happens -- just for my technical knowledge here. The -- the employee suffers partial disability on February 1. He then doesn't notify the employer until, let's say, February 10, and then the employer waits for a week or so, and then begins to pay. Now, is the employer supposed to calculate the -- the weekly wage that he's paying on in the week February 1 to February 10 or -- 3 days, he puts it aside. But -- in the first week or does he do it on the first week he got notice? How is that -- how does that work?",
  "That's right.",
  "But I'm saying he has to write the check now.",
  "And the wage could have changed in those few weeks.",
  "The first week he didn't get the notice. Then the second week he did get the notice. Which week does he calculate the payment on?",
  "All right. So, what you're not - -",
  "Then we can't -- we cannot read this thing \"award\" to mean award by the employer. We can't mean it to read \"award\" by the -- by the government, in your view. We have to mean it to mean the time that he became entitled to some money.",
  "Yes.",
  "And the tough thing is saying, well, that that's an award. That's what this case turns on.",
  "And what you pointed to in the statute is you pointed to some situations which say we have situation 3 and 4, and they're not present here; but in situation 3 or 4, award does mean this.",
  "All right. That's - -",
  "You don't have another example of a -- of a situation where \"award\" did mean - - and so, you're saying there are some others where \"award\" doesn't mean, okay. But - -",
  "-- is there anything - - what's the most analogous thing you can find anywhere where award has referred to the time a person became entitled to a thing, prior to the time anyone was - - became obliged to give him some money?",
  "Even if that time first was the period for -- way for calculating the money?",
  "910(h)(1).",
  "No, no, don't do it again.",
  "It says was awarded compensation.",
  "Yes, okay.",
  "I mean, you can do it. You can say it's the time that the statute awards him the compensation. That's the English language.",
  "But it's the statute that's doing the awarding.",
  "What about the -- the business was newly awarded the tax credit at the time they made the deduction?",
  "What would have happened if Abraham Lincoln today were there? And I gather what happened is they thought the local prosecutor is good, but Lincoln is better. So, we'll let Lincoln prosecute this case. Now, in your view, Abraham Lincoln would not have had immunity, but the local prosecutor would have.",
  "They did exactly the same thing, by the way; it was just that Lincoln had a better reputation. Every word was the same.",
  "But in your -- I'm asking you, in your opinion, when I write this opinion, is I could say not even Abraham Lincoln, when he acted as a public prosecutor brought in for the occasion? In your opinion, he should not have the immunity that Joe Jones, the local prosecutor, would have?",
  "I'm just trying to get your opinion.",
  "Is it because it's Abraham Lincoln or - -",
  "But investigatory functions -- they don't get immunity. So, if Lincoln had looked into it and said, you know, I've looked into this; I don't think we should prosecute. And what they said was use your judgment.",
  "Okay. So, there are problems with both standards both ways. This is one of the things that -- that is bothering me.",
  "Imagine in this case the lawyer sat down with the other firemen, the supervisor and so forth, and they said -- not necessarily this event; they said we want to do X. And the lawyer said: I have to tell you, it's unclear whether X is constitutional or not. Now, because it's unclear, I also have to tell you that if you do it, you will not be held personally liable. Now, can a lawyer give that advice? Yes. When he does, of course, he's subjecting himself to personal liability. Now, it's that conflict that is worrying me, among other things. So, what do we do about that? The lawyer is being asked to give advice to the client. Under the canons of ethics, he ought to have their interest at heart, and in doing that, he's subjecting himself to what could be hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars worth of damages or whatever in suits for malpractice. Is there a way that we side with you out of that dilemma?",
  "No, no, no. What I'm assuming in the question is, since it's a close question, he has to worry about a court saying: You were wrong in saying it was legal. It was not legal. The matter was unclear, but it was not legal. At that point, he becomes subject to much damages. But, of course, the others do not, and he had to tell them go ahead with it. You understand my point.",
  "So, what is the answer?",
  "Well, that may be, but what I'm trying to work out is what is your set of rules? If we don't say -- if we don't say you have immunity, and you agree that this is a bad dilemma at least in my hypothetical case, I'm trying to work out what set of rules you advocate in order to either say, well, that's too bad, the dilemma is there, we can't get around it, or something else. That's why I want your answer.",
  "I change it slightly, and he puts them up to it.",
  "Because I don't know why he couldn't. I mean, you know, he says go do it. Or, in other words, my hypothetical -- okay, go ahead.",
  "Even without Chevron -- I mean, even apply it, I would have thought the point of Brand X is you look at the language of the statute and you look at what Congress intended, and where they intended the agency to have power to interpret, you follow the agency. And you could do that after the event if the basis for your decision is that it isn't clear. But that isn't Harlan's opinion at all. He goes and looks at what Congress meant, and what they meant is treat basis like you treat a deduction. And he gathers that from the legislative history. And so, I don't see the basis for saying now the agency still has power. Now, forget that one. I mean, that's one point you might want to address, but I may be too unique in that, in which case it's not worth your time.",
  "No, I didn't think that was the basis. I thought the basis is that there are two kinds of things: One is you just don't put in some big category of stuff in your return, and the agency can never figure that one out. And the other is where you don't state your deductions correctly. And now, the cost of goods sold and the basis are difficult cases because of the way the -- the code defined \"gross income.\" It defines it in terms of gain. But Harlan says they're like deductions for purposes of this statute. That's how I read it. But I have a different question. You can pursue this one if you want. My -- what's really bothering me about this case -- and I can't quite figure out the answer to this -- is it seems to me when they filed that tax return in April of 2000, it was a terrible loophole, but these lawyers have the job of creating loopholes or at least trying to take advantage of them. Okay? And the IRS had told them this was okay. Indeed, they had informal advice to that effect. Now, there's a -- you don't put the date of the year 2000 reg, and I don't know if you're both talking about the same thing. I was really surprised there was no date there. Then what happens is, after you lose in every circuit -- not you personally -- they lose in every circuit; and then in the year 2009, they say, though we lost and though we told everybody this is okay at the time they filed the return, now we're going to pass a new reg and we're going to penalize them, taking all back this money 9 years later. That seems to me pretty unfair. So, I'd like to know just that answer.",
  "You say in your brief on page 4: \"In 2000, the IRS issued a notice informing taxpayers that Son-of-BOSS transactions were invalid under the tax law.\" And you cite without a date. So, I was sort of curious whether that particular cite came before or after they filed their return.",
  "And they say that -- and I -- in July 2000, 3 months after they were filed, the Commissioner reiterated his view: \"It has long been held that the extended statute of limitations,\" da, da, da, \"is limited to when specific receipts or accruals are left out of the\" -- of gross income, which is basically the Colony statement.",
  "Are you talking about the same thing?",
  "Okay.",
  "So, there are two different documents. So -- so, in July, they're telling the tax bar this is okay. And what you say is this document here, which you refer to without a date, told them it wasn't okay.",
  "I'd be rather curious if you could sort that out.",
  "I -- I know there are many ways of downplaying that, but I'm just curious as to what happened. What about the one you cited? When was that?",
  "What about the -- that's the July. What about this other, undated one? Now, I notice what you say about it. You said that it described \"arrangements that unlawfully 'purport to give'\" them -- if I read that piece of paper, which I might -- and you probably read it because you cited it -- will I come away with the impression, uh-oh, these loophole arrangements, Son of BOSS, which previously seemed to be okay are now not okay? Is that the impression I'll have?",
  "Is that the impression you had?",
  "Okay. All right. That's what I suspect. Then look at the unfairness of this. I'm not saying there aren't worse unfairnesses in the world, but, nonetheless, people spent a lot of money. The whole Bar has gone to an enormous effort. Everything up through 2000 being -- seems to say you can do this. You have a case on point in the Supreme Court. And then 9 years later, after continuous litigation, the IRS promulgates a regulation which tries to reach back and capture people who filed their return 9 years before.",
  "I agree with you on that. The -- and I agree with Justice Scalia, actually. There are many different kinds of ambiguity, and the question is, is this of the kind where the agency later would come and use its expertise? And you're saying here it was up to the Congress and looking at what they had in mind. All right. Maybe that's the base -- best ground, but suppose it turns out a majority think you're not right on that. Okay? Now, here's my question: Assuming you're wrong on that, which I'm not sure you are, but assuming you're wrong, now we get to this regulation. Here is my problem: One -- I have no doubt at some level it seems rather unfair, but that instinct is not enough. The question is what -- what's the law? (A) You can say the word \"open\" doesn't include this case. But we run into the problem that an agency has great authority to construe its own regulation. (B) You could say that, well, there's this statute out there that says don't apply it, and there are two routes there. One is something to do with language, which I think you can think of, which seems to cut very much against you if read naturally, but you can strain it to read it in your favor. And the other has to do with a parenthetical where, once again, although they left it out of their brief and they put in ellipses, I can see why they left it out because when you read it it's again ambiguous. We run into the same problem. Then you could say: Well, they're not supposed to do these things retroactively, either on common law administrative law grounds or something like that; they shouldn't do it; it's unfair. And they'll say: But, you see, it wasn't that unfair; a child of 2 would have known this was a loophole. That's how they would have characterized it. And the IRS never said anything, except for one district director in a different district that really encouraged or underwrote this kind of thing. So, it's not nearly as unfair as you think. If you live by loopholes, you'll die by regulation. You know, something like that. So, looking at those four possible grounds -- and I can't think of a fifth -- you take your choice. Which is the strongest, and how do you apply to the - - reply to the objection?",
  "\"Open,\" that's the term.",
  "When Rosenberg would have been the law -- Fleuti -- and the answer to the question would have been, yes, you can make trips abroad, wouldn't it?",
  "That's true, but in -- in St. Cyr, as I read it, on pages 322 and 23, the Court focused directly, not on the crime point of time, but the time of the guilty plea. And what the Court says there is that a person who is thinking of pleading guilty might well have taken into account the fact that he could ask the Attorney General later when he's about to be deported to exercise discretion in his favor. So, that's as I read those pages. You can say why I'm not reading them correctly, but that's how I read them. And then, having read it that way, I thought the question in this case is whether the person who's sitting at the table and deciding whether to plead guilty or not is likely to think, well, if I plead guilty, I can always ask for discretion. That's St. Cyr. Well, if I plead guilty, I can still visit my aging parents and grandparents, a matter that could be of importance to some people, as opposed to whether I will never see them again. Now, that seems to be the question. Is the second as likely to be in the person's mind as the first? And to tell you the truth, I don't know the answer. I mean, maybe it would be. There isn't that much chance of getting discretion. It might be important to some people to visit their aging parents and grandparents. So, go ahead. Answer the question. Is the one more important than the other? And if not, why not?",
  "No, but I'm really asking you - -",
  "-- isn't my question the key question? Now, you can answer that \"no.\" But -- I mean, I suppose you could prove that the only thing that mattered to -- to LPRs who plead guilty, the only thing that mattered, was visiting their parents and grandparents, a matter I doubt; but, you can say, even on that situation, it would make no difference, or you could say I think the one is as important as the other, or you could say they're not. I just want to get your full answer, all -- your whole answer to my question.",
  "All right. But why do you -- look, as I read the statute, it isn't even clear whether it overrules Rosenberg v. Fleuti. I mean, they talk about admission, but admission, after all, could have an exception for the 4-day trip. That's what the Court said effectively in Rosenberg v. Fleuti. So, Congress certainly wasn't clear on what policy they're following. I would have thought that. You can disagree with that. But I -- because -- but the part that's still gnawing at me 95 percent of the people plead guilty. All right. You know. Everybody pleads guilty. All -- about. About. And now, the consequence that this ex post enacts is he can't take the 4-day trip. And you keep saying, well, a 4-day trip requires action on a person's part. Right. Of course, it does. So, why does that matter? I mean, the fact is he can't take the 4-day trip. A 4-day trip requires action. You have to buy a trip -- ticket. You have to get on a plane. So - -",
  "That's -- that's why I think the Chief Justice's question and the ambiguity of the statute are relevant. Like with SORNA you would apply it backwards, because that's a pretty clear intent. I don't know about, you know, like, \"three times and you're out\" statutes, et cetera. But -- but here you have the disability on the one -- the disadvantage to the person pleading guilty, that problem, on the one hand; and, on the other hand, you have the policy that with a -- fill in the blank - - with a statute that doesn't talk about it but simply uses a new definition of admission or admissibility. That's -- do you want to say something about that?",
  "More than that, what is - - I'm ignoring -- more than that, I'm saying what's the policy on the other side? The policy that favors the retroactivity despite the fact that the person might not have pleaded guilty? And that's why I was interested in the Chief Justice's question and also the ambiguity of the language in the statute that they used.",
  "So, how does it work? I'm -- how does it work? Two legal permanent residents, a man and his wife, happen to show up in New York, and they have a 6-month-old child. All right. What's the legal -- why doesn't the INS just take the child, ship him off? I mean there -- is it just discretion? Or is there some rule of law or regulation that prevents that from happening?",
  "Well, no. I've given you the hypothetical. I mean, there we are.",
  "That's all you know.",
  "I'm not asking for that. I'm saying, what in the law -- that's all you know. All right? There are -- you know the hypothetical. I want -- one possible thing to say would be that child is -- is actually -- we are imputing that he's here for lawful permanent residence, too. Every circuit had had some kind of imputation rule, and moreover there are other areas of law where I have found imputation rules in the immigration law. Roughly, I have three or four cases on that. But they're - - they're not exactly comparable. Okay. So, I just want to know what is it that prevents you from taking the child and shipping him off to China if we don't impute?",
  "I'm not asking that. You know the question. I just want your best effort - -",
  "-- to give an answer. Or I'm thinking that your answer is there is nothing; it's either imputation or nothing.",
  "And you don't want me to reach that conclusion.",
  "No, no. That isn't my hypothetical.",
  "Actually they came from Italy, in my hypothetical.",
  "I don't see how -- were you finished?",
  "I don't see how the -- you can read the Lepe-Guitron -- that was one of the cases -- it seems to me clearly imputes residence as well. They quote the earlier case from the circuit which said the 7 years of domicile have to come after their admission for permanent residence. And then the dissent says, hey, what about permanent residents? And what they say is this case is different because, in that earlier case, the parents had never been admitted. He came after he was married in this case. He's here after his parents were admitted. Now, I grant you they didn't explicitly say this, but I don't see how they reached their conclusion without it. And then there's a different split in the circuits about the pro and con of tacking on periods, you know, before the domicile, after, et cetera. And that seems to be what Congress resolved. So, I think if you're talking about what was the law, the law was you did impute with -- you did impute for residence. And then Congress sort of just doesn't deal with that and deals with a slightly different thing. Is that a fair reading, or what do you think?",
  "You had an example in your brief, I thought -- you might -- I thought that it was an example of status rather than intent. The example that you gave -- I took that way; tell me if I'm -- is where an alien comes in and wants asylum, and then you can't get it if you were resettled in another country. And there are criteria -- country with a resettlement program. And then that seemed like a status, a residence. Were you resettled in the other country or were you not? That's his status, and then that's imputed to the child.",
  "You're saying -- I just want to hear your whole argument here. You're saying they would have had, Congress, as a background, the Ng case where they imputed the Hong Kong residence; the fact that you were about to say, that domicile necessarily includes residence. And is there something else?",
  "All right.",
  "How does this – just -- may be a side issue, but I don't see how this is a fee for service. I mean, I thought points is simply a way of paying more money up front and getting a lower interest rate later. It isn't supposed to be for any service; it's simply a question of -- of a loan term, how much you borrow and what the interest rate is.",
  "So, what are we supposed to do -- decide theoretically, in the context of a case that does not involve paying a fee for a service that doesn't exist, whether you can pay for a service that doesn't exist?",
  "How?",
  "What's -- what's the argument on the other side? A point is a way of paying more money, i.e., borrowing less. Since you pay more, that means you borrow less. And so, your interest rate is lower because you’ve borrowed less. Now, what's the argument on the other side?",
  "Okay. How does that work? The bank says to Mr. Smith we are going to charge you $100 for a courier service. And then they don't. So, there it is on the bill. And Mr. Smith, really knowing he didn't get the courier service, pays the $100. All right? Why isn't Mr. Smith guilty, on your interpretation? I mean, on your interpretation, every innocent consumer is guilty of a crime.",
  "Why not?",
  "Yes.",
  "So, you -- I don't understand that. It's my fault. But wouldn't -- it says that if she doesn't get the appraisal, but she has to pay for it, then why isn't she -- why hasn't -- why doesn't she fall within the statute?",
  "What you got was nothing.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Why hasn't the consumer violated?",
  "Then why is the bank liable?",
  "I see. So, this -- you're saying when the bank writes down, \"pay $100 for the courier service,\" the bank is charging for the courier service.",
  "When the consumer pays for the courier service which he sees there, the consumer is not paying for the courier service. He is paying for the nothing.",
  "All right. Then why doesn't he fall within the -- within the statute?",
  "Why?",
  "The consumer doesn't violate it in those circumstances because?",
  "Well, can you tell me where in the briefs? I have to read this about six times to get this one in my head.",
  "Where in the briefs does it explain to me why in your situation the bank would be violating it, but the consumer wouldn't, since it says \"no person shall give\" as well as \"no person shall receive\"?",
  "Well, my goodness. If it isn't in the briefs, it -- maybe I'm off on a track here, but it seems to me a pretty obvious question.",
  "I mean, we have a statute that looks like a kickback statute, and the reason it looks like a kickback statute is it refers both to the person giving and to the persons receiving, and it seems to make them equally liable. Now, you want to apply it to a situation where I don't think you want to hold consumers liable. And so, I think you have to explain to me why this statute doesn't --",
  "-- on your reading of it.",
  "Oh, you mean it's all prosecutorial discretion? In other words, if you happen to be a consumer you just have to rely on the goodwill of the prosecutor; is that the idea?",
  "What more?",
  "But can you -- I don't want to take all your time on this because to me the more important problem was the problem of the difference between a kickback statute, which we could understand as well within HUD's expertise and normal and of course very good reason for doing it. But a price control statute, where we have the Federal agency deciding whether the prices are accurate for each service that is rendered or whether some percentage or all of it represents service for nothing -- that's a rather big novelty in American life. That is, we have it, but they are usually Federal agencies that have a system set up for determining proper prices and so forth. So, it's hard for me to believe that sort of inadvertently Congress brought in the second under the guise of the first without a big fuss being raised and a big debate and so forth.",
  "Yes, but that's the problem. The problem is, look, you are saying this is a payment for a service that wasn't given. I think I might say that this is just a lower interest -- a higher interest rate than they -- than they expected. Somebody might say you didn't get the courier service at all. Others might say you got service but not the gold-plated service, and the gold plate was nothing. You see, that's what happens when you get into a price control statute rather than a kickback statute. And that is our concern here, I think at least mine.",
  "Well, in 1992, they promulgated the regulation, which is the strongest argument I think on the other side. It's a strong argument. Have you -- has anybody looked at that notice-and-comment proceeding? Have you looked at it?",
  "All right. If you have, do they go into this point, a point about -- the point being this is a kickback statute? It isn't an overcharge price regulation statute. Therefore, promulgating a regulation that makes it a crime, a Federal crime, to overcharge, which is what the regulation says, is outside the scope of the statute. Now, did someone make that argument? If so, I'd like to be able to read it, and I'd like to be able to see what the agency said in response.",
  "So, you would say -- is it --",
  "Is this a fair statement in your view -- and we'll hear theirs on rebuttal -- that in respect to the 1992 regulation, there is a sentence which says, \"A charge by a person for which ... nominal services are performed ... is an unearned fee and violates this section\"? All right? I've ellipsed part. All right. Now, it says that. And that later on is taken as being: This statute is a -- to that extent, a price regulation statute. Is it fair to say that notice of such a regulation was not given?",
  "Was comment received in respect to that?",
  "All right.",
  "That's -- no, no. That's a good question, and your problem is different people feel differently about the answer. So, the -- which is why from my perspective --- and perhaps you're only answering a question for me and no one else has it -- but I would be pretty interested to know whether when you looked at the legislative history of this, what you discovered was a lot of complaints about consumers paying for things they didn't get, period. Which favors HUD's interpretation. Or whether you see a whole long list of complaints about consumers having to pay referral fees, where that's just one person taking advantage of another person's business. I would -- I think it would be relevant. And then if you've looked at all this, which you could tell me you haven't -- I will try to -- but what do you find?",
  "Once you say that, you're -- you're outside the reg. I mean, when you read the reg and the policy statement, it's pretty clear what they are thinking of.",
  "And the policy statement is even clearer. What they are thinking of is overcharges, period.",
  "No?",
  "It's right here. It's on -- it's on 53,057. And what they're explaining is that, and they're talking about a third situation, and they say one settlement service provider charges a fee to a consumer where no work is done, or the fee exceeds the reasonable value of the services performed by that provider.",
  "And so, if it exceeds the reasonable value of the services performed by that provider, you have to say what is the reasonable value of the services performed by that provider. And that involves the agency in the job of deciding what's a fair or just price for this particular service.",
  "No, but what I'm doing there, you see, is now I'm trying to make sense out of an agency interpretation which is other than what it says, where what they're trying to do is to change the nature of the statute from a kickback statute into a statute that protects consumers across the board from paying for things they don't get.",
  "Now, that's where I'm sort of interested in what the legislative history said, et cetera, et cetera. It's much more complicated than I thought coming in. I have to look at a lot of things.",
  "And then part of that is -- you might want to say something about the other part. I mean, the purpose of this kind of APA/Chevron stuff is to prevent agencies, seeing the supreme importance of their own mission, taking a statute, running with it and in particular transforming into a criminal law something that really wasn't much there. Now, procedure is important in that. And that's why I'm very interested in whether -- whether they gave notice to the public: Dear public, we are thinking that this is far more than a kickback statute.",
  "We would like to hear what you think about that.",
  "There are -- there are lots of regions of the country -- Puerto Rico, for example -- where there are vast numbers of documents that have to be translated if you go into Federal court, not necessarily in the Commonwealth courts. That's expensive to people. And they might have thought for a long time, while that expense won't go away, it's at least better to have it paid by the loser than to have it paid by the winner. That's been the common practice. I don't think that's a foolish approach. And you can find language in this, which is to go back -- go back to Justice Sotomayor.",
  "What do you think of the -- I mean, the First Circuit went into this, which deals a lot with Puerto Rico, and it felt that this fell within the idea of fees for exemplification, which is certifying a document. And, in fact, to certify a document that comes into the Federal court in San Juan, you have to have it translated very often. And so, the translation cost is at least consistent with the idea there of trying to -- well, you may -- you don't have to -- you may impose the cost on the loser.",
  "Why haven't the -- I was interested here that the amici on your side consist of some professors and the -- I guess the trade association of interpreters or translators, but the people who would have the financial stake in it, the defense bar, the plaintiffs' bar in some circumstances, have not filed any brief. And I tend, though not putting a lot of weight on it, to take it as a sign, along with the long period of time, that there hasn't been some tremendous financial problem. What evidence is there that there has been? I -- a few cases, but in general.",
  "There's a plain language argument I got. But how many years has the great bulk of the court been going the other way?",
  "How many years has, would you say, the great bulk of the Federal system been deciding this differently from the way you think it should be?",
  "That's the bulk.",
  "Well, when did all this rot set in, in your opinion? How long?",
  "What's the first one?",
  "You have a case cited from 1812. I take it that's it.",
  "What do you think on the -- I guess nobody wants to defend this argument, including you, but the First Circuit and several others did look to the provision which permits the taxing of costs for the making of -- it says exemplifications or official documents, for the costs of making copies of any materials obtained for use in the case. Now, if you're going to make a copy for use of the case of something in Japanese, you're going to have to turn it into English. So, they included that as part of the cost of making copies of the material – of a document for use in the case. Now -- which is discretionary as to whether you do or whether you don't. But that's how several courts did read it. I'm just wondering as that didn't strike me as so obviously wrong. Maybe it's obviously --",
  "I'm sure you'd like to win on any subsection.",
  "All right. So, the history is that, prior to '78, a serious number -- some number of circuits said you can get the translation paid for under -- as -- as being necessary to create a copy that's usable in court. All right. Then Congress passes this, knowing of those cases in principle. And then there is a shift after Congress passes this, and then the majority of courts say, all right, this is the provision that permits it. Is that an accurate statement?",
  "Is there anything in the history of the '78 statute which suggested that Congress didn't want these taxed?",
  "That means you don't have to look at this.",
  "I accept -- I accept the following, that there was a history basically giving -- doing what you want before the statute, but the statute -- nobody thought what it was going to do that history. That statute is capable of being translated, but it isn't the most natural thing. And so, the question is, do we take -- go with the smaller capability, saying leave -- leave well enough alone, or do we say, gee, that's just too hard to translate it that -- to interpret the statute that way? Have you got any other example in the law? I mean, can you think of an example in the law which I've been trying to think of where there was a history of doing something? A statute comes along that makes it a little tougher for the judges to do it, and then the Court says either, sorry, too tough now, or it says let sleeping dogs lie.",
  "What's bothering me is I can't figure this out very well. We have an imaginary State, and what the State says to the jury: Jury, you have three choices. Choice one is you acquit this person of everything. Choice two is you convict him of something. Choice three is you say you're hung. Okay? I don't see anything in the Constitution that prevents a State from doing that. So, if that -- if no -- what is it? And, of course, if you follow that, there was no acquittal on those early charges. That wasn't a permissible verdict. And now you structure your argument any way you want, but that the State has -- I would think, within the limits of due process, it can structure the jury's arguments as it wishes. But -- so, what's wrong with that? And if that -- if there's nothing wrong with that, then how do you win?",
  "Well, you could say, well, you could -- well, that's one route. What you say is nothing wrong with that. But if the judge is foolish enough to get the jury -- to get the foreperson to say what the state of the deliberation is in detail, then the Double Jeopardy Clause kicks in. Well, that's an argument.",
  "So, they make a mistake and now suddenly it’s jeopardy where it wasn't before, or -- this seems like a minor matter compared to the issues of jeopardy, whether the jury honestly said what was going on in the room, particularly if it's changeable.",
  "Okay. So, let's -- go ahead.",
  "Please.",
  "Why \"surely\"?",
  "I mean, why \"surely\"? Look, the thing ends. To go back to my example, the case is over, the jury comes in and says, Judge, we're hung. Okay? Everybody is going to go home.",
  "But the defense lawyer says, Judge, I'd like to know which of the five charges they're on. Does the defense lawyer or the prosecutor have a constitutional right to find out?",
  "No, I'm not assuming anything. I’m giving you the example.",
  "Yes.",
  "What's the answer?",
  "In the State I imagine is -- remember, there were three possible verdicts: Acquit of everything, convict of something, or say you're hung. That's what we're imagining. Okay? And you can imagine the set of instructions -- go to A, B, C. That's fair enough. Those four things.",
  "Okay? Now, case over, acquitted -- no, hung, Your Honor. Defense attorney: I want to find out which of the five they're on. Does he have a constitutional right to get the answer?",
  "He does?",
  "I don't know what -- I'm sorry.",
  "Okay. Okay. I see, okay, fine.",
  "In other words, here -- I got it. If --",
  "Okay. Okay.",
  "Wait. I'm only midway, because I'm trying to follow this through. I still don't know why the Constitution does that, but I'll take your word for it. I'd assume it was State law that does that, but -- but fine. Now he says, yes, you have the right, either of you has the right. We're on number three. Your Honor, I would like a poll of the jury as to the acquittal as to one and two. Does both -- do both sides have the right to get that?",
  "No. Well, here's what happened: Judge, I want to know what number they were on when they couldn't reach a --",
  "Foreman: Number five, Your Honor. Judge, I would like a poll of the jury, each juror, as to numbers one, two, three, and four to be sure that they were unanimous on each as to the acquittal, which under the instruction allowed them to go to the next one. Okay? Constitution requires it?",
  "No, no. Why doesn't the Constitution require it? You have to be sure there was an acquittal. You have to be sure there was an acquittal. And what -- what I'm doing obviously is I'm spinning out what I see as the constitutional consequences of taking your constitutional position, and I'm going to be ending up by saying I've never heard of this before.",
  "But there's a lot of stuff I haven't heard of. So, that doesn't prove that much.",
  "There is no room in Arkansas law for saying you're acquitted as to one, acquitted as to two. But Arkansas law says you come in with a verdict of guilty of something, a verdict of acquittal of everything, or the words \"hung jury.\" Is that right?",
  "No. They say to the judge, Judge, we are hung. Judge says \"hung jury.\"",
  "An obvious example that used to be -- are there Jews hiding in the cellar? No.",
  "Are you hiding Jews in the cellar?",
  "Why not?",
  "Why not? Because, after all, we're willing to protect the Olympics Committee when a false person saying he's the Olympics Committee might deprive the Olympics Committee of a penny, while here they're saying that to win this great medal, say, the congressional Medal of Honor, the highest award in the military the nation can give, you're deserving of the most possible, grandest possible respect, and we don't -- we don't even want you to have to think about somebody having taken that name falsely; and so, we will just criminalize it to discourage such activity that undermines the very thought and purpose of giving the medal. All right? So, I'm just saying in my mind there's real harm. And there's real harm, and yet, I can think of instances where we do want to protect false information. And I want you to accept that as a given because that isn't my question.",
  "My question is: If I'm right that there are very good First Amendment reasons sometimes for protecting false information, and if this also would cause serious harm, what the government is aiming after, are there less restrictive ways of going about it? And, if so, what and why?",
  "Is there anything else -­ that the threat of criminal prosecution might discourage from lying who would never be caught. So, at least as to that set, exposure won't work. So, you have a less restrictive alternative that helps some but not completely. Are there others?",
  "Not under my theory. My theory is that it does hurt the medal, the purpose, the objective, the honor, for people falsely to go around saying that they have this medal when they don't. Okay? So, I might be wrong about that. I just ask you to assume that for purposes of argument because what I'm trying to get to is I want as big a list as I can to think about of what the less restrictive alternatives are.",
  "Or might be.",
  "Well, how does it work in the law now, where we have similar statutes, and there's an additional requirement when you're imitating, say, a Federal officer or somebody else you shouldn't, you have to perform an overt act that asserts authority that the impersonator claims to have. What does that add? Do you have to -- does it add enough to just make it not pure speech, to limit -- to wall off the things about -- the things that we're worried about in the First Amendment? Or there's another one, you have to falsely assume or exercise powers, duties, and privileges. Those are ways statutes have of limiting this thing. How does that work?",
  "It has nothing to do with harm. It's a way of walling off things that are of concern under the First Amendment from those that aren't. And what they use -- I read you what they use: Performing -- you know -- you know the language. It's written about in the briefs. And I just want to know how you would think about a statute that imported that kind of language, which is limiting language.",
  "The trouble is that you can think of 10,000 instances that meet your criteria that one candidate or another could bring up in a political campaign. And we don't know what will come up, but I can easily think of examples. And then, if this is lawful and constitutional, then you have people in political campaigns suddenly worrying that the U.S. attorney is going to come in and start indicting him. Now, that's part of the chilling effect. And you've assumed you can get around this chilling effect, but I'm less certain.",
  "How do we know this doesn't?",
  "Where --",
  "Where? What's the case that supports you the most on that?",
  "No, just give me a citation.",
  "Has to -- has to be what? What's the word? \"Unequivocal\"?",
  "Because I'll look at the statute. Now, I did look at Black's Law Dictionary, and Black's answer. Okay. I say you voluntarily relinquish your legal right. Your legal right was to get the case dismissed, and you relinquished it. You didn't assert it. That said, that would be the difference. And she's saying that. She's saying that makes a lot of sense. When you read Day, they're worried about the State doing something inadvertently, making a mistake. So, what the judge says is: State, you know you have a pretty good claim here on statute of limitations, but you didn't assert it. So, I'm going to give you the right to assert it. Go ahead, assert it even though it's late. You overcome the forfeiture. Now you say: I assert it, Your Honor. Okay, you haven't waived it. Now you say: I don't really care.",
  "Oh, no. I assume they didn't do anything mean -- strategic; it wasn't a trick. It was just what is it that they did? And what they did is they were given the opportunity to overcome the forfeiture, to assert the statute of limitations claim, and they didn't do it. They didn't want to do it. I don't know why they didn't want to do it, because there was a lot of trouble raising other issues, dah, dah, dah. But that's their business. The fact is they didn't do it.",
  "Wait, wait, wait. When you say \"further,\" I want to be very precise about the distinction. You have to put it in your answer. You didn't. Okay. So, that's a forfeiture. So, now the judge says you didn't put it in your answer, but I'll raise it. So, now you have the right to have the case dismissed for statute of limitations. Do you want to exercise that right? The answer to that question was you didn't.",
  "You said you didn't care.",
  "All right. Well, but, one, do the characterization, but please don't forget my first question, because so far I'm just stuck on Black's Law Dictionary. And I would like you to have better authorities for your -- you know, the supporting --",
  "Well, that's why your colleague on the other side -- why she made this point the way she made it. I think there's no disagreement, at least as far as I hear Justice Scalia. Look, he did abandon his right, the State, to push the matter. That's abandonment. He didn't abandon the right to get the case dismissed if the judge pursues it. So, your colleague says -- or as she says, a court of appeals does have the power on its own to overcome a forfeiture. That's Day. But they don't have the power on its own to overcome the waiver. And that's what they're doing. They don't have the power, in other words, to decide it themselves. They only have the power to overcome a forfeiture.",
  "So, why is that -- why is that a bad result? The -- I -- imagine the facts are these: The State forgets to waive the issue, to raise the issue in the defense. All right? Forgets. Judge: State you haven't raised a statute of limitations. State -- one possible answer -- thank you, Your Honor. We overlooked our forfeiture. We want to raise it. That's one. Number two: They say we don't care. Number three: We don't want to. Okay?",
  "Now, in two and three, you can say this: You could say the reason that we depart from the normal rule that you have to actually assert it in your defense is we're trying to protect the State because of habeas. So, we protect the State at least by giving them a chance to make the argument when they forget or some other reason. Now we gave them the chance. Now they say: Huh? Who cares? All right? If that's their attitude, why is it the habeas court's business to protect the State from themselves?",
  "Despite forfeiture?",
  "And --",
  "So, what's the problem? He says -- the employee says I was dismissed. MSPB says that's right, you were, and it's lawful. The employee says but you didn't consider my argument that the relevant statute was unconstitutional. MSPB says, no, we can't. The Federal Circuit says but we can; so, make your argument. What's the problem? And then I'll decide it. And if they decide it's unconstitutional, then the action of the MSPB is wrong.",
  "I don't know -- I'm just saying, is there any practical problem with that?",
  "Which is?",
  "Fine, fine. What they say is you have one argument here, that the statute that led to your dismissal was unconstitutional.",
  "We do not have jurisdiction over that; therefore, we say you were rightly dismissed.",
  "Now, they appeal that, and they say they're right that they didn't, but you do; so, will you please decide that this statute is unconstitutional? What's the problem?",
  "Ah. It may be unusual. I just want to know what's the problem. I'm not saying there isn't one. I want to know what's the problem with that.",
  "No, it doesn't affirm the dismissal. It says the dismissal was unconstitutional; go reinstate him.",
  "That's your conclusion, and I want to know what -- what is the practical reason that that wouldn't work or why is that such a big problem to have it work that way? I'm asking for your answer on that.",
  "Give me one where it wouldn't.",
  "Give me one where it wouldn't. But I don't want to cut into your time. Your time is up.",
  "So, you have to be thinking about it if you want to respond.",
  "I don't want to delay you; so, don't pause too long. But I've just been curious -- where did this rule -- is there a statute or something that says an agency can't say that this action would be unconstitutional? Where does that idea come from?",
  "Why? I mean, it sounds -- really what the argument boils down to is -- is if we accept your position, there's a kind of procedural complexity and anomaly. And your argument is that his position's worse. And, yours is also fairly bad.",
  "So, that's his point. So, I mean, that's -- but that's why I wondered. I mean, U.S. magistrates, all -- tax courts, all kinds of people as a preliminary matter have jobs where they say we think a statute is unconstitutional. I suppose millions. I don't know how many. So, is this coming that they can't do it from some kind of lore from Kenneth Davis or something or -- what's -- what's the basis of this? And wouldn't it be simpler if you just said it says they can take appropriate relief? They can take appropriate relief, period. End of the matter.",
  "Are there --",
  "So, somebody quoted Kenneth Davis in 1958 and wrote it into an opinion in a holding?",
  "So, Kenneth Davis said this in 1958?",
  "Okay.",
  "You went -- can I go back to -- are you finished with that answer? Because I want you to finish.",
  "I just want some clarification on the first question that Justice Kennedy asked. Well -- I'll get it in reading about it. You go ahead. You want to reserve your time. I can find the answer --",
  "-- to what I was going to ask.",
  "So -- so, why -- why then -- you want to answer in your brief and -- this question, I find impossibly difficult, maybe highly fact-dependent. There is no United States Supreme Court of the World. There is no way of getting unified law on the points of whether when we interpret a common law Federal -- a system of Federal common law to decide whether a corporation can be defendant in every – a defendant in a certain kind of case. Every other country could do the same. And there's no way of resolving it. All right? So, I find that a difficult question. I don't know why that's in this case. I would have thought the question in this case is, can a private actor be sued for certain violations of -- of substantive criminal law? The answer is \"yes.\" Okay? Genocide, for example. And then the question is -- a corporation is a private actor, and is there any reason why, just like any other private actor, a corporation couldn't be sued for genocide? And there the answer is I don't know, but I'll find out when the other side argues. You see?",
  "So, I -- I think this is unnecessarily complicated. They made a -- a categorical rule. They said never sue a corporation. I seem to think possibly of counterexamples. Pirates, Incorporated.",
  "You know? I mean -- so -- so, why isn't that -- why are we going into -- I mean, you have good reason for doing it, and I want to hear why.",
  "You say there is not a case. That's a different matter.",
  "Yes, but that's a different matter because you can have a principle that applies even though there isn't a case. And the principle that here would apply is what I said, Pirates, Incorporated. Do you think in the 18th century if they brought Pirates, Incorporated, and we get all their gold, and Blackbeard gets up and he says, oh, it isn't me; it's the corporation -- do you think that they would have then said: Oh, I see, it's a corporation. Good-bye. Go home.",
  "All right. Well, what source have you for --",
  "What source have you for that proposition?",
  "You couldn't seize another person other than Blackbeard. That's why -- if the ship is owned by a corporation, and they sue the corporation in 18 -- 17 whenever it was -- '96 or something, what reason do we have to think that the corporation would have lost -- I mean, would have won?",
  "Well you're right on that point. What about slavery? Genocide -- I see your point in the Goldsmith brief. But what about slavery? That seems like contrary to international law norms, basic law norms, it could be committed by an individual. And why, if it could be committed by an individual, could it not also be committed by a corporation in violation of an international norm?",
  "No, no. I know, but the way --",
  "I've read the reason why, as you point out in your briefs, the corporations are different in many countries as if they're not moral persons. And I have in my mind filled in the blanks on that, and I think I know what it refers to. All right. That's the rationale that kept them out of some of these treaties. And now the question would be, all right, are they always kept out no matter what? And I'm bringing up the two counterexamples I think were fairly strong, was Pirates, Inc., but that's a joke example, and the other -- although it's a point. And the other is slavery. What about -- what about that one?",
  "You could -- you could -- first, maybe you addressed this case. There was a case called Skinner v. East India Company.",
  "Okay. All right. So, it's -- now, what -- what I'm thinking of is if you go through the rationale is you find some instances where individuals could, in fact, violate an international law norm, and then you find a lack of a reason why a corporation couldn't do the same. Now, in that kind of category, could the Court say we're interpreting Federal common law here to determine who can be sued under this statute? That's the remedial part.",
  "And we're -- and so, what we're saying is that there is a -- in certain circumstances, there could be a suit against your corporation. You'd have to be careful because you recognize that by creating a -- a suit against your corporation, you're saying every country in the world can do the same. And -- and, therefore -- but maybe there are instances of like, universal jurisdiction recognized under international law where you could be pretty certain no harm would be done by that. And so, what I'm thinking of is -- is a way of enforcing it.",
  "No, I see. Yes.",
  "Well, we know the way to do it. I mean, in Skinner, even if it was English common law, the court reasons -- it says the taking of the ship on the high seas was \"odious and punishable by all laws of God and man.\" So, we -- could you not say, where an action is forbidden by the international law, and it is punishable or -- by all laws of God and man, in such a circumstance there being no reason to deny corporate liability here, even under the moral person rule, it -- we interpret the Federal common law to permit that remedy?",
  "You're -- now you're beginning one additional thing, that the corporate rule that you're about to cite shows that many people believe there shouldn't be a remedy against a corporation because they're not moral persons. Why does it show that the corporation couldn't violate the substantive rule?",
  "Why isn’t the place --",
  "So, what else should I look at? Because I've looked at the -- I did really -- I know I have to go through legislative history. I've said it's meaningful, and so I do it.",
  "And, so far -- so far, I think I have to say that you're on a weak wicket.",
  "The -- the word \"persons\" -- when was there -- I found lots and lots of instances and by people in the civil -- international civil rights community who are testifying, where I look at what they say, and over and over they say a limited statute, the person won't often be in the United States. Well, the PLO had a presence in the United States. The person won't be in the United States very often. I know, but sometimes he may come over here; it's important to take a -- make a symbolic step. And not a word could I find, when they're talking even about the word \"person,\" that suggested they meant even the PLO at that time. In fact, they thought, well, it would be a nice thing, but, but, but, but....",
  "I mean, that's the tenor of what I seem to have found so far. So, I mention that because you will point out to me the things that I have accidentally skipped.",
  "Maybe they did. You see, I might as well be honest with you, page 26 of the Government's brief did have an impact on my thinking. It's Father Drinan, and Father Drinan says in the hearing, \"I think it would be best to stay with that and just avoid all of the problems about the PLO and related groups.\" And then Michael Posner testifies, it says, the Government, to the same effect. So, there the great advocates of this thing are sitting there saying we don't think it should cover the PLO; let's not take that step at this time.",
  "I mean -- and you have Congressman Leach, and you have the word \"individual.\"",
  "Yes, but he's taking that --",
  "He's taking that -- oh, go ahead.",
  "It's also possible it's not a stupid statute.",
  "I took -- I took -- the reason I say that is because if you want to elaborate on this -- because I purposely asked it, but I -- one of the things in the Government's brief that did, as I said, have an impact was Father Drinan is asked, shouldn't we have here -- this is before it reads \"individual\"; it reads \"person\" at this time -- shouldn't we have another definition for including organizations like the PLO? He responds, \"I think that we should exclude non-governmental organizations.\"",
  "\"I think it would be best to stay with that and just avoid all of the problems about the PLO and related groups.\" Now -- but you heard the response to that, which really was, if I look at the context, I'll see that's less relevant than I think -- than I did think. So, what do you think?",
  "That's why they're thinking of it. His argument the other way, which I see now, is that -- is that, look, Father Drinan and the others are not talking about individual versus person; they're talking about whether, say, the PLO falls under color of law of a foreign state. And so, they're not thinking of that question.",
  "And if -- and if, in fact, it does fall under color of law there, they don't care about whether it's individual or person. They've never really thought about that.",
  "In fact, the only one who thought about it was Congressman Leach, and that was four bills earlier. And --",
  "I thought there were a lot more than -- there are 20 different lots, 20 different -- there are -- I mean, when -- what's your view of -- of how the cutoff should work? Do they have to refund all the money, everybody who, in fact, ever paid a Barrett Law assessment?",
  "I don't care what the State is; I'm saying a matter of constitutional law.",
  "Okay. All right. So what?",
  "Why can the State, when they have, let's say, 10,000 people who have already paid their assessments -- well, why doesn't it have to give them back their money, on your theory? That's my simple question.",
  "Why aren't they?",
  "Okay. Fine. They define here who is similarly situated, and the people who aren't are the ones who are on the installment plan.",
  "They do. They do. The reason is because they think it's unfair to give the people -- they think it's -- they don't want to bother collecting it from these people who haven't paid yet. Okay? That's why. And they don't see a way, if you -­ so, if we're going to free them, we don't want to go back into history and then suddenly give back all the people who've ever paid their assessment. I mean -- so, we draw the line somewhere.",
  "This is where we're drawing it. That's the State law.",
  "What's wrong with that?",
  "I mean -- my point, I'm not making it clear. My point is that what's less rational about saying, if you paid, too bad; we're having an amnesty for the future? What's less rational about doing that than saying some of the people who paid in full will get their money back, and some will not? Which is the line you want to draw.",
  "But that isn't the administrative -- the administrative -- well, maybe that's one of them. The administrative problem is, I thought, the following: Imagine that you are the city mayor. All right? And suppose the mayor does what you want. The mayor says I'll give all these people in their project back their money. The next day in my office, there show up 15 people who say: Last month, we happened to be in project 2, and we paid all our money. Why don't you give us back our money? You just gave it to the people in project 1. Give it to us. And the next day after that, there are 14 people from project 3 and from project 4. What is your answer to those angry taxpayers who have said we don't understand why you refunded the money from project 1 but not for us? What's your answer?",
  "I might have missed a fact, which -- which I'd like to know. Let's call your project, project 1, all right? And all the others are 2 through 20. Are there any people in projects 2 through 20 who still have money outstanding, or are they all paid off?",
  "They're in various states. Okay. What happened to the taxpayers who still owe money in projects 2 through 20?",
  "Okay. So, it's the same. So, now the people for the angry taxpayers in projects 2 through 20 show up at the mayor and say, Mayor, you're not only -- you only -- you're not only -- under your system, you not only gave the all-paid-up people back, if you win, but you also forgave the future people in 2 through 20, and you're not giving us our money back.",
  "Am I right on the facts?",
  "Yes. Older projects.",
  "Yes. Right.",
  "Yes.",
  "Oh, I see the -­",
  "Oddly enough, I was not suggesting that.",
  "The goal here is very simple. They say we have hundreds or dozens or 20 different programs anyway, and once we start getting into the business of distinguishing among people who are already paid up, it's going to be a nightmare. And so, the only clear line we draw is between the people who are already paid up and the people who haven't paid. And we don't want those people who haven't paid to have to pay because that's going to be another 20 years of administrating $33 a month. Okay. That's their rationale. Now, that may not be perfect, but it sounds reasonable, doesn't it? What's wrong with it?",
  "It's not their rationale, or it's not perfect?",
  "It's not impossible. They don't say it's impossible. Say, try looking through the U.S. tax code. It has thousands of pages. There is not one human being alive who understands every provision. All we have to do is start comparing the provision on page 1 with page 3 with page 7 and page 9, and we will discover irrationality forever. So, I don't -- I mean, you may have this fairly simple case, but I foresee, if you win, the -­ don't ask me what will happen, but I have a suspicion it's not going to be too good.",
  "What?",
  "Then you're saying that the difference between the two classes is that if you continue to have the tax apply to the people who haven't paid it yet, there is a large administrative expense. And if you -- as an expense that does not exist in respect to the class that has already paid it. So, the question, I would have thought, in our Court is whether that's a rational distinction. And I think contrary to what was suggested, administrative expenses, of course, make a difference where the Equal Protection Clause is concerned because they differentiate between the two classes. And trying to avoid an administrative expense is a rational reason, normally, for making the distinction. Now, I mention that because I know -- what -- it can -- does that bring to mind any authority which would be helpful? Because there was a question that there is no such authority. It makes sense to me, but is there some authority for that?",
  "What do you think would happen if the city says -- if it came out that way -- we really want to give refunds or cut off -- we want to stop collecting the money, period? Then to make it fair on this hypothesis, the city would have to go back and refund money. To whom? And how many?",
  "And you heard your -- your friend try to make a distinction between this project, and you wouldn't have to give the money, he said, to every other person, whoever back in 1850 or 1890 or whenever it was began to make Barrett Law payments. But you would with this one. Now, what -- I'd like a little comment on that.",
  "Right, because it's a question.",
  "That's right -­",
  "Let me try to get my question, which is, I'm not -- I'm thinking this is project 1. So, certainly, on the hypothesis, you have to pay back the people who already paid up for project 1. But in your brief, you say there's project 2 through 20. And is there, in your opinion, a basis for distinguishing all those people who have paid up in those projects, or would you have to give them their money back, too? Now, you heard your friend's statement -­ explanation of why you wouldn't have to give them the money back, and I want to get your response to that.",
  "How many people does that involve, about?",
  "The argument isn't that it's expensive to administer as much as it is there are 1,000 people in all these projects who are already paid up. We don't have enough money to pay them all back. That's why we don't want to pay them back. At the same time, we don't want to collect the money for 30 years from these other people who aren't fully paid yet.",
  "The question, I guess, is, is that rational?",
  "The question is what -- you haven't mentioned the text that suggests you're not right, which is right in (h) which says: In determining whether an applicant is a child of an insured, the Commissioner shall apply such law as intestacy law. Okay? That's what it says. Now, how do you get out of that?",
  "Because you say, well, there's an implicit exception.",
  "You're saying that that doesn't apply. And so, I've listened carefully to your reasons for saying why (h) doesn't apply when its language seems to say it does apply, and I'm not sure of why it doesn't apply. I mean --",
  "Suppose that two parents have lived together for 6 years and 4 months in State X, and they have a child. Fine. The father dies. Were they married? They never went through a ceremony. Is there a common law marriage? Might it depend on the State? Do you know the answer in every State? My answer is: You don't know. And I don't know. And, therefore, we have to look to the law of the State in order to see whether that (e) is satisfied. Now, we have to look to it to decide if they're married. Even you say that. So, what Congress did is it found a pretty good shorthand way of saying where you look. We're not going to worry about 6 years and 2 months; we're just going to look at their intestacy law. That's, as I read it, what it seems to say. Now, I have been listening to you , and I don't see how you're going to save us from even worse problems, particularly when I started looking at the state of the artificial insemination and so forth, and every State has a dozen different variations. There are uniform acts. There are things you have to acknowledge in writing. It's a very complicated subject. And -- and that's why I am rather hesitant to read it the way you want. But I want you to reply to that.",
  "Where is that sentence?",
  "Is it the bottom of the paragraph?",
  "It says, \"Applicants who according to such law would have the same status relative to taking intestate property as a child or a parent shall be deemed such.\"",
  "So?",
  "At the bottom of the paragraph.",
  "It's sort of like a -- you say there is no board of tax -- sorry. I won't get into that. But -- because they used the word \"deemed.\" Is that right?",
  "That's the heart of your argument there.",
  "Yes, all right.",
  "Okay.",
  "The obvious practical thing is --",
  "-- is that -- that, you even -- if he's conceived -- or what the father could do, couldn't he just write a note and say this is my child even if it's conceived later, and then wouldn't he fall within one of these other exceptions, the exception for being acknowledged?",
  "He has acknowledged in writing that the applicant is his son or daughter. What about that one?",
  "Does it? It doesn't say it. I mean, it seemed to me easier to work with that one than the one you're trying to work with. But I -- I don't know. You're the -- but -- but anyway, what I'm worried about here --",
  "No, no, I know.",
  "Okay. What I'm actually worried about and want you to address is I just -- if we were to adopt what you said, what they're concerned about is many different applicants coming back later. That's what State intestacy is concerned about. And you don't really know who their parents is. Another thing is there are already children who are eating up all of the money. And then some new person shows up, and you have to take the money away from the other children in order to give it to this new child. And all the time, you don't know if that's what the parent who is dead really wanted. And so, that's why the States have gone into all kinds of writing requirements. And -- and you want us to sort of -- applying this old law to new technology, just overlook those complications.",
  "I didn't think --",
  "I mean, I was -- I tend to be in dissent in these cases; so, I don't have the authoritative view. But the --",
  "What?",
  "Well, but no. But the impression I have is that -- that I had thought there were what I'd call the elements of the offense, and then there were sentencing facts. And sentencing facts have been traditionally facts found by the judge when imposing a sentence. Now, the majority of the Court in Apprendi went back into the history and said there is no significant old tradition, old enough, of -- of sentencing facts. So, really, when you raise the sentence, that's like an element, and you should have a jury trial. Now, the argument here, one of them, that the government stresses -- and Ice is the same -- is that there is no -- the tradition's different where fines and where multiple and concurrent sentences were at issue. If you go back to the 18th century or earlier, what you'll discover is that the judge has always had a much greater role in deciding what the amount of a fine should be. And, therefore, insofar as that amount rested upon some view of the facts as to the manner in which the crime occurred -- and it always does -- it was the judge who traditionally found it, not the jury. So, those facts are not like elements of the crime. That's what I thought was essentially the argument. Ice and fines are on one side of that line, and Apprendi is on the other.",
  "No, no. They're not doing that here. What they're deciding is a fact of sentencing is how often this crime was committed. No one can go against the statutory limit, but rather it -- it allows a higher sentence when certain facts occur. Now, I thought in Apprendi that the history is just what I'm saying it was in -- in the fine case, but the majority says to the contrary. And so, here it seems, even if I was wrong in Apprendi, that at least there's enough discretion here to say, look, this is traditionally up to the judge. Now, why do you think that isn't so?",
  "My goodness, I think there's lots of statutes that say something like this: That within limits, if there's a particular --",
  "Yes, leave that out because we assume -- right.",
  "It says, the fine, the maximum fine is going to be \"not more than the greater of twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss.\"",
  "Now, you're going to send that to the jury. Let me read you the next phase -- phrase: \"unless imposition of a fine under this subsection would unduly complicate or prolong the sentencing process.\" I point to that next phrase to show you that Congress understands, in an antitrust case, in a RICO case, in a corruption case of different kinds, in an environmental case, it is so complicated figuring out that kinds of things that they excuse even the judge who's experienced in this from dealing with that. And under your theory, as you just point out, if Apprendi applies here, we're suddenly telling juries to -- they have to under the Constitution administer that section 18 U.S.C. 3571, which I just read to you.",
  "No, I understand you could say that's what the Constitution provides, and if you jury can't handle it, well, too bad. Okay. But I think we're still in the business of trying to decide whether the Constitution does provide that in the case of fines.",
  "Is that a tail? Is that a tail that the jury proceeding is itself so unadministrable that even Congress says we recognize even a judge couldn't do it? All right?",
  "Now, is that --",
  "Is that an irrelevant consideration when you are trying to figure out whether an ambiguous history requires the jury trial?",
  "How, in general -- I mean, in the individual case, very often a trial doesn't come up because 90 percent or more of the time it's just a question of a plea bargain; and, therefore, the defendant doesn't -- this is an added weapon for him, Apprendi. But in your -- with your clients and the others, there might be quite a lot of trials. So, how in a trial does your client or others in that position defend on the ground of we didn't do this at all; but by the way, in case you decide to the contrary, jury, we want to tell you we only did it Monday, Wednesday, and Friday?",
  "How is that supposed to work? Do you have two juries?",
  "What about the other two? I just -- I was very interested in your colloquy here. You said, well, there were three cases in the 19th century where they did say the jury --",
  "And one of them was a very brief opinion from Massachusetts.",
  "Well, Massachusetts counts in its favor, but perhaps the brief opinion doesn't. The --",
  "What about the other two?",
  "Both Massachusetts. Well, it's getting stronger.",
  "So, do you need any more than that? I mean, do we have to get into this? Isn't it just a question of whether there is a tradition in the law that juries, rather than judges, would determine what used to be called sentencing facts; facts related not to the crime, but to the imposition of the punishment where that's a fine?",
  "Of the numbers, the 79 to 82 -- I guess there's some disagreement whether it's 82 or 79. Regardless, in your opinion, or maybe it's in the briefs -- I just can't remember it -- of those, say, 79, how many are there for reasons of mandatory sentence where they would not -- no one could consider the individualized nature of the crime or the criminal?",
  "What's your estimate?",
  "That's all right. What's your estimate?",
  "Well, how many come from the States that have this mandatory system? That shouldn't be too hard to find out.",
  "Non-mandatory. So -­",
  "So, you think it's almost -- it's probably 90 percent.",
  "And that's -- all right. Say it's about 70 or 71, and I remember reading a statistic somewhere where they managed to count up the number of possibilities, i.e., serious murders committed by those under 15 over 50 years or some long number of years, and 20,000s? What was it?",
  "Seventy-five hundred?",
  "That sounds more – that sounds about reasonable. that number around in my mind, that 1 percent of those who might have obtained this terrible penalty, 1 percent are actually given it?",
  "I see. All right.",
  "All right, but what is --",
  "-- the justification? You are going to get to this, I guess -- so, I'll -- but I want to be sure you do at some point. And I'm not certain it's a -- it's a cruel and unusual punishment argument. It may be more of a due process argument. But I want to know the justification -- giving all those statistics that you've seen and that was in Roper and so forth -- procedurally speaking, what is the justification for not giving the defendant any opportunity to point to mitigating features in his lack of development, in his age, in his upbringing, et cetera? That to me is a difficult question, but before we get to that topic, I don’t want to --.",
  "So, is that -- I have -- I understand their arguments, both sides. I think I've pretty much got the arguments on the question of the individualized sentencing. You can make an argument that it should be individualized, life without parole, up to age 18; say 7 through 17. And there's an argument the other way which you're making. Okay. What I want to know is your argument the opposite way on this one. What's the minimum age, in your opinion, or is there any constitutional minimum at all in respect to which you could give for a murder a child life without parole? I mean, you could have an instance of a 10-year-old or an 8-year-old. I mean, is it totally up to the States, or is there a minimum? And if there is a minimum, what is it in your opinion?",
  "What is it?",
  "Well, do your best.",
  "Do your best.",
  "Do you want to say 12?",
  "Do you want to say 10? Do you want to say 9? Because as soon as whatever you say, I'm going to say: And why not 14?",
  "Do you see the difficulty? All right. So, now put yourself in my position, because my --",
  "That's why he's arguing that the legislatures don't focus on it. If you do a public opinion poll, or just ask me, for example, or ask anyone, you say the question is: Should -- at what age should juveniles be able to be transferred out of the juvenile system into the adult system? You might get one answer. Maybe 14, maybe 15, maybe 12. But if you put the question, at what age should they be receiving a mandatory life without parole, the answer might be different. And his point is they never ask that question. They ask the first question, not the second. And that disturbs me enough to think that I can't think the answer to this question that I asked you just relies on public opinion polls or even just the number of States. I'm not sure about it. But that's why I want to hear your response, because it sounds like we're arguing between whether it should be 13, 12, or 14, in terms of an absolute cutoff. So, how do I approach that? I'm asking you for help on that one. I know you have a side in this. But I say, well, we're talking about 14, and we have all this scientific literature and so forth.",
  "Before we leave it, could -- what was the instruction the jury was given? Was it you find him guilty if he was deliberately indifferent, if he was recklessly -- what are the words they used?",
  "If he was recklessly indifferent to life.",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "Reckless -- reckless indifference to life suffices for the death penalty for an adult.",
  "But -- so, you'd -- if that's right, then we'd -- you would have to argue on, if we took this tack --",
  "-- which I don't know that you could --",
  "-- but that you cannot sentence a juvenile to life without parole for murder unless he, e.g., specifically intends the death or something equivalent, but something stronger than reckless indifference to life.",
  "How do you -- think about this, which is not your favorite position, but it's a position you've taken. It's -- it's the same question I asked before. If I say, well, doesn't there have to be some line, 3 years old, you'll say \"of course.\" Ten years old? You say \"of course,\" but nobody -- there's no problem with sentencing 10-year-olds to life without parole. Twelve years old? Well, hum. Now, maybe, your opponents want to defend that one. Thirteen years old, 14 years old? And, of course, I'm walking right into the buzz saw: Well, leave it up to the legislature. But suppose that -- that there's something to be said for not leaving it up to the legislature, at least for the numbers that were in that range. But how would you defend the cutoff at -- for no life without parole at, say, 14, older than 14, rather than older than 15, rather than older than 13? What kind of argument is there that isn't totally random for picking that number as the age below which you cannot impose life without parole even for the most horrendous murder?",
  "Okay.",
  "Eighteen, you use for a lot of purposes. Eighteen -- you could say, okay, 18. The difficulty with 18 is you're running into 2300.",
  "Not 79.",
  "And the difficulty is that. In Roper, it said, well, don't worry so much about -- about not having the death penalty -- the other one. Don't worry so much about it because there's always life without parole.",
  "And the fact that 18-year-olds or 17-year-olds in many respects are quite mature or at least can be.",
  "And so, that makes 18 seem not quite right.",
  "Or -- but there's a problem with each of them. So, that's where I'm trying--",
  "Is there any other distinction that you have been able to think of, growing out of the literature or growing out of the law, where the cutoff for some roughly comparable series of things is between 14 and 15 or between 14 and 16, or something like that?",
  "Well -- so, in Arkansas, if a 13-year-old or a 14-year-old is in a getaway car and knowingly accepts the money that someone gets from a robbery and intends to drive off with it, and that other person shoots the teller and kills him, then that individual who is 14 years old is guilty of felony murder, capital felony murder?",
  "He aided. Is that right or not?",
  "Okay. If that's right, do -- do you think that such a person is less culpable, knowing only that, than a person who actually takes out a gun and shoots the teller? Morally speaking.",
  "Okay.",
  "Now, if the answer to that question is \"yes,\" what is the argument for not being able to tell that to the jury or judge who's going to impose the sentence? What is the argument for not allowing a judge or a jury at least to think about that question, before they have -- before imposing mandatory life without parole?",
  "Oh, I know. I mean, my obvious point is that -- that the Arkansas system, once we have he was the getaway driver or assisted the getaway driver, they must sentence him at that age, or despite that age, to life without parole. And so, the other side is saying, well, at the very least -- he has three other positions -- but at the very least, the Constitution -- maybe it's the Due Process Clause -- requires the sentencer to take that into account, the fact that he was just the assistant/getaway driver and may not have thought about the murder in reality and may not have expected it in reality. Why not have to take that into account in sentencing? That's the argument. I want to hear directly your answer to that, which is taking the fourth or possibly the weakest of his positions or the least radical. What is your answer to that one?",
  "I understand the arguments, which are very good ones, for the importance of Arkansas emphasizing the importance of life and not killing people. But a person who is an adult who is faced with the death penalty, which is certainly a strong statement along your lines, is permitted by the Constitution nonetheless to make any mitigating argument he wants. And Arkansas has to do that. They have to let him make any mitigating argument he wants. And so, the argument here is basically, well, the same is true when a 14-year-old, because of the lack of maturity, faces life without parole. And that seems to me the hard issue in this case. Just as -- just as the death penalty is unique for anyone and, therefore, requires mitigating elements, isn't the life without parole special enough for an adolescent that you have to let him at least make any mitigating arguments he wants? Now, Arkansas hasn't really expressed a view in its legislation on that question, or maybe it has and just rejected it. But I don't know. That's -- if you want to say something about that, I'd be interested.",
  "Yes. But I mean, that's what their brief is filled with on the other side, basically. And so is Roper.",
  "You didn't -- you didn't read the whole thing. I -- it's a little hard to understand. And looking at the transcript on page 769, am I right? I want to get my own understanding right. At that moment your client's lawyer, who they call \"Beau\" -- is that right?",
  "Okay. All right. Your client's lawyer, namely you --",
  "-- has not yet seen the client; is that right? They think you haven't seen the client yet. They say somewhere you haven't even talked to him yet or -- he hasn't even talked to Beau. He hasn't seen his lawyer yet. They say that two paragraphs earlier. So, is that right, basically, that they think that, anyway? You see at the top of the page, about six lines down: He hasn't even talked to the lawyer yet. He hasn't even talked to Beau.",
  "Oh, they're talking about the lawyer. All right. And what you're trying to do, as far as I can read this, is they think what you're trying to do is you want Perez to plead guilty. Is that the fair thrust of this?",
  "What do you think it means?",
  "All right. So, it's hard to tell what they're talking about, I grant you that. I thought they were talking about trying -- that you thought it would be better if everybody got some kind of agreement worked out. And then she says, Perez's wife: \"How can I not worry?\" He says: \"I don't understand what's going on.\" Which is fair comment. \"But it's not the way Beau -- he's putting it two different ways. If he didn't explain to you the way, then, either -- then it's a different story. If you don't ask him\" -- Then she says: \"Yes, he's saying that everybody's going to lose. He's saying that whatever he wants to say. I don't believe him.\" Well, by the time I got through reading that, I wasn't certain what they were talking about, and I thought it sounded like they're talking about: Let's all make an agreement or everybody's going to lose. And -- and I could see that you could say that's prejudicial. I could also see that the government could say it isn't prejudicial. And it's pretty hard for me to read their opinion as thinking they were really not thinking about that error. I mean that was -- or not an error. I mean, of course, they'd be thinking about that; that was the issue. And as I read the opinion, they said, well, there's so much other evidence in the case, and in our opinion, this is weak enough that it didn't -- wouldn't have made a difference and -- and if you didn't, say, take it for the truth. And the other, dissenting judge, common, is thinking: No, I don't know; you know, it's pretty hard to understand what it means, but there's an implication there the lawyer thinks he's guilty of some kind, and in context that might have made a difference. So, he comes to a different conclusion. That's what I saw going on. And I didn't see some big war of standards. I just saw judges disagreeing about a fairly tough question in an individual case. So, what can you say to make me change my mind and think this is a war of standards that we ought to --",
  "Okay. So, would it satisfy you in your opinion if we said: We aren't finding your opinion totally clear. And, luckily, people don't have the right to send cases back to us on that basis, but we have the right to send cases back to you on that basis.",
  "And, therefore, we would like you to clarify whether you do or did or did not take in the actual transcript page there, when you reached your conclusion.",
  "Back to Justice --",
  "I suspect --",
  "Well, I would like very much to know what your answer is to Justice Kennedy's hypothetical and the Chief Justice's. As I understand those hypotheticals, they're trying to imagine a case --",
  "-- where the particular piece of improperly admitted evidence -- we know from how the jury reacted, or the kind of evidence -- it's the kind of thing that could really make a difference. I mean, they were in tears, et cetera.",
  "All right. Now, in my reading of this, which I once had to read about 100 harmless-error cases, and it seemed to me -- and you can confirm or deny this -- that in cases like that, the judge who knows this is a tough case when the jury's feeling this way, asks himself or herself the question, could this illegally admitted evidence make a difference? Could it have made a difference in this case? Could it have? And the answer is going to be \"no\" where that judge thinks a reasonable jury would not have thought it made a critical difference. And that's just putting the same thing I think slightly differently. But the answer in Justice Kennedy's case would be a judge just isn't going to think it has nothing to do with rationality. If the jury's in tears, they're going to think it's a close case. And, therefore, if in fact this could have made a difference, the judge says, yes, it's not harmless. And if the judge thinks, no, it couldn't have made a difference to any rational person, he's going to say \"harmless.\" Period. Now, that was my impression reading those cases. And I felt that those hypotheticals were getting at that. And -- use them. Answer them rather than me, because that's what I'm interested in.",
  "That -- we've never held that in respect to a claim that the real reason the police arrested was retaliation against, for example, a picket sign having an unpopular point of view or a statement having an unpopular point of view. That is, this Court has never held that it overcomes an arrest where there's a claim of retaliatory First Amendment action; is that right?",
  "All right. And what you're saying is your first reason is that we should say that. And the -- the question I wanted to ask you there is, you make a very strong case where the President and Vice President are involved, the need to protect them, but the rule that you there adopt is a rule that will apply to every police officer, anyone who arrests anyone anywhere in the country, and no matter how clear it is that the motive was retaliation against a point of view, that individual will be protected from a Bivens action. So, it sounds as if your first claim -- the remedy sweeps well beyond the need that you sketch. And so, I'd like your response to that.",
  "I understand that. I'm just saying if I agree with you on your first that if there is a probable cause for an arrest, then wouldn't I have to say there is no retaliatory First Amendment claim when a border officer chases into Arizona a person with whom he politically disagrees, and there are 14 bishops who will say he cared about nothing but his political disagreement? And there's nothing to the contrary, and he says: Oh, I happened to notice -- at trial -- that when he left he reached out and snatched a $5 bill that was in the till. And so, I had probable cause to arrest him. End of case. Now, that sounds very far-reaching, and I don't know that I'm prepared to do that. So, therefore, is there another way you might win your case, or should I do that?",
  "Yes.",
  "And, of course, Hartman dealt with prosecutions. But people all the time don't arrest others. Policemen frequently don't arrest people for everything they might arrest them for. I mean jaywalking, to take an example. Or all kinds of things where they just normally don't arrest somebody. You might -- or I'm sure you didn't, but I might sometimes have driven 60 miles an hour in a 55-mile zone. And I shouldn't even admit this. I hope I get away with it.",
  "But -- but you see, it's different arrests and prosecutions.",
  "Illegitimate? You just --",
  "Look, you just used the word \"crowd control.\" And I take it, in saying the word \"crowd control,\" you are making a distinction.",
  "Do you want -- do you want the same rule of automatic, you know, immunity -- it's sort of automatic immunity -- when crowd control isn't at issue, where there's a history of persecution of an individual by a particular officer, da, da, da? I mean, you know, we can make up cases.",
  "Did you want it absolutely across the board, or are you going to start making distinctions?",
  "I mean, I agree with you about the crowd control.",
  "I see that. I see that problem. I see the problem of protecting people in public life; I see the problem in protecting the President.",
  "Now, how far -- now, given that that's a particular problem where views are likely to be evidentiary -- unpopular views actually are, unfortunately, but how far do you extend it? You say extend it to everything. To jaywalking, to persecutions, to, you know -- that's what's making me a little nervous.",
  "How many cases -- you might know this; you might have information on how many cases over 5 years or whatever period there actually have been against Federal protective officials of retaliatory First Amendment activity.",
  "It would be in the Department, wouldn't it? Do they keep track?",
  "Do we know that this is not unique, the one before us?",
  "But when you looked up your research for this, did you find any other case in which anyone had ever asserted a First Amendment claim of retaliation for an arrest?",
  "Yes, against a Federal --",
  "Against a Federal protective official.",
  "There's no --",
  "Yes, but they did say -- and also you've left out that one of the agents overheard him say he was going to ask the Vice President how many babies he killed that day.",
  "Okay. So, their job is to protect the Vice President.",
  "That's their job.",
  "And it's a very emotional subject.",
  "And if something happens to the President, nobody's going to say, oh, you know, what were you doing? And the whole country is in mourning.",
  "We understand that. And, therefore, it's a matter of concern that the -- if you have a rule of law that says to the agents, when you hear someone who says how many babies are you going to kill that day, I'm going to ask the Vice President, I'm going to touch him, I am going to then tell them a lie when they ask me if I touched him -- that's cause for concern.",
  "Okay. Now, if there's a lawsuit, the agency will say we just can't do it. We can't do it. We can't use that as a basis for stopping that individual.",
  "All that poses a problem. Now, you're -- and I -- I think -- I recognize it as a problem. I'm not saying I have the solution.",
  "Well, say, though, that in the case of the President, what you're hearing is, as you well know, that the combination of disparate political views and risk is unlike other situations. And I don't know if they can prove it or you could prove the contrary, but that's -- that's a claim. And I can't say there's nothing to it. So, let me suggest to you another arrow which – I’ll ask you what you think of this arrow, and the answer's going to be not much, but I'm interested in hearing --",
  "-- your reason.",
  "In -- in Hartman, Justice Ginsburg and I dissent.",
  "And we referred to a D.C. Circuit case. And in the D.C. Circuit, it said -- it talked about rare cases \"where strong motive evidence combines with weak probable cause to support a finding that the prosecution would not have occurred but for the ... animus.\" Now, so far, you think \"fine.\" But suppose you were to say because of the factors that have just been mentioned where the President's at stake, the courts -- where his life is at stake, the President's -- the courts will not infer once probable cause exists that it's weak. And the courts will not infer from the simple presence of political disagreement that the motive of retaliation is strong, which in fact would produce a very limited extension of Hartman to the case of protecting the President of the United States. And now, I know you're not going to agree with that, and I'm trying it out and I'm not saying I agree with it, but I want to see what you -- how you react.",
  "Okay. So, then putting it in their point of view, I just what he actually said. He was very angry, your client. I mean, judging what he said -- there were a lot of swear words and so forth -- he was pretty angry at this whole situation. So, you're a Secret Service agent, and you hear him say -- speak like this -- he has every right to speak like that. I mean people do. I understand that. But now he's also thinking that -- I'm nervous about this. The President is here, the Vice President, whatever --",
  "-- same thing -- and I've got to do my job. So -- and nobody's going to say, ho, ho, First -- whatever if is -- if somebody is hurt.",
  "Now, he has also lied about whether he touched the President.",
  "And he has also been talking about the President killing people.",
  "Killing babies and so forth and --",
  "All right. So, what is he supposed to do in your view?",
  "Well, it is in this situation --",
  "But this situation, I've -- I'm pretty --",
  "Nothing there.",
  "He says, okay --",
  "A lot of people in that place.",
  "Well, he lied. He --",
  "I just don't want to lose the second half of your argument. And we've spent all the time so far on jurisdiction. And I accept pretty much -- I'm probably leaning in your favor on jurisdiction, but where I see the problem is in the second part, because the second part says \"restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.\" Now, here, Congress has nowhere used the word \"tax.\" What it says is \"penalty.\" Moreover, this is not in the Internal Revenue Code but for purposes of collection. And so, why is this a tax? And I know you point to certain sentences that talk about taxes within the code - -",
  "-- and this is not attached to a tax. It is attached to a health care requirement.",
  "So, why does it fall within that word?",
  "But that doesn't mean the AIA applies. I mean -- and then they provide some exceptions, but it doesn't mean the AIA applies. It says \"in the same manner as.\" It is then attached to chapter 68, when that -- it references that as being \"the manner of.\" Well, that it's being applied or if it's being collected in the same manner as a tax doesn't automatically make it a tax, particularly since the reasons for the AIA are to prevent interference with revenue sources. And here, an advance attack on this does not interfere with the collection of revenues. I mean, that's -- you've read the arguments, as have I. But I'd like to know what you say succinctly in response to those arguments.",
  "The best collection I've found in your favor, I think, is in Mortimer Caplin's brief on page 16, 17. He has a whole list. All right? So -- I let my law clerk to look all those up. And it seems to me that they all fall into the categories of either, one, these are penalties that were penalties assessed for not paying taxes; or, two, they involve matters that were called by the court taxes; or, three, in some instances, they were deemed by the code to be taxes. Now, what we have here is something that's in a different statute that doesn't use the word \"tax\" once, except for a collection device and, in fact, in addition, the underlying AIA reason, which is to say to the Solicitor General: We don't care what you think; we, in Congress, don't want you in court where the revenue of a State -- Tax Injunction Act -- or the revenue of the Federal Government is at stake, and, therefore, you can't waive it. Now, I got that. Here it's not at stake, and here there are all the differences I just mentioned. So, I ask that because I want to hear your response.",
  "I thought Davis was the case that -- where a shareholder sues the corporation.",
  "And the remedy is that the corporation shouldn't pay the money to the tax authority. Now, it's a little technical, but that isn't actually an injunction against the tax authority collecting. He's not -- they're not restraining the collection of the tax. They're saying to the taxpayer, don't pay it.",
  "I don't know how far that gets you.",
  "Why do you keep saying it's a tax?",
  "Thank you.",
  "The penalty.",
  "So, is your point that the tax and authority -- what we want to do is get money from these people. Most of them will bet -- that the money by buying the insurance, and that will help pay. But if they don't, they're going to pay this penalty, and that will help, too. And the fact that we put the latter in brings it within the taxing power. But as far as this Act is concerned, about the injunction, they called it a penalty and not a tax for a reason. They wanted it to fall outside that.",
  "It's in a different chapter, et cetera. Is that what the heart of what you're saying?",
  "It basically, basically the difference -- of language is relevant. There are a lot of relevant things. But one thing that's relevant in my mind is that taxes are, for better or for worse, the life's blood of government.",
  "And so, what Congress is trying to do is to say there is a procedure here that you go through. You can get your money back, or you go through the Tax Court, but don't do this in advance for the reason that we don't want 500 Federal judge - - judges substituting their idea of what is a proper equitable defense, of when there shouldn't be an exception made about da, da, da, for the basic rule. No. Okay? And so, there is strong reason that is there. You tried to apply that reason to the copyright law. You can't find it. Registration with the copyright register is not the life's blood of anything.",
  "Copyright exists regardless. So, the reasoning isn't there.",
  "The language -- you're -- I see the similarity of language. I've got that. But it's the reasoning, the sort of underlying reason for not wanting a waiver here that is -- has a significant role in my mind of finding that it is jurisdictional. Plus the fact that we've said it nonstop since that Northrop or whatever that other case is.",
  "That's fine. I just asked in case you wanted to answer the policy.",
  "All that's going to really what I'd think Congress's intent was meant to be in sticking the collection thing into chapter 68, and - - and it's certainly an argument in your favor. The over-arching thing in my mind is it's up to Congress, within leeway. And they did not use that word \"tax,\" and they did have a couple of exceptions. And it is true that all this language that you quote - - you know, the first two sentences and so forth, it talks about the use of \"tax\" in the IRC. It talks about the penalties and liabilities provided by this subchapter. And we look over here, and it's a penalty and liability provided by a different law, which says collect it through the subchapter. And it has nothing to do with the IRC. See? So, we've got it in a separate place. We can see pretty clearly what they're trying to do. They couldn't really care very much about interfering with collecting this one. That's all the statutory argument. Are you following me?",
  "You see? I'm trying to get you to focus on that kind of argument that I'm just making.",
  "Yes, it is.",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "All right. So, if that is your difference --",
  "If that is your difference, I'm somewhat uncertain about your answers to -- for example, Justice Kennedy asked, can you, under the Commerce Clause, Congress, create commerce where previously none existed?",
  "Yes, I thought the answer to that was, since McCulloch v. Maryland, when the Court said Congress could create the Bank of the United States which did not previously exist, which job was to create commerce that did not previously exist, since that time the answer has been \"yes.\" I would have thought that your answer to, can the government, in fact, require you to buy cell phones or buy burials, that if we propose comparable situations, if we have, for example, a uniform United States system of paying for every burial such as Medicare Burial, Medicaid Burial, CHIP Burial, ERISA Burial, and emergency burial beside the side of the road, and Congress wanted to rationalize that system, wouldn't the answer be, yes, of course, they could?",
  "And the same with the computers or the same with the -- the cell phones, if you're driving by the side of the highway and there is a Federal emergency service. Just as you say you have to buy certain mufflers for your car that don't hurt the environment, you could -- I mean, you see, doesn't it depend on the situation?",
  "Would be up here defending it.",
  "All right. So, then the question -- fine.",
  "Let me ask -- can I go back for a step? Because I don't want to get into a discussion of whether this is a good bill or not. Some people think it's going to save a lot of money. Some people think it won't. So, I'm focusing just on the Commerce Clause; not on the Due Process Clause, the Commerce Clause. And I look back into history, and I think if we look back into history, we see sometimes Congress can create commerce out of nothing. That's the national bank, which was created out of nothing to create other commerce out of nothing. I look back into history, and I see it seems pretty clear that if there are substantial effects on interstate commerce, Congress can act. And I look at the person who's growing marijuana in her house, or I look at the farmer who is growing wheat for home consumption. This seems to have more substantial effects. Is this commerce? Well, it seems to me more commerce than marijuana. I mean, is it, in fact, a regulation? Well, why not? If creating the bank is, why isn't this? And then you say, ah, but one thing here out of all those things is different, and that is you're making somebody do something. I say, hey, can't Congress make people drive faster than 45 -- 40 miles an hour on a road? Didn't they make that man growing his own wheat go out into the market and buy other wheat for his -- for his cows? Didn't they make Mrs. -- if she married somebody who had marijuana in her basement, wouldn't she have to go and get rid of it? Affirmative action? I mean, where does this distinction come from? It sounds like sometimes you can, and sometimes you can't. So, what is argued here is there is a large group of -- what about a person that we discover that there are -- a disease is sweeping the United States, and 40 million people are susceptible, of whom 10 million will die; can't the Federal Government say all 40 million get inoculation? So, here, we have a group of 40 million, and 57 percent of those people visit emergency care or other care, which we're paying for. And 22 percent of those pay more than $100,000 for that. And Congress says they're in the midst of this big thing. We just want to rationalize the system they're already in. So, there, you got the whole argument, and I would like you to tell me, looking back --",
  "Well, no, it's one question. It's looking back at that -- looking back at that history. The thing I concede, that you say to some people go buy -- why does that make a difference in terms of the Commerce Clause?",
  "It was both?",
  "But do you think you can, better than the actuaries or better than the members of Congress who worked on it, look at the 40 million people who are not insured and say which ones next year will or will not use, say, emergency care? Can you do that any better than if we knew that 40 million people were suffering, about to suffer a contagious disease, and only 10 million would get sick?",
  "We don't know which?",
  "Of course, we do know that there are a few people, more in New York City than there are in Wyoming, who never will buy a car. But we also know here, and we don't like to admit it, that because we are human beings, we all suffer from the risk of getting sick, and we also all know that we'll get seriously sick. And we also know that we can't predict when. And we also know that when we do, there will be our fellow taxpayers through the Federal Government who will pay for this. If we do not buy insurance, we will pay nothing. And that happens with a large number of people in this group of 40 million, none of whom can be picked out in advance. Now, that's quite different from the car situation, and it's different in only this respect: It shows there is a national problem, and it shows there is a national problem that involves money, cost, insurance. So, if Congress could do this, should there be a disease that strikes the United States and they want every one inoculated even though 10 million will be hurt, it's hard for me to decide why that isn't interstate commerce, even more so where we know it affects everybody.",
  "All right. But all that sounds like you're debating the merits of the bill. You asked really for limiting principles so we don't get into a matter that I think has nothing to do with this case: broccoli. Okay? And the limiting principles -- you've heard three. First, the Solicitor General came up with a couple joined, very narrow ones. You've seen in Lopez this Court say that we cannot -- Congress cannot get into purely local affairs, particularly where they're noncommercial. And, of course, the greatest limiting principle of all, which not too many accept -- so, I'm not going to emphasize that -- is the limiting principle derived from the fact that members of Congress are elected from States and that 95 percent of the law of the United States is State law. That is a principle, though enforced by the legislature. The other two are principles, one written into Lopez and one you just heard. It seems to me all of those eliminate the broccoli possibility, and none of them eliminates the possibility that we're trying to take the 40 million people who do have the medical cost, who do affect interstate commerce, and provide a system that you may like or not like.",
  "That's where we are in limiting principles.",
  "So, in your view, right there -- in your view -- in your view right there --",
  "Can I just --",
  "I'm just picking on something. I'd like to just -- if it turned out there was some terrible epidemic sweeping the United States, and we couldn't say that more than 40 or 50 percent -- I can make the number as high as I want -- but the -- the -- you'd say the Federal Government doesn't have the power to get people inoculated, to require them to be inoculated, because that's just statistical.",
  "Is your answer to that yes or no?",
  "No, they could not do it?",
  "They cannot require people, even if this disease is sweeping the country, to be inoculated. The Federal Government has no power, and if there's -- okay, fine. Go ahead.",
  "Please turn to Justice Kagan.",
  "Yes.",
  "I agree with you --",
  "-- that it had big effects, but the majority thought that was a local matter.",
  "Fine. Then if that's so, is it -- let me just change my example under pressure --",
  "-- and say that in fact it turns out that 90 percent of all automobiles driving interstate without certain equipment put out pollution, which travels interstate -- not 100 percent, maybe only 60 percent. Does the EPA have the power then to say you've got to have an antipollution device? It's statistical.",
  "Then you're -- then you're not going on statistics; you're going on something else, which is what I'd like to know what it is.",
  "Now we -- now you've changed the ground of argument, which I accept as totally legitimate. And then the question is when you are born and you don't have insurance and you will in fact get sick and you will in fact impose costs, have you perhaps involuntarily -- perhaps simply because you are a human being -- entered this particular market, which is a market for health care?",
  "I see the point. You can go back to -- go back to Justice Kagan. Don't forget her question.",
  "But what about -- you know, the simplest counter-example for me to suggest is you've undoubtedly read Judge Sutton's concurring opinion. He has about two pages, it seemed to me, of examples where everyone accepts the fact that under these kinds of regulations the government can compel people to buy things they don't otherwise want to buy. For example, he gives -- even in that farm case, the farmer was being forced to go out and buy grain to feed to his animals because he couldn't raise it at home. You know, and he goes through one example after another. So, what is your response to that, which you've read?",
  "It is different. It is different. It is different. I agree with that. But you pointed out, and I agree with you on this, that the government set up these emergency room laws. The government set up Medicaid. The government set up Medicare. The government set up CHIP, and there are 40 million people who don't have the private insurance. In that world, the government has set up commerce. It's all over the United States. And in that world, of course, the decision by the 40 million not to buy the insurance affects that commerce and substantially so. So, I thought the issue here is not whether it's a violation of some basic right or something to make people buy things they don't want, but simply whether those decisions of that group of 40 million people substantially affect the interstate commerce that has been set up in part through these other programs.",
  "So, that's the part of your argument I'm not hearing.",
  "Can I ask you one question, which is a practical question? I take as a given your answer to Justice Kennedy. You're saying let's look at it objectively and say would Congress have intended this, okay? This is the mandate in the community - - this is Titles I and II, the mandate, the community, pre-existing condition, okay? Here's the rest of it, you know, and when I look through the rest of it, I have all kinds of stuff in there. And I haven't read every word of that, I promise. All right. I mean, as you pointed out, there's biosimilarity, there's breast feeding, there's promoting nurses and doctors to serve underserved areas, there's the CLASS Act, et cetera. What do you suggest we do? I mean, should we appoint a special master with an instruction? Should we go back to the district court? You haven't argued most of these. As I hear you now, you're pretty close to the SG. I mean, you'd like it all struck down, but if we are supposed to apply the objective test, I don't know if you differ very much. So, what do you propose that we do other than spend a year reading all this and have you argue all of it?",
  "I would say the Breast Feeding Act, the -- getting doctors to serve underserved areas, the biosimilar thing and drug regulation, the CLASS Act -- those have nothing to do with the stuff that we've been talking about yesterday and the day before, okay? So, if you tell me at that level, I'd say, sure, they have nothing to do with it; they could stand on their own. The Indian thing, about helping the underserved Native Americans -- all that stuff has nothing to do with it. Black lung disease, nothing to do with it. Okay? So, that's -- you know what you have there? A total off-the-cuff impression. So, that's why I'm asking you what should I do?",
  "But what he's thinking - -",
  "What he's thinking of is this: I think Justice Scalia is thinking, I suspect, of -- imagine a tax which says this tax, amount Y, goes to purpose X, which will pay for half of purpose X. The other half will come from the exchanges somehow. That second half is unconstitutional. Purpose X can't possibly be carried out now with only half the money. Does the government just sit there collecting half the money forever because nobody can ever challenge it? You see, there -- if it were inextricably connected, is it enough to say, well, we won't consider that because maybe somebody else could bring that case and then there is no one else? I mean, is that - -",
  "I mean, I think it's not uncommon that Congress passes an act, and then there are many different titles, and some of the titles have nothing to do with the other titles. That's a common thing. And you're saying you've never found an instance where they're all struck out when they have nothing to do with each other. My question is -- because I hear Mr. Clement saying something not too different from what you say. He talks about things at the periphery. We can't reject or accept an argument on severability because it's a lot of work for us. That's beside the point. But do you think that it's possible for you and Mr. Clement -- I'm exploring this -- to get together and agree on - -",
  "-- I mean, on a list of things that are, in both your opinions, peripheral? Then you would focus on those areas where one of you thinks it's peripheral and one of you thinks it's not peripheral. And at that point, it might turn out to be far fewer than we're currently imagining, at which point we could hold an argument or figure out some way or somebody would hold an argument and try to -- try to get those done. Is that a pipe dream or is that a - -",
  "But would you -- I'd just like to hear before you leave your argument, if you want to, against what Justice Scalia just said. Let's assume, contrary to what you want, that the Government's position is accepted by the majority of this Court. And so, we now are rid, quote, of the true \"heart\" of the bill. Now, still there are a lot of other provisions here like the Indian Act, the black lung disease, the wellness program, that restaurants have to have a calorie count of major menus, et cetera. Now, some of them cost money, and some of them don't. And there are loads of them. Now, what is your argument that just because the heart of the bill is gone, that has nothing to do with the validity of these other provisions, both those that cost money or at least those that cost no money? Do you want to make an argument in that respect, that destroying the heart of the bill does not blow up the entire bill; it blows up the heart of a bill? And I'd just like to hear what you have to say about that.",
  "Have you come across - -",
  "Yes. Oh, I know. So, you -- I would say stay out of politics. That's for Congress, not us.",
  "But the -- the question here is -- you've read all these cases or dozens -- have you ever found a severability case where the Court ever said: Well, the heart of the thing is gone, and, therefore, we strike down these other provisions that have nothing to do with it, which could stand on their feet independently and can be funded separately or don't require money at all.",
  "Where does it say that? I'm sorry. Where does it say that?",
  "What you just said. You said Congress said, if you don't take the new money to cover the new individuals, you don't get any of the old money that covers the old individuals. That's what I heard you say.",
  "And where does it say that?",
  "Where?",
  "Where is it in your brief?",
  "In the blue brief?",
  "23A. Okay. Thank you.",
  "Okay --",
  "I want the part about the funding cutoff.",
  "And that cite section is what?",
  "Well, I have it in front of me.",
  "And I'll tell you what I have, what I have in front of me, what it says.",
  "And it's been in the statute since 1965.",
  "And the cite I have is 42 U.S.C. Section 1396(c). So are we talking about the same thing?",
  "Yes. Okay.",
  "And here's what it says at the end.",
  "It says, \"The Secretary shall notify the State agency\" -- this is if they don't comply -- \"that further payments will not be made to the State, or in his discretion, that payments will be limited to categories under or parts of the State plan not affected by such failure, which it repeats until the Secretary is satisfied that he shall limit payments to categories under or parts of the State plan not affected by such failure.\" So reading that in your favor, I read that to say it's up to the Secretary whether, should a State refuse to fund the new people, the Secretary will cut off funding for the new people, as it's obvious the State doesn't want it, and whether the Secretary can go further. I also should think -- I could not find one case where the Secretary ever did go further, but I also would think that the Secretary could not go further where going further would be an unreasonable thing to do -- since government action is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, since it's governed by the general principle, it must always be reasonable. So I want to know where this idea came from that should State X say I don't want the new money, that the Secretary would or could cut off the old money?",
  "All right. Now, let me relieve you of that concern, and tell me how I -- whether I have -- that a basic principle of administrative law -- indeed, all law -- is that the government must act reasonably. And should a Secretary cut off more money than the Secretary could show was justified by being causally related to the State's refusal to take the new money, you would march into court with your clients and say, Judge, the Secretary here is acting unreasonably. And I believe there is implicit in this statute, as there is explicit in the ADA, that any such cutoff decision must be reasonable. Now, does that relieve you of your fear?",
  "I didn't think it would, but I --",
  "What I said -- I said because it could be, you know, given the complexity of the Act, that there is some money that would be saved in the program if the States take the new money, and if they don't take the new money, there is money that is being spent that wouldn't otherwise be spent. There could be some pile like that. It might be that the Secretary could show it was reasonable to take that money away from the States, too --",
  "-- but my point is, you have to show reasonableness before you can act.",
  "Yeah, but I have a number -- all right.",
  "All right --",
  "To make you feel a little better, I want to pursue this for 1 more minute. There are cases, and many, of which Justice Scalia knows as well, which use -- Holly Hill, uses the same word as this statute: \"In the Secretary's discretion.\" And in those cases, this Court has said that doesn't mean the Secretary can do anything that he or she wants, but rather, they are limited to what is not arbitrary, capricious, and abuse of discretion, in interpreting statutes, in applying those statutes, et cetera. End of my argument. End of my question. Respond as you wish.",
  "And isn't the covenant going to apply, as well, to the 1980 extension to children 0 to 6 years old, 1990 requiring the extension for children up to 18? All those prior extensions, to me, seem just as big in amount, just about as big in the number of people coming on the rolls, and they all are governed by precisely the same statute that you're complaining of here, which has been in the law since '65.",
  "I'll tell you this number, which I did look up, that the amount, approximately, if you look into it -- as a percentage of GDP, it's big, but it was before this somewhere about 2-point-something percent, fairly low, of GDP. It'll go up to something a little bit over 3 percent of GDP. And now go look at the comparable numbers, which I did look at, with the expansion that we're talking about before. The expansion from 0 to 18 or even from 0 to 6. And while you can argue those numbers, it's pretty hard to argue that they aren't roughly comparable as a percentage of the prior program or as a percentage of GDP. If I'm right on those numbers or even roughly right -- I don't guarantee them -- then would you have to say, well, indeed, Medicaid has been unconstitutional since 1964. And if not, why not?",
  "Knew you would say that.",
  "Which way?",
  "Just before you leave that, I'd appreciate it if you would expand a little bit on the answer to Justice Kagan's question for the reason, when I read the cutoff statute, which as I said has been there since 1965 unchanged, it does refer to the Secretary's discretion to keep the funding, insofar as the funding has no relationship to the failure to comply with the condition. And as I read that, that gives the Secretary the authority to cut off all the money that the States' refusal to accept the condition means they shouldn't have. But nothing there says they can go beyond that and cut off unrelated money. Now, there is a sentence, says maybe they could do that. But I thought they had to exercise that within reason.",
  "I don't know when it be reasonable. So, you've looked into it, and that's what I want to know.",
  "Is there -- I could find no instance where they went beyond the funds that were related to the thing that the State refused to do or things affected by that. I would like you to tell me, when you looked into it, that what I thought of in this isolation chamber here is actually true. Or whether they have gone around threatening people that we will cut off totally unrelated funds. What is the situation?",
  "I don't know if that's so. And all I asked in my question was I didn't ask you to commit the Secretary to anything. I wanted to know what the facts are.",
  "I wanted to know what you found in researching this case. I wanted you, in other words, to answer the question the Chief Justice has: Is it a common thing that that happens, that this unrelated threat is made? Or isn't it?",
  "You're not privy to conversations.",
  "Why is it different? Why is it different? I mean, I thought it might be very unlikely a State would ever say that the government -- Federal Government would say here's a condition that you have to have a certain kind of eyeglasses for people who don't see. And, by the way, if you don't do that, we'll take away $42 billion of funding. Okay? I thought such a thing would not happen. And I thought if it tried to happen, that it's governed by the APA, and the person with the eyeglasses would say it's arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion. And that's so even though the statute says it's in the discretion of the Secretary. But Mr. -- your colleague and brother says no, I'm wrong about the law there, and, moreover, they would do it. That's what I'm hearing now.",
  "That they would do it, and they do do it, and -- et cetera. So, I'd like a little clarification.",
  "What's making you reluctant?",
  "Yes, I do.",
  "That's my point, actually. That's where I'm sort of bothered, just exactly what Justice Scalia said, that if you look through what I've seen so far by the materials, they're pretty evenly balanced, and there are tens of thousands of people who work in this industry, and there's a history of 75 years of nobody said anything. So you would think -- and it isn't the only problem that has just been recognized in other industries, too. If the agency is going to reverse, not reverse, but suddenly do something it hasn't done for 75 years, the right way to do it is to have notice and comment, hearings, allow people to present their point of view, and then make some rules or determine what should happen. Perhaps they'd say for the future let's do this, but not let's give people a windfall for the past. Perhaps they'd say some and not others. Okay? That's my instinctive reaction, not necessarily legal, but informed by administrative law. But why shouldn't I try to get there?",
  "No, I've read those.",
  "I've read those, and I find them beautifully ambiguous.",
  "I'll go back and read them again, and if they're absolutely clear, you win, fine, that's the end of it.",
  "You're right about that, and so, they're at fault, too. But on the other hand, their employees might have been satisfied, and this is done to protect the employees. So, I'm asking, not saying, but what is the process here? How do you know -- at what level was this agency decision made to suddenly go ahead with this? Who made it? What was the input? How do you know they're on your side? You do know; you're right. But I mean, what's the process internally?",
  "Well, the alternative step ..-- well, did the Secretary of Labor herself or himself, depending on when it was, consider this matter?",
  "No, we don't. All right. So --",
  "So, the alternative is not enforcement actions, necessarily. The alternative is for the agency to focus on the question and decide what it actually wants to do.",
  "That's --",
  "The --",
  "Are they paid commissions? If they're -- if the salesman or the promotion agent, as the case may be, is successful in his territory in getting doctors to prescribe the drug, does he receive extra pay?",
  "What does that mean? Does he -- I mean, an outside salesman -- in one document, it says is a person who often obtains a commission on his sales.",
  "And now what I'm trying to figure out -- I might not have the right words to ask the question -- are these people, people who in some sense or other receive commissions on their sales?",
  "Let's pursue this for a second.",
  "Because I'd like to go back to Justice Kennedy's question, and this is only me speaking. I don't know how anybody else feels. If this had come up in 1941, you wouldn't have had a chance. I would have said look at the statute; it says the Secretary defines it. You'd say, well, can you define it in a brief? Yes, you have to be careful of briefs, but, yes. And that's the end of the case. It's not a question for judges; it's a question for administrators. All right. But now it's difficult for me because of the passage of 75 years. And we can blame it in part on the industry or in part on the Secretary. There is blame to go around. So, the question is, what do I do as a judge? And partly my instinct is get somebody to decide this other than a lawyer in the Department of Labor, because this is a hard question. And that's where we come to Justice Kennedy's question, which is he says all right, fine, let's write that, and -- and what case do we cite? And I don't agree with you, overturn Auer. I think amicus briefs are often helpful, but use them with care. And then I have the statute here, which talks about the Secretary doing the definition of \"outside salesman,\" and I have lots of rules and regulations and reports, which are fairly ambiguous in my opinion. So, you tell me what to say.",
  "Thank you. I'll look at it.",
  "Mr. Goldstein, 3 minutes.",
  "Yes, but how -- how many are we talking about, say, a 3-month period? How many people commit -- most people -- everybody pleads guilty. They're caught quickly and sentenced quickly -­",
  "I know not necessarily. That's why I want your estimate of how many we're talking about.",
  "And how -- how long historically, roughly, if you know, does it take from the time the person's caught till the time he's sentenced, when he pleads guilty?",
  "Eleven months?",
  "But how many of -- you see what I'm trying to get at. I'm trying to get at a guess, if you like, of how many people we're talking about. The two numbers that I can't find in the briefs are roughly -- if your opponent is correct, and it only applies to new people, this thing. That's the applicable law. In other words, you're assuming the answer -- in your answer to Justice Scalia, you're assuming the answer. I haven't heard an argument for it, except that there are very few people that his interpretation or the opposite interpretation would catch. And how many are there?",
  "About? I mean, is it more like 10, or is it more like 50, is it more like 100? Can you make a guess at all?",
  "All right -­",
  "It isn't obvious to you what I'm trying to get at.",
  "You -- you see what I'm trying to get at? I guess -­",
  "No, no.",
  "But you're saying it would be absurd to think that this section 8 has to do only with prior -- the pre-enactment offenses. Absurd, all right? If there's just likely to be one person, I tend to buy your absurdity argument. If there's likely to be 500 or 1,000, I'm much less certain.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, that argument -- of course, they could have had both in mind. They could have had applicable law for the new people is our new statute; applicable for the old people, you don't need any amendment, we're not talking about that, just apply the old law.",
  "That made perfect sense.",
  "Suppose you're wrong about that.",
  "Suppose you're wrong about that. I mean, I think when they -- they meant do it, that considered. Does that change?",
  "No. I mean, I think that when they wrote 3553, they were thinking those were the guidelines that are going to apply. Do it. Now, I'll look into that. But if I -- if I reach the conclusion I agree competing background rules -­",
  "I agree applicable law doesn't help us, because -- all the time, there are two different sets of guidelines that apply depending upon when you committed the crime. That's very common. All right. So, I agree with you that far. But now I'm worried about -- the last question Justice Scalia asked does, I think, focus this question, because we have not only 109; we have also the -- the one we're talking about now, and that says, normally, you will apply the guidelines in effect even to people who committed the crime before the new statute.",
  "And now, do we have any analogies? Has this ever happened before? Is there -- I can't find out how many people we're talking about. I'd like to know at least are there many other occasions when Congress amended mandatory minimums so there's some precedent? Any?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Wait, wait. This is -­ just tell me if maybe the light is dawning, and maybe I'm just at the same question Justice Kagan asked. Think of before the statute. There were two sets of people: Those people subject to the mandatory minimum and those crack people who -- the mandatory minimum didn't matter, but the Commission wrote amendments consistent with. So, they were tough amendments, though the law didn't require it -­",
  "-- to produce consistency. Now the statute's passed. Now we have some of the pre-Act offenders. Because of the two sets of things, section 8 on the one hand and the 3553(g) on the other, in respect to those people who were not governed by the mandatory minimum previously but were subject to the then-conforming amendments, now will have to be subject to new conforming amendments that conform to the new thing. And that -- because that'll have to be because of the combination of the two sections that Mr. Dreeben read, the -- all right. Now, if that's so, we get to the cliffs that Justice Kagan is talking about. And if I'm right so far, we're now back at the probation officer example, and it's so odd and so peculiar that it is not just a fair -- do you see where I'm going?",
  "Is that too complicated?",
  "I don't blame you, frankly. But I -­",
  "All right.",
  "I don't blame you. I don't blame you.",
  "I'd imagine you'd find disagreement with that. You know -- you know -- you know if -- as a matter of fact, in the year that these took effect, think of the sentences that were not governed by mandatory for crack, not governed by the mandatory minimum. Did the guidelines provide, let's call it a low sentence, disproportionately low?",
  "And did they change those non-mandatory part when they wrote new ones?",
  "All right. I'll look it up. I'll look it up.",
  "I'm sorry, I'm not clear on what this hypothetical is. I thought her hypothetical -- Justice Kagan's -- was a situation where the statute says, Mr. Secretary, you can spend no money beyond what is appropriated.",
  "But the contract doesn't mention it. That's Ferris. I thought that the -- the real world is, in contracting, you typically have both a statute that says don't pay more than is appropriated --",
  "-- and in the contract, it says, \"subject to appropriation,\" putting the contracting party on notice.",
  "So which were you answering?",
  "The words in the contract are \"subject to appropriations.\"",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay. So in that world -- now we get to the question -- in that world, what happens when 15 people each enter into such a contract for $100,000 each, and the appropriation turns out to be too small to pay all of them, but big enough to pay some?",
  "I saw -- I read the Redbook. I might have missed the part that you're about to cite to, because I'd like you to tell me where in the Redbook it says that a contractor who has a contract that says \"subject to appropriations\" and is then dealing with the law of Congress which says the appropriation will not exceed X million is then entitled to be paid on a contract where he and like contracts do exceed X million. Where does it say that in the Redbook?",
  "I couldn't find it.",
  "I did read it. I just would like to know what page you want me to read again. I read the Chamber of Commerce brief. The Chamber of Commerce brief says everybody knows that the contractors are paid in this situation. So I looked up the authorities that they cited. Okay? I read the Redbook. I read my other case of Cherokee. I read Ferris. I read Sutton. I can't say I'm perfect at reading --",
  "-- but I couldn't find it.",
  "So I would appreciate your referring me to those citations.",
  "Okay.",
  "I have it in front of me, by coincidence.",
  "Here it is.",
  "No, no. I have the Redbook 6-44.",
  "I'm not saying it isn't there. I just read through these pretty quickly. I just need a little refresher.",
  "Oh, I don't have that one.",
  "No. That isn't quite my question. My question was: I would like the authority for the proposition that when you have a set of contractors, and they read their contract, and it says \"subject to appropriation,\" and then you read the law, and it says they will not be paid, it shall not exceed $4 million, and then you discover that the amount of the contracts of the same kind in this category are more than $4 million, I want to know where in the Redbook it says that they get paid more than $4 million. That's all. That's fairly simple. And if that's -- if that's normal practice, it must be there's a lot of authority for it. So I -- I just want to know what to read.",
  "But they aren't talking about there where it says specifically in the contract \"subject to appropriations.\" At least I think they're not. Now, I would like you right now to tell me, no, you're wrong; it does say that.",
  "They're distinguishing Sutton from Ferris.",
  "They're trying to use that to distinguish Sutton from Ferris, and it's filled with, well, we're not sure about this because Sutton, which is Brandeis, which comes out the opposite way, did have a line appropriation. And I thought that just refers to the fact that because there's a line appropriation, the contractor's on notice.",
  "Exactly. And when you do business with the government over a period of years, and it says \"subject to appropriation,\" not necessarily you but your lawyer, who's a good lawyer, should look up and see what the appropriation is or whether it was made. And that's what I gather --",
  "No, no, not as a matter of policy. I'm putting it as a question because that was my first reaction. And I expect you to say, no, Justice Breyer --",
  "-- you're wrong, and that isn't the practice, and here is what I read to show that isn't the practice. That's all I'm asking.",
  "By showing me where in the law it says -- and I don't want to repeat the question for the third time, but it says --",
  "Well, here sometimes not everyone pays sufficient attention to these very clear questions.",
  "Where -- look, hypothetical. Four people, four identical contracts, the words appear, \"subject to appropriation.\"",
  "Each is for a million dollars. Then you read the appropriation that was later made, and in that statute, it says, we hereby appropriate $3 million, and -- it is, the payments are not to exceed $3 million. Okay? Something like that.",
  "All I want is the authority that says each of those four people can come in and get the $1 million, totaling $4 million. I want the authority that says that.",
  "No. Ferris -- it did not say anything about it in the contract.",
  "Oh, there certainly is. Putting in the words gives the lawyer notice.",
  "It does? Where do you get -- I couldn't find the contract. The language in Ferris is, \"a contractor who is one of several persons to be paid out of an appropriation is not chargeable with knowledge of its administration.\" True. Now, Dyk says, in his opinion, that one difference from Ferris is they wrote the idea into the contract, saying you're subject to appropriation to get to make that lawyer chargeable with knowledge. And the second thing in Ferris is that it was an individual who went off on his own in the administration and paid money that he shouldn't have paid. It should have been over here for the contract. In this case, it is an instance where Congress itself required the money to be paid, as it was paid, and didn't provide enough. Okay. So that's where I am with Ferris, which is a big question mark. And I guess you could talk about that, but all I wanted to know is what is well established in this field.",
  "I don't want to write something that suddenly upsets what is well established.",
  "And that is that as it says in the contract, you are barred, you are barred from recovering if we don't appropriate enough money. Should it say that wouldn't matter? Is that right?",
  "And so what's wrong with that? I mean, a creditor loaned you a million dollars. For the million dollars, he got an interest -- a secured interest in a piece of property. And that property is worth whatever it was -- whatever it's worth -- less than a million, and he says that's the deal. I -- I have a secured interest in this; I want the property. Now, you are better off because you can stretch out the payments over time, and maybe you don't have to give it to him immediately, but I don't see anything unfair about saying, give him the property if he wants it.",
  "Well, in accordance with (i), (ii) and (iii). I mean, I'm not saying skip those.",
  "I don't understand that. I mean, as I read it, to put it out on the table, I read this makes perfect sense. What they are trying to do is help the debtor a little, without mucking up the secured creditor's collateral. Choice (i), give the secured creditor his collateral, and there is still a lien on it. He has what he had before, and the debtor is better off because he can stretch the payments out over time, and that's one and two. Choice (ii), we give the creditor some new collateral. Hmm, that's a little risky, but to be sure it's fair, we are absolutely certain, with a few exceptions not relevant, that the creditor can credit bid. So he has it within his control. Choice (iii), something else which comes up in different situations, for example, a creditor who is over-secured, see, and -- and they want to sell the piece of property. And he says, sure, I will let you sell it, but I want something that's the equivalent, give me this other property over here that you own, that has no liens at all. And the judge can look at that and say that's fair. That's what (iii) is basically about, as far as I could understand it. So it all makes sense to me. And I don't understand why you would want to have a rule saying that (iii) trumps (i) and (ii) and stops credit bidding.",
  "So that's the whole thing, as I am seeing it at this moment. So I'll give you a chance to reply.",
  "No, it doesn't have the language, which is why we have a case. But, I mean, trying to interpret it in a way that makes sense, what is wrong with what I said as a way that makes sense? I mean, why, since we are trying to give the -- the creditor the indubitable value, at the very least -- the best way to do that would be let the creditor credit bid.",
  "So why not? And you can read it. You don't have to read it the way that -- that you want. You could read it the opposite way, too.",
  "No, I'm looking at it from the perspective of a bankruptcy system --",
  "-- that is trying to get secured creditors what they have their security in, while giving the debtor the advantage here of being able to stretch out his payments.",
  "You said -- look, in subsection (iii), if it applies here -- I assume there's -- suppose it doesn't apply here. There is a safeguard against having no bidder. Bidders who would bid more than what the creditor thinks it's worth, the creditor will want them in this. And if they -- he doesn't want it in, it's because he thinks it's worth more in his own hands. So what's the problem? But there is a problem the other way. The problem the other way -- and I'm not saying it's this case, but there are -- is that the insiders say to the stalking horse, we would like you to put this up at a low price and give us a job. And if they keep the creditor out, well, that's a big incentive. And they are the ones who know what a hotel is worth, the judge doesn't know, and there is always leeway. And so that -- that was worrying me about this fact pattern. You want -- you want to get rid of my worry?",
  "Good.",
  "You know, but the concern was -- I gather there is no other bidder, you have said. You've just found the stalking horse. You agree to pay the stalking horse a million and a half dollars, in case he doesn't get it. And then the people from the inside are being hired by the stalking horse, if he wins.",
  "Now, I'm not -- I'm sure they are acting very honestly. But you would have to say, in such a situation, that there is an incentive to try to value everything on the low side by the debtor to make sure that stalking horse gets the property. And that incentive is destroyed -- or at least doesn't work, if you allow the creditor bid.",
  "What is -- I was just guessing before, but, I mean, if you're right, what is the (iii) -- the indubitable equivalent, what kind of situation does that come up? I mean, I was guessing it would come up, maybe an over secured creditor, they want to -- they want to sell the property, and he still wants his security, and they have to put in equivalent property that wasn't mortgaged, but I was just guessing.",
  "So -- so what is it really -- what is it really used for, in your opinion?",
  "What?",
  "Yes, I'm sure.",
  "That's what I was thinking.",
  "All right. Well, then why isn't it just like your 30 days?",
  "So what?",
  "Can I -- the -- this is exactly the point that I don't understand. Forget standing for a moment. I'm just thinking of your quiet title action. This wasn't an action to quiet title at all. This was a -- I looked at the complaint, as I -- as I gather from his questions, so did the Chief Justice. And it is a complaint filed before the -- the property was taken into trust, and it asks for an injunction under the APA, if it wants review of that, before the government has any title to it at all, or at least it hasn't taken it into trust. So why are we considering quiet title? What has that to do with this? Why isn't it exactly what -- now, that's the same as the Chief Justice asked, and I have exactly the same question.",
  "All right. Well, why isn't that -- that's the end of that argument, then, isn't it? Because this suit was brought seeking an injunction before the land was taken into trust; the district court denies the request for the injunction. The court of appeals reverses that. And so there we are. We're reviewing that action by the court of appeals, reviewing a judge who said you are not entitled to an injunction sought before the land was taken into trust.",
  "Oh, I don't know about that. Well - -",
  "Well, I don't know how - - how we should treat that. There -- there was an order. Suppose that order was wrong. Suppose they should have granted the injunction. Then isn't what we should do, send it back because that injunction should have been granted, then have a hearing or trial or whatever you want to have on whether the Act applies, and then figure out how you do relief? Which I don't know.",
  "They did.",
  "He didn't appeal that. He appealed it different - -",
  "But that -- but you don't -- you can't believe that totally because you agree there is some APA review of an action brought before the title shifts where, the claim is, you cannot take title, Secretary. You agree with that. You can bring some.",
  "Okay. Once you agree to that, I stop at the words, not just \"under this section,\" but \"to adjudicate a disputed title to real property.\" Then I read his complaint. His complaint, on 31 to 38, is asking for an injunction, and it's asking for an injunction before they take any title to the property. And maybe they went ahead and did it anyway, but is there some other complaint that I didn't read? Is there some amendment to the complaint in the record? If so, where is it?",
  "I don't know what a constructive amendment is.",
  "No, no, no. You can't -- I mean - -",
  "I thought -- I mean -- sorry. You answer it as you want according to your argument. There is a difficult question here. The difficult question is what happens if one brings an ordinary APA suit before land is taken, before that suit can be decided -- before that suit can be decided, the government takes the land. Does that transform it into a quiet title action? The obvious answer, which isn't obvious at all, is that the answer is that it's a proper APA suit if you bring it before they take it. And if you bring it after they take it, it's a quiet title action. And -- and that would seem to me a first-blush answer. But I haven't found -- I mean, that's a question we don't -- I don't know if we have to answer that question. It seems to me quite difficult. And I don't know what authority there is. And is it fully argued in the briefs? So what -- isn't that what -- you're thinking -- I think Justice Sotomayor is thinking, well, and you just said you can bring it after. I don't know if you can bring it after. So go answer now - -",
  "And I want to hear what you say.",
  "But your injury, your injury is that it's being used for gambling. So is there room for relief that could say the government can do what it wants to the land, it just can't let it be used for gambling, if you want. And that would cure your injury, and it wouldn't require the government to give back the land, and it wouldn't require any unscrambling, and title could rest in the government. I don't know if that's possible or not possible.",
  "I don't think Justice Scalia's argument was a bad argument. I thought it was a rather good argument. If in fact you go back and you take the view that any suit filed to review APA is not a quiet title action, people could go upset government title to property years and years later. And they would say: Oh, well, we're not challenging the title; we're just challenging what happened when it was taken, the title was taken. That can't be right, it seems to me, first blush. So therefore, I thought you -- yours is different because you filed before they took title. But as I say, I'm uncertain of that distinction. Now, your answer suggests you've been going both ways. Sometimes you think, well, it matters that we filed before. And other times, you think, no, it doesn't matter.",
  "How do they have -- well, the same question, but -- but I'm trying to think of examples. Example one is the person is arrested. Now, it says any person who is arrested shall have the person's immigration status determined before the person is released. So I wonder, if they have arrested a citizen, he's Hispanic-looking. He was jogging. He has a backpack. He has water in it and Pedialyte. So they think, oh, maybe this is an illegal person. It happens he's a citizen of New Mexico. And so the driver's license doesn't work. And, now, they put him in jail. And are you -- can you represent to us -- I don't know if you can or not -- can you represent to us he will not stay in jail, in detention, for a significantly longer period of time than he would have stayed in the absence of Section 2(B)? Do you want to represent that or not?",
  "All right. Now, if you cannot represent that -- and I'm not surprised you don't want to -- I mean, I don't know - -",
  "What?",
  "Oh, fine.",
  "But the Fourth Amendment - - since -- for -- I mean, that's -- that's another question. I don't know how long the Fourth Amendment allows. I don't know on that. There probably is a range of things. But we do know that a person, ordinarily, for this crime, X, would have been released after a day. Oh, you know, the Fourth Amendment would have allowed more. So, now, what I want to know is what, in practice, will happen? You -- from your representation, I think that there will be a significant number of people - - some of whom won't be arrested. It takes 11 minutes for some. For citizens, it might take two hours. It might take two days. Okay. There will be a significant number of people who will be detained, at the stop or in prison, for a significantly longer period of time than in the absence of 2(B). Is that a fair conclusion?",
  "That's a different argument - -",
  "All right. Can I make the following statement in the opinion -- and you will say that's okay. Imagine -- this is imaginary. \"We interpret\" -- imagine -- \"we interpret Section 2(B) as not authorizing or requiring the detention of any individual under 2(B), either at the stop or in prison, for a significantly longer period of time than that person would have been detained in the absence of 2(B).\" Can I make that statement in an opinion, and you'll say, that's right?",
  "But can I say that?",
  "No.",
  "Well, let's -- let me just go back because I think -- I'm trying to get focused the question, I think, others are asking. And one way to focus it is the same question I asked Mr. Clement. Think of 2(B), the first sentence. All right? Now, I can think -- I'm not saying they are right -- but, if that means you're going to hold an individual longer than you would have otherwise, I can think of some arguments that it is preempted and some replies. So keep that out of it. Suppose that we were to say, that sentence, as we understand it, does not raise a constitutional problem as long as it is interpreted to mean that the policeman, irrespective of what answer he gets from ICE, cannot detain the person for longer than he would have done in the absence of this provision. Now, in your view, is there any preemption exemption -- argument against -- any preemption argument against that sentence as I have just interpreted it? I don't know what your answer is, and that's why I'm asking.",
  "And if so, what?",
  "Look, in the Federal statute, it says in 1373 that nobody can prohibit or restrict any government entity from making this inquiry of the Federal government. And then it says that the Federal government has -- any agency -- and then it says the Federal government has an obligation to respond. Now, assuming the statute were limited, as I say, so nothing happened to this individual, nothing happened to the person who's stopped that wouldn't have happened anyway, all that happens is the person -- the policeman makes a phone call. Now, that's what I'm trying to get at. If that were the situation, and we said it had to be the situation, then what in the Federal statute would that conflict with, where we have two provisions that say any policeman can call?",
  "What's the -- that's - - that's where I'm trying to push you.",
  "Because, in my mind, I'm not clear what your answer is to that.",
  "Couldn't you just say if - - would we have the power to say, looking at Sosa and the principles that narrow considerably the subject matter of this statute, to add a requirement that if the State Department says that it interferes with foreign relations it doesn't fall within the statute, can't bring it?",
  "That would get rid of this problem, wouldn't it?",
  "It would be the same thing. By the way, did we sign the torture treaty?",
  "We've signed the torture treaty.",
  "The torture treaty does provide for -- for what is it called, universal jurisdiction?",
  "All right. So, if in fact a corporation in the United States, in cahoots with the Government or something, should do the unusual thing of violating the torture treaty, Tasmania or any country in the world that signed the torture treaty would have jurisdiction under that treaty to proceed, is that right?",
  "So the situation that we're talking about already is in existence.",
  "Well, that's -- no, the torture treaty says nothing about corporations.",
  "Well, it doesn't mean that. It doesn't mean that, but if the -- what is the question we're asking. If, when the statute was passed, it applied to pirates, the question to me is who are today's pirates. And if Hitler isn't a pirate, who is? And if, in fact, an equivalent torturer or dictator who wants to destroy an entire race in his own country is not the equivalent of today's pirate, who is? And we have treaties that say there is universal jurisdiction. Other countries take it.",
  "We took it in Filartiga. We took it in the cases that Justice Ginsburg mentioned. So I absolutely grant you could make the distinction, but, given the purpose and an objective of the statute, why should we make it?",
  "Well, we did explicitly in the torture treaty in respect to that particular incident.",
  "They do that, don't they, with torture? I mean, isn't that -- it's criminal, not civil, quite right. Does that make it better?",
  "Okay. You're right about that. What about the Bradford? Isn't there -- all this stuff about -- you know what I'm talking about.",
  "Because?",
  "He could have, but if you read it, it looks as if there was -- what he's upset about -- or what Britain was upset about was an American.",
  "Yes. Go ahead.",
  "Suppose everything is the same except for - -",
  "If in the -- in fact in Filartiga it was done through a corporation -- the torture -- now?",
  "Torture is done by hiring Torture, Inc. Okay? Is there or isn't there?",
  "You heard the question. I need an answer to that specific -- that specific hypothetical. Everything is the same except the torture is carried out by Torture, Inc. Because my actual question is about aiding and abetting. I mean, the first part is they do it directly. Can they bring Filartiga or not -- in your view?",
  "Okay. But if it's aiding and abetting?",
  "Yes. So it turns on that. And what I really want to know is what is the difference between that? Is it like the criminal law difference of accessory versus principle or what?",
  "What about the -- I thought there was a -- a kind of caveat in one of these cases, maybe Stewart, that said take a thing that looks just like a boat, the Queen Mary, but if it is permanently - - they use the word \"indefinite.\" I think they mean \"permanently.\"",
  "But if it is permanently moored to the shore and is never going to sea again, then it isn't a vessel.",
  "Then if the Polynesian boat is permanently in the museum, there's a lot of objective evidence of that, it would not be a vessel. But if it's something they really could well take out on the sea, then it is, is that right?",
  "That doesn't come up here. That concerns the Queen Mary being sent to Long Beach and used as a hotel.",
  "This cup. What about the cup?",
  "Oh, well, this is lighter than you think.",
  "I -- I got stopped here, back at Stewart. \"Practically capable of maritime transport.\" Now, those are words I thought you have to interpret with some degree of common sense, and the reason for that is because each of us can of course imagine all kinds of things, from Styrofoam sofas to - - to just dozens of absurd things that have nothing to do with ships or vessels and really could be used theoretically to carry something on the water. So what we think of is that practical capability means that there must -- this must really have as a function, as one of its functions -- I'd like to say purpose, but some people apparently don't like that - -",
  "-- because it - it has some other implication that I don't understand. Okay. So call it the function or the capacity, and it really does as a significant matter of carrying things, and not just accoutrements like nails in its walls, but -- but things from place to place to some significant degree, okay? So I've just taken the words of the test and through voice -- and trying to focus your mind, I've said you have to do that really as a - - it has to be some significant degree there, which this one doesn't seem to have, all right? So you see what I'm trying to do, and really it's a way of getting you to respond to that.",
  "But it wasn't carrying things.",
  "Well, that's true. And of course a Styrofoam sofa is -- is carrying the holes, or it's carrying the -- you know, the -- the coffee can or something that is on top. But when you have a thing that carries itself, that isn't good enough.",
  "It has to be something to do with transporting a thing, transporting some stuff.",
  "That's what part of the house.",
  "All right. Think of what it's doing and compare that with the dredge that every day the workmen get on, they go into the middle of Boston Harbor, and then they start to work, and they dredge. And so you'd say, well, I see one of the purposes of this boat is to carry those people out there. Now think of this one. This one is carrying things, but that which it carries is just what is part of a normal house which has nothing to do with transporting things on water.",
  "Okay. How do you then distinguish -- I see where you're -- you're just saying my distinction is not going to work, and so then I'd ask you to say what one you want to come up with that will get rid of all the absurd examples that are lurking in the back of my mind, which I will avoid -- and yet include - -",
  "The floating sofa? The floating sofa? Somebody is retired, he likes to see it float around in the water, and you know, and it carries a cushion. I mean, really that's absurd. So -- so how do you distinguish -- I gave you an absurd example. I don't need to think of more.",
  "Well - -",
  "That's where - that's exactly -- I mean, I think that works pretty well; and you think that works pretty well, but I don't agree with you at the moment hypothetically. So something's wrong somewhere. And what I'm thinking is that you could have very odd things, you know, like an advertising sign, floating advertising sign and tow it around. Is that floating advertising sign a vessel? No, it doesn't carry goods but it does carry, say, the eyes on the figure which might move around; and then it does -- and Justice Kennedy said carrying goods. All right. Does this structure, this houseboat have a function of carrying goods? You're tempted to say yes, because his personal effects are in it. I'm attempted to say no, because there is nothing special about those personal effects that isn't exactly similar to their being in a similar structure on land. That's where I am wondering if there is a distinction. That's -- do you see what I -- what's bothering me?",
  "No, it's nothing - -",
  "Is there any problem here, which I think maybe the Coast Guard and the other people who are responsible for vessels, say once we start thinking that everything in the house is a vessel -- I overstate -- we're going to have an impossible time doing our job. I mean, you know, you are going to see some kind of a log next to a beach somewhere and somebody's going to start calling it a vessel. We've got to limit this somehow to things that really are used as vessels.",
  "Is that a problem, and if so, how would you deal with it?",
  "You don't have to read it that way, do you? I mean, look, it says in (a), it says, let's take an employee who is affected adversely, and then it says \"alleges that the basis for the action was discrimination,\" okay. In that case the board shall within 120 days decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action. So they decided it. They decided it was out of time. They decided it was barred. They decided da, da, da. I mean, there are a lot of decisions on an issue that a person raises in court and we don't normally say they didn't decide the issue, the court. It decided it. It decided it was untimely.",
  "Oh, well, I see. The issue. They shall decide the issue of discrimination. I mean, you can read it as saying they have to decide the merits or you could read it as saying, there could be several claims that went on below. Heard them, decide the discrimination one. Now, you decide the discrimination one. And I agree they used the word \"issue\" instead of saying decide the discrimination claim, that it says here, he alleges. They could have said, decide the allegation. They could have said, decide that part of the case. But, I mean, why do we want to jump over 14 hurdles to give this narrow interpretation to that word issue when all that's going to happen is we'll have a new jurisprudence arising. Is the dismissal on the ground that it was an allegation of discrimination, that it wasn't enough to really make out discrimination? It was partial summary judgment. It was a dismissal on the basis of the statement in the complaint. It was -- I mean, we can think of 40 different things, perhaps, that are going to be hard to distinguish as to whether they're procedural, jurisdictional or on the merits. And why do we want to get courts into that, when the simplest thing is the person says, I allege discrimination. There it is right in paragraph 1(b) of his paper. The MSPB says, you lose for any reason on that particular one, and now we go to the district court. That's just so simple.",
  "Oh, no, no. All we're doing is interpreting what you've said is the word issue, not to be quite so technical as to mean decide on the merits, which it doesn't mean normally, but we're interpreting it to mean decide the allegation that he has raised that he was discriminated against.",
  "Is there anything you want to say on the question of which is worse? That is to say, I get your point on the word \"issue,\" and I think you can read the word \"issue\" to say there is a contested point as to whether there was discrimination or to say there is a contested point between the parties as to whether the MSPB -- whether the plaintiff has a -- has a legal right before the MSPB to get the lower -- the agency reversed on the issue of discrimination. The latter way favors your opponent, the former favors you; okay. So we could do either, I guess. The one way, if you win, there will be a body of law about what counts as procedural and what doesn't. That sounds confusing to me. If you lose, I quite agree with you that there will then be different courts deciding different procedural matters, where you'd get more uniformity out of the Federal Circuit. Okay. Do you have anything to say about which of those two evils is worse? Is there any reason --",
  "Have we any way of knowing?",
  "-- going back to the language, and so far, in my hypothetical anyway, I think the language at best might be read, that word \"issue,\" the way you say, but need not be.",
  "So why do you care? I mean, you're in the Northern District of Illinois, you bring a case under this Act. I guess you lost because you wanted to appeal. And so -- so what is the big deal? Appeal to the Seventh Circuit. Who cares. Why do you care which circuit you go to? You said you think -- well, why do you care?",
  "I guess you and the Government could have stipulated, we agree it goes to the Seventh Circuit, and nobody would have opposed you on that.",
  "This case is about you want to go to -- you want to go the Federal Circuit, they want you to go to the Seventh Circuit?",
  "Okay.",
  "Not in tort. This seems an awful lot like a tort, or tell me why it isn't. I mean, what you are saying is there's a statute that says you can't print more than the last five digits of a card or the date, the expiration date, and they did both and you want to say \"or\" means one or the other, it doesn't mean and/or. That's what the case is about fundamentally, right?",
  "Yes, can you do and/or or or. All right, got it. Now, if you print -- in your view of it, they printed too much about a person's credit card.",
  "It sounds like an -- sort of like an invasion of privacy, which is normally a tort.",
  "What do you mean? You can sue for -- in other words, if the statute were to say, if Smith, a Government employee, assaults a person, he gets damages. Federal statute. Now he brings a claim -- I don't know this law; I'm asking, I'm not arguing. The plaintiff sues the United States for assault. And you're saying that they can bring that in the Court of Claims because it's a statute. I don't know how this law works. I just read that and I know the language doesn't totally tell you. It's about liquid, illiquid. I didn't get that part exactly. But as I've understood it, you can't bring a tort suit in the Court of Claims. Now, that's what I would like you to elaborate, because this sounds rather like a tort suit, not sort of. That's why I am asking.",
  "Even if it says you may not assault someone.",
  "And the case I should look at to show that is what? That's all right if you don't have it.",
  "Well, I mean, the -- a lot of these provisions are technical, like the one I think is fairly technical, the one you are talking about, the Government -- it provides for treble damages -- treble damages, does it?",
  "Minimum damage, punitive damages, a fairly lengthy statute of limitations compared to the court of claims.",
  "2 years. And they have 6 in the other?",
  "My -- my impression was there are several differences. And normally, these things you, at least arguably, are not appropriate against the Government, because the Government when it knows the law will follow it, we hope. And, therefore, you don't need brow-beating mechanisms to make sure they follow it once it's clarified. So, therefore, it -- I mean, I can imagine arguments. At the same time, there are differences between the relief scheme in this statute and the normal one you have in the Court of Claims. And they're arguing that that means that they didn't want this Tucker Act and these other things to apply. I just want to know what your reply is to that. They are different.",
  "Right. So is -- are you also saying, FCRA, the underlying statute, clearly waives sovereign immunity, so we don't have to worry about whether the standard is a weak standard or a tough standard, doesn't matter. We win anyway.",
  "So what you want us to say is, okay. We will apply the tough standard. There's still -- there's still -- sovereign immunity is waived in FCRA. And since sovereign immunity is clearly waived there, then you can bring this under the Tucker Act, and the only differences are the remedial schemes are slightly different, but that doesn't matter. Am I correctly stating what you are now telling us?",
  "Well, why can't they just do what we used to do? Many district judges do this and -- because there sometimes thousands of petitions of different kinds. A lot go to the staff attorneys that look them over and flag the arguments, and you put at the end, just to be on the safe side: Any other arguments that are made are rejected. All right. Now, that serves one purpose. A human being has a hard time writing that unless he's thinking: I've looked this over pretty carefully. And if it's a staff attorney preparing a draft, the staff attorney doesn't want to -- doesn't want to write those words unless he or she has really looked with some care. And so it serves a purpose. It means they don't do it just as a form. They could turn it into a form, but they shouldn't. And so if -- let them write that, and therefore if we get nothing then you put into play these presumptions, et cetera.",
  "Well, anything. Judges can not do their job. But -- but when you write something like the word \"denied,\" which is all most district judges write in respect to many motions, they read the motion, they think about it, that's their job. So -- so, similarly, a staff attorney or a judge who is going to have to write certain words will want to do his job or her job, and they will do it. So I'm just suggesting that it won't -- that isn't a big deal. Now, this case, they didn't write that for some reason. Many do.",
  "No.",
  "-- Can we go back a minute, please, to Justice Kennedy's question about page 104(a). I read the court of appeals' opinion. Most of it, about six or eight pages, recites the facts. Then they discuss the law. The legal discussion is on page 104(a). It's approximately 30 lines long. More than half of it concerns Federal law. I mean, they don't just cite that Federal case. They say, \"In assessing whether a juror is impartial for Federal constitutional purposes -- Federal constitutional purposes -- the United States Supreme Court has said,\" da, da, da, then they quote it all. Now, since your argument, the argument in the -- in this brief here is entirely Sixth Amendment, as far as I can tell, they say, look, look what happened here, they took this man off the jury. That violates my rights to Sixth Amendment right. It says it over and over and over. I have no doubt you raised it. And now they give an answer. And the answer that they give consists of 30 lines, and 16 of the lines consist of Federal law. So -- so what's the problem?",
  "The remaining 14 lines do consist of state law too; but, I mean, how can we say they didn't consider the Federal issue?",
  "No, they didn't quote -- Nesler doesn't. What they did in Nesler is quote a Federal case. And what they do here is not just say Nesler, they quote the Federal case.",
  "Well, maybe it doesn't. Maybe they didn't properly -- maybe they didn't properly state what Federal law is. Everybody has some concerns about that one. But what I don't see is how when they spend 14 out of 27 lines quoting a Federal case which they believe sets the standard for impartiality and partiality you can say that they didn't discuss the Federal issue.",
  "For Constitutional purposes. And this guy was kicked off the jury because they thought he was not impartial.",
  "Well, then your claim over in the Ninth Circuit is not that they didn't consider it, but that, rather, they considered it, but no reasonable juror could reach -- no reasonable jurist could reach the conclusion that they reached on the issue. That argument is open to you. The only thing I don't understand is how you're saying -- or everybody -- I must be wrong, because everybody seems to be saying it -- that they didn't reach the Federal issue when they spent 14 lines discussing it, rightly or wrongly.",
  "Which happens to be the issue in this case.",
  "No. Now, what the court says about that argument, what the court of appeals says, is that the argument of your client not only misstates the evidence -- that's their -- not you, but they're criticizing -- and then he says, \"It ignores the trial court's explanation that it was discharging Juror No. 6 because he had shown himself to be biased.\" So this court of appeals thinks the issue is whether he had shown sufficient bias. You think the answer to that is clearly no. The Government thinks it's yes. And I can understand the differences of opinion, but I'm back to my question. It seems to me in 14 lines they do address the Federal constitutional question of bias. And that's -- that's -- maybe it wasn't the right issue, et cetera, but -- or maybe they didn't decide it correctly. But you see what's bothering me. And so I've listened to the answer. Do you want to add anything?",
  "That was one of the things. Then they go through in those four pages about six other -- they called -- he gave one story to the judge, Juror No. 6. Then the prosecution calls about eight other jurors, and they come up with quite a different story about what he was telling them in the jury room and -- that I'm not going to convict him. Well, he didn't quite say that; he was talking about Vietnam and talking about the slaves, and you don't want to convict a person for -- make him return the slave. I mean, they talked about a lot of things. And he went through all that, and then concludes he was biased. And your point was he wasn't biased. He was going to decide it fairly. Okay, I'm listening.",
  "Which ones? Because I counted eleven cases which either say, state, some seem to hold or support the proposition that when it's temporary with a flood it's a trespass, and where it's permanent it's a taking. Okay? I mean, I have eleven. And so I've got from my law clerk. And then I tried to see, well, what are the ones that say the opposite? And so far we've come up with zero. All right? You could argue that there were three cases during the war which might be read that way, though they don't quite mention it. All right? So which of the cases that you -- rather than list my eleven, I'm more interested in what you think, and so I'd like to know which are the ones you think support -- with something like a flood, which it's not -- you're not physically taking hold of the whole thing. You're sending something in that comes back. Which of the ones support you that temporary is not a trespass, temporary is a taking?",
  "Dickinson -- I got written down Dickinson.",
  "Kimball Laundry. Kimball Laundry was the -- laundry facilities.",
  "They took the laundry facilities for 3 years, but there what they did is they went in and they took this building, you know, took the whole thing.",
  "The problem with a flood is you don't take all the land. You send some stuff in. And the stuff is there for a while, and then it comes back, and -- it's called water. And so I don't know what to make of the cases like Kimball Laundry where you actually appropriate the property. I suspect that they are not quite the same. Anything else? I got Dickinson. I've got Kimball Laundry.",
  "Yes, Causby.",
  "Yes, but in Causby, what they did -- there was a question about whether just flying some airplanes over is a taking or a trespass. But it went on for 25 years, so it was a long time. And, therefore, the permanency of it I don't think is at issue there.",
  "But what do you suggest - - what do you suggest -- I looked at the consent.",
  "To tell you the truth, I think it's permanent. I think they're thinking it's intermittent, but permanently intermittent.",
  "The flood comes like three months a year every year. And the erosion, they say that part that's eroded belongs to the Government now. And if he comes back with his dirt and puts it in, that's fine, but he's trespassing on Government land. So if I'm right in reading that, if I'm right -- and a big if -- it seems that eleven cases somewhat stand for this, I agree, somewhat arbitrary rule. Now -- so I'm tempted, if I'm right, to say, okay, it's not perfect, but let's go with it. There are people all over the country who have probably relied on this stuff. And that would be so absent a better rule. So what do you suggest would be a better, clearer rule for compensating for flooding where our problem is what's a trespass and what's a taking?",
  "You know, but I want to know what your idea -- I understand the difficulties are there - -",
  "-- and I'm willing to accept a lot you mentioned.",
  "But what I'm asking -- which I just did ask -- is what's your idea of a substitute that would be better?",
  "So a Department of the Interior employee trespasses on Jones's land, trampling paths, and even limbs fall off trees. That's a taking and not a trespass?",
  "Because?",
  "So our department employee trying to find a shortcut drives his bulldozer through Jones's land knocking down his favorite redwood, it's a taking?",
  "What is the legal rubric? I mean what you're -- what I haven't thought of until you've been putting it this way is that the Government builds a dam. When it does it, water backs up behind the dam, and that water might flood somebody's land. That's a taking, if it's at least permanent, and so forth. Okay. Now, the Government builds a dam, all that happens. Because the Government builds a dam, a lot of other things happen. They release water sometimes. They make electricity sometimes. Different animals come in. All kinds of things can happen to different people 200 yards down. Some will be 200 miles down, 200 -- you know. Some will be helpful, some will be hurtful. Can they never bring a lawsuit? Can they sometimes recover? How do we look at that?",
  "Well, then, suppose what the Government said is, Mr. Smith, you live 150 miles from here, and we have a rule, and our rule is you can't cut down any of your trees, and you can't farm the land, and you can't even walk on it without a boat. All right, that would be at least a regulatory taking.",
  "So why -- now, they're doing exactly the same thing here, but, instead of a regulation, they send some water in to do it. So should we analyze it as a regulatory taking?",
  "Well, but that's the issue.",
  "But building a Government project, let's say an electricity plant or high tension wires, you could require the taking of some land to build it. Now, you've got that and you begin to run it. You could run it in such a way that it takes some of the property. I mean, the electricity could, for example, because of some odd thing run around over somebody's land and kill all the chickens. That wasn't expected but it happened, and it happened because of the way the Government runs the plant. Now, I guess there would be a taking in such circumstance if in fact, because of the way it's run, it makes that land which no one thought would happen, as a consequence of the project uninhabitable; wouldn't there be?",
  "The collateral consequence is to make some piece of land 4 miles away quite unexpectedly, but totally uninhabitable. Now, what's supposed to happen there? That's not just a trespass because it's permanent. And even if it's once every 2 years, it's permanently once every 2 years.",
  "What does it say?",
  "Yes, but they made this - -",
  "Yes.",
  "All right. So -- well, that's the part -- that's the point. The reason they don't compensate there is it apparently had something to do with everybody suffering the cinders. But where the cinders went out of the train and they ended up on just one person's property because there were some pipes or something, then it was a taking.",
  "Well, here they're focusing it on his land.",
  "What if the -- it might be unusual, but you can't try a person who's not competent. You can't try him.",
  "So what about -- and now, he's been tried, and he's been convicted and been appealed and gone through the procedures. But some case could arise where, in habeas, they made like a prima facie showing or a -- convinced the judge that there really is a very good chance here, or maybe even I think it's probable that the basic trial was unfair, to the point where it's like not having a trial. What about in that situation, if it ever arises? I mean, should we leave the door open just for that possibility?",
  "I have that. That's why I put in the possibility that, on the basis of what's presented to me, the judge, I think I have so much without this defendant's testimony here suggesting it was unfair, that maybe the presumption should shift back. I'm -- that's what's worrying me in the back of my mind, that there could be such a case. There have been in history.",
  "Which he can't do, if he's not competent.",
  "Why? I mean -- sorry. I didn't mean to say it in that particular tone.",
  "But, I mean, trial judges run their trials. You know, that's what they're hired for. And once we make it clear, it shouldn't go on forever. And -- and why can't we trust them to do their job?",
  "You mean it shouldn't be indefinite. The object of this is you're trying to give -- like you would with any witness who's not around at the moment, you're trying to produce a hearing that will reach a result with this witness. And if you think, after a reasonable period of time, that witness will recover and be available, fine. And if there is no hope of that, forget it. I mean -- you know, something like that.",
  "Why would we, in this kind of case, as opposed to, say, some other case, where a witness is missing and it's crucial? The district court does have authority to grant stays. And we haven't said, but no longer than a year. Why do we say, but if they do it in a reasonable time? If they abuse their discretion, there is mandamus, or there are other ways of controlling the discretion. Why are we suddenly here, in this case, imposing a fixed number of days? I mean, the reason, of course, that the Psychological Association says 6 months to 9 months is they have different studies. In some places, it's 6 months; in some places, it's 9 months. And -- and so why are we picking a number out of a hat here, when we don't elsewhere?",
  "It should, but it should be something like reasonable or -- or don't abuse your discretion or -- I mean, at the moment, I'm just not seeing why this is different than 10,000 other kinds of instances where we set that kind of limit, rather than days.",
  "If you are going to the - - to the merits, I want to know whether you want us to - - or are asking us to overrule Grutter. Grutter said it would be good law for at least 25 years. And I know that time flies, but I think only nine of those years have passed.",
  "And so, are you? And, if so, why overrule a case into which so much thought and effort went and so many people across the country have depended on?",
  "So your question is whether -- your point is does your case satisfy Grutter? Is that what you're arguing?",
  "Well, how do you want to argue it right now in the next ten minutes? I'm interested because I have a very short time to get my question out, and I need to know how you are going to argue it.",
  "I agree it might, but I want to get to the question, so, what I'm trying to pinpoint, because we have such a limited time, and to me, the one thing I want to pinpoint, since you're arguing on that this satisfies Grutter, if properly understood, as you say that. In looking up, we have a two-court rule. And two courts have found, it seems to me, that here, there is a certain thing -- there is no quota. It is individualized. It is time limited. It was adopted after the consideration of race-neutral means. Each applicant receives individual consideration, and race did not become the predominant factor. So I take those as a given. And then I want to know what precisely it is that Grutter required in your opinion that makes this different from Grutter, in that it was not satisfied here? The ones I listed, two courts say are the same. So maybe there's some others.",
  "But we have a rule that if two courts say it, we're very reluctant, on something connected with facts, to overturn it, so -- so that's why I mention that.",
  "Okay.",
  "Now, but the test is -- the test is, in your opinion -- I have to write this in the opinion, let's say -- the proper test of critical mass is, is the minority isolated, unable to speak out. That's the test. And that wasn't in Grutter or was in Grutter? And in your opinion, it was in Grutter?",
  "Isolated. And the reason it was satisfied there and not here is?",
  "Or they could -- this is what is underlying my thing here. I want to get you directly to answer it. I did look up the figures. And before Hopwood and the 10 percent plan, it looked on the African American side, that it averaged about 5 - - 5 percent per year, really, pretty steadily. Then after Hopwood and 10 percent, it went down a little bit, not a lot, but it went down to about 3 and a half percent -- 4 percent, maybe. And then they introduced Grutter, and it's back up to 5 percent.",
  "Okay. Now, is that a lot? Is that a little? There are several thousand admissions officers in the United States, several thousand universities, and what is it we're going to say here that wasn't already said in Grutter, that isn't going to take hundreds or thousands of these people and have Federal judges dictating the policy of admission of all these universities? You see why I'm looking for some certainty?",
  "I saw what happened, you saw the numbers. Sorry. Go ahead.",
  "You can answer it later, if you want, or not answer it at all, if you don't.",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "Can I ask you to get -- if this is easy, do it; if not, don't. I wanted to use accurate numbers, and so I discovered -- I wanted to find out how many universities actually used a Grutter-type process last year or the year before, etcetera. And one of your amici, the admissions officers, according to our library, is the only place that has that information, though it's public, and I didn't want them to do it because they are an amici of yours. And you are both here, both sides, so if you can agree on -- simply, roughly -- what that number is, I would like to know it; otherwise, I will -- I can use pre-Grutter numbers which are public and available.",
  "All right, so. But it is the correct answer to Justice Alito's -- if there are ever two applicants where the GPA, the test -- the grades, the SA1, SA2, leadership, activities, awards, work experience, community service, family's economic status, school's socioeconomic status, family's responsibility, single-parent home, languages other than English spoken at home, and SAT score relative to school's average race, if you had a situation where those -- all those things were absolutely identical, than the person would be admitted on the bounds of race.",
  "So what you want me to do is go read back what we wrote in Grutter, go look what the underlying determinations of critical mass were there, go look exactly how it is being done in Texas - - which I have charts that help me see that -- and I will then find enough of a difference that I can write some words that can be administered by 2,000 or 3,000 -- a thousand Federal judges as they try to deal with programs like this, in -- that's the point, is that right?",
  "I -- I see that. There's something I really don't understand in these cases because the other cases, our precedent's been around a long time, so I would have guessed that, under that precedent in these other statutes, the obvious thing to do -- the obvious puzzle here is not the Federal statute, it's the State statute, what is this thing he was convicted of about? So you'd pick up the phone, and you'd phone, at random, four U.S. attorneys -- not U.S. attorneys, but four State attorneys - -",
  "-- who work with the statute in Georgia, and say, now, look, the indictment here says possession with intent to distribute, and I can show from the documents that it's a tiny amount. Now, is it your policy, if he was selling it, to charge under the sell? Is it your policy if he's not selling it to charge under intent to distribute? Is it totally random whether you say sell or intent to distribute? What's your policy? Okay? Then we get some answers. Then we'd have an idea whether what you're saying is right. Now, you could do that, but they could do it, too. Anyone could do it. And then we'd have some actual facts about whether this charge -- really, it corresponds to the misdemeanor or the felony in the Federal statute. So why -- I'm not -- I mean, that isn't a brain -- that isn't -- doesn't require -- it's not rocket science, okay? So why has no one done it?",
  "You don't have to say, \"never.\" The question is what kind of a statute is this State statute?",
  "And the kind of statute that it is, is a statute that is used to prosecute people - -",
  "-- with small amounts when they don't sell.",
  "If your version of what that felon intends to distribute - -",
  "The distinction there is really picked up by the district attorneys. And if it's not, then they may be right, because -- because then intent to distribute may well often include, as it does under Federal law, people who sell stuff.",
  "Okay. Okay. You didn't. In any words, nobody did it. So my other question - -",
  "-- which is the only other one I really have, aside from making that suggestion. But here, what happened to this person?",
  "He was -- was he sentenced under 16-13-2(a)? That is, was he sentenced to probation? Which would be evidence in your favor, I think.",
  "But was he, or wasn't he?",
  "All right. If he was, what it says in this provision is that the Court may without entering a judgment of guilt. So there was no judgment of guilt.",
  "And it says, if he completes it, he then is discharged without court adjudication of guilt.",
  "And -- and shall not be deemed a conviction, it says for purposes of this code.",
  "Well, why are we saying he was convicted of anything?",
  "But it's the word \"punishable,\" I think.",
  "So you're thinking, under Georgia law, this is punishable as a felony only if it wasn't a small amount used for personal use, you see, and therefore, they go into the hearing. It's not punishable as an 841 felony, unless those two things are absent, and therefore, they have the hearing to find out. And the word \"punishable\" doesn't appear in the statutes, the other ones that we've construed. That's what I thought they were doing.",
  "Well, here is -- I assume that it is an injury for an American speaking in America to have his communication intercepted against his will by the American government. We take that as a harm; is that right?",
  "Okay. So the question is how likely is that to occur?",
  "All right. Fine. That's why I say certainly -- it might not be a storm tomorrow. I mean, you know, nothing is certain. But I see it's some degree of what you say -- some people say certainly, some people say likelihood, etc. So put that to the side. What I want to know is, we have the declaration of Mr. Scott McKay. Now, Mr. Scott McKay says he's represented two of the people who are allegedly part of al Qaeda and committed crimes, and he has represented them for some time. One was in Guantanamo. Another is charged with various crimes and is subject to many, many civil suits. In the course of that, he has to phone and has phoned lots of people in Saudi Arabia, in the various Arab states, and in the past the U.S. intercepted some 10,000 telephone calls and 20,000 e-mail communications involving his client. So isn't it a fair inference, almost pretty certain, maybe about as much as the storm, that if the security agencies are doing their job, they will, in fact, intercept further communications involving this particular individual, the two that he's representing?",
  "And why doesn't that meet the test?",
  "But why can't we get an answer to that question? I mean, I see your point. I'm interrupting because I -- I see where you're going. And it seems to me that, at least, if held in camera, I can't imagine what security it would violate, whether the government were to say, if necessary privately to a judge, would say, no, we do not intend to use this new authority for this purpose.",
  "Or it could say the contrary. And so couldn't we find out whether he has standing there without jeopardizing any concern of national security?",
  "Well, there is if, in fact, the government is going to use this statute to continue to do some of the 10,000 or 20,000 - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, you think it's speculation. The government has a statute that says you can wiretap in the United States organized crime when life is at stake and you show it to a judge. Then they say, that isn't good enough. We pass a new statute, and it says, suppression of organized crime, wiretap when you want, without a judge. Now, a lawyer who represents organized crime says, my clients have been wiretapped under the first statute 400,000 times. Now, I'll tell you, when the government gets ahold of this second statute, it's going to be a million times, because they want to suppress organized crime. I'm not saying my clients are guilty, but we all know. Okay. So. Now, the question, which I haven't thought of before, you are saying no standing, no standing, can't raise it - -",
  "No, you can't. You can't do that here. So -- so what I'm thinking is, he seems to be separate from other people. He seems very likely to have a concrete injury. If they -- if they aren't wiretapping the people who are described here, who are they wiretapping? And they passed this statute in order to have extra authority. So put those three things together, and they seem to spell mother, perhaps, you know.",
  "I think the -- which I think is difficult, because it makes this case somewhat unique, so that what you're worried about most is the definition of foreign intelligence information, which defines it to include information with respect to a foreign power or foreign territory that relates to the conduct of foreign affairs. It's very general.",
  "And then, the Attorney General can, if he decides there are exigent circumstances, wiretap for a year, anyway, without going to any court, something that isn't true of the ordinary wiretapping. Now, you say, look, if there is any special group that's going to apply to, that is the group that they wiretapped 10,000 times when they didn't even have that authority. And the government is saying, maybe, maybe not. And there, we have an argument. Is there a way of resolving it? That is, is it open to the government, if you prevail, and we say, you know, they have this extra broad authority, there is no way to check it through a court, it does cause harm, these are the most likely people to be harmed and there is very good reason, whatever words we use there, to think it will be used for them, that the government - - is there some way the government could say, in camera even, no, we are not doing it? Here are our procedures. We are not going to show them to anybody but you, judge. I mean, is there a way for the government to show that you're wrong - -",
  "-- and that we're wrong when we think you're right?",
  "What?",
  "That's on that branch of your argument, which makes me more nervous than the other branch. The other branch, they might say something like: We're supposed to minimize risks of catching in surveillance Americans and this is what we do. And they show that and they say: We go to the FISA court. Except in these very rare instances where there are emergencies, da, da, da. And I guess by that point they might be able to reduce the risks to this kind of plaintiff to where it's the same as virtually anybody else or they might be -- be showing it's constitutional. That's where I - - that's why I ask the question. I'm not certain of where I am going.",
  "But you don't have to say -- you can say both, either it was manufactured directly and received an American copyright and satisfied all the conditions, or, if that wasn't the case, it was manufactured in a way that satisfied the conditions of the American statute, even though, for technical reasons, it didn't apply.",
  "That's what your argument is, I take it.",
  "So we are off on a kind of curly cue here.",
  "I take it that the reason they wrote -- or changed the statute was just because they were worried about bailees or lessees or somebody under the old statutes not satisfying the first -- they were worried about that -- somebody -- a printer lawfully obtains a book, and he shouldn't have advantage of the First Sale Doctrine.",
  "He's in the middle of printing it. And therefore you have to change the language. So they changed the language to \"lawfully made under this title.\"",
  "Am I right; or, if I am wrong, why did they change it?",
  "I couldn't find a word. I could not find a word of that in the legislative history. Irwin Karp, who was the strongest representative for the publishers, said you couldn't do that ten years earlier. So is there - -",
  "No, but you just said yes in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question. So she'll find exactly what there is there, so I would like to know what it is.",
  "You don't need that.",
  "Your -- 602(a) has plenty of meaning. I mean, an American copyright holder licenses a British company to publish the work under British copyright law. 602(a) says he can't import the books into the United States, period.",
  "Now, the only -- so there's plenty of meaning there. The question is what happens when he sells it to his bookstore and you or I go in and buy it and we want to give a copy to our wife when we get back to the United States. The question is, did - - is that unlawful?",
  "No, no exception I take it once I bring back five copies and I give one to my son.",
  "Oh, fair use.",
  "The reason -- what I was trying to bring up and I didn't do it artfully - -",
  "-- is, imagine Toyota, all right? Millions sold in the United States. They have copyrighted sound systems. They have copyrighted GPS systems. When people buy them in America, they think they're going to be able to resell them. Now, under your reading -- now, this is one of their horribles, I gather, and I want to know your answer to it. Under their reading, the millions of Americans who buy Toyotas could not resell them without getting the permission of the copyright holder of every item in that car which is copyrighted.",
  "Is that right?",
  "Am I right or am I wrong? Am I off base or am I wrong -- am I right?",
  "Well, how do you distinguish? How do you distinguish?",
  "Now, explain to me, because there are horribles if I summarize them, millions and millions of dollars' worth of items with copyrighted indications of some kind in them that we import every year; libraries with three hundred million books bought from foreign publishers that they might sell, resell, or use; museums that buy Picassos that now, under our last case, receive American protection as soon as that Picasso comes to the United States, and they can't display it without getting permission from the five heirs who are disputing ownership of the Picasso copyrights. Those are some of the horribles that they sketch. And if I am looking for the bear in the mouse hole, I look at those horribles, and there I see that bear. So I'm asking you to spend some time telling me why I'm wrong.",
  "But we need to - -",
  "But what about litigation in this respect? I want to bring you back to the horribles.",
  "The main point is that horribles haven't occurred. Right?",
  "Sometimes horribles don't occur because no one can believe it. Now, for example, I believe there is going to be a storm, but it hasn't started yet. So I would like to know -- I would like to know, if you were the lawyer for the Toyota distributor, and if you were the lawyer for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, or you are the lawyer for a university library, and your client comes to you and says, my God, I just read the Supreme Court opinion. It says that we can't start selling these old books or -- or lending them or putting them in our word processor or reselling the Toyota without the -- without looking -- displaying the Picasso without the permission of the copyright holder, who may or may not be Toyota itself. What, as their lawyer, do you tell them? Do you tell them, hey, no problem; or, do you tell them, you might become a law violator; or, do you tell them, I better litigate this? What do you tell them?",
  "Well, the word has grounding. It is Coke upon Littleton, 1628, where it says that if a man be possessed of a chattel and give or sell his whole interest upon a condition, that condition is no good. And Coke says, and that's how it should be. And now that's picked up in Bobbs-Merrill; it's picked up in Dr. Miles. It's been the law. Now if, in fact, there are two ways of interpreting the statute, and one is consistent with that basic principle of commercial law, and the other produces some of the complexities that you have just mentioned, isn't it better to go with the common law and simply reaffirm a principle that's been in the commercial law almost forever?",
  "That's true, but if you're looking at expectation of a reasonable homeowner, imagine you have a home, a long driveway. You do expect people to come up and come into the house, knock on the door, maybe even with dogs. Do you expect them to sit there for 5 to 15 minutes, 15 minutes, not knocking on the door, doing nothing? I mean - -",
  "-- is that something I wouldn't -- would you be nervous about that?",
  "Anyone coming to your door and not knocking.",
  "Just sniffing.",
  "No, there is in this sense. Justice Scalia just said it. He said, you do have an expectation of people coming into your door, perhaps even with animals, perhaps even with binoculars, but not looking into the house, not looking into the house from the front step with the binoculars. Now, why is that unconstitutional? Because it's very unusual that someone would do that, and a homeowner would resent it.",
  "Would a homeowner resent someone coming with a large animal sitting in front of the front step on his property and sitting there sniffing for 5 to 15 minutes? Forget the sniffing. Just talking, loud noises. Is that something that you invite people to do?",
  "Ah. Is that what happened here?",
  "I thought what happened here was 5 to 15 minutes.",
  "Yes, but I -- what I'm curious about, and it's an unanswered question for me, is we are considering whether the dog sniff is permissible, so I wanted to know what a dog sniff at the front door involves. And at page 96, 97, 98 of the joint appendix, with which you are familiar, it explains that. It isn't just going up and (indicating); that's it. It's a process called bracketing. They describe it at length. The officer, the dog officer, said he was in a rush that day and it didn't take more than 5 to 10 minutes. And my question really is whether an ordinary homeowner expects people to walk down the curtilage and, with a big animal, and the animal -- they don't knock. They behave in the page 96, 97, 98 way. I subjectively think, well, that's pretty unusual behavior, whether it's a policeman or anybody else. So what do you respond?",
  "It was 5 to 10 minutes and it's 96-97.",
  "You're assuming the conclusion in these things. I mean, I thought since Katz the rule has been whether the homeowner has a reasonable expectation of privacy in -- which is infringed or violated or interfered with when the government acts. So it's a question of does he have that reasonable expectation. So now we're back to exactly where we were. Your opponents say, no, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy - -",
  "-- to protect a person with a dog coming up to the door and going (indicating), all right? Now, your response to that is what?",
  "And then the question was, as Justice Alito put it, why? He says, we go back to the 17th century, as far as you want, and there is no law that says there is any kind of expectation in a homeowner that a person won't walk up to the dog -- to the door with a dog on a leash and sniff, which, as he says -- which your opponents say is what happened here. And your response to that is?",
  "I'll look at this later, but I'm rather surprised. My understanding of the case law was the Chief Justice's, and I thought what you're supposed to look at is the behavior of the individual, the police officer, who comes to the door or looks into the house, not his subjective motive. Now, as we just heard, you said, and with support here, that Jones changed that, but I don't know what in Jones changed that. Jones was the case where the police did in fact go to a person's car and physically put something in it. That's -- something that tracked. That's behavior.",
  "So what is it in Jones that said what we're supposed to look at is not behavior, but the subjective intent of the officer?",
  "I mean, it may be a search. I see that.",
  "Not a police officer. If we start -- policemen have to know how to behave. And in this area, they can behave the same way as other people can behave, and we expect them to behave, even though their motive differs. They're always trying to find crime. That's what I thought the law was. I've been trying to figure out just what you say, but in a slightly different form. Do people come up to the door with dogs? Yes. Do the dogs breathe? Yes. Do in fact policemen, like other people, come up and breathe? Yes. Do we expect it? Yes, we expect people to come up and breathe. But do we expect them to do what happened here? And at that point, I get into the question: What happened here? And I'd be interested in your view on that.",
  "I didn't think they disagreed about what he may do; I thought they disagreed about what he must do. That is, the Florida Supreme Court said you must, da, da, da, da, da, and gave a whole list. I thought that's what the case was about.",
  "That's a totally different matter. Of course, I agree with you that a trial judge has control of the trial. He's likely to know what's relevant. In different circumstances, different matters will be, and he has first say on what you're going to go into. It's the must. And now you're on the point. Why is that the right list? I mean, what in the Constitution requires that list?",
  "Didn't the Supreme Court believe the Constitution required it?",
  "What is the actual difference? I mean, you have two officers or three. If they go into the property and somebody's there, they can detain him, and Summers gives three reasons: One, as Justice Kagan pointed out, preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found. We are considering now the case where, instead of going and detaining the people, the people inside the house walk out and there are two officers in a patrol car or an unmarked car outside waiting to go in. Okay. That seems to me identical, as you said. The last one is facilitating orderly completion of the search. That seems to me identical. You want the person there so that he can open a drawer, so he can unlock a closet, et cetera, okay. Identical. The third one, where there is the only place for difference, it seems to me, is minimizing the risk of harm to the officers. Now, the harm, risk of harm to the officers I guess if he goes into the house is that, well, if they leave, they might come back, goodness knows, and they've seen they are looking for the drugs, da, da, da. Or maybe they will rush out, or maybe there will be a -- well, any, goodness knows what. Now here I can see a slight difference, but maybe not. I don't know. Maybe they will come back. Maybe they noticed the people in the car outside. Maybe they didn't. Certainly the policemen don't know. And they might go in quicker, and then the others will be alerted. I mean, when you talk generally about a risk of harm to the police, it seems to me pretty close, if not identical.",
  "So what am I missing?",
  "You already said the first one's identical. I don't see how the third one could change, and what about the second?",
  "How do you know that? They are sitting outside in the car.",
  "It's not just that. It's that they might want to get in quicker to stop this person from leaving because he's the one who knows where the drugs are. At least that's what they think. Or they start to shout, and alert the others. Or -- I mean, I have never conducted such a search, you know, so I don't know the risks involved there, but I can see the possibilities. And probably you might have conducted them, but I don't know. So how am I supposed to answer this question?",
  "But that's the problem.",
  "That's the problem. The police have to know what they're supposed to do when they go in to search a house, all right? And they know that sometimes they can keep the people there, and you are saying, but they can't stop them from leaving if they're not -- all of a sudden, I'm a policeman, and I don't know what to do exactly because I don't know how to fill in that blank. And therefore, I might rush in -- I don't know -- I see a recipe for a mess, and that's what -- and the mess could involve physical harm, and - -",
  "They can't stop them from leaving if, blank.",
  "But is it in the process? Does Summers apply and does this apply only when the police are in the process of executing a valid search warrant?",
  "If -- if the police executing the valid search warrant walked through the gate and at that moment the individual emerging from the house had not yet passed through the gate, then under Summers the police would have the right to detain him. All right. So the question here is he's walked through the gate. All right. Now, I guess the police -- all right, I see. The police objection is: I don't know. These things are complicated and we might not want to push him back. I don't know what the neighborhood is like and maybe somebody will get killed. I mean, that's the kind of argument - -",
  "I know you'd say that was right.",
  "Maybe he had a key to the -- to the place where they keep the drugs, the basement or something.",
  "Is that fanciful? Is it fanciful that people who are searched open doors or - -",
  "How many had?",
  "How many had? I mean, I would have thought it was common sense that a lawyer should tell the client the terrible things that are going to happen to him if he pleads guilty, those things that the lawyer knows or should know about and the client may not. Alright. That's a very general rule at that level. But some courts have said, no, that isn't true. That isn't true unless -- if it's -- as Justice Kagan said, if it's a collateral exception, if it's a collateral consequence. How many had? Was it only Kentucky, or was it fairly widespread, this exception?",
  "Well, there aren't that many. There are eleven, and two of them are specialized.",
  "All right, so given the ABA and everything else, why doesn't that apply here?",
  "No, but I mean if the general rule is that Strickland evolves to pick up changing professional norms, and that -- you looked at 30 cases and that's what you get out of them -- and then it turns out that at the time this case began, there was such a professional norm; and all that happened in Padilla is that the Court following its general practice said apply that professional norm; then why doesn't the other side win?",
  "That, of course, is true, but the professional norm had evolved by the time of the proceeding here that they would.",
  "No, but -- in the other -- in the other, by the way, in the other 29 cases, did the court specifically say in each of those 29 cases that the basis of our decision is that the professional norm has evolved and we apply the new professional norm as of the time?",
  "Can you go back for a second to Justice Ginsburg's question? I'd like -- I just don't want you to leave without -- without answering the following: Normally a new rule that this Court announces would apply to cases on direct review.",
  "Right. In the case of inadequate assistance of counsel, without being picky, the place where that claim is best developed, in my view is first collateral, because for reasons we both understand. All right. So given the fact that by and large it is, and I think should be, developed in that way, why not treat in the case of an inadequate assistance claim the first collateral as in other claims you treat direct review?",
  "You could say that, you could say that same thing precisely about the cases on direct review which have not been completed. I mean, you could give all those arguments exactly the same. If you're worried about the time, you could have time limits on the first Federal -- the first Federal habeas or state habeas. There are time limits there. You could add to those. And the -- the -- the direct review is itself a balance. It's a balance between the surprise and need to complicate the case, and it hasn't really finished and da, da, da, versus the problem of giving a person a chance to raise this argument even for a new rule.",
  "And so all those -- those are the -- when you look at the functional factors, it looks quite similar to me and I'm trying to --",
  "Or you can take exactly what you said and phrase it the opposite way.",
  "You can say – No I know is it the purpose of the certification stage to try out every element of liability at that stage, rather than waiting for the trial?",
  "No, it's not. Good. Now, once you say that, what you have said is, you know, it could still be material for some individual, even though there is no market reliance. And similarly, a silence going (indicating), some odd set of words or whatever it is, although it's not false for almost anybody, for some particular person, it could seem -- convey something false in some particular set of circumstances. So let's try out falsity at the certification stage, too. In fact, let's try out everything because we could always think of a few examples where, despite the fact that -- you know, that it's only a common issue 99 percent of the time, we can dream up a situation where it's not a common issue.",
  "No, but you are saying with a cert -- class certification here, if there is no materiality, there is no class; and you are repeatedly faced with the question, you are absolutely right; in fact, there is no case. And so then what you say is, and indeed, I have a few instances here in which there could be a case, and I’d say, I bet if we are -- you know, professorial enough, we could dream up a hypothetical for anything, where there still is a case.",
  "This is true, but I'm -- I'm -- I'm trying to work out what, as I understand it now, Mr. Waxman's point is -- is basically this: That -- that why do we use an efficient market theory? We use it because if the market is efficient and the statement is public, then someone who bought over the market is buying in a -- in a world that reflects the false statement. I mean, that's -- so he -- there was sufficient reliance indirectly. All right. So I think his point is, yes, I can see materiality is something that's relevant to everybody. Of course, it is, a common issue in the case. But also, it is a feature of materiality that, if it wasn't material, then our theory of market reliance -- market -- efficient markets goes out the window because you can have all the efficiency in the world, all the publicity in the world, but still, where something to a reasonable stockbroker is irrelevant, his reaction is \"who cares?\" And therefore, although there could be special cases, the efficient market theory plays no role. Now, I think that's what his theory is, if I understand it. And -- and I don't hope it is, if I've got it -- I mean, I hope I got it right. But -- but if that -- so what's your direct answer to that?",
  "All right. So you're saying, in this kind of case, the -- the materiality or not is not likely to be specially sufficient -- specially significant. In fact, you are going to decide if it is a common issue, and there is no reason to import that common issue into the preliminary finding, even if what I just parroted, we hope, is true.",
  "Right. So if I've got this, your answer -- which I am trying to follow it; don't tell me I'm right if I'm not -- that, with efficiency of the market, that's not a traditional element of a tort --",
  "-- that is something special to get into this theory.",
  "The publicity of the matter, that is not traditionally a common element of the tort. That is something special to get into this theory.",
  "With materiality, it is a common element of the tort always; it is traditionally there; it will be litigated, so there is no special reason to or desirability in or need for litigating at the outset.",
  "They are preconditions -- they are preconditions, not related to the merits, that do, in fact, justify the use of a special reliance theory. Now, I've said that; of course, so is materiality.",
  "But materiality, unlike the other two, is part of the element of the basic case, where it is a common issue in this case -- and in most -- to everybody.",
  "Is that exactly right? Because I am getting the -- facing the problem a few minutes from now, somebody is going to say, well, why is that exactly right? I mean, it is a precondition.",
  "Traditionally, how did that work? How did that work traditionally? No class, okay? Joe -- Farmer Jones comes in, you have to show it's false? You have to show it's material. And then you show the reliance that he did something on that basis.",
  "So the materiality was not part of reliance. Materiality was an element that was always proved, and then you went on to show reliance.",
  "And the reason that we want to prove it upfront in the 23, rather than wait till the merits, where it will be argued anyway in exactly the same way -- the reason that we want to do it first is, since it's going to be there anyway and going to be litigated anyway, unlike publicity, unlike efficiency, but the reason we take this one and run it upfront is? And it can't be the answer we should litigate everything before we litigate anything.",
  "Okay. So -- so what's the answer?",
  "Well, I completely agree with hornbook law. Three pipe manufacturers get together and, in January, fix their prices, all right?",
  "Fourteen wholesalers want to show that, and each has different damages because they bought different amounts of pipe.",
  "Hornbook law: Certify the class and leave the damages issues for later.",
  "This case, this case, hornbook law: Section 2 forbids monopolization. It is absolutely clear Comcast has that power. That's why they're -- that's why they're regulated. And, indeed, they engage in things that show that they did not achieve that through skill, foresight, and industry. What things? And now, we have a list of four. And the district court says exactly what? If we prove monopolization, which is relevant to all these people in the class, then what we do is we later look into how much that monopolization raised the prices above competitive levels. And I offer a model to look at the competitive levels and look at what happened over here, and there we are, it will help. Okay? Now, hornbook law, whether that's so or not so is a matter for later, but see first if there is liability. Okay. That's their argument. What's the answer?",
  "Well, here, since what they are saying is they have two theories, Section 1, the agreements to keep other people out of this area are unlawful in themselves. Question 2 is whether they contribute to monopolization. Okay?",
  "Now, that's the legal issue of liability. Now, if they're right, why isn't the measure of damages just what you said? We look to the people who are subject to the monopoly power, and we work out how much above the competitive level they had to pay.",
  "Some paid some; some paid another. We have some experts in to try to make that computation. Sounds the same to me.",
  "I saw the four theories, and it seems to me that we are now on the theory of the -- one of the pieces of exclusionary conduct was agreement through various mergers, et cetera, that potential competitors would not come in and compete. Now, I don't know why the judge struck out the other one, the number 2. But number 3 and Number 4, I can see it. But on monopolization theory, that's not relevant to damages. Throughout, we assume that the regulator is doing a terrible job; otherwise, the prices wouldn't be so high in the first place. But what's the difference in this case? I just didn't hear it, and I put that to show you how it seemed to me there is very similar. The difference --",
  "Is?",
  "That's -- I mean, that's liability.",
  "You have the right to prove that they weren't, fine.",
  "And this does, too -­",
  "-- because if they prove their case, the question on damages is to what extent did the absence of competition from the overbuilders -- and it should have been DBS too, from reading this, but nonetheless, let me express no view on that.",
  "But on -- on -- to what extent did the failure of competition from those people raise price above the competitive level?",
  "And if --",
  "-- how is it different from the pipes --",
  "No, you shouldn't.",
  "The strongest argument I think for that point of view would be simply this: The Smith Company makes widgets. The plaintiff says they monopolize the widget business. That business has monopolized because they achieved the power to raise price above the competitive level through exclusionary practices. For example, United Fruit used to pour garbage on the ships of its competitors. Now, we have here a class of people who have been injured by their monopoly power -- and here they are, and you give a list. The judge says to the other side, how do you know that's the right list? Well, we know; here's how we know. We have an expert here who has used a model to pick out the right people who were injured by the monopoly power -- its exercise. And the other side says, no, that model is no good. Well, if it genuinely is no good and really worthless, then I guess you haven't shown these are the right people for the class. And I think that's what they're saying. And so the response to that is, to answer this question, do we have to go look at the model? I mean, on its face, it seems okay. I don't know. I haven't looked at the record. And --",
  "Could you talk about that a little bit, please?",
  "Did I get my analysis right?",
  "No, no. That isn't what I want to really know.",
  "I want to know -- if you think of the examples I just -- do you, as the plaintiff, when you draw up your list of class members, have to have on that list people who really were hurt by the -- or plausibly were hurt by the exercise of market power? And you have to have some way of picking them out, and you have chosen this model as a way. So I guess they could object on the ground that model is worthless. Is this analysis right? And you would have to show, no, it isn't worthless.",
  "You don't have to show that much. I think you only have to show it's a plausible model.",
  "And I guess, in a monopolization case, it is not the case that you have to trace the damages to the exclusionary conduct.",
  "In a classical class of -- Section 2 case, the damages are caused by the monopolization, which lacks skill, foresight, and industry justification. So the fact that he omitted three, but kept one has nothing to do with damages in a classical Section 2 case, is that right?",
  "But here is the difficulty that I am having, a little technical, but -- but it -- this is a regulated industry.",
  "And because it's a regulated industry, the regulator, in your view, is doing one of the worst jobs in history. They are willing to come in and overbuild and everything, so he must be letting prices -- all right. Suppose the judge or lawyer were to find, that's okay, it doesn't matter, all we're interested in is what Justice Scalia says. Then, if that were true, from looking at the footnote on this, I guess you'd take this model, and you would simply subtract or add to the base, which is supposed to be the competitively priced districts.",
  "The districts that also have satellite.",
  "And that shouldn't be tough to do, but I don't know if it's tough to do, and I don't see how we're ever going to find out.",
  "I don't know. How would you answer such a question?",
  "Is that right? Is that what Learned Hand said? Is -- is that what Alcoa holds? Is that United Fruit holds when they bomb their competitor's ship and achieve monopolization? That the only people who can get damages are the people who run the ship and were bombed --",
  "-- who bought those bananas? I didn't know that. But besides, if you're right, which I tend to doubt, but I'll look it up, if you're right --",
  "Yes, all right. Fine. I'll look that up. If you're right and as they pointed out, it's still one of the easiest things in the world to simply change the base for this model. Instead of the base being those businesses or homeowners who received their service at competitive prices, we say -- we modify it by including those who received services where DBS was involved, and that'll be a higher price, and we subtract that price from the price they paid where there was overbuilding threatened. Now, that'll be a new number. They say it was a new number. And I think anybody running a model could do that, but I promise you, I don't know. And to know whether you're right on that, or they're right, I will have to get into the model-building business, where I am not an expert.",
  "I see the problem, but I am still back to where Justice Kennedy was -- and that is my own failing here. I didn't quite understand. I thought, when you grant a dismissal and you dismiss the case in the middle of the trial because the prosecution was brought too late, all you're doing is, in the middle of the trial, granting something you should have granted in the first place before you impaneled the jury. But I thought that, in Fong Foo, Judge Wyzanski had dismissed the case after empanelment because he wrongly thought that the U.S. attorney had been talking to a witness or a juror or something at lunch time and that he had -- and that's an acquittal. And I thought Justice Harlan, for the Court, wrote Double Jeopardy, Jeopardy attached, you can't try him again. And I didn't think the Court ever overruled that. That -- what -- in where?",
  "So Scott says that even in judge-wise -- Scott says Fong Foo was wrong, that that -- because the reason that Charlie Wyzanski dismissed it is he has this idea of a -- the AUSA doing something improper at lunch. And -- and that's -- that's -- now, on your theory -- on the theory you just enunciated, there would -- there would -- Double Jeopardy wouldn't protect against the second indictment, right?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. Yes. That's - -",
  "Now -- now, I take it you -- you -- you agree that sometimes the prosecution -- I'm not saying anyone would -- but they -- the defendant's acquitted by the jury so - - because he doesn't find -- they don't find enough evidence, and so the prosecutor thinks, I think I'd like to try him again, and then he's acquitted again. I'd like to try him again, and he's acquitted again. Now, substitute judge for jury, the same thing could happen. I mean, I don't see why not. And there's no answer to that, is there? And if there's no answer to that, the same bad thing could happen. Well, then you're going to have to start distinguishing among which judge or jury acquittals do or do not invoke the problem of the Double Jeopardy Clause. And where I'm driving is that -- that there is a principle, and the principle was -- it seems the simplest way to put it, is where in fact the acquittal rests upon a judgment that there isn't enough evidence, that's it. That's what we're after. And where it's some procedural thing or not, maybe we aren't. Okay. Now, the virtue of that is it's simple, it's consistent with the cases, it's been clear. And you're advocating, let's go into that and change it or at least interpret the cases that's consistent with it. And we're saying there wasn't enough evidence, is because the judge had in mind a legal point that he was wrong about, then Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't work. But if the judge was right, it does work. Well, except for the matter of substantive evidence. Now, that way, as your opponent, lies a mess. I just went through that long thing because I don't want you to get -- sit down without addressing what I see as a central problem, namely, if we don't accept his view, it's going to be a terrible mess.",
  "Now, you're beginning to make distinctions.",
  "And once you make those distinctions, I go back to the question I asked, which was there is a distinction. The distinction is whether it's a procedural ground or -- and Justice Harlan's - - it's whether there was -- \"Just talk to the U.S. attorney, I didn't like it,\" or \"Talk to the witness,\" or \"The prosecution brought too late.\" The other side of it, where the clause attaches, is where it was done on a substantive basis, not enough evidence. I said -- I don't want to repeat myself, but I'm saying what he's coming up with is a simple, clear rule, basically consistent with the cases, and why shouldn't we follow it?",
  "Let's go through this. My basic question: Normally, a judge will wait till the jury comes in and then decide, if the jury convicts him, whether to set it aside. So there's no problem. So now, we have the judge -- for some reason or other, this judge has decided to grant the motion of acquittal in the middle of the case. Now, this is unusual, I think -- I hope. And if so, though, the judge might not think of writing down his reasons. So he might just say there isn't enough evidence. And now, it happens that, just before he did that, the defense lawyer argued to him an erroneous theory. All right. An added element or something or other, some kind of misconstruction of this. What happens then?",
  "Yes. But this a judge, after all, who for some reason -- we don't know what - - decided, instead of waiting, as they normally would do, grant it in the middle of the case.",
  "Oh, I see. So there are a lot more places - -",
  "They do. They - -",
  "And then this is a - -",
  "This has arisen a lot more than -- than I think. All right. Fine. Thank you.",
  "And in that case, do they have to write it down?",
  "So then, in other words, when an acquittal - -",
  "Can you add to that -- your -- just your idea of what the empirical situation is in the last 30 or 40 years? Have most U.S. prosecutors or prosecutors in these states thought that they could appeal an acquittal on the -- in the middle of the trial on the ground that the judge made a mistake of law?",
  "What is -- is there any - - I'm trying to find an analogous instance without the statute of limitations. And what occurred to me, just as an example, that you might have in your practice found a different one, the Thomas Crown Affair. Say that he robs the bank or the art museum, but he has an intent to return it, and he produces evidence that he had an intent to return. Now, in such a case, once he produces the evidence, does the government have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he didn't have an intent to return? Or does he -- is there any instance in which the burden of persuasion shifts? Do you see what I'm driving at?",
  "So you have never found a case -- I will ask the government this -- in the substantive criminal law, no matter what, who is -- even if the defendant is the only one ever likely to know anything about it, you've never found a case where, once the burden's produced, the -- the burden of persuasion remains on the defendant?",
  "Yes, because you agree the defendant has the burden of production here.",
  "And so I was trying to think of some instance -- as I said, I would be repeating myself -- I'm looking for any instance in which, leaving the statute of limitations out of it, the burden of persuasion shifts to the defendant. So I'm saying, did you ever find one? The Thomas Crown Affair or some other instance, and your answer is, no, you never have heard of it.",
  "Have you heard of it? So what?",
  "Well, this is not -- this does not negate the elements of the defense -- this does not negate the elements of the crime.",
  "All right. Well, then if that's so, if it's an affirmative defense and if sometimes where it doesn't negate the elements of the crime the burden of persuasion remains on the defendant, then why shouldn't it here? Because he's the one most likely to know.",
  "And how do you prove it?",
  "They often do. I just want to go back, get the complete -- insofar as you can help with this. All right. Let's take duress or self-defense. The government shows all the elements of murder. Then the defendant comes in and says, I have evidence here that it was under duress or evidence that it was self-defense. Then to prevail, what's the standard of persuasion? How does it work? Is it then that -- is it that the defendant must show more likely than not? Or is it the defend - - that I was defending myself? Or is it that the government -- how does it work? What's the rule?",
  "Yes, of course. Of course.",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "All right. Well, that's - - well, then their point is, well, this is awfully similar.",
  "The fact that there is a statute of limitations makes your case weaker, not stronger, because -- because the statute of limitations is less directly connected to the elements of the -- the offense than is self-defense or duress.",
  "This is true, but his point -- basic point -- and he has responded to the points I've made, is that, of course, if there's a five-year statute on robbery, it doesn't help the government that he create -- he committed a robbery before.",
  "All right. So he's saying what you charged in the indictment is that he was a member of a conspiracy that existed between 1995 and 2005. Now, that's the crime that concerns us, roughly. And he is saying, to prove your case, you have to show, as an element, that he was a member. Now, you did present some evidence that he was a member. And he wants to present some evidence, and has, that he wasn't a member. And he wasn't a member if he withdrew. And therefore, once he presents enough to get -- make that an issue, you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was a member. So you have to show he didn't withdraw. Now, this has nothing to do with the statute of limitations. By coincidence, it does. But a statute of limitations issue would be that you all agree that he withdrew, but the question is did it happen in 1993 or 1997? That's a statute of limitations issue, but this isn't. This is a question of whether he was a member of the conspiracy during the time period that you charged in the indictment. That's his point. So what is the response?",
  "Well, in other words, you can charge me or anybody in the audience or anybody here with what? Not charging them? You are saying there was a conspiracy? Doesn't he have to be shown to be a member of the conspiracy in order for you to get a conviction?",
  "And that's an element of the crime?",
  "There is no more relevance, is there, to the fact that there happened to be a pre-1995 conspiracy, except as a matter of proof -- I shouldn't say relevance -- that he happened to rob a bank before 1995? I mean, in each instance, there was criminal activity before 1995. Now, you can use that in order to prove that he was a member during '95 to 2000. That, I see. But he, similar, can use the matter of withdrawal to prove he wasn't a member during 1995 to 2000. And, therefore, it goes to show whether you or the government have proved an element of the offense, namely, that he was a member between '95 and 2000.",
  "I mean, I am looking at it as a puzzle here because I think you could look at it either way. I mean, if a person commits a burglary and the indictment charges that, and he says, yes, I did, I did, there is no doubt about all the elements being satisfied, but it happened outside the limitation period. That's in the statute of limitations area. But where you charge a conspiracy taking place within a period of time, as I would think you usually would -- I would think the -- those words on the paper almost always have a date in them -- then you could look at it as a question of membership in that conspiracy, the one that's charged, in which case, it's a question of the elements. And then, if you're in doubt as to whether or not the time that he withdrew was inside or outside the period, that becomes a limitations question.",
  "And then I'm -- I'm sort of -- I'm torn here. I actually can see it either way.",
  "No, that isn't true. You have to prove membership.",
  "And it happens, in this instance, that you bring in a prima facie case. I'd be repeating myself. And that he says withdrawal, and withdrawal is designed to negate membership.",
  "But then the withdrawal prior to the time charged negates membership in the conspiracy that you have charged because there was no membership during that time.",
  "Well, I suspect I agree. If -- it's awfully tough to turn this on the presence or absence of particular dates in the indictment, but the -- the thing that motivates me -- I mean, I can see it's like a rabbit-duck. You know, is it a rabbit, or is it a duck? And -- and the -- the -- the thing that is so rare in the law - -",
  "Yet it's so rare, that the government doesn't have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt, that it suggests, when in doubt, say reasonable doubt. But -- so what do you want? I mean, we've thought of duress. We've thought of self-defense.",
  "Insanity.",
  "Anything else?",
  "Nothing to do with statute of limitations.",
  "Your -- I'm sorry. The Thomas Crown Affair again, all the evidence shows he took $10,000 from the bank. He testifies and says, oh, I was going to give it back, okay? The prosecution puts on nothing. The jury says, are you kidding?",
  "Okay.",
  "I mean, my problem with this is I don't -- I mean, I read the whole statute, and they have a good claim until I think you read the whole statute. And I don't know what to say, other than the impression -- the impression is that subsection 3, which is what's at issue, the whole thing is meant to say that the winner, when it's the plaintiff, is going to get attorney's fees. You know, it mentions costs, but that's the background rule. And then when you get to the second sentence of that, it means, and if you're in bad faith, the plaintiff, then the defendant gets attorney's fees. It doesn't really mention costs. That's the background rule. So -- and I look at the legislative history, there's some staffer, at least, who's tried to find that interesting; the -- they're talking about what the point of this is, and say the whole point of this section is to help prevent frivolous suits. Well, so there we are. That's -- that's where I am at this moment.",
  "I didn't say, on some technical linguistic basis, it may do that, that's correct. But perhaps I'm unique in this, but I don't just look at the language, I look at the context, I look at the purpose, and -- and I don't see anything in the language that gets rid of the background rule, and I don't see anything in the purpose that gets rid of the background rule, and I don't see anything in the history that gets rid of the background rule.",
  "I don't see anything in the consequences that suggests that you get rid of the background rule. I don't see anything in our traditions that says you should get rid of the background rule. So what -- what do you do with some obstreperous judge who doesn't just look at the language? I mean, I know who uses it, but that's not the only thing.",
  "Oh, why? A person who is a drafter says -- you know, you get your costs and you also get the attorney's fees. They don't -- they don't know every statute, the people who draft this. They -- they -- they just say, Senator, what are we trying to do? He says, we're trying to give them attorney's fees. They say, okay, we'll give them the costs and the attorney's fees.",
  "And that's if you had been drafting it, perhaps. But the people who actually draft these things are a whole section over in Congress, they don't know every statute, and you give them a general instruction.",
  "And the -- the general instruction would be add attorney's fees on the plaintiffs and add attorney -- Alright. You understand the point.",
  "Yes, ignorance of other laws.",
  "That's right, general ignorance.",
  "Well, then they shouldn't have put those words in. But we're talking about the next sentence. And the next sentence doesn't put the words in. So you're -- you're -- you're assuming from that fact that, in a pro defendant -- this is a pro-defendant provision they put in, that was their whole point apparently reading it -- that what they decided to do is take away from defendant's costs, which they normally get, without saying anything about it. I mean, that's -- you understand the problem.",
  "It doesn't -- where does it say that? Where was the --",
  "-- I would like to read it.",
  "Did you look up -- did you try to do any sampling on that? Because I did, actually, and -- and I discovered something that I think is not as strong for you, but it isn't too much against you. We just did a random sample of 28 successful cases, and I think the average recovery -- except for one outlier, where it was very high, -it was around $4,000 -- 3 to 4, and the average costs on the ones that the defendants won, I guess, was around a thousand. So you have a point --",
  "But it isn't quite as good a point, as you seem to suggest. That is, it's a not so low value and the costs are not so high --",
  "-- in order to make it.",
  "Suppose you're right. What about their policy argument here, that you're a -- you're a potential plaintiff, you've borrowed a lot of money, you don't have a lot of money, and the deal is this, under your interpretation, if you win, you're going to get 2 or $3,000; if you lose, it will cost you about a thousand. That's -- that's under your interpretation.",
  "And under theirs, it's if you win, you get 2 or $3,000, and if you lose, at least you don't lose anything.",
  "Oh, it could be worse.",
  "Now, what about the -- how does this work, the canon? I'm very interested.",
  "I'm very interested in canons, and I want to know on the canon, the traditional thing, which you've probably looked up, what about the specific governs the general? Is it -- how is that -- that's an old canon that's been around a long time, and people are aware of it. And that's --",
  "This is -- it seems to be the one they feel is very important.",
  "Yes. Well, that's what I'm interested in.",
  "Well, that -- that's a different matter.",
  "So she says if I -- if I tease -- if you tease your sister, I'm going to give you -- give her your allowance and her allowance, that that doesn't mean that the sister loses her allowance if you don't tease her. I mean, there are a lot of instances --",
  "-- where you put the \"and\" in and it doesn't mean that that's the exclusive place for giving it. Sometimes, it does; sometimes, it doesn't. That's her point.",
  "Well, I doubt that it does. I'm sorry. I mean, they're human beings over there; they're not necessarily all --",
  "You're right, that's the standard. And so you said that -- I mean, I feel perhaps more calmly about this than I might feel is warranted, but the -- the question is, is there anything here that you -- so you said, by definition, we're going to produce some new shoes, which new shoes are not -- do not have the appearance of any current and/or previous footwear product designs and any colorable imitations thereof. So I would like you to refer me to the record where your president of your client or somebody else says, we are intending to produce some new shoes that fall outside that definition, and of course, I will look at that, because your opponent says we can find no reasonable likelihood that they are going to produce anything or they have any present intent of showing -- of producing something that falls outside that definition. But now, you just said, oh, no, we're definitely going to. So just refer me to those pages in the record that shows that because, of course, you win, if that's true.",
  "Yes, but that isn't the point. The point is, is the new footwear that you're designing footwear that is not -- does not have the appearance of any current or previous footwear product designs or any colorable imitation thereof? And so to say you are in the business of producing new footwear, at least, to me, suggests nothing because the question is what the footwear looks like, not that you're producing new footwear.",
  "No, I'm not interested in the real world. I am interested in the record.",
  "And does it show anything at all in respect that would support the claim that you are going to produce new footwear that doesn't either resemble, nor is a colorable imitation of anything that you have previously produced or is the subject of the case?",
  "Period?",
  "Okay. So I take it that this case really boils down to should you have -- should they have or you both have another chance to say what the new footwear will be -- look like under a new standard, or is there enough here already to say, well, really, the judges could conclude that there is no real likelihood that you're going to produce something that won't look like what's already been produced.",
  "But that look -- I mean, maybe you could suggest to me that I -- that we should change what the law has been or not follow it here, but where I'm taking the law from is Friends of the Earth.",
  "And in Friends of the Earth, it says a defendant -- namely Nike -- claiming its voluntary compliance moots a case, and what they're claiming is that this -- a covenant moots the case, moots the case, the covenant they gave, there's the formidable burden -- you know, it's formidable, you're quite right -- of showing it is absolutely clear, correct, that the allegedly wrongful behavior, namely, their suing, but their suing in respect to this kind of shoe, could not reasonably be expected to recur. And they say, since we promised in an enforceable promise not to repeat this behavior ever -- 100 years, how could it be expected reasonably to recur? How could our behavior, namely suing for infringement in respect to a shoe like this, be reasonably expected to recur, given our covenant? And your response to that is?",
  "What is it -- I would like to know. I mean, I assume you ask them, do you have any current or future plan to produce a shoe that would violate our mark --",
  "-- or that might -- which does not look at all like the present -- your present shoe, and isn't even colorably like your present shoe, do you have a plan to do such a thing, are you in the process, is it likely? And they say, no, it's not likely. That's the end of it. They're just as if they manufactured cell phones.",
  "But if they were to say -- you know, we make new shoes all the time.",
  "And this is some kind of thing we might well consider, and we have people working on it; and they are considering whether to do it or not, it's well in the works -- they win. Okay? What did they say?",
  "What they say is that they changed this at the rate of a mile a minute -- you know, they have -- they have stuff they put out, and we have the YUMS and the Sweet -- whatever it is and the Jelly Bean and so forth, and we keep changing it. And so I don't know. I mean, it doesn't seem clear, one way or the other. If it is -- if I come to that conclusion, is it the case -- I thought perhaps, in looking at this, that the line I quoted -- remember, which puts a lot of burden on you, from Friends of the Earth -- is not quoted in the district court, not quoted in the Court of Appeals, so perhaps the thing -- I think the SG wants something like it.",
  "So you say, okay, this is the standard; it's tough for Nike to show this. You seem to have conducted this case without that standard quite in mind. It's tough for Nike, but they can do it -- you know, depending on the facts, and you have these protective orders, da, da, da, so send it back, use the right standard, and give Nike a chance and give them a chance, and that way, we --",
  "What about that? I would like to know what the answer to that question is here.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Well, that's your opinion, that you will win on remand. Okay.",
  "I would ask Nike, I suppose, Nike could say -- you know, I read the page 73 and you changed things at the rate of mile a minute, and we looked at YUMS and Jelly Bean, and they're sort of like our shoe, but we didn't think enough, but you did think enough, and are some of these changes that could happen at a mile a minute -- is there any reason to think -- you know, that they won't look really colorably even like what you just did, but nonetheless, is a pretty good point that they might infringe our -- our present trademark.",
  "That's a long question, I don't know if I'll get a good answer.",
  "I see that. But I thought your response to Justice Kennedy was a different one. I liked it because it was that -- the concern that Nike can go and find out the competitor's plans is true, but it exists whenever a -- a -- a manufacturer brings a trademark infringement case because that manufacturer has to show he is now making the product; or, if not, he intends to. And if it's a question of intends to, then the defendant can go and look and see if that's true.",
  "And your response, I took it, to that was there are procedures that deal with that. They're called protective orders and so forth. Is that -- have I got that right with your argument?",
  "That's what your argument is, yes.",
  "Okay. So, look, how are you hurt then? Because suppose he wins here. Now, you, if you have the president of the company say, hey, I'm going to do an exact copy, go bring a -- go bring a cancellation action. If you can't quite say that -- you know, you can start one -- you can't quite say that, but he says something sort of vague about it that's close, go to the PTO. And if he can't say anything like that at all, well, then, maybe you should lose. I mean, that's -- that's -- what's the practical problem with that?",
  "Well, what about the other? The next line that they give is they give to the hospital authority the power to acquire and operate projects and the power to form and operate one or more networks of hospitals, physicians, and other healthcare providers. Now, as I read that, it certainly includes the rather specific power of acquiring a hospital. And having read that -- not -- not just something you might see in General Motors' charter.",
  "And -- and those -- that's the language of the -- of the grant of power. Now, I want to know what you want us to do because, in my mind, reading this, it's a statute that provides for regulation -- price regulation of hospitals. And you say -- and I have no doubt you thought of one way in which that could be -- I can think of 100 -- that you could have prices that are different from those set by a free market. So I have no doubt that this sets -- I start there. Now, what is it -- I go back to Justice Scalia's original question: What is it you want us to say? Even though this -- this statute is immune, does grant immunity from attack on a basis of cost and price regulation, it is not immune in respect to mergers, okay?",
  "I can, unfortunately, think of about 50 examples, where a merger might be anticompetitive, and yet, it would lead to lower prices. And the Department of Justice might attack it, but this statute -- and that's what's bothering me -- seems to want to further that kind of thing.",
  "That -- that's where I am, and I -- I'm not at all decided.",
  "Yes, I think I know that.",
  "You are not understanding my question, I guess. You have to take as a given that, even though what you say is true, I would find that this statute clearly prohibits the application of the antitrust laws to pricing decisions. That's the job of the authority. Now, if I start with that, then you will say, okay, I have to decide against you. Or you might say, even so, I win because mergers are different. Now, that -- that's what I'm trying to get you to say.",
  "I want to ask you: Why are they different?",
  "After all, we have, one, the specific language I read; and, two, I can think of examples where a merger would be anticompetitive under the DOJ and your FTC rules --",
  "-- and yet, probably would further the purposes of the statute by lowering the cost.",
  "Do you think that's the null set? I -- I don't think that's --",
  "What does the words mean, \"to form and operate one or more major networks of hospitals\"?",
  "Which follow -- which follow the words \"to acquire and operate projects, defined to include hospitals.\" So -- so what about those words? Why aren't they good enough?",
  "I'm looking at Section 30 -- well, where are we? 31-7-75(3).",
  "And this falls within the words \"to acquire and operate projects\"?",
  "And --",
  "And can't -- in other words, the -- the two hospitals in the town, when they say, the price here -- you shall see that the price is not higher than 38 cents, whatever, and would you please get together and be certain that you have similar terms and you have similar agreements and similar prices there, we don't want either of you to be higher, that -- you would then proceed against them for that?",
  "And would you also do the same if -- if the electricity regulator in any State or telephone -- a local telephone regulator --",
  "-- or gas pipeline regulator -- what they did is the same thing; they said, our prices are -- you're to file tariffs, and the tariffs are to be reached after you go meet in committee; and that -- that would also fall within the antitrust laws?",
  "How is that?",
  "Well, the language is awfully similar to what you find in public utility statutes, to set reasonable rates, to be certain that nobody is higher than a reasonable rate.",
  "Well, what does it mean to establish rates and charges for the services and use of the facilities of the authority?",
  "Your point -- I don't mean to interrupt, but the point that he's making in response to my earlier questions along these lines, I think, was the following: Where do they get their hospitals, these authorities? The -- the law sets up a hospital authority. All right. Where did they get their hospitals?",
  "Well, do you know what actually happened? Do you -- do you know, in fact, where these hospital authorities got their hospitals from?",
  "No, not all of them, but -- I now am in a county, and suddenly, I'm the mayor, and I see this law, and it says we can set up a hospital authority. So Joe, I say, you are -- you are the boss, you are the hospital authority guy. And he says -- you are to run the hospital. And he says, what hospital? We don't have a hospital.",
  "So I want to know where did they get their hospitals?",
  "I don't need to know all of them. I just want some rough idea where do they come from.",
  "You may not know.",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay. I've got it. I've got it. Then --",
  "Then he says this: I --",
  "He says, I have been thinking of it the wrong way. I have been thinking of it like the California State Public Utilities Commission. They regulate all the electricity producers. That isn't this.",
  "These were a group of people that ran some hospitals -- some municipal hospitals, and now, they can acquire, not just general -- I agree with you, it isn't just general. They have a lot of power there to acquire other hospitals from outside the system. But, when they do that, there's no reason to think that that gives them the power to acquire it, where it's anticompetitive.",
  "Now, the fact that you can regulate your own hospitals, which is one track and one group, doesn't say that you have to bring in anticompetitive people -- I mean, you have to bring in others, where they're anticompetitive. That -- that, I think, is his point.",
  "Don't think of it as one thing; think of it as two separate systems.",
  "No, no. I know that. But once you don't -- once you don't -- he says, you see, they don't regulate prices at non-authority hospitals, they don't do this for non-authority, they don't do that for non-authority, even though they might have the power to bring them in; but, when they have the power to bring them in, why read this -- it's at least ambiguous -- why read this as saying you can bring them in, where it's anticompetitive to do so?",
  "And they -- they say on that, that it's a sham. Well, just say 30 seconds on their argument, that the FTC looked into it, these people had never regulated anything, they'd never looked at any price anywhere, they've never done a single thing, it's a sham; and therefore, that's the end of it. What about that?",
  "Have you --",
  "Well, you've looked this up. And apparently, for about a dozen years, the EEOC has had, as -- as an alternative basis for qualifying as a supervisor, the individual has authority to direct the employee's daily work activities. And in addition, we have three circuits that for some period of years have been following roughly the same kind of rule. Now, has this problem of the country music or the other problems raised, have they turned out to be a significant problem in those circuits or for the EEOC?",
  "They have, or they have not?",
  "But I guess they'd tell you. There are three who signed the brief, or four. And I guess they'd tell you, wouldn't they --",
  "-- what the problems are, if they have problems.",
  "I mean, we can ask the other side the same question. They've seen the cases in the circuits. Have they seen instances in the EEOC or before the circuits where it's turned out to be a serious problem, like the country music or any of the other hypotheticals raised?",
  "Well, is there any? You said he went through, you weren't preceding on the -- your client, originally in district court, not preceding on the basis of this straight Seventh Circuit test. He had the EEOC look into it; the Government itself says that we should affirm and they have EEOC lawyers on it. And so is there any piece of information that would be relevant that you know of that you would introduce, were it sent back, say to the district court, that you have not already introduced?",
  "I read what they said in the last page of their brief. They said either affirm, that was their first thing, or send it back. Okay. Now my question remains the same.",
  "Is there --",
  "What is it?",
  "So if I were -- if I were Joe Smith, and a plan -- the plan pays me 100 -- I have medical expenses of $100,000. And, actually, the –- the -- there was a driver who caused this problem. And later, I collect 100,000, but I have to pay 50,000 to get the 100,000. So I am left with 50,000 net because I had to pay my lawyers, I had to pay expert witnesses, there were a lot of different things I had to pay. I'm left with 50,000 now. So in comes the plan and says, we want 100,000. I say, what? Then I look at the language. The language allows them to get back expenses which were recovered from the third-party. I didn't recover 100,000 from the third-party. I recovered 50,000 from the third-party because it cost me 50 to get the 100. Now, if I were a judge and listening to that, I'd say, assuming they wanted a reasonable interpretation of this language, it sounds pretty reasonable to me.",
  "It's a little tough, since nobody had the plan.",
  "All right. But, I mean, wouldn't the normal result of such a case, like any contract case, where you have language, even if it was the word \"any,\" it doesn't mean wheat grown on Mars, okay? And so you'd say -- if it says you can recover anything, that \"any expense,\" it means, yes, you can recover that which was paid, but not money that you had to pay to get the amount paid.",
  "But this is a plan that they wrote and that US Air --",
  "All right. So I can --",
  "What is the issue of law? The issue of law is what happens if we have a plan which says, Joe Smith, my employee, if you have to spend $90,000 to get back 92,000, you have to give us back all 92, even though you only have 2 in pocket. And we are supposed to assume that's what the contract said. Is that right? And then -- and then we say, now, can you override that with the principle of equity? Is that the issue you see before us?",
  "But that's my exact question. I think, now, what we're being asked to decide is, from your point of view, does the common fund doctrine apply? I take it the common fund doctrine says, if this victim here got some money back from the person who caused the accident, that that money goes into a common fund, in the sense that those who share in the fund must share as well in the cost of producing the fund. So if it costs 50,000 to produce 100,000, which is in the fund, that we have to have US Air, as well, pay part of the cost of producing the fund. That sounds very fair. But I hear the argument, fair though it is, we have here an agreement, and in this agreement, it says, it's as if it said, and you shall not apply the common fund doctrine or any other equitable doctrine, such as he who seeks equity must do equity, etc. And I think that's the question that's being asked. And so what is your response to that? In particular, why do you say the common fund doctrine applies, though the contract says it doesn't, we assume, but all these other equitable doctrines don't apply?",
  "Good. So now, we have 18th century authority which says that, in the 18th century, Lord Cooke or someone said that the common fund doctrine applies, but the other doctrines don't. And the -- and the name and citation to that authority is?",
  "Why -- why is it so unfair? I've been putting it in a way that looks unfair, which favors your side. But US Air or the equivalent says, now, here is the deal, we'll pay your medical expenses. And now, if somebody causes those expenses, you come to us, and we decide whether we want to sue and get our expenses back, and any extra money, we give to you, and we pay our attorneys' fees extra. They don't count against the fund. And if our lawyers tell us it isn't worth it, you're free to sue; but, I'll tell you what, your lawyer is going to be at the end of the queue. We're first, then comes your lawyer, and anything left over goes to you. Now, if you can find a lawyer that takes it on those conditions, good for you. But he might because he might think he's going to get -- but our lawyers have already told us it's not going to work, so that's the situation. Now, what's -- I'm not -- I think US Air's point would be, well, what's unfair about that? That's -- that makes sure we get our money back. That's what we want to do. And you're free to sue; it's just your lawyer who's going to come at the end of the queue, okay? What's -- why is that unfair?",
  "Enter best case -- what is your best case? I'd love to find it. There's a case that says something like this.",
  "Well -- well, let me tell you what I'm thinking of. The -- there is a contract, all written down. They forgot to put a seal on it. They forgot to put a seal on it. So I guess it's now 1463 or some year like that. So they go into equity. And now, they are in equity. And the plaintiff says, judge, I want you to enforce this contract. He says, I'm a judge in equity. He says, I know, but we've agreed, and you enforce it in equity. The contract says, give Smith all the wheat. And equity says -- you know, there are other people who would like some of this wheat, too, so we are not going to follow the contract. We are going to modify the contract according to equitable principles, which, as you say, they can do. And the other side says, no, they wouldn't. They'd follow the contract. They are just in equity because they forgot the seal. Okay. What is your best case to show they did, indeed, modify it with the common fund doctrine or some other doctrine? I want to be sure to read it with a magnifying glass.",
  "I know, but I didn't ask you about what they found. I was asking what you found.",
  "Suppose the expense weren't to pay the lawyer. Suppose, in order to get the 100,000, you had, for example, to build a model car to demonstrate to the manufacturer what caused the injury, and it cost you 98,000 to do it. And they pay you You're saying that -- it wouldn't be unjust to say the 100,000 has to go to -- back to pay US Air?",
  "I want to go back to Justice Alito's question for a moment because I thought -- and Justice Scalia. I thought, in your brief, you -- you said that their point's a good point. Their point is that the system works in a way that requires the lawyer to object at the trial. Alright. And that is an efficiency because the trial judge has to -- has to correct -- he has to -- has an opportunity to correct mistakes. He can't be sandbagged. But, you said, that's theoretically always true, but, in your case, as a practical matter, it's really never true because no lawyer is ever going to think, oh, I would object, but I'm not going to object because maybe the law will become clarified by the Supreme Court, and I'll be able to get a plain error thing on appeal. The lawyer who thought that is like the unicorn, he doesn't really exist. Okay. And you then said, on the other hand, there’s an efficiency on the other side. The efficiency on the other side is if you don't take your rule, when you get to the court of appeals, you're going to have to decide in real cases whether the law was so clear that the plain error doctrine still does apply at the trial level before. Either it was clear that the judge was wrong, or it was clear the judge was right, and there is no point to objecting. So now we have to decide, was he clearly wrong, was he clearly right, or was it a middle case. And when you get to real legal cases that have tough issues, you discover that that's a hard question to ask -- answer case by case, court by court. Now, didn't you say all that?",
  "Okay. Well, then why didn't I hear you say it again.",
  "So you can -- if you lose, you can't get through the door. If you win, you then have to go on to the next part of it, which says, did the error affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. So if all that's at stake is a resentencing, not much harm is done, and you're more likely to satisfy the fourth.",
  "If what's at stake is a whole new trial and everything, it's probably a little bit harder to satisfy that prong. So it's possible to build what Justice Kennedy was referring to into the present rule, isn't it?",
  "Well, what about the -- I mean, that's the question. The word \"plain\" of course refers by and large to an error that the lower court judge should have caught, so you should have objected. But why limit it exclusively to that; that is, you have -- you know, they quote the Schooner, Peggy and Chief Justice Marshall and back to the history of Hammurabi, as far as we know, that sometimes there is a case where just simple fairness, plus the fact that the law is now plain, means that the appellate court should treat this person the same as a thousand others who now will be treated according to the new law. And indeed, you're complicating it even further for the reason that I really meant my question to be aimed at you -- you know. I mean, in fact, the reason that I said that you're going to create distinctions, there will be a case, the fellow is going to go to jail for 50 extra years, the law is plain that he shouldn't, that didn't come about until the appeal. And here we have six identical people in the circuit where the law was clear one way and they get the new rule's advantage, and six identical people in another circuit where the law was clear the other way and they get the advantage. But in the one circuit where the law wasn't clear, he doesn't get the advantage of the new rule. Now, that seems pretty unfair, and I could at least make up some cases where it's just a horror. And if that's so, why don't we leave plain with enough wiggle room so that where it's fair, the judge on the Court of Appeals can say, it is now plain and the other things are satisfied so we apply it to the defendant. That's the whole long question that I've got every part of it in there.",
  "Whoa, whoa.",
  "Here, that's -- it's the second part. I mean, I think you'd have a stronger argument were it not for Johnson. But Johnson is saying, look, if you're in a circuit where the law turns out to be absolutely clearly wrong, then you don't have to make an objection. And then what we do is we consider whether the matter was clear at the time of appeal. Now, once I see that, it's like both bookends. You don't have to make the objection, and the only time you do is when the law is unclear; and, that being so, we're going to have everybody doing research about how clear the law is one way or the other, which is going to be tough. But, more importantly, it seems to me what's happening is that 52 is being also used in part to isolate those Peggy Schooner type cases where it is just basically unfair not to apply new law. And in the words of Justice Marshall, he says that should apply, and sometimes it's unfair not to apply it on the appeal. And -- and so I don't see how you explain Johnson on your theory.",
  "Yes, but the -- the – well, this -- I mean, the trouble is you've run into, like, four different interpretations of what Johnson really means. And mine, which is, perhaps, no better or worse than the competing ones, is -- is you go back to the Schooner Peggy, and you see the Chief Justice, and he says, in a case the law has changed, the Court must decide, according to existing law, the appellate court; and, if it be necessary to set aside a judgment rightful when rendered, but which cannot be affirmed, but in violation of the law, that judgment must be set aside. So there, we seem to be -- and Johnson seemed to me to bear this out; but, sometimes, you do forgive the need to object because the overriding principle is the principle of deciding the law as it is at the time of appeal, and to do the contrary is just too unfair. Now, that -- reading Johnson that way, I'd say, well, that rule applies here too.",
  "Sometimes.",
  "No, it's not.",
  "Yes. Yes. And that's why you make a balance. And the balance goes -- brings back the first question that I put. Because, in this kind of a case where the law is unsettled, we have what we'll call the uniform or the hippogriff problem, and that's the problem of it doesn't really make that much difference to the basic policy of objecting. And on the other side, you have the administrative potential mess of having to figure out how clear was the law in the court -- the district court. Is it a circuit where you'd say the law was absolutely -- is pretty clear that they were right? Or was it a circuit where it's pretty clear that the law was the opposite, in which case we waive the need? Or is it actually mixed up and you don't know, in that circuit, in which case you're arguing, don't waive the need. So I see the unicorn on one side versus an administrative problem on the other.",
  "Then what harm does it do, in the interest of simplicity, in reading a word to mean what it says? The word is \"plain error.\" It doesn't say whether they mean plain error at the time of trial, or plain at the time of appeal. Olano says it means plain at the time of appeal. If we say that's what it means, then that's what it means always. And what harm will that do, given the fact -- but, still, there's a plenty of a good reason, and appellate judges know their job, not to send things back, where it's some technical matter, where he's trying to sandbag the judge, where, in fact -- now we have all the Rule 4, the fourth prong consideration.",
  "The words mean what they say.",
  "Well, if you agree, then --",
  "That is Mr. Dreeben's excellent argument. And then Olano -- rather, Johnson says the contrary.",
  "All right. But this, I take it, is a statutory case, not a constitutional case. That is, do you have any constitutional objection if Congress had said, in 216(b), that Joe Smith and other people similarly situated to Miss Laura Symczyk have a genuine dispute with the employer, and the way they file their case is Miss Symczyk's case will be deemed to be their case as well, though it ceases to be their case, unless they confirm within 60 days of such-and-such, in writing, that it is their case. If Congress passed that statute, there couldn't be a constitutional objection to it, could there?",
  "No, no, no. Do you see what I'm driving at? In other words, if Congress had explicitly said, in 216(b), that the Third Circuit's procedure is the correct procedure for Mr. Joe Smith to bring his case in such circumstances, if they had said that explicitly, is there a constitutional objection? If so, what could it be?",
  "Oh, we know at least, since we are doing -- I looked up a little bit, but Article III is what was a case or controversy in Westminster in 1788 or 1750 or whenever, that in Westminster, in a court of equity, I found at least two instances. A person dies, there is no case with that person, but it remained in equity on the docket until the other person, the -- the estate, came in. A woman could not bring a case if she was married. She starts as a single person. She gets married. Lo and behold, the case remains on the docket until her husband comes in. That's not a happy example, but nonetheless, it's in point.",
  "Now, I could find nothing the other way, so I thought of the canon of interpretation that equity deems to have been done what ought to have been done -- or something like that. Others on the Court will know -- but the -- the point is that there are instances --",
  "What? Yes. It remained on the docket in the Westminster courts, even though there was no plaintiff. So I would ask you again: Is there any counterexample? Is there any instance from equity or elsewhere, where there is a constitutional objection, had they said it, at which point our question is have they said it?",
  "No, no. It's Mr. Joe Smith, if he confirms it in writing.",
  "Well, you're interpreting -- I think it's true that we're interpreting the statute, and -- and I'm trying to look at what document are we interpreting? Is there a different rule or a different -- what -- what rule? So I could come back to the statute. And Congress could deprive -- could provide exactly the system that you suggest. I don't see anything unconstitutional about it. But isn't it a little hard to read this statute as providing that mechanism, since what it says is no party shall -- no -- you know, it says what it says in the last two sentences. How do we read that to foresee the mechanism that you're talking about?",
  "Well, he says the difference in the class action context is, in the class action context, you can consider them there, but there isn't a specific sentence somewhere in a statute, which says, no one shall be a party unless he signs in writing.",
  "Well, why? Why?",
  "Because that's -- why? Why, is my question?",
  "How does that differ from an employee who says that he is annoyed for a variety of reasons at the employer, and he sues the employer for his pay -- for his pay for the month of October. The employer says, He got his pay, I -- I sent him the check, I mean, he gets it every month. And he says, yes, but I didn't cash the check. Is there a case for controversy? He can go sue for his paycheck that he didn't cash?",
  "Okay. So why is it any different when the -- the defendant -- employer says, here's the check.",
  "And he says, oh, I didn't cash it.",
  "Now, we have a case if the employer, for some reason -- a mistake in bookkeeping or something -- didn't send the check on time, so it arrived 3 days late. And he says, ha, I'm not cashing the check; now, I can sue him. Right? That's your theory.",
  "No, no. He -- he -- it's a contract -- you know. He -- he is paid every month, the end of the month.",
  "Even though the -- the employer gave him the paycheck. He just didn't cash it, plus the damage is for the 3 days.",
  "All right. That's true. And so what we would be reading into this statute is a relation-back doctrine, which happens every day of the week in class action cases and has historical analogies. So I understand the difference you're pointing to, but why not read that in? It would be fair, and it would get the job done, that Congress sets up in the statute. That's the argument the other way.",
  "All right. But that -- that's why I wonder what the basic underlying principle is. I mean, I would have thought -- but I'm not sure what you think, that -- that the way to look at these cases is, using ordinary principles of statutory interpretation, would a reasonable legislator, having enacted these words, intend to give the agency a degree of leeway in interpreting the statute? Now, if that's the basic question, it helps, but isn't determinative whether you classify this as a claims processing rule or a jurisdictional rule. Those are conclusions. But, really, it's the question of leeway that the Congress intended to -- to delegate to the agency that is determinative. If the answer to that question is yes, your rule stands, regardless of label, and if the answer to the question is no, it fails regardless of label.",
  "Well, but you have three -- the point that you make is right, that -- that you have specific language in the beneficiary part and not here; but you have the other way, the point that Justice Ginsburg made, the fact that the language here is -- is -- doesn't say file within 180 days. It says, you may have a hearing if you file within 180 days. It doesn't say what happens if you don't. It's open, the language. And the -- the subject matter is not a court. The subject matter is a rather technical agency review board. And normally, I would think, you would think, and members of Congress would think that the agency knows best as to how to run its own operation and -- and don't interfere too much in details, and this is a sort of detail. So those are the things against you, it seems to me, though the thing you cite is certainly for you.",
  "One was passed long, long ago and was part of the Social Security Act or something, the one you're talking about, and was passed many years before the second one was passed. And when they're sitting in Congress writing -- you know, they don't know everything that was passed in history.",
  "Are there examples? I mean, it seems to me that, even if you lose this -- I mean, I mentioned the three arguments against you, the other -- the ambiguity of the language and so forth. So if it ends up, even though it's not just a lawyer's argument, it isn't really that clear, and they do have some authority, you then have the second string, which is you say their rule is unreasonable because it has an absolute 3-year cutoff, instead of a little flexibility there for fraudulent concealment. So -- so do you have statutes, are there statutes that say 3 -- or are there cases that say 3 years is not enough, that -- that you have to have more than 3 years? I thought 3 years is a pretty long time. I mean, I guess they can't go back to fraudulent concealment pre-Civil War -- you know, I mean, there's some period that must be reasonable to cut everything off, and what is that period? What do the cases say? If it isn't 3 years, what is it?",
  "That's their view there, and their view here, which is a different kind of thing, is that 3 years is enough. The question is, is that reasonable? And do you have any authority that says it's unreasonable?",
  "So what about -- then let's get back to the question I really meant to ask before -- you know, assuming they have some authority here to write a rule, you want to say a 3-year absolute rule is not reasonable in this situation. So what is?",
  "I mean, you want to go back to the Civil War? I mean, let's imagine you really have the strongest possible case. All the records burned up, and it took 5 years for scientists to reproduce the records by putting charred pieces of paper together. Okay? So you couldn't possibly bring your claim until they finished. That's a pretty equitable claim. 5 years okay? 10? What is the -- 100? I mean, what?",
  "But what I hear you saying is go back to the Revolutionary War. If it took 100 years to put the papers together, you're saying no time limit at all is -- is the only reasonable solution because there are too many weird cases or unusual cases or misconduct cases. You've got to have some exception in there forever.",
  "Is that right? If that is your position, I just want to know.",
  "Okay. And by the way, do we -- are you supposed to, in such circumstances, give the agency's own determination some weight?",
  "Yes. They'll come in and say, I don't care what the cause is, there isn't cause here because we weren't that awful. And now, does the judge give them some weight?",
  "Okay. So you say they have two remedies, that the NRDC, if they think you are polluting, could have done -- could do two things. One, they could go and get some expert to try to get a sample or to make an estimate, based on what he knows about the industrial sites that it's actually your storm drains that are polluting. That's one thing they could do; you say they didn't do it. Okay. The second thing they could do is they go to the permitting authority, and they could say, will you please ask the L.A. County to monitor the actual storm drains when they come in, a sample thereof. And you're saying they could have done that, but they don't have to now because, now, that is a requirement. And we are doing it.",
  "Okay.",
  "But, anyway, you say that the court held the same thing in two other cases involving two other rivers, and they didn't cross-appeal from that, and so that issue isn't really in front of us.",
  "And if they did hold what you said, then they'd have to reopen the other two cases.",
  "Okay. But if we decide that they needed file a cross-petition and they didn't, then what's the basis for our remanding, rather than reversing?",
  "It's that issue that what we have to decide.",
  "Sometimes, the Court says the bottom line in that italicized thing, which I've never fully understood when and when we don't do it, but it just says, \"Reversed.\"",
  "And then, sometimes, it says, \"It is so ordered.\" And exactly when you write the word \"Reversed\" -- but I usually just ask the Clerk, all right.",
  "But the question -- the question is when do we do the one or the other, and I think, here, what they're saying is, just write the word \"Reversed,\" we'll deal with the rest of it. All right. So that's --",
  "But as I read it, and he explained it, I thought that, look, what they're thinking is this: Stormwater is really a big problem, and it's really complicated how you work it out, and we want the agencies to work it out. So the purpose of this monitoring thing is we first determine that there is an exceedance. Now, once we determine that there is an exceedance, which is the point of this pertinent particular requirement, then we're going to go on to decide who. And what we're going to do is leave you with two possible choices. One is you can try to figure out who, which means you've got to get an expert and monitor it; or let us now have a new permit which will -- will -- you know, which will -- which will put some responsibility on the individuals, because we'll monitor higher up the river. Now, that's a rational way for an agency to proceed and it leaves you with pretty good remedies. And so why -- why are we running all around, trying to work this thing out? Why don't you just sort of try to deal with it as they described it and say, okay, we're going to either prove you did it before or at least we can prove it now?",
  "Okay. So the upshot would be, however, as I understand it, and correct me if I'm wrong, that since they're doing that now anyway under the new permit -- and you can question my hypothetical assumption there -- but if they are doing it under the new permit, then the only result of your winning this would be to transfer the running of the district from the agency to the court. And I suspect the Ninth Circuit knows less about it than you participating in a -- some kind of negotiation with the agency.",
  "Your basic argument is this permit requires you, L.A. County, to do monitoring, to decide if you're violating it. You chose this system, then common sense suggests you're doing it. You struck out twice with that argument --",
  "-- in the other two rivers, and now, you're going to go back if we permit it, and we want to make the argument and tell the Ninth Circuit, three times and you're out; in this case, hold the opposite.",
  "That’s what you want us –- I understand it.",
  "Couldn't you get some expert who understands --",
  "I see. What do you think of the government's point? They are telling us, just write what you usually write, and then you can go make all your arguments, see what they do. Does that satisfy you?",
  "Let me ask a quick question.",
  "Does it satisfy you if we just write in the judgment what you -- we usually write, and then you all can argue what it means below? What about that? Does that satisfy? Or do you want us to write something special?",
  "I don't think that's -- you've won a judgment in lower court that says that the habitual residence of the child is Scotland. So if they appeal, they might win one that says that was wrong, the habitual residence was the United States, but the child is in Scotland. You understand Scottish law better than I, but they are also bound by this treaty. So I would imagine a Scottish court, just as we would do, when they are trying to decide what's the habitual presumptive then, and now, what's the habitual residence, they would look at what the United States courts decided. They are not absolutely bound by it. But just as we, in the last case we had, were very interested in what the Chilean courts said. Of course, it was relevant to us what the Chilean courts had held was the proper law of Chile in respect to that child. Wouldn't the Scottish courts do the same? Wouldn't it matter to a Scottish court, after all, that an American court had decided that the residence was not bound? I'd certainly give it – won’t they give it consideration?",
  "I'm assuming they win. The reason that they want to appeal is they want to win. If I were looking at the case as you present it, I would say, of course, you'll win, don't worry. What are you worried about? But -- but they have a different view. So they think they are going to win. Now, it means nothing if they lose. But if they win on appeal, they then have their order that says that this child's habitual residence was the United States. And my question is where we started, armed with that piece of paper, they walk into the Scottish court and they say, oh, Scottish judge, please read this paper. Of course, he will read it, and I would think that that judge would take it into account in his decision. That's what we do with the foreign -- similar foreign orders of other foreign courts, and I think we should do that, and I think the Scottish courts should and will. Now, you tell me where I'm wrong in that.",
  "Or -- then argument as to why they shouldn't give in to this hypothetical American judgment. That isn't my question. My question is won't they consider it and give it -- and the Scottish courts, to my knowledge, are not so narrow-minded. I think they would pay attention to what other courts have said.",
  "Am I right or wrong? I want to know if I'm right or wrong.",
  "They would?",
  "Well, thank you for Justice Ginsburg's answer. She is quite helpful.",
  "I was there, but I didn't understand it as fully, and now, I do.",
  "Unless there is some accommodation here, what worries me is this: If you win this case, it's not going to be better. Maybe for your client, it will be, but for others in your position, it's not going to be better. And what's worrying me, to put it on the table, so you can respond, is that, in similar situations, district judges will think this child belongs in England; this child belongs in France; this child belongs in China, wherever they belong. But in the back of their mind will be the possibility that they are wrong, and they know there is a right to appeal. And so instead of being able in these border cases -- borderline cases, instead of being able to send the child back home, they will think, I've got to keep the child here, so that the other party has the right to appeal. Now, it seems to me, in general, that would be bad for the child. It would be -- and it's bad for our system. And it would be better to work out a system that you can send the child back, and then if you're reversed on appeal, it does matter to the other country's courts.",
  "But I can't -- I don't understand why you want a treaty where the best interest of the child is what's at issue, and you interpret it in a way that the court of one nation with the child, where you have parents from both nations, pays no attention at all to what courts in other nations are saying. I mean, my experience out of that is Chile, where, of course, we wanted to know what the law of Chile was and how the Chilean domestic relations judge understood the relations between the parents. That was important. And similarly, I think the Scottish judge should want to know the same thing about the courts deciding in the United States. And the same thing is true of the United States judge wanting to know about Scotland and so forth. I don't see how we're going to get harmony, in other words, unless you let appellate processes go forward, too. And -- and I don't know what the treaty drafters would have had in mind if they wanted some other regime.",
  "I trust Scotland to do the right thing. And I think, to help Scotland do the right thing, it would be nice for Scotland to know what American judges have decided. That's all. And the reverse is equally true.",
  "It does equate, but now, you've got me -- I think I'm on the same wavelength.",
  "And I think it was back just as well, let me see, because Justice Ginsburg -- I see the point of her answer now. It's really fact-specific to this case that you're talking about. So it just happens that the child has now been in Britain or in Scotland for 18 months. And so the question of current habitual residence where they have been there for 18 months is a question of what's been happening over these 18 months, and what happened before the 18 months has absolutely nothing to do with it. And the most that the court of appeals could say is that it was resident in America 18 months ago, and that's no more relevant than saying that the cow jumped over the moon or some other thing. Is has -- is that the point? Is that the point? Is that the point?",
  "If that's the point -- yes, that is the point. Okay. If that's the point --",
  "Well, the Convention doesn't know whether it's 18 months or 6 months or what counts as habitual residence, does it?",
  "That's true, but you have to decide whether that's the habitual residence. And it seems to me that you're adding a factual thing, that what happened in 18 months earlier has nothing to do with whether the child is now a habitual resident of Scotland. And what I want to know -- and I'm not going to find this in the treaty, I don't think, because it's not going to say whether it's 11 months or 12 -- but I want to know what source I look to, to show that you're right and that what happened 18 months previously has nothing to do with the child's habitual residence as of the place where he has lived for 18 months.",
  "Yes. Fact.",
  "Yours is fact. I want to know what I look to, to find out that fact.",
  "Well, what he says is that, after 18 months in Scotland, the Scottish court will decide where is the habitual residence of the child. We are now in August of year 2, and what happened before January of year 1 is now totally irrelevant. So even if the American courts decided prior to January of year 1 the correct habitual residence was Alabama, when the -- when the Scottish courts decide what is his habitual residence as of 18 months later, they won't pay any attention at all to that American decision because it is not relevant. That, I take it, to be his argument, which depends on the long time, 18 months. So what is your response?",
  "This is what I -- could you go back --",
  "-- to Justice Kagan's first question? I was looking at the words of the statute. And if I look at 1332, which has been on the books a long time, it says, \"The district court shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest, of costs, and\" -- et cetera, okay? Then I look here, and it says, \"The district court shall have jurisdiction of any civil action in which the manner in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $5 million, exclusive of interest and costs,\" et cetera, okay? So the words seem identical. Now, in respect to the first, we know that a lawyer can file a binding stipulation that says, I don't care what this is about, I am not asking for more than $75,000, and the Federal court does not have jurisdiction. Given that's true in the first statute, and given that the second statute is almost identically worded, at least in that part, why can't he do the same thing with the $5 million? And it can't be the words I quoted that stopped him from doing it, so what is the word that stops him from doing it?",
  "Yes, as to what that looks like, \"shall be aggregated,\" again from the language, is it's simply to make certain that Zahn does not require the individual -- thing to approach -- to count. In other words, you aggregate rather than just looking at the individual members, which is Zahn, which has nothing to do with the issue before us.",
  "No, they rarely pass a statute that says, let's just get rid of case X. Normally they look to the holding of case X, and then they pass the statute that says the opposite. So the holding of Zahn was that you could not aggregate the individual members' claims in a class. So to get rid of Zahn, what we do is we pass a statute that says you can aggregate. And indeed, nobody objects here to the aggregation. It's the total amount of the claims being limited by a stipulation that is the issue here, and that's why I had trouble finding your argument in the word \"aggregation.\"",
  "That's the same question.",
  "If so, this is just a loophole because it swallows up all of Congress's statute, which is what their problem is, all you have to do, even if you were less obvious than the Chief Justice's example, what you do is you -- you file a complaint, you say it's for $4,900,000; in fact, it's worth 10 million. But you inform people, unlike Justice Alito, you figure a way around his problem, you keep them informed, and you say, it's getting close, getting close. And once you are up to $4,800,000, the others get the word: Stay out of it. And once they stay out of it, you go ahead with your action and then those that stayed out of it becomes the subject of a second action. And if it's for 50 million, then you have ten actions and then you have 20. So, in fact, all that is required is a few extra pieces of paper that will soon become standardized, and a lot of postage stamps. And we have 30 or 40 or $50 million cases being tried in whatever counties Congress liked the least. I gather they're some in Arkansas. But that seems to be all behind Justice Scalia's and the Chief Justice's questions, and I would like to hear a pretty complete answer on that.",
  "But what you said then in response -- we're on the same subject, and I'm drawing the conclusion from what you say that yes, we've found a way around this. And what we're going to do is we will divide our $25 million class action into six subsidiary actions and proceed exactly the same merry way. And we do that by means of stipulation. Now, your words in the statute do favor that, in my opinion, at the moment. But the purpose seems to strongly cut the other way. And I do see a way to go the other way, in that you could say, given the purpose of this, the words do mean something different, and they do mean you should aggregate the real value of the real amounts that the class is likely to have. Now, it's capable of that reading, and the virtue of that reading is that it would stop what looks like, from what you're saying, a mechanical method of avoiding the purpose of the statute. I say that explicitly because I really want to make it as much as possible that you will focus in on what's a response to that.",
  "What about -- what about, has anyone thought of this -- I hate to bring up sort of a new idea, but somebody may have thought of it. Imagine we're now in the Federal district court. And the Federal district court reads the statute because the case has just been removed. And he says -- you know, this -- this case would be worth a lot more than 5 million were it not for that stipulation. And let now me look at that stipulation. That stipulation is a part of some, let's call it, \"monkey business,\" which you will resist that, but I mean by that to -- to encompass the kinds of things we've been talking about, that there are going to be five similar class actions, that they're going to take the people A through K, that they're going to -- anything like that. And he says that's not under this statute the kind of stipulation that Congress meant to bar my consideration of the $5 million. So if it's a manipulative stipulation, whatever that might be, it doesn't bar me as the district judge from aggregating up to -- beyond 5 million, but if it's not manipulative, fine. Has there -- has there been any thought on that kind of --",
  "Well, but there might be -- there might be ways of working with this notion, a little risky from your point of view, but there might be ways of working with this good faith notion so that some -- there would be some power in the Federal district court to set aside certain stipulations which were used for manipulative purposes and what the definition of that manipulative is something that isn't clear to -- to me at the moment. But --",
  "The problem is there's no way. This is purely conceptual. A State supreme court that says the word \"weapon\" in the statute means knife, ax, or gun. Now, are those three ways of committing the crime? Or are they three crimes, each with a separate element? That is -- we'd need not only St. Thomas Aquinas, but I mean, we'd need those angels dancing on the head of a pin. There is no difference that I can imagine. And therefore you are saying, look to the point of this statute; it is not to look to the individual way in which it was committed, and therefore go to the statute to see whether you have a single crime or separate crimes, okay? That's that's what I think your argument is.",
  "Do you think I understand your argument?",
  "Fine. If I understand your argument -- it's not as friendly a question as you might hope--",
  "-- because what I want to do next is say, why are we debating this point, because the only difference I can see under the California statute is shoplifting and even that one is sort of debatable. And the very next clause of this statute says \"or otherwise,\" \"or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\" So, why not forget about this metaphysical point and say, look, even if you are totally right, you've still got a statute that for 430,000 convictions and as far as we can tell there must have been fewer than 500 that involved shoplifting, so this is so much like burglary, that whatever risks were presented by burglary are surely present here. So let's forget the metaphysics and just go on to clause 2. Now, why hasn't anybody done that? It's a mystery to me, because you haven't and they haven't. So why not?",
  "Why?",
  "No, no, no. But I mean, what I would do -- I've said this and nobody pays any attention. I think Justice Scalia's said it; nobody pays any attention. I think Justice Posner said it. He said, look, under clause 2, these are really empirical questions, is this dangerous or not. Let's do a little sampling and what we'll do is we'll sample the kinds of people that this particular State statute X get convicted under and where a whole lot of them are dangerous it's a dangerous statute; and where not, not. And so nobody's done that sampling, but we do have some numbers here and the numbers here suggest that this is really a burglary statute.",
  "Yes, you could. I just don't think there are that many people who burgle their own homes or who go into the home of somebody else with an invitation and then sneak into the cupboard and stay overnight and burgle everything. I mean, there are some such, but --",
  "No, no, no. It doesn't have to do with that. It has to do with the crime and the crime is the crime that the statute defines. And the question is, is that crime otherwise -- present a serious potential risk of physical injury? And if 4,000 manifestations of that crime it does, and 3 manifestations of that crime it doesn't, you would say the overall judgment here is this is a crime that does present that dangerous risk. That's because in almost all cases it's there.",
  "No, no. It's exactly pure categorical. You have a crime in a statute. You don't know how dangerous it is. It is not burglary, arson or explosives. So to find out if it presents the same kind of danger you do a little empirical research. That's all I'm saying. It has nothing to do with categorical.",
  "\"Is burglary or otherwise,\" \"or otherwise,\" \"burglary or otherwise,\" and the reason we have \"or otherwise\" is because Congress does know that the number of State statutes that are sort of like something, but not completely like something is in the thousands. And so that's why they put in \"or otherwise.\"",
  "Because it's like the old joke. I mean, it's in the statute, you are looking back to see whether he was charged with possession of a gun, which is one word in the statute, or an ax, or a knife. That's what we're looking for under the categorical -- modified categorical. But if all it says in the statute is weapon, even if the supreme court says it's a gun, a knife, or an ax, you still have nothing to look for. Because the charge to the jury could have been, did he have a gun, a knife, or an ax, and the answer to that question, when the jury comes back, would be yes. You see? All they have to say is yes. They don't have to say which. And therefore, Apprendi would be violated, in your view.",
  "You didn't.",
  "But you're not -- but you're not looking at the factual basis for the purpose of deciding the manner in which the defendant committed the crime. You're looking to the factual basis or you look to these other documents in order to decide which crime it was that the offender committed. And the reason that you have to sometimes do that is because there are many State statutes which under a single section number list several different crimes, where \"crime\" here does not refer to a thing that happened at a particular day at a particular time, but refers to the kind of thing that a statute defines; i.e., a general category. Now, every case that we've written it seems to me says that or is consistent with that. And that is certainly consistent with the idea of the crimes being burglary, arson, explosives, or other dangerous crimes. So the guilty plea is beside the point. It may just say, guilty of 828 376 Section 42-BC, end of the matter. And we don't know which of those three things: House, car, boat, which are there in that section, was the crime committed. And he's saying that's the end of that. And so he says, then, look, this is a California State statute and it isn't divided into three parts. It just has one part. And that one part is not the equivalent --",
  "-- of Federal burglary as defined by Justice Blackmun and the Court in this case, end of matter, QED.",
  "That's exactly right. So therefore, that was my question basically.",
  "And of course Congress knew that there are hundreds or thousands of State statutes with several different words and they -- you know, different ways of getting at the same thing, and therefore they wrote the next phrase of their Federal statute, which is it's burglary, arson, explosives or otherwise, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury. And so if you have a slight variation on the burglary theme, it doesn't fit within generic burglary, but it's pretty hard to imagine it wouldn't otherwise present the same risks, at least if it's only a slight variation.",
  "I know and that was my question. Why not?",
  "True. But what they said in Gauze is that the entry must invade a possessory right in a building. And that cuts in your favor, because that's not having different ways of committing a crime, that's what the word in the statute means.",
  "Yes. So now you're ahead. But the difficulty I think is, as I understand it, that invading a possessory interest includes -- includes going into a shop with an intent to steal something, a shoplifter. Now, you could go back to the Blackmun opinion and you can say, ah, that falls right within it, because generic burglary is defined in part there to include generic, an unprivileged remaining in the building. And you say, you see, these are the same. Were it not for two facts. The first fact is in Shepard it seems as if the Court says shoplifting is not burglary. And then you look to the treatise that they cite for that, which is LaFave, and LaFave makes that even more clear. And says, no, when you talk about remaining, what we're thinking of is hiding in a bank and not going into what used to be Jordan Marsh and staying overnight, or not even staying overnight, but just putting a few toothbrushes in there.",
  "So that's where the problem is.",
  "Ah. But now, once you conflate those you are back to Justice Sotomayor's problem.",
  "Let me quickly ask you this then, you say look at Gauze for this reason, it makes clear that in these words of the California statute, there must be an interference with a possessory interest. Now, go back and read the Blackmun opinion, and it says the element of generic burglary includes an unprivileged entry or remaining into a building. You say now, between those two forms of words, there is virtually no difference.",
  "The one possible difference is shoplifting.",
  "And as to shoplifting, here is what I would like to say. This is you, okay? Not me. Shoplifting just is not a factor under California code section 459. Now, you have not added those last words; and therefore, I begin to think maybe it is a factor. And if it is a factor, then I'm afraid I'm then leaning in favor of saying there is a big difference in the California statute in generic burglary. But if you could tell me, no, there are other shoplifting statutes, this is never or hardly ever used for shoplifting, then maybe I would feel differently about it, and say, oh, it's close enough.",
  "You see why I turn back to the empirical question and keep wondering, why is it not possible to get, say, a law professor; they have spare time -- get the sentencing committee, get someone to look and see what are the real behaviors that are convicted under section 459.",
  "Well --",
  "Does it apply to Social Security? Does it apply to Veterans Affairs?",
  "Does this statute apply to Social Security?",
  "Does it apply to Veterans Affairs? Yes or no or you don't know?",
  "What about Social Security?",
  "Then, I'm asking about this statute. Does it apply?",
  "Defense Department?",
  "Antitrust?",
  "FTC, you don't know?",
  "It does apply to FTC, okay. So Social Security, FTC. Veterans Affairs we don't know, antitrust we don't know. Okay.",
  "Medicare, Medicaid?",
  "Now, that's the question because I certainly agree with Justice Scalia that this is not an SEC statute, this is not a securities statute; it is a statute that applies to all government actions, which is a huge category across the board and it's about 200 years old. And until 2004 I haven't found a single case in which the government ever tried to assert the discovery rule where what they were seeking was a civil penalty, not to try to make themselves whole where they are a victim, with one exception, a case called Maillard in the 19th century where they did make that assertion. They were struck down by the district court, and the attorney general in his opinion said, the district court's absolutely right; of course, the government cannot effectively abolish the statute of limitations where what they're trying to do is to gather something that's so close to a criminal case. So my question is: Is there any case at all until the year 2004, approximately, in which the government has either tried or certainly succeeded in taking this general statute and applying the discovery rule where they are not a victim, they are trying to enforce the law for the civil penalty? The reason I brought up Social Security, Veteran's Affairs, Medicare, is it seems to me to have enormous consequences for the government suddenly to try to assert a quasi-criminal penalty and abolish the statute of limitations, I mean, in a vast set of cases. And that -- you know, I have overstated that last remark a little bit, but I want you to see where I'm coming from, which isn't so different from the -- from the questions that have been put to you.",
  "All I'm asking you for is one case.",
  "No, it is not a problem of fairly recent vintage. I'd say for 200 years there is no case. The only case, as far as I have been able to discover, which is why I am asking, is that what created the problem of recent vintage is that the Seventh Circuit, I guess, or a couple of other circuits decided that this discovery rule did apply to an effort by the government to assert a civil penalty. That's what created the problem. Before that there was no problem; it was clear the government couldn't do it. All right. Now, you will tell me that I'm wrong by citing some cases that show I'm wrong. And that's what I'm asking. I want to be told I'm wrong, sort of.",
  "No, I haven't found one.",
  "I mean, we are asking the same question, but in 30 seconds I am going to conclude there is none. What I want is a case before the year 2000 in which the government sought a civil penalty and was not trying to recover money or land that it had lost, and I want the name of that case in which they said that the discovery rule applies. The two that you cited, Amy and the case of Broderick's Will, did involve the government being injured by losing land or losing money, something like that. So I have those and I don't think they count, but I will look at them again. Is there anything else you would like to refer me to?",
  "The reason would be that the -- you know, once you start talking about applying this to Social Security, for example, or to Medicare, for example, or to DOD, for example, you have somebody who did commit some fraud and they kept the money. You know, she had five children not four, or she has five, not six. And I can understand it being fair when the government catches her -- you know, 18 years later, they say, We want our money back. Okay. I say that's fair, not necessarily merciful, but fair. But then to go and say, and in addition we want this civil penalty, even though -- of course, we couldn't have discovered it. Don't you know there are 4 million people who get Social Security or 40 million or something, and we can't police every one. And so suddenly, I see I am opening the door, not just to getting your money back, but to also you're having what looked like criminal penalties years later without much benefit of a statute of limitations. That is at the back of my mind. And I'd like to know, having brought it up front, what -- what your response is.",
  "That's right.",
  "But this is not the securities context. This is the context of -- that's why I started down the road I was down.",
  "Yes, because you have two people who are hurt, where two people have been hurt. For example, I wrote the case in Burk and we had the statute of limitations and Congress focused on this. And it wrote a two-tier statute. And it wrote a two-tier statute in large part because it was concerned about the problem you mention. You have a victim. So you're either going to let the defendant keep the money or the victim gets it back. I understand that, but this is not that context. This is like a criminal context, where not only are you getting your money back, but you also want to assess a kind of criminal penalty. And in that situation, I see a pretty clear line and I don't understand why the government is so anxious to change what has long been the apparent --",
  "That's correct, you have a fraud and you can't put them in jail either, but you can get your money back.",
  "Oh, no, your case--",
  "Well, if all that's true, and this is a point I want you to -- I'm not sure I am right about this point, but remember your banking case now, we're sounding like that, I thought -- doesn't the doctrine of fraudulent concealment still apply? That is, if the defendant, in fact, takes any affirmative action to hide what's going on, the statute will be tolled. Is that right?",
  "All right. As long as that's right, then in all your banking cases, there are bank inspectors all over these banks, I hope -- you know, about once a month or so --",
  "-- or once a year. And so the chance of there -- the chance of this somehow escaping notice without fraudulent concealment, which would allow the government to extend the toll strikes me as small, but am I right?",
  "I thought it was the opposite. In other words, I thought both parties, for purposes of this argument, are assuming fraudulent concealment has nothing to do with it. We are not to consider fraudulent concealment.",
  "Am I right when I say that?",
  "I assume that we are on the same ground, but I don't know that you have -- I mean, I'm worried about your giving up the fraudulent concealment. I mean, you wouldn't give up equitable estoppel, would you?",
  "No, no, no. I mean -- I mean, there's nothing --",
  "If we were to say -- if we -- if the Court were to hold, it seemed to me, and this is again tentative to get your response, but if the -- if the Court were to hold the discovery doesn't -- rule doesn't apply, there's nothing in that that says equitable -- equitable tolling doesn't apply, nothing in that that says equitable estoppel doesn't apply, nothing in that that says fraudulent concealment doesn't apply. Now, you've shaken me a little bit on the fraudulent concealment, but I don't know about the other two.",
  "Oh, not the equitable estoppel.",
  "Equitable estoppel, the person comes in and says, oh, yes, I'll tell you all about what I did, but by the way, I won't assert a statute of limitations defense, I promise. And the Court says, hey, you just asserted one, you can't.",
  "Can I ask you a somewhat technical -- and I appreciate your paying attention because it's hard for me to keep all this in my mind. All right. It's my understanding of North Carolina, everyone accepts the rule and North Carolina agrees that if you in -- in North Carolina advance to the victim $50,000 in medical expenses -- now, you're never going to get more than that back and you don't want more than that back. Now, the victim and the tortfeasor enter into a settlement and you have a rule and the rule is you will never get more than 50,000 or 33 percent, whichever is less. That's the rule, whichever is less. So if the settlement is for $100,000, you are not going to take more than 33, so you have advanced 50. Okay. So you have basically three situations. The first situation is where a judge has said -- you know what, I find that only $10,000 of this settlement is for medical expenses. In that case you take $10,000, no more. Is that right?",
  "Oh. I got the impression that if there was a judicial -- there are three situations: One is there is a judicial finding that only 10 percent was medical. And the second is the situation where they stipulate that only 10 percent is for medical, and the third situation is this situation, namely there is no stipulation and there is no judicial finding. So my thought, which is wrong I guess, is if the judge says it's 10 percent you won't take more than 10 percent, but if in fact it's a stipulation of 10 percent North Carolina courts have not yet decided that, and this is a case where there is no stipulation and no judicial finding. Now you're telling me I have that wrong. So you explain what the North Carolina is on that because I think it makes quite a difference.",
  "I know, but in the settlement they stipulate that 10 percent is for medical and the rest for pain and suffering. Now, I thought North Carolina courts have not yet decided whether North Carolina -- which would like more than 10 percent -- can get it. Is that true or not true?",
  "They have decided?",
  "Said?",
  "This has nothing to do with Ahlborn. Ahlborn, we all agree, says you cannot get more than medical -- the medical expense, okay? The question here is how to figure that. So I thought that one way to figure it -- I will just be repeating myself. One way to figure it is how much of this $100,000 settlement is attributable to medical expenses as a judge would say. Now, you're telling me there is a case in North Carolina which says if the judge himself says that 10 percent of the settlement is for medical, that's not what California -- that doesn't matter according to North Carolina law, and I'd like the name of the case, the State case that says that.",
  "Okay. So we don't know the answer to that. We know what you would like, but we don't know the answer.",
  "-- can I go back for a second? Because I want to show you where I got my perhaps mistaken idea from. There is a case called Andrews. And there is a statement in Andrews, which is a South -- North Carolina case -- which says in certain circumstances, although the statute says just what Justice Scalia says, the lawyer sits there, he takes one-third and pays it to the State. Then this case has this sentence in it: \"Ahlborn controls when there has been a prior determination or stipulation as to the medical expense portion of a plaintiff's settlement. In those cases, the State may not receive reimbursement in excess of the portion so designated.\" Now, having read that sentence, I thought the law of North Carolina was that this statute does not apply, and that when, in fact, the jury or the judge finds that only 10 percent was for medical expenses, the State cannot take more than 10 percent. And the same is true of a stipulation. That's what those words seem to say to me. Now you're telling me I'm not reading those words correctly, that the case of Andrews does not affect our case here, and that you -- that the law of North Carolina is that you get one-third. Now, what is it? Do you see why I am confused?",
  "I see.",
  "They say a prior determination or stipulation. I took prior determination to mean a determination by a judge or a jury. What does it mean, if it doesn't mean that?",
  "How does it work? Because I would imagine at the negotiation you have the -- the victim's lawyer and the tortfeasor's lawyer and the tortfeasor's lawyer is interested that the bottom line number be as low as possible and the victim's number, that it be as high as possible. And the victim's lawyer, in fact, would like as little as possible to be allocated to a source which is going to take that money away from him. So they can reach agreement. What they will do is say 1 penny is for medical expenses and everything else is for pain and suffering, and that's very good for the victim. And it's irrelevant to the tortfeasor. So -- so when you see that on a piece of paper, what is it you are going to do? What kind of proceeding are you going to have? And it's a proceeding about a proceeding. It's a proceeding about the settlement negotiation. What's it going to look like? What does it look like in the 16 States? We will have a plaintiff's lawyer testify. He will say, Your Honor, I really wanted 1 penny and only 1 penny to be allocated to pain and -- to medical expense. And the defendant's lawyer, he's being very honest, he'll say, I didn't care; if that's what he wants, that's fine with me.",
  "Exactly. So what does it look like?",
  "It's the same point.",
  "How does it work in those States?",
  "But I am asking the same question. There are 16 States that have this procedure. How does it work?",
  "I don't want to know that they have it. I want to know how it works. We have put the problem as to why it seems it might not work too well, and now I would like you to tell us how it really works.",
  "Are you satisfied --",
  "So you're -- you're satisfied with the presumption. Is there any law here that gives you a leg-up? I mean, is this like Chevron or Skidmore or something like that?",
  "I know that's their position. But my question is, does the law mean that when we decide this case, I see you have a reasonable point, they have a reasonable point, that if both points are reasonable, you get the benefit of some kind of legal presumption like Chevron, Skidmore, et cetera. Maybe you can think of another one, I don't know. Do you or don't you?",
  "Why isn't -- the missing part here -- maybe I just missed it -- we're interpreting a statute, and the part that trumps the lien provision is the part that says the State is entitled to payment that has been made for medical assistance for health care items -- and some other similar language is in the statute. They think their one-third rule is a good way of measuring that. You think that the one-third rule as a rebuttable presumption is a better way of measuring that. Now normally, or often, I would see government arguments like that where they'd say, and, by the way, we're interpreting very technical language in our statute, and Chevron and/or Skidmore means that you should give us particular weight. Is that part of your argument here, and if it isn't, why isn't it?",
  "My impression is that you get Chevron deference on the basis of whether Congress -- and there's a lot of rules and so forth, but --",
  "-- you haven't claimed it. And I -- so that puzzles me -- and I don't --",
  "I'm not -- you argue what you want to argue, but I -- this is awfully technical language. It's a minor interstitial point.",
  "So why can't you do that? I mean, the only virtue I see in saying you have to go get a warrant is the officer picks up the phone, there is usually somebody on duty, a magistrate somewhere, he phones him up and says, I have a drunk driver here; he's wobbling, he can't cross the center line; and he won't take a breathalyzer; I want to give him a test. Now, you have a second judgment and the officer has to talk to somebody, so he's a little more careful. And that's a protection, not necessarily for this person, but a protection for others who maybe weren't wobbling. All right. So I think that's the question you're being asked. Why -- what's the problem with doing that? Which adds a little bit of security that this warrant really is -- this search is really necessary.",
  "Why wouldn't it take -- let's see, how long did it take me to say that? It took me about 30 seconds. So -- so even if you are a lot more careful, why would it take more than, say, 3 minutes?",
  "Well, what you do is you have a system, and you phone up and you do just what I said. And this man or woman who is there is not a policeman. That's the virtue of it is this man or woman is trained to listen to policemen and others say things and try to pin him down a little bit and make an independent judgment. So -- so why would it take more than 5 minutes?",
  "I thought the question was if -- if in fact the person won't agree to a breathalyzer.",
  "Was your client was offered the breathalyzer twice?",
  "How many times?",
  "I mean, aside from all -- the thing, what it boils down to, at least in my mind, is, is yes, of course it would be better to -- to have a neutral person hear what the policeman has to say and to act as a second judgment on that; it would make it less likely that people who are really innocent, in fact, have this happen to them and so forth. But they're arguing that that's a -- that's a considerable burden in many, but not all States. And at some point -- and the addition in respect to the second judgment, namely the magistrates that you get, is not worth really what you're going to lose, which are going to be people who are drunk driving around on roads and -- and possibly killing people. We all know how that side can be built up, too.",
  "So at some point, I would wish you would spend some time addressing that, that practical argument.",
  "A lot of States have varying degrees to which they want to enforce strict rules against drunk driving. And a State -- that's exactly the kind of thing that worries me on your side. The -- you have a bunch of States that don't -- you know, it's not easy to get hold of a magistrate in 15 minutes or so forth. And so what to do about that? If you say, well, you don't have to because you haven't got it provided, you give them every incentive not to make the magistrate available. That's cutting in your favor. On the other hand, it's pretty tough to say that all these States have to have the best possible magistrate available 24 hours a day so somebody can call in ten instances a year because the guy won't take the blood test -- won't take the breathalyzer. And that's where I am in a dilemma. And so I'm looking for an answer to that. And you don't have an absolute rule or I don't see an absolute rule. Should you say, look, here's what you have to do, it's better to have a second opinion there, which is the magistrate's? And so on the way to the hospital, it's just that's where we started, you have to phone and try to get one, and if you don't have one by the time you're at the hospital, tell them again: It's your last chance, give us the breathalyzer or else. And he says no, then you take the blood test. Is that the solution, or do you have a better solution? What's the solution to the problem if you are willing to reject, which you aren't, but hypothetically you might be, that there's the absolute rule.",
  "My question is what you don't want to do and you don't have to, but if you think of a second-best solution it might always be better than what I think of as a second-best solution.",
  "I -- I want to know if you want to say anything that would suggest -- we have a number of them floating around and -- and I just wonder if you want to express any view on a second-best solution.",
  "I am probably just -- but a policeman has probable cause to believe that somebody inside the house has drugs. He hears the toilet flushing and he thinks they're flushing the drugs down the drain.",
  "He doesn't have to get a warrant as long as he reasonably believes that the evidence is disappearing. All right. Now, the difference between your case here and that is specifically what? Suppose we were just to refer to those cases --",
  "-- and say it's the same thing.",
  "Can they do this: Can -- can Lawyer Smith say -- you know, there are some products in this State that I really suspect are not being properly made, and I have probably a tort suit; and the damages are awfully small; I would like to get 10 or 20,000 plaintiffs. I wonder if there is anybody interested? And then what he does is -- I have to write them a letter, and I know where I can get the names and addresses, from the DMV. So he goes to the DMV and says, I would like the names of everybody who -- I'd like all your names and addresses, and I intend to write them all and send them a letter and say, I suspect there is some fishy business going on here in the dress manufacturers; would you like to tell me about what happened? Is that possible? Can they do that?",
  "Well, what do you --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, maybe they -- maybe this is all passe. Maybe -- perhaps they could get this information elsewhere, but I guess we have to deal with this statute --",
  "So maybe what they want is they want the names of all the people who've ever had a car -- you know, because they think there's something special about a car, and they think that's going to be connected. But you see what I'm driving at.",
  "You have no lawsuit, but you are going to get one if you can, and you have grounds for thinking that there is some suspicious defendants, and what you are looking for is plaintiffs. That's all.",
  "All you are looking for is plaintiffs. Now, can you, under this statute, go and get the information, where all you are looking for is plaintiffs for your lawsuit? So far, you know how many plaintiffs you have? None.",
  "All right. Is your answer what I have in my mind -- I'm just repeating the same question. I will do that -- I have some reason for thinking there are a whole bunch of defendants here who have done something wrong. All I am lacking is a plaintiff, and what I want to do is get the names of potential plaintiffs. It's the same question. I have asked that three times. Either you can, in your view, get it under this lawsuit, or you cannot.",
  "No, no. I'm not liking or disliking. All I want to know is --",
  "Wait, wait. Now, that's your -- now, that's the line. As to some of these defendants, what he's saying is, these lawyers had no client that my defendant hurt, none.",
  "And as to some of these, but not all the requests, all they were doing was they were looking for somebody who bought a car from me. And the reason they want that is to ask them what the practice was, so they can get a plaintiff to do what the complaint is about. So it's at least two -- or one or two of the requests are like that.",
  "Okay. So, now, repeat to me -- I've got your point.",
  "You have don't have to prove it to me. All -- what I'm trying to get at is the statement that I could write in an opinion that will draw the boundary of this provision south of -- well, the lawyer can go out when he has reason to believe that a defendant has done something wrong and, to use a pejorative, troll for clients.",
  "I want it south of that, and, now, you will tell me the words I can use that will both help your client because they will cover this case, but will also be south of that. What are --",
  "South means -- south means it does not -- you can't just go and troll for clients, simply because you think a defendant has done something wrong, and you have no client.",
  "Okay. So you are saying that really this is a -- the way the statute works is it says nobody can solicit, but for lawyers. And that's not -- that makes more sense than you might think because this was not a statute that was meant to interfere with solicitation rules; it was meant to interfere with commercial selling. And -- and that's what this is about, and there is a requirement, the requirement as to the lawyer, in good faith, has to believe that, if he finds a client, there's a case.",
  "All right.",
  "The difficulty that Justice Alito brings out is -- I see your interpretation, and I hope the other side will give me some line because they have the same problem -- you know, but in reverse. What is the line? But your way, it doesn't become that much of a privacy statute. It's sort of a misnomer. It's a -- it's a statute that is designed to prevent the commercial use of your -- of this personal information. It's not really a privacy statute.",
  "Well, the reason -- the reason that would be so -- I agree with you, that it's very hard to figure out what the line is here between the investigation and solicitation. But that's where the solicitation thing comes into play because what it -- the words that go the other way, in my mind, that cut against you, is that this card could have asked for Social Security numbers, I guess.",
  "Not under South Carolina law. All right. But then, under another State, under this statute, they could. Now, that's helpful, that answer. But if -- when I think of asking for Social Security numbers, I -- the words -- exaggerated, but they go through my mind -- are \"identity theft run wild.\"",
  "And, if that is a concern -- if that is a concern, then, by reading this as a solicitation -- you know, the pure case -- and throwing the other exception to cover it, you force the State to focus on it. And the State then has to decide whether they are going to permit or not permit the solicitor, who -- you see, might -- might include the lawyer here, to ask for the Social Security number, and better to have them focus on that decision. That's the connection that I see between the two.",
  "Okay. So are we -- do we know -- by the way, that is helpful because do we know under how many States' law the DMV would be forbidden to give Social Security numbers?",
  "Well, why don't you give us the line that's north?",
  "No, not north of trolling, but you understand the point. What's your line?",
  "In the middle of the -- in the middle of the class action, several of the clients, the only ones who brought -- who bought the cars -- which there is loads of evidence they're defective, from Dealer Smith, died, and they want to see if they can find three others, so they don't have to dismiss them from the class, they're almost certain -- and has loads of evidence there is the -- you know, the harm caused by the defendant. They are missing a client. They died. And so can they get it then?",
  "Can they go to the board and say, look, Dealer Smith here -- we're in the middle of the case, we're finished with discovery. We're just -- he just died and - -",
  "-- we want to find three others, and I'm sure there's loads of evidence here that there were a hundred thousand others, who bought this defective thing from this defendant, we want to find out the names and addresses. Can they get it or not?",
  "Not.",
  "No, no, it isn't quite. I mean, the -- the linguistic difference -- I agree with Justice Scalia, and I agree with you. It turns on the word \"exposed.\" I mean, if you state Apprendi's holding as it was just stated, this is a different case because you could, in fact, if you were the defendant, have been sentenced to that anyway. That's your argument.",
  "Now, let's put it differently. There is a fact in the world. There's a gun, or there wasn't a gun. In the Apprendi case, if the fact turns out to be gun, you could get two more years. All right? We have to go to the jury. Now, here there's a fact in the world, gun or not gun. If it turns out not gun, you get a lower sentence, you could. And, if it turns out to be the fact, gun, you can't -- the judge cannot put you in that box. He has to put you in a worse box. He has to put you in a worse box. He has to give you more than -- more than the three years, two years, or one year. He has to. Okay? Now, from the point of view of the defendant, worse or not -- at least as bad. From the point of view of Congress, same. They drew some lines, want a judge to administer them, and they turn on facts. And the sentence very often will turn on those facts. From the point of view of the judge, same. It's the jury decides or he decides. In the one case, his discretion is cut off to give a lower sentence. In the other case, his discretion is granted to give a higher sentence. Now, I see tremendous similarities, though I grant you the words are different, but can you -- can you just explain --",
  "-- why the difference in the words should overcome the fact that I can't think of a -- of a difference, other than those words that happened to be used in Apprendi?",
  "I'm afraid the other side was upside down, and I saw what you meant.",
  "But --",
  "That's the -- that's the -- you've used all the words, which do make the difference, in your mind. But my question --",
  "-- is why should those words make a difference? Look, in the one case -- I'll be repeating myself, but I want you to see it. In the one case, presence of a fact or not means the defendant goes into a higher sentencing box. In the other case, presence of a fact or not means that he cannot go into the low sentencing box.",
  "In the one case, he cannot go into the low sentencing box; in the other case, he can't go into the high sentencing box. I got that difference. My only problem is why does it make a difference.",
  "No, it's not -- well, you can call it judicial leniency, but you could call the other judicial harshness. I mean, what is, in fact, turning out --",
  "And, here, we have the ingredients of a crime that Congress has determined that you have to get the five years.",
  "I mean, in the one case, you can say all that Apprendi did. It never should have been decided -- I mean, some of us thought that -- because, in fact --",
  "All you're talking about there is that you are stopping the judge from exhibiting his otherwise discretion towards harshness, and that's a matter for judges. I've heard all these arguments before, you see.",
  "And I've just heard them in the context of harshness, and, now, I don't know why changing it to leniency makes them somehow more relevant. They weren't apparently relevant in the first situation; so why are they relevant in this one?",
  "Look, look, here's another way of putting the same point: With the mandatory minimum, the judge can't go below the five years, okay? But you say, well, he could have gone below the five years anyway, couldn't he have? I mean, you -- he could have given you the five years anyway -- sorry. He could have given you the five years anyway. That's your point.",
  "All right. He could have given you the five years -- he could have given you the five years if you'd been -- if you had been convicted of a different crime.",
  "But why does that make a difference? The best way I thought of putting it is the heading on page 6 of their reply brief is almost right, I think. I mean, I -- it says it's -- it's permitting judges to find facts by a preponderance of the evidence that compels sentences higher than a set of those permitted by the jury's verdict. That's exactly what's going on here.",
  "And -- and I -- I want to know, what is it? And the trouble is --",
  "You're just going to say, well, he could have given the same sentence anyway. And I'm going to say, well, so what, why does that matter?",
  "That -- that's -- I don't know if you can add anything to this, but, remember, I agree with you about the history, but I just apply it to Apprendi, too. So the one --",
  "I thought -- are you sure it was Gertrude Stein and not Dorothy Parker? But I think you're probably right about that. But the -- the -- I'm thinking of this as, well, Apprendi, I see what they're thinking. They're thinking that, once you have to add the extra fact to get above the otherwise ceiling, it's like a new crime. It isn't really a new crime, but it's like a new crime. Okay. But then I can say, well, once you have to really cut off that five years and less and really send him to jail for five years, hey, that's just like a new crime. It isn't really a new crime, but it's like a new crime. So why can't I say everything that we said about Apprendi here, except I can't deny what you say, the judge could have given the sentence anyway. That's absolutely right. But all the other things, I can say. Is that true?",
  "But, I mean, are they true?",
  "Your -- your point of view in this case - -",
  "In your point of view, would it satisfy you if we say, the Louisiana court of appeal found the largest part of the delay involved the funding crisis experienced by the State of Louisiana -- that meant giving you adequate money for counsel. Then they said, the progression of the prosecution was out of the State's control, as determined by this court, which I think referred to that funding crisis. And we could -- and your view would be that's what they said. We don't know the underlying facts, but that's what they said. And, insofar as they said that the State wasn't responsible for that part of the delay that they are talking about, they're wrong because the State is responsible for not providing enough money, even if it's a problem and to say they weren't responsible is wrong, okay? That's what you want us to say?",
  "Period. And send it back.",
  "The answer to the question -- that's what I was trying to do -- this case -- the briefing is filled with whether he asked in time, whether he was delaying, whether he should have done some other thing, whether he should have -- but the question that's asked is, simply, whether the failure to fund counsel is a factor that should be weighed against the State.",
  "And maybe it only gets very little weight because maybe there was a hurricane, and maybe it doesn't even matter because he didn't make the right motions. But the lower court said it shouldn't be weighed against the State, period. And do we have to do anything other than say, if you're right, yes, it should. Now, how much weight it gets, well, that depends. There was a hurricane and -- but -- but it's something that they can't just ignore in -- in the hearing. They have to figure out what happened and to -- to the extent the State should have done more, it weighs against the State. Do you want any more than that?",
  "And what else?",
  "You also agree, right on this subject, that the only sentence that I can find -- I haven't read it totally carefully -- but, in the lower court opinion, that has to do with this is the sentence I read before. And it says, \"The first three years he was incarcerated, he was charged with first-degree murder, and the progression of the prosecution was out of the State's control, as determined by this Court and the Supreme Court.\" Now, when I look at those words, I am not 100 percent certain what they mean. So it would be helpful -- but I don't want --- you're not going to do it -- I'd like to -- are you -- would you concede that that statement means they're saying that the State, for speedy trial purposes, is not to be held accountable, really, at all, for not providing the money, insofar as that's a cause of the delay? Is that a conceded point? Or is that something I have to spend quite a lot of time going through? And, if you don't concede that, what is it that you concede, which would spare a little time going through this record.",
  "All right.",
  "I thought maybe you would not, but --",
  "Yes, you are right. Most of this opinion -- and almost all of it is about the other factors. Now, I agree with you, that's what it looked like. But we do have this sentence. So how am I supposed to figure out whether that sentence really means what they say? Or just is something they threw in to make the opinion more difficult for us to understand?",
  "No, I don't either. I don't either. But what's the argument -- sounds as if it has something to do with funding. So what's the argument it doesn't?",
  "I mean, it says, you see, \"as determined by this Court and the Supreme Court.\" What were they talking about?",
  "Oh, okay. Well, then, that's it. They're referring to Barker. Okay. So when they say it's out of this State's control, as referred to in Barker, which is our case, then what they mean is that it's not something that the State had anything to do with, so they shouldn't be blamed for it.",
  "When you agreed with --",
  "Suppose it is negligent. For -- for a year, this person isn't represented because the State keeps sending the checks to his cousin of the same name. I mean -- you know, they didn't do it purposely. He just happens to have a cousin, this lawyer, of the same name, who doesn't tell him he's getting these checks out of nowhere. So he can't hire the expert. Absolute negligence. I mean, that's not to be attributed to the State?",
  "Is there any authority for that? I mean -- you know, maybe you'd discount it because it wasn't deliberate, but no attribution whatsoever?",
  "What would -- what do you do, if anything, about those of us -- I hope more than one -- who actually look at legislative history, and the House and Senate Report -- the Senate Report says Subsection (e) would nullify a provision of the Tort Claims Act, which would otherwise exclude any action for assault and battery, then the House says about the same thing. So, when I look at those two things, I think the purpose of this Act was to do just exactly what the other side says, it was to get rid of assault and battery as an exception and said the government of the United States will pay for unlawful assault and battery. That's what the two reports say. That's why they passed it.",
  "You're -- you're -- I'm picking up from -- I find Justice Scalia's hypothetical interpretations of legislative history very useful. So the -- the -- and I --",
  "The -- the thing where we are in this -- it' -- we have a -- we have a statute, 1089, basically, and it says you can sue the government for the tort of an employee -- I'm oversimplifying, I'm oversimplifying so. And we should interpret that narrowly, okay? We should interpret that -- absolutely has to be definite, and it is pretty definite. Now, what we have is an exception to that. And the exception is an exception for battery, but not battery. Can't sue the United States for battery. And we're supposed to interpret that, I guess, as broadly as possible. If you have a plausible argument that it could be broader, you get it, as long as it's plausible. Then what we have -- because, after all, after these two things, you can still sue the person who hit you over the head, you can go sue him in a State court, can't you? Now, oh, now, we bring a new Act there. And this new Act says, we are going to have a little exception to the exception. Right? And we are supposed to interpret that one, I guess, as narrowly as possible. You see -- so, now, what we are -- because that's an exception to something which should be interpreted as broadly as possible, which is an exception to something that should be interpreted as narrowly as possible. So I think I get it like Costello used to, I don't know what I'm talking about.",
  "Because there are a lot of words in these things. And -- and so given all these words and -- this is where the Chief Justice started -- I mean, can't we at least look at legislative history, to try to figure out what Congress was doing by the time we get to the exception to the exception to the exception?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, then you win, as long as I find it confusing.",
  "Well, I don't find it all that confusing. What it says is that this battery exception, which is in (h), is not supposed to apply when we look at the military doctors. That's what it says.",
  "And if -- and you say, ah, but it says, \"for purposes of this section.\" Okay. I look at \"for purposes of this section,\" and the purposes of this section -- the very first whole sentence has to do with 1089. It has to do with the scope. It has to do with the general waiver.",
  "Okay. But why? Why would they have wanted to do that? That is to say, look, if you cut the exception to the exception to the exception, the presumption, da, da, da, out of it, what we've got on your interpretation is that a person who's hurt by a battery committed by a government official, given your interpretation, has no remedy at all. I mean, previously, he could have at least sued in State court.",
  "Now, what you're saying is Congress tried to do with this language is say, hey, you can't sue in State court; and, by the way, when you try to sue the Federal government, we are not going to give you your suit, either. Why do that?",
  "Would you -- are you finished there?",
  "Would -- would you go back for a minute and think, before this Act was passed -- the Gonzalez Act -- and think of the millions of government employees, and they're in different parts of the country, and some of them commit batteries. Now, you told me before that, where an injured person -- a plaintiff sues a government employee, and they sue under State tort law, and they say, this government employee committed a battery, okay, in the course of duty, you say there was an immunity there. Where did the immunity come from?",
  "From what?",
  "I mean, what was the theory of it? I mean, here it's just -- it's a person, he's at work, he does happen to work for the Federal government, instead of working for someone else --",
  "-- and everybody else, you have to respond, and you -- if liable, you'd have to pay damages for the battery. Now, where -- where did the immunity come from --",
  "-- if the Federal employee did it?",
  "Why?",
  "So -- so what I think might be driving some of these questions is the district court says -- just as you say, had Koontz offered additional mitigation -- the additional that would have cost $10,000, he would have gotten the permit. That's what he said. So then you look back to see what additional mitigation. And, here, we have in the record, at least that my law clerk finds -- you know, that -- that they went to Koontz and they said, here are some choices: Install a subsurface stormwater management system in the development -- I mean, right on your land -- or reduce the size to one acre; or eliminate the filling of the slide slope areas; or replace 15 culverts and eliminate a ditch system somewhere else; or enhance 50 acres somewhere else. Now, at that point, when -- and then they said, won't you negotiate for 30 more days, maybe we can find some other things? He says, no, I'll bring a lawsuit. Okay. Now, I absolutely can see a Penn Central claim there. But the land -- what you're talking about is not some land somewhere off the site. We're talking about his land. If, after all, they said you have to leave all the coal in the mine to hold up the ceiling -- you know what I'm referring to -- then they go too far. And, here, if we look at all these conditions proposed and said -- you know, this is just terrible, they don't do it for anybody else, your client's the only one, it bears no relation, oh, it just goes too far, you win under Penn Central. So I can see the framework here. I'm not saying you're going to win, but I got it clear what the framework is. But suddenly you bring this Nollan/Dolan business into it, and I get confused. And the reason is because there was a different piece of land in Nollan and Dolan. The piece of land that was different was an easement in front of -- and an easement is a piece of property in Nollan, and there was a bike path in Dolan, right across his property. So -- so I don't see how Nollan and Dolan have to do with this. I see everything that Penn Central has to do with it, and that grows out of the nature of what was being offered. You are saying what they are offering you is simply going too far. Okay. I've got that conceptually. I ask this question because all these briefs are about Nollan and Dolan, and I don't understand what they have to do with it. I must be missing something, and that's why I am asking you.",
  "But, of course, they are land claims because they took a piece of land, which everybody assumes -- right in front of his house -- and said, you've got to let everybody from the beaches walk back and forth from one beach in the north to another one in the south, and they are going to walk over your land. And the Court said, you can't take his land unless you have a nexus to some public purpose that is related to his building the house. I got it. I just don't see what it has to do with this case.",
  "Of course, you can. In fact, there is too much coal. That's an unconstitutional condition. It goes too far, and there is a framework called Penn Central, which deals with it.",
  "All right. Look, we have the same question. I just want an answer to my question. And, for the purposes of this question, I am assuming enormously in your favor. I am assuming that this set of conditions is the worst thing since sliced bread.",
  "All right. I think there -- all right. I'm assuming that in your favor. All right.",
  "No, no. It's been proved bad.",
  "The -- the -- but -- but in any case, the -- the point is, you see, I assume that in your favor. I'm trying to figure out the conceptual framework. I assume that in your favor. I assume whether they didn't issue the permit and would have, but they haven't quite, or maybe they have -- it means nothing. Now, having assumed that, it seems to me what your argument is, is that this is a form of regulatory taking of the kind that Holmes was talking about. And that -- that's what was going on in -- in Penn Central, and so we simply look to see if it went too far or whatever. The lower courts could do that. I got that part. Now, I want you to answer the question, which is, am I right? Is there another part -- a different part to this case, called the Nollan/Dolan part and explain that to me. That's why I asked the question. I want to hear what you're going to say.",
  "So that -- am I wrong about -- I might have this -- I thought the framework, roughly, is the following: it is not the case that Penn Central applies only where there is a physical invasion of property, or there is total destruction of the value of the property. In those two situations, what we said in Lucas is it applies without case-specific inquiry, but there are another set of cases where Penn Central and McMahon apply with case-specific inquiry. And those, to discover whether you have one, you look into such things as whether the regulation destroys investment-backed expectations. And then you look to the nature of the government interest and the relationships, et cetera. That's what I thought the framework was. Now, if that's the framework, then, when the government says, I will let you develop your land if and only if you give $50,000 to the Shriners Hospital, you would say, I can't develop my land. And, besides, that significantly interferes with my investment-backed expectations. And, besides, there is no relation whatsoever. Therefore, I win under the Takings Clause. Now, I spell all that out because I -- if I'm wrong about that framework -- if I am right about the framework, that can apply to this case. If I am wrong about the framework, I want to know where in the cases I'm wrong.",
  "Okay. So, if I'm right about the framework, that takes care of all the hypotheticals you were asked. In those cases, there is a significant interference with investment-backed expectation. And there's no justification whatsoever, so the Takings Clause applies.",
  "No, no. Why isn't the answer, yes, it is applicable? Of course, it's applicable. I own a piece of land, and they have significantly interfered with my investment-backed expectation.",
  "And -- and to say that I can't put a house on this because I'm supposed to pay for a football field, which has nothing to do with it, is as close to insisting that you have to have 4,000 columns of coal in your mine, so that you can never use it, as I can think of. It's Holmes brought up-to-date.",
  "I mean, at least that argument would be made --",
  "And why wouldn't it be a winning argument?",
  "Yes, I agree with you --",
  "Well, what he's going to say, in part, is -- I guess, I did a little numbers from your brief, the 37 million acres in Florida, say about 4 million are bodies of water and say a third of them are built up, and we have 11 million that are wetland and 11 million that aren't. That's crude. So they're saying why in heaven's name are we supposed to -- everybody wants to build. And why should the people that happen to live in wetland have to pay for all the other wetland? That's just coincidence. So he is going to say that that is like the Shriners Hospital. You are going to say, no, it isn't like the Shriners Hospital. Now, all I'm saying is isn't it at least an issue, under the Takings Clause, whether it is or isn't?",
  "I know you'll say that. He will say that it is.",
  "All right. Suppose you win on that, okay?",
  "Or I -- I grant you, I don't see any reason for that. The question is just whether Congress intended them to have a degree of discretionary power, but all the arguments that we hear still count against you. So -- so if you want to go into the Chevron Step Zero or Step Minus Alpha 13.6, I mean, fine.",
  "But, I mean, at some point, I will hope you -- I hope you will go into what I'd call the question of we have a statute, just as Justice Ginsburg said, it's an expert statute. It is a statute in an agency that has all kinds of discretionary authority. It includes an important substantive question about what the relation is with the cable television in this area -- post -- not cable, but -- you know, the broadcast posts. And so all these factors here, which suggest, of course, Congress, which is not expert, would have wanted the FCC to figure this one out.",
  "That -- that -- at some point -- you don't have to go into it at all, if you don't want to, but I just want to put that on the table.",
  "You don't have to talk about it now, but you can talk about it whenever you want.",
  "Well, what worries me about it is you -- you and I both have, in our offices, thousands of words which are in the U.S. Code, and there are hundreds of thousands -- or millions of employees, in millions of different kinds of agencies, and, if we turn Chevron into the tax code, it's going to be a nightmare -- in my opinion, not necessarily in that of my colleagues. So, as you know, I've written somewhat a different approach. And it says, let's not do this. But just so, who would win here? Suppose you just said, look, what we're interested in is just one question, whether Congress wanted a court to give, in this kind of situation, deference to the agency. And the answer will be, it depends. Chevron is a good rule of thumb, but it isn't a straightjacket. So what you'd look at here is it's the FCC that is in charge of national communications, of which this is part. There is a specific provision, as your colleague points out, that says, \"but don't interfere with the States when they are citing stuff.\" But then there is a limitation to that specific provision, which consists of six or seven parts, all of which maintain a lot of authority in the FCC or rules about what they are not supposed to do. And then, here, it uses the word \"reasonable.\" So where you have a Federal agency with expertise that's in charge of this kind of area and they have rule-making authority, and you have a statute like this, which is a little bit ambiguous, but not too, in respect to the point about whether they do interpretation, you'd add up those factors and make a decision.",
  "I mean, that's such a simple -- I mean, that's Louis Jaffe. That -- that's the founders of administrative law. That's everybody until we get into a straightjacket. And it isn't -- even Chevron doesn't go against us, if you don't think of it as a straightjacket.",
  "I didn't make it up. It was Louis Jaffe.",
  "I mean, I think you can show, which I will spare you at the moment, all the cases like Meade are consistent with what I said. And cases that are not consistent are consistent with what Judge Friendly said years ago, where he said there is no coherence to the Supreme Court's cases in this area; when they like a result, they say they have deference, and, when they don't like it, they say they don't.",
  "You don't have to -- I'm sorry I brought this up.",
  "Okay. Now --",
  "I -- I dissented in that, I think.",
  "Right. And so I agree with you, this flows a fortiori from the majority. But I didn't think -- and this is what I wonder -- is -- you say unelected Federal bureaucrats. Administrative law is about Federal administration. That is Federal administrative law. And I've heard, here, people say we're talking about them adding something. I didn't think that's what was at issue. I thought that there is a word in the statute, \"reasonable,\" and what the administrators did at the FCC was to interpret that word. Am I right or wrong?",
  "What was added? What was added?",
  "Reasonable -- reasonable is uncertain who. Who has -- it doesn't tell us who had the authority.",
  "What does it leave out? What does it leave out, your theory? A policeman's a law enforcement officer. What does he do on his job that isn't in a law enforcement role?",
  "Oh, I see.",
  "So your idea here is a park policeman who is engaged in law enforcement some of the time, but engaged in giving tours the rest of the time. You're saying what you would do is say when he's engaged in the law enforcement he's covered, but not when he's engaged in the tour.",
  "Well, why isn't this -- why isn't what the prison guard does law enforcement? I mean, the law says these people are going to be locked up and he's enforcing that.",
  "It says he's going to be in prison under these da, da, da, da, da. You know, all that da, da, da means the conditions of the prison, et cetera, they're all regulations, rules, statutes. He's enforcing them, why not?",
  "Well, so now you're saying what those three things could provide the definition?",
  "And are you saying that?",
  "Yeah, but EPA is not what I'm thinking of, I don't think they are. I am thinking of policemen. Okay. Now, one basic job of a policeman is to patrol, but not arresting people, not searching and not seizing evidence. They are on patrol. That's basically what they do. All right? Is that a law enforcement activity?",
  "Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I mean in places -- it's Federal, I understand. So I'm sure we can find analogies in the Federal situation to ordinary policemen.",
  "All right. But FBI agents, who are the federal police, they're people on Federal enclaves, for example, there are -- they are on Federal enclaves, they act like policemen, okay.",
  "Okay. That's favorable. I mean, what I'm thinking of is either you can have a broad definition or one that's going to get into trouble when we consider real policemen. So if you have a broad one, then I don't see how prison guards get out of it. If you have a narrow one, my guess is we could find lots of Federal policemen who really are policemen who aren't doing what falls -- who are doing what falls outside your narrow definition. I wish I could think of better examples, but I came up with the ones I did.",
  "No, but you are allowing him to use those seeds for anything else he wants to do. It has nothing to do with those seeds. There are three generations of seeds. Maybe three generations of seeds is enough.",
  "It is for this example. First of you have the Monsanto, the first generation they sold. They have children, which is the second generation. And those children have children, which is the third generation, okay? So bad joke.",
  "So we are talking here -- he can do what he wants with the first generation. Anything he wants. And moreover, when he buys them from Monsanto, he can make new seeds. He can make generation 2 because they've licensed him to do it. Here, he buys generation 2. Now, he can do what he wants with those seeds. But I'll tell you, there is a problem because the coming about of the third generation is itself the infringement. So the second generation seeds have nothing to do with it. If he went into a room and had a box that he bought from a lab and he put rocks in it and he said, hocus-pocus and lo and behold out came the third generation of seeds, he would have infringed Monsanto's patent with that third generation, would he not?",
  "No, he wouldn't have? You mean if he goes and finds a new way of making these seeds, which happens to do with you pick some grass and you intertwine it and various things like that, and lo and behold you have a perfect copy of Monsanto's patented seed, he hasn't made it, he hasn't infringed? Why not?",
  "My question is the same with the grass as with the magic box. I am saying the problem for you here, I think, is that, infringement lies in the fact that he made generation three. It has nothing to do with generation 2. That has just a coincidence. But that is, in fact, the way he made these seeds. But he can sell, resell generation 2, he can do whatever he wants with it. If he sterilizes it and uses them in a circus, he can do it. The only thing he cannot do is he cannot create generation 3, just as he couldn't use generation 2 seeds to rob a bank. You know, there are certain things that the law prohibits. What it prohibits here is making a copy of the patented invention. And that is what he did. So it's generation 3 that concerns us. And that's the end of it. Now, what is your response to that?",
  "I'm still not getting the answer. I'm going to try once more. Now, when you buy generation 2, well, there are a lot of things you can do with it. You can feed it to animals, you can feed it to your family, make tofu turkeys. I mean, you know, there are a lot of things you can do with it, alright. But I'll give you two that you can't do. One, you can't pick up those seeds that you've just bought and throw them in a child's face. You can't do that because there's a law that says you can't do it. Now, there's another law that says you cannot make copies of a patented invention. And that law you have violated when you use it to make generation 3, just as you have violated the law against assault were you to use it to commit an assault. Now, I think that's what the Federal Circuit is trying to get at. And so it really has nothing to do with the Exhaustion Doctrine. It has to do with some other doctrine, perhaps, that -- that somehow you think should give you the right to use something that has as a basic purpose making a copy of itself. Maybe you should, but I don't see that. Where is that in the law?",
  "Yes.",
  "Is that there? Is that -- is that there in the Exhaustion Doctrine?",
  "That's true, but that's what I thought you were going to respond. I thought you were going to respond to me that my question then makes it infringement when your client buys generation 1 from Monsanto because they buy generation 1 from Monsanto, they plant it in the ground and lo and behold up comes generation 2. And generation 2, on the basis of what I was asking you, is just as much a violation. But I think, though I'll find out from them, that the response of that is, yes, you're right, it is just as much of a violation. That's why we, Monsanto, give the buyer a license to do it. And so it all seems to work out. You don't need any exception. There's no exception from anything. When you create a new generation, you have made a patented item, which you cannot do without the approval of the patent owner. Therefore, Monsanto gives that approval when you buy generation 1. Now, it seems to me all to work out without any need for exception. And I'm putting to you my whole thought so that you can respond to it.",
  "Well, is -- I mean, that is an interesting question because you can imagine -- you see, this is -- your answer -- this really deals with all -- it could be with genetic patents, with -- with hosts of things which are self-replicating.",
  "And some of the self-replicating items, which are infringing items, end up inadvertently all over the place. Is there anything in the patent law that deals with that? Is an involuntary infringer treated the same under patent law as a voluntary infringer?",
  "Is -- is there precautions that you take? I mean, is there anything in patent law that helps?",
  "Right.",
  "Well, the person plants it.",
  "I mean, he plants it, but he doesn't even know, you know. He's just got -- we can imagine a lot of circumstances where this would be a -- where Justice Kagan's question could apply.",
  "But you're just saying that would need a --",
  "-- modification in patent law.",
  "What about -- what about the other question --",
  "No, no, no, I want to go back to a different question that was asked, which was the question what do you think we should do about this other aspect of the case, the licensing aspect? I mean, I would have thought it doesn't concern Monsanto's license of generation 1 because, insofar as it's relevant, here generation 1 carries the license that is just permissive. It is to create generation 2. But -- but they also said something in the circuit about a license -- about a restriction, implied perhaps, on -- on the use of generation 2 by the grain elevator for creating generation 3, namely you can't do that. Now, they -- they thought, the circuit, that there's some restriction in a license and they have a doctrine that seems to say that you can restrict licenses -- through licenses the use of a product after it's been sold. And that would seem contrary to the First Sale Doctrine.",
  "But you don't need that because in each instance, as you say, you are making new ones. It's the making of the new ones, not the use of the old ones, where you prevent that from being done.",
  "Then you use the word \"use.\"",
  "Then you use the word \"use\" and you get to the same place.",
  "I don't think you can think of an example. I mean, you say -- I don't think you can think of an example where if you win on the other ground, you can produce a bad result for the manufacturer or the inventor because you haven't treated the conditional sale like a license. I'm not saying you can't, I just can't think of one.",
  "So lease it.",
  "So lease it.",
  "Don't people or animals eat them?",
  "Well, then why is it the only way you can do is to plant them? That isn't the only thing you could do with it.",
  "You can go buy them in the grain elevator and sell them for other things.",
  "The invented product. The invented thing. The invented aspect of the seed is it has a gene in it that repels some other insecticide or something that they have. I understand that.",
  "You don't use that. I don't think they used that particular -- well, go ahead. You go ahead.",
  "The people buying from grain elevators are mostly people who take these chips -- whatever they are, the seeds -- and they sell them for making tofu, they sell them to eat, or this -- there are loads of uses, aren't there?",
  "If I only have time to read one case -­",
  "-- or possibly two, which would you like me to read? I think that's, basically, the question.",
  "Okay. But I assume you don't want me -­",
  "I'll look at those. But I think the Commerce Clause, basically, has, as its objective, insofar as it's dormant, to prevent a legislature or decisionmaker within its State discriminating in favor of their own State producers.",
  "Now, it's pretty hard for me to put this case into that mold.",
  "If it does what the -- I had exactly the same question for both parts of your argument, that what it's their -- am I right in thinking that anyone can get any information -- anyone in any State can get any information that pertains to him or her? Is that right or not?",
  "Is that right or not?",
  "Okay. That's what I wanted to know, whether it's separate or not.",
  "Anyone from Alaska to Hawaii can get any information that pertains to him or her. Second, that this has nothing to do with judicial records, there is a different statute that makes judicial records public.",
  "Okay. So we're, now, talking about the class of information, other than the two classes I've mentioned. And I then ended up -- and I'd like you to add something to this, if you can, that, really, this is about -- since getting information involves usually a benefit to the recipient, but, sometimes, harm to the person the information is about, that willing to run that harm and risk of harm is the interest in State good government, okay?",
  "Now, if that's the interest, that's an interest that probably a State has the right, just as it has the right to say other people can't vote in State elections, if that's the interest, then I guess it could take reasonable measures related to that interest. All right. Now, that is the -- the argument or the position that I would appreciate your addressing.",
  "He -- he has a very reasonable request in my view, but the question isn't the reasonableness of his request. The question's -­ you know, whether they can do it. And the -- the way -­ the work -- the thing that's bothering me on the work part is this: It seems that the work is sort of tailored to the statute. It's in this way. I -- I have a job, and my job is to study election processes. And I write reports, and I find amazing things about differences among States. They're truly amazing. And I say -- you know, it would help me a lot if I was actually a voter in each of these States. That would help my job. It would lend authenticity, and I could learn things that I probably couldn't learn otherwise. Now, does that add anything to the argument? I mean, I don't think so, but it sounds a little bit like you're making that kind of argument -­",
  "-- and -- and they either do have the right or they don't. And I don't know that it helps that I -- that I say, well, I really want it for my work.",
  "Well, that -- that's where he comes in with his argument because I -- I agree, you can -- you don't have -- let's say the most fabulous reason for doing this, but you have a reason.",
  "And so the question is, does it have to be better than that? And -- and they are saying yes. And, as I heard it, this -- what I would characterize as a strong argument -- this sort of, first of all, strikes me as a stronger argument, is that, look, if we go back into history, out-of-State real estate people could always get information about property -- let's say they had a client who wanted to buy it. Now, you've protected that. But, in today's world, it's important that we get statistics about this, too, because our economy is national. If we understand how States are taxing their real estate, we will know to what extent they increase the value, to what extent they increase the rate, to what extent they really get the money they are supposed to, to what extent they might get money or not get money in the future. And all of those things are nationally important, so that people can put them together and make -- better than we have done in the past -­ predictions about what is likely to happen to States and, hence, the national economy. All right. That's -- that's the kind of argument he's making. And he says, so, therefore, there is a national interest in the flow of this information. And that means you have to have a better than \"uh-huh\" kind of rationale. That's -- that's what he's saying, I think.",
  "Well, to be fair, I -- I",
  "So -- so suppose -- I mean, I think they have an argument, saying, of course, this information would be useful for gathering national statistics and helping the national economy. I think that's true. On the other hand, you say, well, but, look, there must be something left that the States can reserve to their own citizens, there must be something. They can't protect their own commerce; that's clear. They can't discriminate against people who want to come here and live here. That's clear. They can't do this and that and the other thing, but, gee, there must be something. I mean, can't they reserve at least their -- their beaches for their own citizens? No. Parking near their beaches? Well, maybe. And -- and maybe deer. And, if not this, what? That's the end. Okay? So that's, basically, what you are saying. This is just an interest in trying to find out how State institutions work, and the voters have the main interest there, and this is other -- so you say the other one is attenuated, but not non-existent. He says the other is important, though he recognizes States should be able to do something. So if you were me, how would you decide? How would you choose?",
  "What is the standard, because you know the -- the Privileges and Immunities Clause is -- is considerably opaque, and there are very few cases on it. And so what -- how would you tell me to -- to resolve that -- that tension because there is a tension.",
  "Well, I'd really like to hear -- I'd really like to hear what you are going to say.",
  "I wanted -- I just wanted to hear what you were going to say in answer to the second part of Justice Sotomayor's earlier question. And, to remind you of that, you were going to explain to us, which I felt I needed, the second term -- that second term. And that just says, \"FV,\" for value.",
  "But I did notice, that if you make .23 times fair value, not quite by coincidence, happens to be what the companies would have made over a period of 2 years in profit, had it been the truth that the value of such companies was, as valued by the market, 9 times their earnings because a company that's valued 9 times its earnings earns about 11 point something percent per year -- taking aside all other factors -- and 2 years' worth is that. And I don't know if I've got that part right, but, if I do have that part right, then what this tax does is it takes the profits the firms actually -- actually made over 2 years -- not quite actually. It assumes twice the -- the value of the first year. You see, so whatever they made the first year -- and, if it's only 6 months, it's twice 6 months -- you know -- that first part figures out what they really made over the first year and then multiplies it by two. And you take that, and you subtract from that the amount that they would have made over 2 years. Now -- so it looked, to me, pretty -- this helps you, of course, but -- but it also is calculated on an average, the average of the first year's profit, they consider that the average; and, therefore, they are right in saying -- you know, a firm that was only in business for 6 months will be taxed -- the whole 2-year extra will be taken away, even when there was no 2-year extra, you see? So that firm would have paid more than their gross income. Of course, there is no such firm, and that's their problem, but we come to that later. But I want your view, if you can -- if I've explained it clearly enough, so you get where I'm coming from, and -- and -- if -- if I have explained that clearly enough, I'd really appreciate what you think about it.",
  "It will do that for firms that are in business for 4 years.",
  "Absolutely. It won't do that for a firm that was in business 6 months. And -- and --",
  "A very different number.",
  "Indeed, a number that could exceed the money -- all the money they really make in the next 2 years.",
  "I could.",
  "Yes, that's correct. That's not true. There is only one company like that; absolutely right.",
  "And -- but -- but some, particularly on the other side, want to make quite a lot out of that fact. And they want to make quite a lot out of the fact that for that single -- whatever it's called railroad something --",
  "I know -- I know they didn't. It didn't happen in this instance.",
  "Okay. Okay.",
  "If they know what it really was, I guess they're all billionaires. You've got triple billionaires. I mean, if you could go and figure out what companies could really be sold at, as opposed to what the market says, I think I have the solution for you. I don't know why either of us is working here.",
  "So, since there is no real value, I -- I mean, maybe there is because they did it in the form of an IPO, and the share then went the next day into the market, and, when it went the next day into the market, did the market pay a lot more?",
  "Really?",
  "All right. Then you could use that. You could use that, I guess.",
  "But, how does that relate to the number 9?",
  "Yes, yes. But, of course, in the -- in the past, we are making a prediction about what efficiencies will be realized, and, in the future, we know. So the one thing we don't know, since life is risky -- or we do know for sure -- is whatever it shows up to be in the future couldn't have been the value that shareholders would put on it in the past because they know life a risky.",
  "So the reason that that is relevant here, of course, is this number 9 is a made-up number. It may be made up by great experts, but since they are all not geniuses who are -- own the whole world, they must not be perfect experts.",
  "Isn't that true?",
  "No, it was a number picked by whatever company had -- what is it, the -- the lowest price earnings ratio or something like that.",
  "Okay. But that doesn't -- that means whatever company that the shareholders thought would deviate the least from whatever the return was and that doesn't apply the others. But you don't want a lecture from me on this subject. What I want is an answer from you, and the answer I want from you is this: As I read it and once understand that this number is a semi made-up number, I did look at that second term, and I thought that .23 times 9 is about 2 years' worth -- about 2 years' worth of profits that would be expected, all things left out of it, except profit. And so then, once I saw that, I looked at the first term. And the first term seemed, to me, to be their actual profit -- their actual profit on an annual basis multiplied by about the same number, you see? And so what we do is we take -- about multiplying, you see -- so we take about two years' worth of profit that they actually made, and we subtract from that two years' worth that our experts tell us they should have made as -- on the basis of the original market price. The rest is excess profit, and we seize all of it, for two years only. And, by the way, if a company had only six months' worth, well, then -- you know, they might really be hurt because, after all, they only earned six months at the annual rate that showed something, and maybe they didn't really earn it over the next 18 months. But the reply was there was no such company. And, of course, because time periods vary, rates will vary. But I don't know that that matters for an income tax. It's not a question of the rate; it's a question on what you impose it. And you impose it on income because, as he says, there are two choices here. Number is really calculated on the basis of income, and there is another number going on, the actual floatation value, and this third thing, which is called the number 9. But, primarily, it is the income that makes the difference. Now, that's his argument. What's your response? That's his argument, as I understand it. I don't want to put words in his mouth. But you -- you explain it to me.",
  "But I said, so what? Now, I you can answer that by saying, no, it's not so what. mean, isn't an income tax dependant upon whether it's a tax on income, not the rate? And -- and whether some companies pay a high rate and others pay a low rate, even if that's totally arbitrary, wouldn't make a definition to the characterization.",
  "As long as you're not -- they actually have the gross income from which this comes.",
  "No, it will. Wait, wait, wait, wait. It is greater than the profit they earned during the year, but it is not greater than the profit that they earned during the two years -- or whatever the period is that everybody's paying this on.",
  "Is that right?",
  "So, here, by good luck for them or bad luck for you or whatever it is, they have not taxed more than the gross income of the companies. Is that -- is that --",
  "Four-year period. Well, that's -- well -- well, is it not going to be an income tax if what the U.S. government says, though it hasn't said it, it could say, we want -- we want 35 percent of what you earn over six years. Okay. That's what we want. Now, that's still an income tax, isn't it?",
  "So you say whatever -- if they impose it on more than a year, any -- any country that calculates the income tax over a period for more than a year is outside the tax treaty because it's essential to the nature of the American income tax system that it be calculated year by year. You're hesitating to say that, but I think -­",
  "On that -- on the question of how to treat, I -- there isn't authority, but, I mean, if I'm quite honest about how I think about it, I think the people in the tax court actually, usually, know more about it than the judges who are not on the tax court. And so when I get an opinion and the tax court all thinks one thing and then the court of appeals is thinking something else and it's highly technical, I -- I tend to be tempted to say, well, the tax courts deserve something. Now, is there anything, really? Am I just doing that wrong, if I did that?",
  "If the reformulation -- think of -- think that first term. Put it in your mind. Now, that first term does have a number -- .23 -- and let's do times 9, which is that valuation business. And what you get is a little over 2. Okay? And you are going to get that every time. That's not going to vary from company-to-company. That varies as long as the universe is here. So we know we're going to multiply .2 -- rather, 2 point something times that first part of the first term. And that first part of the first term consists of nothing other than, for the four-year company, the average one-year profit. So the only -- what you are telling people to do in that first term is simply multiply by a little over than 2 -- a little more than 2 -- the average profit earned over a four-year period. That's what it says. So there is nothing there but income. It's average income, I grant you. But there is nothing there but income. And then what you subtract from that -- what you subtract from that is a quarter -- is a quarter of the value, I grant you. But it's a hypothetical value used with the number 9 of what one-quarter of the value of the floatation price taken in. So there's an aspect to it that does have -- unless you do it the way I was doing it initially -- there is an aspect to it that does concern at least a hypothetical value. But the heart of the equation, in determining this so-called present value, is nothing other than taking average income over the four-year period. Now, if I'm right -- am I right about that?",
  "Okay.",
  "No, no. It is -- the very first part of the first part is the profits -- the average profit over the four-year period. It says P. And then P, with all of this day business, that's just times 365 because they want to annualize it. So, if you have a four years, what you are going to have is you -- you will have 365 times -- and then it's going to wipe out, and you will have divided by 4. So you will take the total profit over the four-year period, and you'll divide it by 4. That gives you the annual profit. So, now, we have finished the first half of the first part. And the second half -- and we are going to take .23 of that. Okay? No, we are not going to take any yet. Taking .23 -- you're going to take .23 of the number 9, and that leaves you with the 2 -- that brings you to the little over 2.2.",
  "So what we are doing is taking the average annual profit over a four-year period, we average it, and then we multiply it by two point something. Okay? And what that is doing -- and then what that is doing is giving you just the average annual, two years' worth of average annual. And, from that, we subtract a quarter of what they received in the initial price, which happens to be what the market -- if it really was 9 -- about was expecting it to earn during a two-year period. That's why I put in the last part. But even if I am wrong about that, I am right about the first half, aren't I.",
  "That's why I said 50 percent.",
  "Yes, yes, yes. That rate could be a problem for somebody at some time, in some place.",
  "It wasn't a problem here because all of these companies, but one, did have and did fit within the four-year category. So as to all these companies, but one, it did not exceed gross income; it did not exceed net income; it was 50 -- what the number that he arrived at.",
  "It is?",
  "Of the one year, you haven't calculated based on one year, but it's 50 percent of two years, isn't it? I'm sorry. I am now confused enough that I am not following you.",
  "All right.",
  "All right. I have said enough -- my law clerks will have picked this up. They will have written it down, and I will be able to go back with the transcript and study it, which I will do.",
  "Why -- why should it be changed? I mean, why should companies -- American companies doing business abroad, in borderline cases, have to pay tax on the same income twice?",
  "So he can do this -- I didn't understand this. I'm sorry. Joe Smith is convicted on day 1. The transcript appears 9 months later. Okay? 9 months later his new lawyer, who is supposed to proceed on appeal, reads the transcript. He thinks, hmm, I think there was a problem with his lawyer at the trial, and I would like to raise this claim and get a new trial. And you are saying what he does is he goes back to the trial court, and he says, Judge, I just read this, it raises some factual matters; will you please give me an evidentiary hearing with the old lawyer there and me there, so we can develop this? Now, that is what -- how Texas works?",
  "Because I did not get that impression from the State Bar brief, but you are saying that is how it works?",
  "You go to the court of appeals, and what do you say? You say, court of appeals, will you please direct the trial court to have an evidentiary hearing on the adequacy of trial counsel before you hear the appeal?",
  "Is that yes or no?",
  "Okay. So you are just saying that they are all wrong about how Texas works, so I guess you -- you could refer to a case where that happened.",
  "Well, in what case did that happen?",
  "Cooks vs. State. And they got the transcript, months later, and they looked back, and they said, oh, dear, there was something wrong with the trial performance. So we go to the Federal appeals -- the State appeals court, and we say, State appeals court, please direct an evidentiary hearing. And they directed an evidentiary hearing, and they had an evidentiary hearing before the trial judge -- really, what would have happened on State habeas?",
  "All right. Now, I am puzzled about what I'm supposed to do because I would have thought that the standard's fairly easy, that this individual must always have one full and fair opportunity to present his claim of inadequate assistance at trial. There are certain things that could deprive him of that. One, his lawyer in the habeas State could be incompetent -- all these lawyers could be incompetent. Or the State, at a certain stage, didn't give him enough proceeding. All right? Well, what do I do, where people are disagreeing about how the State procedure works, as to whether it was full and fair? What do I do? What is your suggestion? By the way, if he doesn't get the full and fair, he still has to show to the Federal habeas judge that he has a substantial claim, that that trial was not -- so what do you suggest?",
  "Right now -- but I'm saying What do you -- I would like you to sympathize with my problem. My problem is I have seen -- I have a bunch of briefs. And they seem to me that what you have just described is a full and fair procedure to develop all these evidentiary matters before the appeal even takes place. It exists in Texas, and, therefore, unless he could say his lawyer there was incompetent, he's out of luck. Okay? The other side seems to say, no, it doesn't exist in Texas. And, now, what am I supposed to do, since I am not an expert on Texas procedure?",
  "I tried that once in a case involving Pennsylvania, and the result was such that I resolved never to do it again.",
  "But -- but don't say never. All right. So one thing we got --",
  "What happens -- imagine we have a State supreme court, and it says, okay, you could raise this claim on appeal, we don't advise it, we think -- it's so much easier to do it in State habeas. Please do it in State habeas. It's not absolutely binding, but do it. Okay? That's what they are saying. Now, he raises nine of his ten ineffective assistance of counsel claims in State habeas. And the State habeas court says, no, you are out on all nine, but he never raised the tenth. Now, we are in Federal court, and the prisoner says -- you know, that tenth claim is fabulous. And the judge says, it is substantial. And he says, you know why it wasn't raised before? Because my counsel was incompetent on State habeas, and they didn't raise it on appeal because that's just how people normally do things in Texas, they don't raise it on appeal. They wait until State habeas. Has that person had a full and fair opportunity to raise this tenth claim in the State court?",
  "They are not saying never. They are just saying it works so much better. What they say is we appoint State habeas counsel at the same time, it's easier to develop it. Please. We won't say never. We'll just say hardly ever. Now, what's -- what is the -- what is your view about whether that person has had a full and fair opportunity to develop his tenth ineffective assistance claim in the State courts.",
  "I'm not even thinking about Martinez at the moment because I don't want to get into whether it is an extension or just an elaboration or just a situation covered, but they didn't think of it or just a lot of other things. I just want to know, given Martinez, what do you think?",
  "What is the standard you are advocating?",
  "But if, in fact, they say, yes, there is a route, never used, but once, filled with minefields, very hard when compared with the other one, there you say, it isn't Martinez, it is a totally -- it is a new thing because Martinez, after all, had no rationale.",
  "I'm being sarcastic there, but I don't mean to be. I mean, you see what I'm trying to get to?",
  "Yes, the dissent said that.",
  "So does this boil down to -- I mean, you have a one-year statute of limitations. Now, I guess -- suppose Hurricane Katrina came along and threw all the documents away for two months. I guess the Court could extend it, couldn't it?",
  "Yes, I mean, don't they toll it when there's some -- when the courthouse burns down?",
  "All right. So you want to say and that's also true when the person is actually innocent, if you can prove that, delay it. Is that what you're saying?",
  "Well, he has his one year, and he gives four criteria, and the four criteria, sometimes, are not exclusive. And you want to say yours is one of the times.",
  "And a different one you say is when he's actually innocent.",
  "All right. If that's correct, then suppose that he purposely has delayed filing this until everybody's dead, so they know they can't prove it anymore.",
  "Well, what is your answer?",
  "All right he, can he toll it under those circumstances?",
  "So the answer is, in your view, if he deliberately and -- and, without cause, delays it for 5 years, his filing, just so everybody will die, you would say, okay, I'm not worried about him?",
  "Is that right? Would you, or wouldn't you?",
  "Does he win or lose?",
  "I mean, what do you think?",
  "I didn't ask that. I said what do you think?",
  "Yes, you do. I made up the hypothetical.",
  "But they admit --",
  "I'm just trying to -- they admit that, if he's diligent, it's okay?",
  "Yes.",
  "Do you believe he's diligent?",
  "So the State is asking for a diligence requirement. You admit that there's a requirement that -- that you have to not really use this as a sham device, so we're pretty close.",
  "But there is a sham -- there is a sham and deliberate delay requirement, not a diligence one, but there is a sham. I'm not trying to trick you.",
  "What I'm trying to say is maybe we're arguing about something that we could solve; that is, in fact, many of these people don't have lawyers. They don't understand the statute of limitations, they don't understand what diligence might consist of looking later. You agree that it's -- it shouldn't be a sham, shouldn't do it deliberately. All right. Now, if I'm thinking about that, how would you advise me to write it?",
  "What do you think about the words \"discovered in exercise of due diligence\"? You know, you could manipulate those words so as to deal with the circumstance of the -- say, below-average IQ person who doesn't have a lawyer, who isn't certain about what to do, and what counts as diligence and discovery in that case. Is that -- are you objecting to that? Do you object to that? What do you think?",
  "Can I ask you a particular specific quick question?",
  "As I read this, this concerns people arrested for a felony, a crime of violence, attempted crime of violence, burglary, or attempted burglary.",
  "And so we're not talking about people who are driving cars and traffic stops and all these other things?",
  "The only thing we have to decide is whether a person, where there's probable cause to arrest a person for those four crimes, their fingerprints are all taken.",
  "And whether they also can take DNA. That's the issue?",
  "Okay. Nothing else. Thank you.",
  "That -- that part is surprising. Then do you think the States are wrong? I mean, they all say in their brief, in footnote 10, DNA identification database samples have been processed in as few as 2 days in California and -- although around 30 days has been average. So I guess the technology is there, now, to process this in 2 days, not 9 days.",
  "In the case of -- do you have any information -- are there instances with fingerprints where returns have not come back for as long as 30 days? Or are they all, or almost all, done in 5 minutes?",
  "I would like a complete answer to what Justice Alito and Justice Kagan both were asking, I think. I mean, to summarize that, if I look, in terms of intrusion, I am not talking legally, I am talking practically. It doesn't seem to me -- I can argue that it is certainly a much lesser intrusion than fingerprints. You have to stand there, have the thing rolled; your -- stick out your tongue. I mean, it's hard to say it's more, for me, I'm not saying for others. Accuracy, it's much more accurate, and that doesn't just help the defendant. There is a whole brief here filed by the victims that have case after case, where people spent 5 years in prison, wrongly, and where this system and the CODIS helped victims avoid being arrested and sent to jail when they were innocent, so it works both ways. So, one, it's no more intrusive; two, it is much more accurate. And three and four and five, how it's different and worse in practice, is what I would ask you to summarize.",
  "And, by the way, when you talk about what information you could get out of it, there is a brief filed by leading scientists in the field, and I came away from the brief thinking there isn't much more information because fingerprints can be abused, too. Of course, you can learn loads from fingerprints. Photos, try photos; my God, you could learn a lot, who he was, who recognized -- you know, so all these things could be abused. But I came away from that brief, frankly, to think, well, in terms of the possibility of abuse, it's there, but these other things, photos, too.",
  "Okay. So, now, you tell me, in light of that hostile question --",
  "-- I would like you -- I would like you to tell me, okay, it's different from fingerprints and worse because of one, two, three, and I will write it down, and I'll remember it. I promise.",
  "I think I can totally lose this because -- because I have a confusion that you can clear up. There is something to what you say. I see what you are saying. But what does this word \"identification\" mean? It's used for identification. We have a person, he's been arrested. He writes his name down, Mr. Smith. Maybe he's lying. We have his picture. Well, his picture's pretty good. If he turns up in a bar somewhere in the future, we can look, see, and that's awfully good. And, now, you say, well, what is fingerprinting doing that photos aren't doing, in terms of identification? What does it do, in terms of just identification?",
  "What does it do?",
  "What does that mean, confirming his identity? We have -- you mean what? What exactly?",
  "Oh, really? I mean, do you think the fingerprints -- where do you go to find out if he's Alonzo King? A lot of people have never had their fingerprints taken before.",
  "That's what it's for? To determine what his name really is?",
  "Ah. You want to determine what his name really is, plus his adjudicated criminal history, and, here, we have the DNA, which I guess might or might not help determine what his name really is, and, with criminal history, it does about the same. And also fingerprints are sometimes used to -- for unsolved crimes, and they are sometimes used for unsolved crimes, but your point really is more for unsolved crimes. Have I got it.",
  "I would have thought you would have gone back to Calder and Bull. And Calder and Bull, which this Court refers to all the time, in these kinds of cases, has four categories, and the only one that fits this case is a law that changes the punishment --",
  "-- and inflicts a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when committed. So whatever these other hypotheticals are, they do not involve -- they are not laws that change the punishment, but yours is a law that changes the punishment.",
  "I wouldn't concede that.",
  "Well, it isn't, but that, I think, is an undecided question at best. If you won the case on that ground, I would say that what the guidelines and the Sentencing Commission are best at, gathering information from across the country, and saying a typical person who commits this crime in a typical way should be sentenced to the typical range that applies -- let's say 18 to 24 months. That would be down the drain. And I think that Rita, in fact, and the other cases have, at the very most, left open and maybe decided against you the question of when a court of appeals gets the sentence from a judge who does not apply the guideline because he doesn't like the policy judgment. That's a different matter from when he applies it then when he thinks he shouldn't apply it because the person in front of him doesn't meet the -- the policy conditions. Those are different. The Commission has the expertise in the first, the judge in the second. And so there is at least a question as to whether the court of appeals should give more leeway to the guidelines in the first and more leeway to the judge in the second. Now, I think Rita is consistent with that, and I think every opinion we have written is consistent with that. And I'd hate to see that suddenly decided and changed in a way I think is inappropriate in this case. So have you all thought that through? And is the position of the government, now, that we think the guidelines, even if it's a policy matter that they have gathered evidence on, are entitled to nothing, if they run across a district judge who happens to think, though he was an outlier, that the outliers were right as a matter of policy, which, of course, will always be true. Every judge who is an outlier thinks the outliers are right. Otherwise, why would he do it? You see? Now, I didn't know that issue was in this case and that changes the case dramatically for me. And I thought we could decide this just on the ground that this is a law that changes punishment. It's a law. It's a regulation. And Justice Scalia, I thought, was completely right. The question is whether it inflicts greater punishment. And there is a test on that, and the controlling inquiry is whether retroactive application of a change in a law that affects punishment created a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached. All right? And that's -- that's what I thought the -- the framework of law was in this case. Now, this is sort of tough for you on oral argument because I'm just, perhaps, bringing it all up to get it all out there and see what you think.",
  "I see -- I see, now, where you're going. What I think you're saying is, whatever the sentence is, I am the judge, I read the guidelines. Now, I may think that I am more likely to get reversed if I -- I substitute a different view than the Commission had on a matter of policy. That's all true. But, still, I don't have to do it. No matter what it is, I can not use the guidelines. And, if I get reversed on other grounds, or the sentence is not reasonable, da, da, da, da, da. But there's no legal binding nature there. That's your point, I think.",
  "All right. If that's exactly your point --",
  "All right. But, now, I can narrow what the question I think is.",
  "Why? I mean, I could be your arbitrator. I know exactly what I would do. I would ask for five things, which will be admitted, and one thing that's going to be difficult for them to prove. I don't see why an expert in antitrust would have to have this enormous report.",
  "Do you want to concede I'm wrong? --",
  "Yes, maybe.",
  "If you want to argue that stuff, which I -- then I guess maybe they're right. Maybe you do need experts on that. I don't know that we want to get into this, but I just want to know if you want to concede that there is no way to win this case in arbitration unless they spend $300,000.",
  "Before you get to that, I have two questions. One is on the point you've just made because I -- I agree, I understand it is fairly well established, this doctrine, but I don't see quite how it works. Suppose there's a Tyler claim, a Truth in Lending Act -- you know, something like that, and the claim is a fairly -- it's worth about $10,000 or so. And so the plaintiff says you violated the act, pay me the $10,000. Now, he happens to come up with a theory that is really far out; and the more far out the theory, the harder it is to prove. And the harder it is to prove, the more you need expensive experts. And do we go case by case, saying -- you know, where you have a really weird theory that's going to require 17 experts and endless studies, you don't have to have an arbitration claim, or you don't have to follow it in this instance, but everybody else does. Now -- now, is -- is that something, in other words, we're supposed to look at case by case, which would produce the odd result I suggested? Or do we do it by categories? How does the doctrine work?",
  "No, what I'll do because I work with my own hypothetical, I'll have a far-out case, but yet not quite speculative. In other words, what I'm trying to suggest is it's an odd doctrine that just says, plaintiff by plaintiff, you can ignore an arbitration clause if you can get a case that's expensive enough, and there we are. I haven't seen it work, and I haven't seen enough to know how it does work. And I guess you haven't either, but -- but I'm concerned about that.",
  "Well, that doesn't seem right to me. Now, Hovenkamp would be the person I would hire as the arbitrator. So surely he does know -- or Phil Arita -- a blessed memory. And they're under the instruction to get this done cheap. Well, I think that might be possible. That might be possible because it's only the question of damages that's tough here because if you don't have the double -- there's only one monopoly profit at the two levels, da, da, da, and we don't need to go through that. But I can think of a way of getting it done pretty cheap. But regardless, your expert here didn't talk about the cost of arbitration. He did use the word once. But as I read pages 88 through 92, it seemed to me he was talking about the cost of litigation, not the cost of arbitration. And -- and I wouldn't proceed necessarily with all those reports he does to impress to the jury, or even the judge. This is Phil Arita. You don't need to impress him. And -- so, so, so -- hasn't the Second Circuit looked, assuming your doctrine's in place, to the wrong set of costs: The cost of litigation? Even though they use the word \"arbitration,\" that isn't what your expert told me.",
  "In arbitration or in court?",
  "Does he take into account the fact that the arbitrator can be him? And moreover, could, in fact, work under an instruction keep these costs down?",
  "No, that isn't the point. If I were doing this offhand, I would say everything is conceded, but for one thing: Since there is no double monopoly power, there is only one monopoly power at the two levels which can be exercised, the only way the person is damaged is if in fact you've raised entry barriers. So you'd say to the plaintiff, how are you going to prove that? And you'd read it and submit a report. Now, I'm not saying this is the right way to go about it. All I'm saying is it's hard for me to figure out on the basis of that affidavit, which talks about courts, why this has to be so expensive. So what do I do?",
  "One other thing which I didn't understand, and that's why I am asking. What they chose as the remedy here was sever the arbitration clause if you want, it seemed to be, and go to court. All right. Now, I don't know where that power comes from. So if you were going to improve this contract in the direction that you would like, why couldn't you sever the part about the confidentiality, or why couldn't you require -- you have some awfully big merchants. Like, I don't know -- probably, you have maybe Costco, maybe Walmart, maybe -- you know, these people are not without money. Though your client, may be. But -- go get these contributions. Go for -- there are many ways you can treat this particular set of words in the arbitration clause, short of severing it entirely. And -- and what about that? What's your view on that? What do you think?",
  "There is no authority that I could find for the prop -- I mean, if in fact it costs you $10,000 to buy the arbitrator -- system -- you know, you buy the system --",
  "Sorry. But I mean -- you know, hire -- whatever it is, if those are obstacles, it's pretty well established, I think, that that arbitration is not something that you can use to vindicate the Federal claim. And the part that's bothering me about this, though, is that those aren't obstacles. It's just you brought a very expensive claim. And the real problem here is the reason they can go into court is they can get a class action in court. And then this Court has said, you can't get the class action in arbitration. There we have it. So -- so the -- the question in my mind is, well, is there a way that some of the beneficial aspects of class action can be used in an arbitration that does not formally have a class action? And there it seems yours is a good case because a lot of them can. You say, well, the one part that can't is getting this private information. So maybe we should send it back and say, well, why do you need the private information? On a good theory of antitrust, you're going to show that the price of the Tide product was higher than what it would have been had the entry barriers not been raised from the Tide. That's a general entry question, which I don't think you need private information from them to answer. But that's -- and now we're really into the depths of the merits. So I thought of sending it back and saying, let's -- let them explore this kind of thing about other ways of trying to get some of these advantages of class action into your -- you're going to say I'm too far out on this.",
  "Expert costs.",
  "This is exactly -- I found no authority for the proposition that what hinders -- plenty of authority, you can't make the person go to arbitration if the fees involved are too high because he's blocked. But you're quite an advance over that. You are saying the thing that keeps him out is his own theory of wrong, which will involve hiring a lot of experts and others. Now, once that's adopted, it seems to me in practice we have reversed in many, many cases the proposition that you can, in fact, require Federal causes of action to be arbitrated because all you have to do to get -- out of the arbitration is to allege a theory of your case which is hard and complicated to prove. Now, you are back in court. Now, that's a significant erosion, it seems to me. So I want to know if you have any standard there, if we're just supposed to accept that, if in fact you are trying to reverse in practice what was the holding that you can arbitrate these Federal causes of action. What is going on here? And an addendum to that is if you are going to convince me, which you might, that, well, that's okay, do it, do it, do it, is it a possible remedy to monkey with the arbitration clause and provide for a sharing of costs, say if you win, the loser will pay the expert fees, which is of course a much more pro-arbitration way than just throwing it out entirely?",
  "That's a long question, but do you see what I'm driving at?",
  "But suppose we answer --",
  "-- the question -- the answer is yes, a class action waiver can be enforced.",
  "Now, what are the circumstances here? The record leaves us uncertain, we remand it for further consideration of what they are.",
  "Because that isn't the issue they decided, whether it could be enforced. They decided whether you can -- whether the whole arbitration agreement could be enforced.",
  "Or you have to do without. I -- you just said what -- I thought that the expert talked about litigation costs, not about arbitration costs. So how is that handled?",
  "You said you waived that point, whatever -- however it is. You waived it. Never raised it. The Court of Appeals took it as if it were arbitration costs.",
  "I believe you.",
  "Now, the reason for the formula -- of course, part of the formula looks back to what happened in 1965. And it says are you a jurisdiction that did engage in testing and had low turnout or -- or low registration? Now, that isn't true of Alabama today.",
  "So when Congress in fact reenacted this in 2005, it knew what it was doing was picking out Alabama. It understood it was picking out Alabama, even though the indicia are not -- I mean, even though they're not engaging in that particular thing. But the underlying evil is the discrimination. So the closest analogy I could think of is imagine a State has a plant disease and in 1965 you can recognize the presence of that disease, which is hard to find, by a certain kind of surface movement or plant growing up. Now, it's evolved. So by now, when we use that same formula, all we're doing is picking out that State. But we know one thing: The disease is still there in the State. Because this is a question of renewing a statute that in fact has worked. And so the question I guess is, is it rational to pick out at least some of those States? And to go back to Justice Sotomayor's question, as long as it's rational in at least some instances directly to pick out those States, at least one or two of them, then doesn't the statute survive a facial challenge? That's the question.",
  "But this is then the question, does it justify? I mean, this isn't a question of rewriting the statute. This is a question of renewing a statute that by and large has worked.",
  "And if you have a statute that sunsets, you might say, I don't want it to sunset if it's worked, as long as the problem is still there to some degree. That's the question of rationality. Isn't that what happened?",
  "I don't know what they're thinking exactly, but it seems to me one might reasonably think this: It's an old disease, it's gotten a lot better, a lot better, but it's still there. So if you had a remedy that really helped it work, but it wasn't totally over, wouldn't you keep that remedy?",
  "Or would you not at least say that a person who wants to keep that remedy, which has worked for that old disease which is not yet dead, let's keep it going. Is that an irrational decision?",
  "No, I'm sorry. The old disease is discrimination under the Fifteenth Amendment, which is abridging a person's right to vote because of color or race.",
  "What the question --",
  "So what's your answer? I just want to be sure that I hear your answer to an allegation, argument, an excellent argument, that's been made, or at least as I've picked up, and that is that: Yes, the problem was terrible; it has gotten a lot better; it is not to some degree cured. All right? I think there is a kind of common ground. Now then the question is: Well, what about this statute that has a certain formula? One response is: Yes, it has a formula that no longer has tremendous relevance in terms of its characteristic -- that is literacy tests. But it still picked out nine States. So, so far, you're with me. So it was rational when you continue. You know, you don't sunset it. You just keep it going. You're not held to quite the same criteria as if you were writing it in the first place. But it does treat States all the same that are somewhat different. One response to that is: Well, this is the Fifteenth Amendment, a special amendment -- you know? Added by. Maybe you're right. Then let's proceed State by State. Let's look at it State by State. That's what we normally do, not as applied. All right. Now, I don't know how satisfactory that answer is. I want to know what your response is as to whether we should -- if he's right -- if he's right that there is an irrationality involved if you were writing it today in treating State A, which is not too discriminatorily worse than apparently Massachusetts or something. All right? So -- so if that's true, do we respond State by State? Or is this a matter we should consider not as applied, but on its face? I just want to hear what you think about that.",
  "Yes, but his point, I think the point is this: If you draw a red line around the States that are in, at least some of those States have a better record than some of the States that are out. So in 1965, well, we have history. We have 200 years or perhaps of slavery. We have 80 years or so of legal segregation. We have had 41 years of this statute. And this statute has helped, a lot. So therefore Congress in 2005 looks back and says don't change horses in the middle of the stream because we still have a ways to go. Now the question is, is it rational to do that? And people could differ on that. And one thing to say is, of course this is aimed at States. What do you think the Civil War was about? Of course it was aimed at treating some States differently than others. And at some point that historical and practical sunset/no sunset, renew what worked type of justification runs out. And the question, I think, is has it run out now? And now you tell me when does it run out? What is the standard for when it runs out? Never? That's something you have heard people worried about. Does it never run out? Or does it run out, but not yet? Or do we have a clear case where at least it doesn't run out now? Now, I would like you to address that.",
  "I had said don't change horses. You renew what is in the past --",
  "-- where it works, as long as the problem isn't solved. Okay?",
  "But there is this difference, which I think is a key difference. You refer to the problem as the problem identified by the tool for picking out the States, which was literacy tests, et cetera. But I suspect the problem was the denial or abridgement by a State of the right to vote on the basis of race and color. And that test was a way of picking out places where that problem existed. Now, if my version of the problem is the problem, it certainly is not solved. If your version of the problem, literacy tests, is the problem, well, you have a much stronger case. So how, in your opinion, do we decide what was the problem that Congress was addressing in the Voting Rights Act?",
  "Could -- could you go back, please, to Justice Alito's question? I -- I don't understand the answer to that. That is, I don't understand, and it's just something I don't understand. I'm not saying it facetiously. I don't understand the relationship of mental state to the issue. I mean, I didn't think there is any doubt here that the individual, your client, knew what he was doing. He knew for a fact that he was taking money from the trust. He knew he was giving it to his mother. And he knows where it's going. And he knows it was later paid back with 6 percent interest. So you don't have to assume extreme recklessness. He knew it. Now, what he didn't know was that that was unlawful. And therefore, if I look at the accompanying things, embezzlement, larceny, fraud in the trust, I don't think any of them require a knowledge that what you're doing is unlawful. So if I -- or do they? I don't think -- you can be convicted of embezzlement while misunderstanding the law of embezzlement. You can be convicted of larceny, it's saying. And as far as I know, a person to commit fraud lies, knows it's material, knows, et cetera, but he doesn't have to know there's a law against it. And -­ and so -- if I do what Justice Harlan was doing and comparing it to the other three, it looks as if you don't need to know that what you're doing is against the law, where you commit defalcation. Now, that I think is what Justice Alito was driving at. And I'd like to hear an absolutely clear answer on that.",
  "But I didn't think there's any respect here in which admissing -- mistake of law, would negate the mental state as to having taken money from the trust, used it in the family business and then paid it back, which I take it are, we assume, which is a different question I have, but for present purposes, we are assuming that that's sufficient for defalcation. Is that right? Where does it, where does it negative the intent in respect to what happened?",
  "No, it had nothing to do with recklessness. He did these three things knowingly. That is a stronger mental state than recklessness, not a weaker one.",
  "Were unlawful. So we're back at the same question, and I'm now assuming you have no answer to the question because there is none.",
  "Yes, but you see -- should I have to write the opinion in this case, I would have to deal with this issue and I'd have to say something about it. And as soon as I look at the other words, those are words like \"embezzlement,\" \"larceny,\" and \"fraud.\" Now, elsewhere in the U.S. Code where those are crimes ignorance of the law is not an excuse. It often is an excuse where in fact it's a tax violation or some other technical violation. So I would have to explain why the word \"defalcation\" when linked to those three is being treated differently. Or I'd have to say Congress used words which never have ignorance of the law as an excuse and meant them differently. Each of those is pretty hard to say.",
  "I have one other question on a different subject that may be more helpful to you or not. I think of defalcation as the individual who has defalcated shows up in Rio with two suitcases full of money, and it seems to me if you look at the root of the word, it consists of diminishing, taking a sickle and cutting something down, and therefore it did seem to refer to an instance where you take the corpus or money belonging to the trust, now it becomes ambiguous, and you run off with it. Is there anything you would like to say about that?",
  "Oh, yes. Wait, wait. You say -- you mean either, both? I mean, there is no doubt here, I agree with you, as far as the act is concerned. It wasn't just reckless, it was intentional. So you don't have to worry about that one. Thus Justice Kennedy's basic question I'd like to hear your answer to. I thought it might have come from the other side, but you -- you concede, I take it, that there has to be an element in which the person not only knows what he has done, but that he does it with an element of moral turpitude; i.e. he knows that the law forbids it or -- or are you conceding this and then fill in the blanks, or?",
  "All right. Then if that's your position, what do you say to what Justice Kennedy said, add in Justice Harlan's comment that embezzlement and larceny are set off. These two concern fraud and defalcation in respect to the trust. There is a case of this Court that says fraud in respect to the trust requires an element of moral turpitude. That suggests a knowledge that what you are doing violates the law. And if we read in pari materia, we get the same kind of requirement for this, indeed more so. Indeed, you just conceded it existed even in respect to embezzlement, which is outside the parenthesis.",
  "Why? Defalcation on your definition would seem to be more likely to be thought innocent by someone who commits it in some circumstances than would fraud.",
  "No. It may mean, for example here, fine, okay, no fraud, but what you did was you took some money that belonged to the trust given by your father to help your mother. And your mother says, help me, and the brothers and sisters will benefit well too. And so you go to your insurance guy and he says, sure, no problem. And then, lo and behold, they did it. I mean, innocence just radiates from what the conduct was as described.",
  "Is it -- before we leave this conduct, I mean, I understand I was painting you a picture of they're being innocent. But we are in a court that this Court has described as a court of equity or akin thereto.",
  "One principle I used to learn was he who has clean hands can come into equity, but not anybody else. Now, we have two lower courts that are saying your client has pretty dirty hands or at least they don't understand it. That this, the other client has tried to get him to sell the property, but they write the properties are abandoned and uninsurable. Even though Mr. Bullock produced a buyer, they won't sell it. And so do you have clean hands? Not you yourself. You didn't take the money and you do not have dirty hands, all right? But did your client here, does he lack clean hands because two courts have said he should have just sold his collateral and he would have gotten the money and saved everybody a lot of trouble?",
  "Because?",
  "Did we remand it so they could?",
  "And then what's the loss? I mean, let's assume the trust was worth $1 million plus 6 percent, and every year, they have in their coffer $1 million plus 6 percent.",
  "The only part they don't have is the extra money that the trustee made, that there is no cutting down of the size of the trust. At least that's an argument. Now, what's the answer?",
  "Because?",
  "Because? I mean, I thought defalcation is -- supposes that the person does pack his suitcases with the money and he goes and shows up in Rio. I take it that would be defalcation. That isn't fraud.",
  "But you didn't cite to the Latin, did you?",
  "But you didn't have the Latin definition, which I take it from my colleague and it was confirmed by my law clerks, it comes from medieval Latin, starting with a sickle and meant to cut down, to cut down, and that suggested reduction.",
  "What about the other argument? I just don't want you to leave without addressing the other argument.",
  "In your brief you talk about and quote \"Learned Hand\" and say it means -- \"If it doesn't mean a deliberate malversation,\" said Learned Hand --",
  "-- then it must be the same as fraud or embezzlement. So I will go look up \"malversation\" as soon as I return to my office, and I will get that. Now, the other argument was, yes, fine, a loss. Two, done deliberately, but with an innocent state of mind because he didn't understand the law. Justice Kennedy quoted, fraud -- from this Court, that fraud in bankruptcy for purposes of this provision requires some degree of moral turpitude. Well, that suggests that you aren't innocent in respect to knowledge that it's against the law. What about that?",
  "Could I ask a different -- can I ask --",
  "There's probably a perfectly good answer to this, but I -- I notice that in this Federal law in 7(b), it says what the registration form shall contain.",
  "Now, there are four subsections and only one of those refers to a particular thing, and that is, identifying information. It shall include a statement, including citizenship, saying -- that contains an attestation the applicant meets that requirement.",
  "And under perjury.",
  "It says that. Then I look at the Arizona law and it says in Arizona, you have to include like in immigration -- you know, a passport, a birth certificate, and then you have a couple of other things that show you're a citizen, correct?",
  "Yes, okay. That's not my question.",
  "I'm saying given these five or six specific things --",
  "-- that show you're a citizen --",
  "-- what use does Arizona make of that attestation under perjury?",
  "I didn't say it wasn't. I just want to know, since you have right in front of you a birth certificate or the equivalent, what use are you making of the Federal provision that's there in the form: I am a citizen. What use are you making of that?",
  "Well, I know -- I'm sure you are and then my question is how?",
  "By?",
  "His point is, he keeps making the point, your colleague, and he says, no, that isn't what it says. What the statute says is it may require only such identifying information as is necessary to assess eligibility. In other words, it's telling the people who write the form what they can put on it. And they can't put other things on it. But it nowhere says that the State can't do other things. Now that's his point. And when I asked him, well, how are you -- how are you using -- you have to be able to use, oh, he says, we use it. We use the citizen part and these things on the form to prosecute people for perjury. So we're doing what it says, we're using it and it doesn't say we can't add a few other things. Okay. Now, that's his argument. Now, your answer, which would be very helpful to me, is?",
  "On the form.",
  "But his problem is how do you get to that conclusion? He says you can't get there from the language because the language doesn't say that. It says what the Commission can put on the form. It doesn't say anything about whether some other agency, such as a State or -- you know, a sovereign, can add something. Now, that's his problem. And I would like to hear very succinctly, the reason he is wrong about that is?",
  "Yes.",
  "Correct.",
  "No, no. Where you're going is this, as I heard you before: It is true that there is no specific language saying the State can't do this, can't add things. But it does make a huge point approving citizenship in a particular way on the form. What would the point of that be if the State could add things? So we must look back to the purpose, not necessarily exclusively the language, of deciding what that particular provision be, in particularly one as you quote adding to, what could it have been? And there the legislative history in my view is helpful because it makes clear, for example, in at least one place that Congress did think they shouldn't add a provision that allows the State to do just what it's doing here because that wouldn't be consistent with the purpose of the Act. So I'm putting words in your mouth, but don't accept them because I put them there.",
  "And that's the grand purpose -- to go back to your -- I see that as your grand purpose. That's the grand purpose argument. And then there is the subsidiary purpose argument, which you started to make, which I wanted to hear, which has to do with (b). It says may require only such identifying information. So I thought, well, they could require less, less than what's necessary. They could. It says you can't require more. They could require less. But suppose they put a statement in and they say, in respect to this qualification, nothing to do with citizenship: This is what is necessary. No more. But we've done everything that is necessary. Then could a State come along and say, we think more is necessary?",
  "And it's the word \"necessary\" that you thought -- that that would be dependent upon?",
  "Well, I know I'm not -- I'm just not quite -- the last step of what I wanted you to think up was this --",
  "It does say \"may require only\" –",
  "-- \"that which is necessary.\" So if they said -- and this what is necessary. Fine. Pretty tough for the State to say I'm going to add some things. But the very next subsection does use the words \"shall include.\" So I wonder -- and that has to do with citizenship. So I wonder if that is a statement by Congress that in respect to citizenship, that is what is necessary.",
  "I see that. But I don't understand why that matters. That is, the -- I mean, I was thinking just what you said. I was thinking well, I -- I dissented in the other case, but I lost, okay? So I lost, I lost. The -- the -- the point is that -- that you have a drug, and you say to the jury, well, if there were no warning here at all, then it would be unreasonably dangerous. I think, yes, that probably applies to chemotherapy, it probably applies to Parkinson's, it probably applies to all kind, but you see, says the defense, there is a warning here and it says how to use it. And as you say, that would be not -- it would be despite or whatever it is, despite, not because. But it seems to me in terms of -- it comes for the same thing, lots of drugs would be dangerous, too dangerous, unreasonably so without a warning. Chemotherapy is what I'm thinking of. But properly labeled they're not, and so that seems to be your case.",
  "Because -- why?",
  "In other words, in this case, they have to find that -- that no warning -- there is no such warning that could make a difference, that's what they're asked to find?",
  "Where is that? That's -- I do see that distinction. If, what you're -- but look, the complaint's filled with words about adequate warning, no adequate warning, no adequate warning, da, da, da.",
  "Okay. Now what you're saying is, is really what the jury found, nothing to do with adequate. There is no warning in the world that anybody could have invented that would have made a difference. I'll have to think about that one. But in the meantime, where is it that that's what they said?",
  "Yes. How do I discover that you're right about this? Because everything in the -- in the complaint that I've read so far seems to talk about the adequacy of warnings, not that there is no warning in the universe could possibly have made a difference.",
  "How do I discover that?",
  "The second point is a different point. The second point is, look, I have chemotherapy, it saves 100 and it kills 10. All right. If you have no label at all, a jury might find it was unreasonably dangerous, but once you put in the label explaining the whole thing, it doesn't. It isn't unreasonably dangerous because of the situation, and they could perhaps wouldn't find it. All right. Now, you can call that diminishing or you could call it adequacy. Call it what you want, but that seems to me to come to the same thing and is different from saying, no label in the universe would say it.",
  "We're talking about what juries could find and that's what -- and I don't know about Parkinson's -- I don't know what these drugs are. That's why I said let the FDA say it.",
  "Well, but then if you apply this -- what is deeply bothering me in all these cases, and it's why I came up and said, the FDA has to tell us -- you know. Because just what you said before; what you say applies to sulindac also applies to 12 people who will tell the Mary Hitchcock Hospital up in Dartmouth that they can't use a certain kind of chemotherapy. You see, you could in certain horrible cases find a very sympathetic plaintiff who really did suffer terribly. And -- and -- and you are getting 12 people rather than the FDA. So my solution to it, which you know because you read Medtronics, may not work, but it's the best I can think of. Now, what -- what -- you can tell me if you want, no, there is some totally different thing. But what you are saying at the moment, what I do in my mind is I say, beware because it's also true potentially of some of these life-saving drugs and that's what's worrying me.",
  "But even the compensation, suppose you had strict liability that Florida Avocado Growers could -- what they have to do, all they have to do since they can just be fined and the money would go to pay the consumers of California who have the unfortunate mixup sometimes of eating Florida avocados. I mean, that would raise at least serious problems of -- commerce clause problems and preemption and so forth.",
  "It says on page 5496, adequacy of the warning, I guess, the judge says, is not an issue before this jury. And that was the point.",
  "But now, look, still, the worst thing, the obvious question -- I mean, as a textual matter, but I don't know how you reconcile your position with the -- with the first words in 3300aa-11, which is talking about a petition starts this whole proceeding and you want to interpret that word \"petition\" meaning a timely petition. You mean an untimely petition doesn't start the proceeding? I mean, that's the technical linguistic thing, but if you get to your -- to your basic worrying you, what is worrying you is this proceeding, okay? That's what's worrying you, I think, the shadow trial.",
  "Now, on that, just what Justice Sotomayor said, you only get into this problem when the attorney has filed this timeliness matter with a good reason to think his petition is timely, otherwise forget it. Okay? So you look at the complaint. You see a complaint there. He had a good reason for thinking it's timely. It looks, on the face of the complaint, as if his client has a good claim, a plausible one. Now, if the government wants to say, we want to present some evidence, let them do it. And if they don't, the worst that happens is this person who thought she had a good claim, and who was reasonable in her timeliness will get some attorneys' fees paid. Why is that -- why is that so terrible? Why is that putting such a burden on the government that they have to go through hoops, I think, to try to get these words in the statute, too?",
  "But that's in your control, the shadow trials.",
  "You don't have to have a shadow trial if you don't want one.",
  "So your view here it's the same. No attorneys' fees when the client dies, or they decide to withdraw the petition when it's dismissed early on for a procedural ground, when the record is inadequate, et cetera. You think that in none of those cases Congress would have wanted attorneys' fees. Or is it --",
  "-- do you think in some but not others?",
  "No, no, no, no, the family gives up.",
  "No, but my question is what is your view? It's the same problem. He's listed, you heard, he listed six or seven different instances -- four or five anyway; he's found 11 cases, apparently. And so what is your view?",
  "I'm just trying to get to what you're arguing about. And I might be off base by now. I feel like handlers, purchasers, raisins, like an old Abbott and Costello movie. I just want to see if I'm right. Tell me. Just say you're wrong and I don't go into it further. There -- there are some people, they've been -- they are either -- they have some raisins, all right. And these particular people, whom the Department has said have acquired the raisins, it said they acquired the raisins. And so they're there with some raisins, and then the government says, do this thing with your raisins. And they don't want to do it, so they don't. They don't do it even though the law says do it. And then they say the law is unconstitutional and, moreover, you fined us a huge amount of money and we don't want to pay it because the law is unconstitutional, and we consider that money that we paid. Call it a fine, call it what you want. We consider we shouldn't have paid it and now we want it back and we want compensation and we think it's a taking and where do we go. Can't we make that argument in the Ninth Circuit? It's something like that; isn't that what we're arguing about?",
  "But not quite.",
  "Yes?",
  "Okay, okay. So we shouldn't have to pay because this is all unconstitutional. And -- and now what's your argument?",
  "And then the Ninth Circuit says go to the Court of Claims. And you say no, we don't have to go to the Court of Claims.",
  "All I was trying to do was to get you on the basic argument, which you started with, which is why is there -- why was the Ninth Circuit wrong when they said they had no jurisdiction to hear this, that rather, they had to go -- you had to go to the --",
  "Yes.",
  "No, no, but there's a similar -- I mean, it seemed to me, again simplifying, that underlying this their clients think this whole raisin program is unconstitutional. What it does is it takes raisins that we grow, in effect throws them in the river. And in the thirties, that was done to raise raisin prices. And they think as a matter of policy that just hurts people by raising prices, and as a matter of constitutional law it takes raisins from some people that belong to them and uses them for this bad purpose. Okay, that's their view of it, something like that, isn't it?",
  "Fine. So they're making that kind of constitutional claim. Now, I would think if all you told me was that and I knew nothing about all these statutes, I would say that's the kind of claim that should be made in a Federal district court, period, not the Court of Claims. Because their government isn't going to compensate them for anything. That's against the whole point of the program. Either this program is valid or it isn't. And if it isn't, some authoritative set of courts should tell us that. So I have a feeling this is somehow not a right fit with the Court of Claims. Now, you explain to me why that purely instinctive feeling at this point is completely wrong.",
  "The just compensation, I take it, in the program is supposed to come from the fact that raisin prices go up. So the poor children with their noses pressed to the glass because they can't pay the raisins, their parents are the ones who are paying the compensation. And certainly not the taxpayer, he's not going to pay it, and maybe the other producers will pay, some who get gypped or something, I don't know. But I can't believe that Congress wanted the taxpayers to pay for a program that's going to mean they have to pay higher prices as consumers.",
  "No, no. No, it doesn't go to the merits. It goes to whether or not it makes sense to think that the Court of Claims has something to say about this. And suppose we did this. Suppose we said, given the fact that you filed your thing, whatever it was -- you know, late, and the -- and the light of this very enlightening discussion which has been helpful, we think this is the kind of program and challenge to the program where there isn't going to be a remedy really in the Court of Claims and they ought to go ahead in the Ninth Circuit, and in light of all these enlightening things that we'll write, you just decide the merits of -- is that -- now, I'm sure you're going to say that's absolutely terrible, it won't work at all. So tell me why not.",
  "No, no, we'd say -- we'll say given the way that we've talked about the program, perhaps it's best to consider this matter fully.",
  "Yes.",
  "What does the word \"acquire\" mean. There is some opinion here which says these handlers acquired the raisins. What is -- what's that about?",
  "Like lessees or something, bailees?",
  "I -- no, no. I just wanted to know what the word \"acquire\" --",
  "Now, can an acquirer of my car, for example -- I don't know. Forget that.",
  "Can they -- can they assert a takings claim attaches to the car? It sounds like a standing question.",
  "No, no. But still, it might if they're acquirers -- but they are acquirers, okay? They think this program is unconstitutional because it takes some other people's property, right? So those other people are in a very special relation to them. Those other people are really close. And it may be they have standing to assert those other people's claims. And if they do have standing to assert those other people's claims, why can't they make the argument that way?",
  "What's -- what's your point? If it's not part of the towing law, then it's further removed.",
  "I guess, I mean, I guess you could have thousands of claims across the country, millions of claims where there are all kinds of towing laws. And -- you know, it says in Cambridge, Massachusetts park your car here during a snow emergency, it will be towed. Probably every northeastern country has laws like that. I guess there could be millions of negligence claims when the thing is towed, the guy broke a headlight.",
  "And are all those things preempted? I would be amazed.",
  "Then what's the difference between this and -- and what could arise any day of the week? I mean, as I read your brief, I -- are you saying that all the northeast statutes that say your car will be towed if you park here during a snow emergency, what happens? I mean, do they have to go to the Department of Transportation? Boston couldn't function. I know that they do tow cars. I don't know that firsthand, but I've seen it.",
  "So how's it supposed to work?",
  "Well, all right, there isn't in this case, but I'm curious to know how it works because it seemed to me from what you're arguing, all the abandoned motor vehicle laws and all the snow emergency towing and everything else that I see every day would be preempted a fortiori. So you tell me how it all works.",
  "No, there's a lot of language in the majority pretty much along the line that Justice Scalia said. And not sure if that’s your point. I mean, Justice Ginsburg wrote the majority, and she said the reference to regulatory authority of a State, which is a different reference, I agree, should be read to preserve, not preempt traditional prerogative for the State. And Justice White said previously that you have to start with the idea that this is -- historic police powers of the State are not going to be superseded by the Act, unless it's a clear manifest purpose of Congress. So I guess the problem is, with a lot of the other things, that you yourself are in an area that is a traditional matter of State regulation. It is, in fact, regulated in a way that applies to everybody. It is indirectly related to the transport itself, and that it takes place on -- about storage that took place after the event. So you have all that working against you. Now, the Columbus case does offer some hope for the other side, I would think. But what do you think?",
  "All right. Now, don't lose that. I will ask you this question to, which favors you in a sense but I want the answer really from the Solicitor General who may know. But I'm going to ask it to you too because you've probably both thought about it. He may have -- they may have some experience on it. If you start talking about significant effect, without those last words, \"deregulatory purpose\" I suddenly worry about the following, that every city in the United States depends upon towing to regulate parking within the city. We couldn't function without it, although none of us like it. We know that it's necessary. And certainly a law that provides for towing does directly regulate the service of the tow truck. It says do it. And then it tells you when not to do it. So what's the -- what happens? Is every traffic law in the United States involving towing suddenly preempted? I can't believe that. How does this work? So there is much more in significance in this case than the words we write, perhaps, than in the particular case. And now, do you want to, in light of what my concern is, add anything to what you say. And you may not, the Solicitor General might, but I'd like to hear anything you have to say about that.",
  "No, you -- you can just rest on that, but I'm going to have -- or somebody's going to have to write an opinion. And we could just say that, but I -- I don't see I can -- my own problem is not being able to have an intelligent answer to that without having some answer to the bigger picture. And the bigger picture seems to me horrendously important. And -- and I don't know what that answer is. You seem to be getting there with the words \"deregulatory purpose.\" And I -- and I was thinking how we might try to work with those, but go ahead.",
  "Oh, I think it's much harder than this case --",
  "-- because the relationship is -- is in the -- in the more general case is more direct to the tow truck. It says \"go tow.\" And that's -- that's why I need some kind of bigger picture.",
  "We have a statute which says, if you park your car here for more than 3 hours, you will be towed, okay? And as part of that statute, though we don't see it, there is an arrangement for the service of the city with the tow truck company, which says when the parking person calls you and says -- the meter says red, yellow, purple, green, you are to go there and tow, okay? Doesn't that sound as if it's regulating the service of tow trucks? And I suspect across the country, there is some variation on that theme, but there are thousands of them. And since the words -- I would be repeating it -- the words of this case may affect that situation, I want to know what you know, which may not be very much -- I don't blame you -- about that broader situation.",
  "Or the opposite.",
  "Correct.",
  "Correct.",
  "And they're -- they're very attractive places except in the winter. But a -- a motor carrier vehicle -- a service, transportation includes related to the movement of passengers or property. Related to the movement of passengers or property. So we have these words \"related to\" again. I -- well, you've given me a couple of ideas, but I -- maybe they'll turn out not to be relevant, but -- but -- which I hope.",
  "Okay. Then we either have to take this tenuous, et cetera, this is too much, this isn't too much, da, da, da, or you've given -- there is another thought being thrown out and that is you relate it to the basic purposes of the deregulation act and you say that where the city is regulating something that never was, could not be, and is not part of a regulated or deregulated market, i.e. has nothing to do with the subject matter, then it is not preempted. Now, do you want us to take that approach? Should we punt and just use the words like \"tenuous\" or -- and if we take the implicit suggestion, what's the right way to do it?",
  "Thank you.",
  "That -- that comes under our basic thing -- as I read this, the difference was between this and Stolt-Nielsen, you have two parties here and they both say, arbitrator, you decide whether or not this language, that says nothing about it, did encompass class or not. In Stolt-Nielsen, the claimant, who wanted arbitration, agreed that the clause said nothing about it. So, given his concession there, the only way it could have gotten in is if the arbitrator was doing some policy thing. Given the lack of any similar concession here, the way that the arbitrator got it in is he read this ambiguous language, looked at the situation, and said, hmm, guess it's in. Now, in the latter case, we should presume everything from the arbitrator's favor. Former case, no, they've admitted that it wasn't in the clause. Okay. So that -- now, what's the response to that?",
  "Well, I don't think so. I thought it said that -- that the award -- if the award displays manifest disregard, or words like that. I mean, Misco is -- is not absolute. Misco has a narrow exception, and that exception is where there's just no basis in the contract for the decision. And so I thought you were arguing that here that's clearly not so, there is a basis.",
  "That's a different thing, that's a different thing. It doesn't say whatever he says about the contract, he wins. It says what he says about the contract, it is not just manifestly wrong, it isn't just plain language to the contrary, and et cetera. There is language in the cases to that effect. So I would be repeating myself, but are you saying there is no loophole no matter how tiny? That's news to me.",
  "All right. Suppose I think, since I wrote the words in First Options, that something like manifest disregard or totally ignoring plain law is a ground for reversing an arbitrator, even an arbitrator. Now, suppose I think that. Then do I decide against you?",
  "Look, I'm going to say something and you are going to say, that's right, that's just what I wanted, and that won't do me any good if you don't think of it. The arbitrator in front of me, so you better tell me why I'm wrong because they certainly will and they are in the briefs. Mr. Arbitrator, this class -- this language here says all disputes will go to arbitration. It doesn't say whether they are supposed to be class or can be or can't be. You decide what it means. And the arbitrator thinks, hmm, all, hmm, it doesn't say, but I got to reach a decision. So what kind of a case is it? Small claims. And then it says something about court suits where they have class. Hmm, gets his magic 8-ball out and, whatever it is, he says, that's what it means. It means it could include class, too. Okay? Where in our case law is that a manifest disregard? He's looked at the language, there were two plausible constructions, he came up with one of them. What's the problem? Now, that's of course their problem, but if you just say yes and don't go into why they are saying no it's not going to help me.",
  "So -- obviously you don't.",
  "Use whatever word you want. Manifest disregard, stick to the law. Now, suppose the arbitrator had said this, it doesn't say how to do it. I see how you do it, you get out a magic 8-ball. Now, we would strike that down because that is not relevant. But he didn't say magic 8-ball. He said class. And there are many class arbitrations. So it isn't quite magic 8-ball. Now, you explain to me --",
  "A magic 8-ball is you have -- that's a little thing, it's the -- it's a non-sportsman's equivalent of throwing darts.",
  "Well, that just seems -- that's rather thin, I think. I don't know how -- I don't have the ability to assess that and the significance of it, empirically. The thing I wonder, therefore, you said this is common in antitrust? I'm -- I'm not up to everything in the field, but I know there's an existence of something called a per se rule, let's price fix it. I know there's a rule of reason, and I know there's a sort of vague area that sometimes in some cases that Justice Souter mentioned in California Dental, there is something slightly in between, which as I saw those cases, they're very much like price fixing or -- or agreements not to enter. And what they seem to say is, Judge, pay attention to the department when it says that these are very often can be anticompetitive, and ask the defendant why he's doing it. I mean, is that what you want us to say? It didn't seem as if in your briefs as if you were. Either you were asking us to produce some kind of structure –- I don't mean to be pejorative, but it's rigid -- a whole set of complex per se burden of proof rules that I have never seen in other antitrust cases, I -- my question is, when I say I've never seen anything like this before in terms of procedure, I want you to refer me to a case that will show, oh, no, I'm out of date.",
  "And are there others?",
  "Is there any other? Are you familiar with any other? Because I want to be sure I read all of them.",
  "Well, if there are few or none, then I would say, why isn't the government satisfied with an opinion of this Court that says, yes, there can be serious anticompetitive effects. Yes, sometimes there are business justifications, so Judge, keep that in mind. Ask him why he has this agreement, ask him what his justification is, and see if there's a less restrictive alternative. In other words, it's up to the district court, as in many complex cases, to structure their case with advice from the attorneys.",
  "Without guidance?",
  "The same thing is appropriate as is appropriate in any antitrust case. Are there anticompetitive effects? I have 32 briefs here that explain very clearly what you said in a sentence. It may be that they're simply dividing the monopoly profit. I understand that -- you know, I can take that in and so can every judge in the country. And what's complicated about that. And then I have some very nice dark green briefs that clearly say, four instances, maybe five, where there would be offsetting justifications. I think they can get that, too.",
  "And they mention at least two others. The first one they mention is because the person's already in the market thinks that the next year or two or three years is worth $100 million a year, and the person who's suing thinks it's worth 30 million a year. And so he says, hey, I have a great idea, I'll give him the 30 million and keep the 70. And -- and that, I don't see why that's anticompetitive if that's what's going on. And the second instance they bring up is that it's very hard to break into a market. So for the new generic to come in, he's thinking, giving me two years isn't worth much because I'll spend a lot of money, it's very hard for me to do it. But the defendant -- the defendant who wants this patent kept intact says, I will not only let -- I'll let you in a year earlier and I'll give you enough money so that you can start up a distribution system. The second seems procompetitive, the first, neutral. The problem of deciding whether other matters are or are not really payments for something else, a true nightmare when you start talking about five drugs and different distribution systems and the matter of whether you're paying for litigation costs, a matter of great debate for the judge. Okay, that's the arguments that they make. Go ahead.",
  "No. No. I mean, Professor Areeda, who is at least in my mind a minor deity in the matter, in this area, if not major, he explains it. He says don't try for more precision than you can get. The quality of proof required should vary with the circumstances. Do you know how long it took -- I mean, and I -- of course, I -- I know a little bit of antitrust. But I mean, I think -- do you know how long it takes to take in your basic argument that these sometimes can be a division of profit, monopoly profit? It takes probably 3 minutes or less. And judges can do that. So you say to the judge, Judge, this is what's relevant here. And there's a rule of evidence, don't waste the jury's time. So -- so you shape the case as -- and this is what goes -- used to go on for 40 years. You shape the case in light of the considerations that are actually relevant, useful, and provable in respect to that case. And district judges, that's their job. So -- so what -- I'm not saying you lose the case. They didn't side with the Eleventh Circuit. They said there's no violation, okay? I've got your point on that. But -- but I'm worried about creating some kind of administrative monster.",
  "Yes. But there, it's not -- their point is not it's per se unlawful. What they want is they want to cut some kind of line between a per se rule and the kitchen sink. And if you look at the brief supporting you, it is the kitchen sink. You have economists attacking the patent system or praising it, da, da, da, and here and there and the other. They don't want the kitchen sink. Now, suppose I don't want the kitchen sink, but I have a hard time saying what the per se rule is. So what's your idea?",
  "Okay. Suppose --",
  "Okay. Suppose -- this sounds like an argument, a discussion that you’d have in the district court, so -- so why -- what's your reaction to this. Say A, sometimes these settlements can be very anticompetitive, dividing monopoly profit. In deciding whether anticompetitive outweighs business practices without less restrictive alternatives, judge, you may take that into account. Two, do not take into account the strength of a patent. Three, do not try to relitigate the patent. Four, there are several possible justifications, ones I listed before out of the briefs, litigation costs -- the other products, different assessments of -- of value. Five, there could be, in fact, no anticompetitive effect here because of what you just said now in response to Justice Kennedy and Justice Kagan, but there could be. We don't know. Okay? So start with where we were. Could be anticompetitive. Give the defense a chance to go through five, one through five, and if they convince you there is a six, we're not saying there isn't, but we can't think of one on the briefs, let them have the sixth, too. Okay? Now, judge, weigh and decide. That's what we do. So we've structured it somewhat to keep the kitchen sink out on the basis of the briefs given to us. What's wrong with that?",
  "So why does it help you to say, if the Court says or the FTC says when you get one of these suits you can settle it by letting them in, but you can't pay them money. That that will help to stop strike suits if it costs them nothing to get in. They have to really want to enter or they won't bring lawsuits. So why does that hurt you?",
  "That's -- historically, I think, 40 States, many States have what was called a public action. A public action is an action by any citizen primarily to vindicate the interest in seeing that the law is enforced.",
  "Now, that's the kind of action I think that this Court has interpreted the Constitution of the United States, case in controversy, to say that it does not lie in the Federal system. And of course, if that kind of action is the very kind that does not lie, well, then to say, but they really feel it's important that the law be enforced, they really want to vindicate the process, and these are people of special interests. They -- we found the five citizens who most strongly want to vindicate the interest in the law being enforced and the process for making the law be enforced, well, that won't distinguish it from a public action. But then you say, but also they are representing the State. At this point, the Dellinger brief which takes the other side of it is making a strong argument, well, they aren't the State. They are really no more than a group of five people who feel really strongly that we should vindicate this public interest and have good reason for thinking it. So you have read all these arguments that it's not really the agent and so forth. What do you want to say about it?",
  "As long as you are on that, then I would like to ask you this, assume you could distinguish California, suppose we accept your argument or accept Justice Scalia's version of your argument and that distinguishes California. Now, let's look at California. What precisely is the way in which allowing gay couples to marry would interfere with the vision of marriage, as procreation of children, that allowing sterile companies -- couples of different sexes to marry would not? I mean, there are lots of people who get married who can't have children. And so take a State that does allow adoption and say -- there, what is the justification for saying no gay marriage? Certainly not the one you said, is it?",
  "Am I not clear? Look, you said that the problem is marriage as an institution that furthers procreation.",
  "And the reason there was adoption, but that doesn't apply to California. So imagine I wall off California and I'm looking just there, where you say that doesn't apply. Now, what happens to your argument about the institution of marriage as a tool towards procreation? Given the fact that, in California, too, couples that aren't gay, but can't have children get married all the time.",
  "What the brief says is, of course, you can appoint people. It's not just that you appoint them, it's that the State's interest when it defends a law is the interest in executing the law of the State. So all you have to do is give a person that interest. But when a person has the interest of defending this law, as opposed to defending the law of the State of California, there can be all kinds of conflicts, all kinds of situations. That's what I got out of the brief. So give the person that interest. And that, they say, is what's missing here. And you'll say -- I mean, that's -- that's here, and you say it's missing here.",
  "Why is it missing here?",
  "Well, the argument --",
  "What is the one -- look, a State that does nothing for gay couples hurts them much more than a State that does something. And, of course, it's true that it does hurt their argument that they do quite a lot, but which are their good arguments, in your opinion? I mean, take a State that really does nothing whatsoever. They have no benefits, no nothing, no nothing. Okay? And moreover, if -- if you're right, even in California, if they have -- if they're right or -- you know, if a pact is enough, they won't get Federal benefits. Those that are tied to marriage because they're not married. So -- so a State that does nothing hurts them much more, and yet your brief seems to say it's more likely to be justified under the Constitution. I'd like to know with some specificity how that could be.",
  "I know the principle, but I'm saying which are their good arguments, in your opinion, that would be good enough to overcome for the State that does nothing, but not good enough to overcome California where they do a lot?",
  "Well, the real cost right now would be you're asking me to write these words, \"a State that has a pact has to say 'marriage,'\" but I'm not telling you about States that don't. Well, I would guess there is a real-world effect there, too. That States that are considering pacts will all say, we won't do it, or not all, but some would. And that would have a real effect right now. And at the moment, I'm thinking it's much more harmful to the gay couple, the latter than the former. But you won't give me advice as the government as to how to deal with that.",
  "Why -- why wouldn't -- imagine -- there in Article II, it says that the President shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. So the President has worked out -- I, personally, and for reasons in -- in my department, others think that this law is unconstitutional, but I have this obligation. And because I have this obligation, I will not -- I will continue to execute this law. I will continue to execute it though I disagree with it. And I execute it until I have an authoritative determination not to. Now, how is that different from a trustee who believes that he has an obligation to a trust to do something under a certain provision that he thinks doesn't require that, but -- you know, there's a debate about it, but he says, I have the obligation here. I'm going to follow this through. There'd be standing in the second case for any fiduciary, despite his personal beliefs, to continue. We'd understand that and say there was standing. Why don't we here?",
  "And that's the part I don't understand. For -- if, in fact, as you agree, the trustee or other fiduciary in my example would indeed have standing to act according to the law, even though he thinks that that law is unconstitutional because of his obligation such as under Section 2. You agree he has the -- he has -- there is standing when he goes into court in the first place, which surely he could interpret Article II as saying and you follow it through as long as you can do it, which includes appeals until the matter is determined finally and authoritatively by a court. If you could do the first, what suddenly stops you from doing the second?",
  "No, they're -- they're not in agreement about whether to pay the money or not. They are in agreement about what arguments are correct legal arguments. And I can't think of a case other than the sham cases which -- which this isn't, where -- where you would find no standing or other obstacle. And I can think of one case, which you haven't mentioned, namely, Chadha, which seems about identical.",
  "This is what -- we have always had the distinction between the public action and the private action. A public action, which does not exist under the Federal Constitution, is to vindicate the interest in the law being enforced. Now, when the government, State or Federal, in fact has the interest, a special interest, in executing the law, here given to the President, and they can delegate that interest to Congress, if they did, which arguably they didn't do here. But to say that any legislator has an interest on his own without that delegation to defend the law is to import in that context the public action into the Federal government. Now, that -- it hasn't been done, I don't think, ever. I can see arguments for and against it, but I can't think of another instance where that's happened.",
  "Chadha is really different because of course there is an interest in the legislature in defending a procedure of the legislature. Now, that's -- that isn't tough. But this is because the only interest I can see here is the interest in the law being enforced.",
  "And that's -- I'm afraid of opening that door.",
  "No, no. But think of another instance where that's happened. Where in all of the 12 cases or whatever that what this Court has said, without any special delegation of the power of the State or Federal government to execute the law, without any special delegation, a legislator simply has the power, which a private citizen wouldn't have, to bring a lawsuit as a party or defend as a party to vindicate the interest in the law being enforced, the law he has voted for? Now I can imagine arguments on both sides, so I'm asking you only, is there any case you can point me to which will help?",
  "Maybe I -- as long as you have a minute, I -- what did you think of Mr. Clement's argument this way, that -- that the execution -- can I --",
  "-- to execute the laws is in Article II, but where the President doesn't in a particular law, under those circumstances, a member of the legislature, appropriately authorized, has the constitutional power -- a power that is different than the average person being interested in seeing that the law is carried out, they can represent the power to vindicate the interest in seeing that the law is executed. And that's a special interest, existing only when the Executive declines to do so.",
  "You would say it would be the same thing if the State passed a law -- Congress passes a law which says, well, there's some States -- they all used to require 18 as the age of consent. Now, a lot of them have gone to 17. So if you're 17 when you get married, then no tax deduction, no medical, no nothing. Or some States had a residence requirement of a year, some have six months, some have four months. So Congress passes a law that says, well unless you're there for a year, no medical deduction, no tax thing, no benefits of any kind, that that would be perfectly constitutional. It wouldn't be arbitrary, it wouldn't be random, it wouldn't be capricious.",
  "No, I just want your bottom line. The bottom line here is we can imagine -- you know, I can make them up all day. So can you -- differences between --",
  "Differences between States have nothing to do with anything -- you know, residence requirements, whether you have a medical exam, whether -- we can think them up all day -- how old you are. And Congress just passes a law which takes about, let's say, 30 percent of the people who are married in the United States and says no tax deduction, no this, no that, no medical -- medical benefits, none of these good things, none of them for about 20, 30 percent of all of the married people. Can they do that?",
  "No, there isn't any. I'm trying to think of examples, where I just can't imagine what it is.",
  "All right. So you're saying uniform treatment's good enough no matter how odd it is, no matter how irrational. There is nothing but uniformity. We could take -- no matter. You see what I'm -- where I'm going?",
  "All right.",
  "Yes, okay. Fine.",
  "Fine, but once -- the first part. Every one of those cases has to be decided on its own, okay? Now, what's special or on its own that distinguishes and thus makes rational, or whatever basis you're going to have here, treating the gay marriage differently?",
  "You started, you started by, I think, agreeing -- maybe not -- that uniformity in and of itself with nothing else is not likely to prove sufficient, at least if it's rational basis-plus. And -- and why? Because we can think of weird categories that are uniform. So you say, look at it on the merits. Now that's where you are beginning to get. But so far, what I've heard is, well, looking at it on the merits, there is certainly a lot of harms. And on the plus side what there is, is one, we don't want courts deciding this. But of course, as was just pointed out, in some States it's not courts, it's the voters. Then you say, ah, but we want -- there are too many courts deciding it. Now, is -- too many courts might decide it. Now what else is there? What else? I want to -- I want to be able to have a list -- you know, of really specific things that you are saying justify this particular effort to achieve uniformity. And I want to be sure I'm not missing any. And so far, I've got those two I mentioned. What else?",
  "That means courts -- the courts, they do dictate in respect to time. They dictate in respect to age. They dictate in respect to all kinds of things. And what I'm looking for is what, in your opinion, is special about this homosexual marriage that would justify this, other than this kind of pure uniformity, if there is such a thing?",
  "Then yet --",
  "Or if there's no interest -- I mean, I'm back where we were yesterday. It seems to me, forgetting your -- your preferable argument, it's a violation of equal protection everywhere. Well, if it is, then all States have to have something like pacts. And if they have to have something like pacts, then you say then they also have to allow marriage. So then are you not arguing they all have to allow marriage? And then you say no. All right, so with that point --",
  "What -- what do you think of his -- the argument that I heard was, to put the other side, at least one part of it as I understand it said, look, the Federal government needs a uniform rule. There has been this uniform one man, one woman rule for several hundred years or whatever, and there's a revolution going on in the States. We either adopt the resolution -- the revolution or push it along a little, or we stay out of it. And I think Mr. Clement was saying, well, we've decided to stay out of it.",
  "And the way to stay out of it is to go with the traditional thing. I mean, that -- that's an argument. So your answer to that argument is what?",
  "I understand you do, I'd like to know the reason.",
  "But that's the problem. Is there a way of doing this, which I -- I don't see at the moment? But the judge intervenes in a serious way and says, you go listen to your lawyer and this is a very harsh penalty and, boy, you are in da da da -- okay? Serious problem. And now to track down whether that affected substantial rights, you have to try to track down the state of mind of the defendant and would he have pled guilty anyway. And that's sometimes quite difficult to do, very hard. But if you don't insist on doing it, and you have an absolute rule of structural error or something, then you suddenly discover these minor things. The judge says, go to lunch, or -- or, you know, some really trivial intervention, and you are going to say that -- the guilty plea, he can just void his guilty plea. So there should be a way of distinguishing the trivial from the -- from the really important in terms of how serious the intervention was, but I don't see any way to do that. Have -- have you thought about that at all? Do we have to go all the one way or all the other way?",
  "You want us to basically not apply the 11(h) with the harmless error business, and you basically want to prevent bizarre results by making a tough definition of the word \"participate.\" That's how I understand you. And maybe you are right, but it sounds to me as you say it in reading the briefs that this is really a job for the rules committee. This is a rule. We don't normally have structural errors in respect to rules. We have rules committees there to listen to this kind of complaint, to weigh it in the system as a whole and to come up with better rules.",
  "I know, but I don't see the answer because I gather, if I -- if I've read it correctly, that when you have an R -- the messenger RNA does not have the same base pairs. There's a U or something instead of an A or whatever it is.",
  "So when you actually look, if you could get a super-microscope and look at what they have with the cDNA, with their cDNA, you would discover something with an A, not a U. Is it AU? Is that the one?",
  "Okay. Okay. So -- so you would discover something with an A there, you see, and you wouldn't discover something with a U there. And there is no such thing in nature as the no-introns AGG, whatever, okay? It's not there. That's not truly isolated DNA. But you can go look up the Amazon, wherever you want. Hence the question. Now, on that one, how? How is that found in nature? The answer is it isn't.",
  "Can I ask a question, which I don't think will be taken from your time.",
  "But I have to ask you this. Look, you say don't reach the cDNA issue and the reason is because of the nature of the claim. Okay, I look at their claim. Their claim says they want, \"the isolated DNA of claim 1 wherein said DNA has the nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID No. 1.\" Then we turn to that and the first thing it says right there is it says, \"The molecule involved is\" -- \"Molecule type: cDNA.\" And then it has a long list and that long list is a list of the basis, okay. So molecule type, cDNA. So they say what do you mean they aren't claiming cDNA? That's what they say they're claiming.",
  "Because of the word \"wherein.\" So I go back to the \"wherein\" in Prometheus and the \"wherein\" -- you read \"wherein\" as in context, and in this context you mean to say that a person who makes isolated DNA that has lots of introns in it as well as the sequence is going to be an infringer under claim 2?",
  "Is there any support for that other than the treatise that you cited?",
  "I mean, I looked at that and it said read the \"wherein\" depending on context.",
  "And then depending on -- okay. Then you got -- you heard what I said, so I want to know is there anything else I should read?",
  "Yes, I saw that. I saw that.",
  "Well, that's true, but then you were saying something that I just didn't understand because I thought the -- the scientists who had filed briefs here, as I read it, said it's quite true that the chromosome has the BRCA gene in the middle of it and it's attached to two ends. But also in the body, perhaps because cells die, there is isolated DNA. And that means that the DNA strand, the chromosome strand is cut when a cell dies, and then isolated bits get around, and there may be very few of them in the world, but there are some, by the laws of probability, that will in fact match precisely the BRCA1 gene. Now, have I misread what the scientists told us, or are you saying that the scientists are wrong?",
  "I probably misread it. There's a better chance that I've misread it.",
  "Well, which one have I not read --",
  "So in other words, you're saying that the Lander brief is wrong.",
  "I want to know because I have to admit that I read it and I did assume that as a matter of science it was correct. So I would like to know whether you agree, as a matter of science, that it is correct, not of law, but of science, or if you are disagreeing with it, as a matter of science.",
  "I'd like a yes or no answer.",
  "Was the answer no, you do not disagree with it? I wonder, I disagree or I do disagree?",
  "As a matter of science.",
  "Okay. Very well. If you are saying it is wrong, as a matter of science, since neither of us are scientists, I would like you to tell me what I should read that will, from a scientist, tell me that it's wrong.",
  "No -- yes -- I need to know --",
  "All right. When you are on that, that's good. A more basic question to me is when you use the word \"dangerous.\" I had thought -- and you can -- I'd be interested in your view -- that the patent law is filled with uneasy compromises because on the one hand, we do want people to invent. On the other hand, we're very worried about them tying up some kind of whatever it is, particularly a thing that itself could be used for further advance. And so that the compromise that has been built historically into this area is, of course, if you get a new satisfying process to extract the sap from the plant in the Amazon, patented. Of course, if you get the sap out and you find that you can use it, you manipulate it, you use it, you figure out a way to use it to treat cancer, wonderful, patented. But what you can't patent is the sap itself. Now, in any individual case that might be unfortunate or fortunate. But consider it in the mine run of things. It's important to keep products of nature free of the restrictions that patents there are, so when Captain Ferno goes to the Amazon and discovers 50 new types of plants, saps and medicines, discovers them, although that expedition was expensive, although nobody had found it before, he can't get a patent on the thing itself. He gets a patent on the process, on the use of the thing, but not the thing itself. Now, that's my understanding of what I'd call hornbook patent law, which you I confess probably understand better than I.",
  "And I would like you to express your view on that because that's the framework that I am bringing to the case.",
  "You are saying it gets past 101.",
  "Well, that's -- that's the problem. I mean, all parts of the human body? Anything from inside the body that you snip out and isolate?",
  "And it gets through 101? Does it have to -- I mean, that's actually what's bothering me.",
  "Ah. Then -- then watch what you're doing. That's very, very interesting. Because, really, we are reducing, then, 101 to anything under the sun, and -- and that, it seems to me, we've rejected more often than we've followed it. And particularly with a thing found in nature doctrine because, of course, it doesn't just -- human kidneys and so forth. Everything is inside something else. Plants, rocks, whatever you want. And so everything will involve your vast taking something out of some other thing where it is, if only the environment. And it's at that point that I look for some other test than just that it was found within some other thing.",
  "Can I make a somewhat -- this is how I'm seeing the case and there is some mystery in it to me and it would affect how I might write this thing or consider it. Look, what they want to do is to not have trucks park in the neighborhood on the street, and they want to put a tag on it. All right. So the second -- you seem to have said what they should have done. You go to the NTSB and you ask, and they do it. They approve it or they don't. And their -- their problem is that they don't want 40 or 50 States each saying a different sticker, all right? So then the whole back fills up with stickers and that's the problem. That's the problem. You go explain, et cetera, okay. But the first part, the parking, it seemed to me of course they should be able to do that. And there seems to me to be a tailor-made exception, the authority of the State to impose highway route controls or limitations. And if that isn't tailor-made for this, I don't know what is, I mean, I don't know what it's doing there. And so why has nobody done that? When I read the lower court on that, they said, oh, it affects fares and it affects services. Every route restriction affects fares and services, you know? So here I see an exception which seems tailor-made for what they want to do. I see all kinds of problems with the proprietary thing. What am I supposed to do? What -- what I see as the exception tailor-made for this isn't in the case.",
  "So what do you suggest? And it's a question for both sides.",
  "I mean, you can't say, don't drive our truck through the neighborhood? This is residential area, no trucks over such-and-such. If you can say that, why can't you say do it part of the time? Why can't you say -- we're arguing a different question. I agree it is not --",
  "But wait. Why isn't the -- I mean, I thought that the purpose of these exceptions -- of course cities can have parking regulations. Of course States and cities can have regulations involving trucks as to how and where they use the highways and which ones they can't use and which routes, et cetera. That's the purpose of that exception, isn't it? I mean, I -- I thought that's what it was. And, of course, you're quite right in saying they should have to do it uniformly. It says it based on size and weight. Okay. Fine. What's the problem with that, that I'm not seeing?",
  "No, no, it says, \"The authority of a state to impose highway route controls or limitations based on the size and weight of the motor vehicle or the -- or hazard -- or hazardous nature.\" And it's size and weight, hazardous nature. I mean, isn't there room in those words to include environmental consideration?",
  "I -- I myself don't know.",
  "Well, that's why the route regulation thing is the exception. But the State of California decides --",
  "Pardon me. I know you're not. The State of California decides, here's what we have, a State public utilities commission which issues a tariff, and what the tariff says is anyone who contracts with a person in this State, a property owner, to move his goods and services, cannot charge less than $30 a pound. All right? Plainly preempted. And your case differs because?",
  "You're saying it falls outside the definition of \"routes.\" Well, that argument is not in front of us. I mean, I thought we were conceding here it falls within the definition of routes or rates or services.",
  "The parking regulation --",
  "Well, if it doesn't fall within, then I'm not sure what we're talking about because I thought the problem was that it does fall within the rates, routes and services, and then the question is, is there proprietary exception, et cetera.",
  "That's why I asked you, and how does it differ from the hypothetical I just put?",
  "There are three reasons, and the first one, I -- I'm not sure why it wouldn't survive in a policy of deregulation it would seem to apply a fortiori, or equally, but I don't want to argue that with you. I want to be sure I have the second and third.",
  "But what is the second and third?",
  "And what's the one that would be? Give me the example that you're thinking of where, given Castle --",
  "-- and its applications, it would be --",
  "All right. Now, how does -- how -- how would that differ from Castle? Because what Castle was concerned about was a State that has a perfectly lawful regulation, and it's violated, then the State as the remedy excludes the truck from the State.",
  "That's what it's concerned about. And it didn't say anything about accepting very serious violations, i.e., continuing ones. The reason was the need for interstate regulation of an interstate enterprise. And that was the reasoning. Leave it to the ICC, a fortiori, where it's deregulatory policy, but leave that to the side. I want to know your best case in that one, and I don't see the example yet.",
  "Make -- make this argument precisely and substitute for \"port authority\" the words \"city of San Diego,\" okay? And -- and you'd be still right. I mean, what's bothering me is, I -- I don't know you've got the right one. So -- so if we decide in your way, what we've done is distinguish precisely the same situation, you from the city of Los Angeles, simply because of the method they have of governmentally regulating the port.",
  "Why?",
  "All right. I see.",
  "Well, wait, wait, wait. Isn't your answer 1915(a) still applies?",
  "And so 1915(a) means -- that's right.",
  "So he does have a -- a considerable right.",
  "I mean, they'll have to go through a set and decide. They have to give it to him unless -- unless something overcomes the preference or there is good cause to the contrary.",
  "Well, you're thinking about this case. I'm thinking in general. I think the question --",
  "So what do we do about that?",
  "Actually, it does -- does (f) apply, in your opinion, to this case or not?",
  "And (f) has something of the best interest standard tilted towards the Indian parent.",
  "Is that right or not? I mean, as I read it it's something. It's tough, but it's there.",
  "So in your view the best interest standard does not apply, but rather (f) applies?",
  "And (f) is a tough version of a best interest standard. Have I got it right or not?",
  "You should if I'm not right.",
  "But that is a problem. Because, look, I mean, as it appears in this case is he had three Cherokee ancestors at the time of George Washington's father. All right? Now, you say, oh, well, that's a different issue. But I don't see how to decide that case without thinking about this issue because if your view is taken and you accept that definition, a - a woman who is a rape victim who has never seen the father could, would, in fact, be at risk under this statute that the child would be taken and given to the father who has never seen it and probably just got out of prison, all right? And you don't know that this beyond reasonable doubt standard would satisfy that. Now, that's obviously something I find disturbing, as a person and also as a judge, because we're trying to interpret the statute to avoid results that would be very far out, at least. And -- and that's what I want you to tell me. How do I prevent that kind of risk through an interpretation of the statute?",
  "But doesn't it happen, in your interpretation, unlike the two parties who have an interpretation I can understand, that -- remember my hypothetical, which I deliberately made dramatic. We can think of a whole range of things short of that where the father has seen the mother never, perhaps, or sperm donors for very short periods of time, and under your interpretation where there is an ongoing relationship, even a short one, at least they can't give the child to the father where it would be very harmful to the -- to the child. But under your interpretation, the one category of people who is exempt from that are the category of fathers who've never seen the mother. Who've seen the mother a very short time. Who may be in -- they're not even subject to looking to see if it's very harmful to the child. So I just -- am I right about your interpretation having that effect? And if it does have that effect, what's the justification for it?",
  "All right. So you can say, oh, there's no such thing as a parent, a father who only sees the mother --",
  "All right. Okay. All right. Now, let's suppose there is such a thing. As long as there is such a thing, the anomaly that I mentioned seems to me to exist. And am I wrong or right about that? And if it exists, what's the basis for your creating an interpretation of the statute that would produce it?",
  "Then what's the law? What is -- I mean, Joe Smith leaves a -- a blank in part of his tax return. The IRS gets it. Later, it turns out to be relevant, and the prosecutor wants to say, hey, he left this blank. Okay? Now, Griffin doesn't apply, right.",
  "I mean, isn't it -- you're not going to say that any -- any time you refuse to tell the government anything and, later on, it turns out to be relevant to a criminal prosecution, that that's taken as an invocation of the Fifth Amendment. I mean, do you want to go that far?",
  "Okay. Then you need a line.",
  "Then what is -- then you need a line. So where is -- there's the tax case; then we have a case they're selling tickets to the policeman's ball, and somebody comes to the door, and the policeman says, hey, I haven't seen you around before, and he doesn't answer. Okay? Now, that's probably not an invocation. And then we have the clear line, which, in custody, and, now, you want to extend that line. And so what I want to know if we -- if I follow you and extend it, what line do I draw?",
  "So then --",
  "Well, yes, there's no doubt he was remaining silent, but the issue is whether he was trying to raise his Fifth Amendment right. Now, suppose your rule were, whatever the situation, where either the individual expressly raises his right or, at the least, it's a fair implication from the circumstance that he was trying to assert his right, would that be a sensible rule? And, if so, how would your case stack up?",
  "It depends on the circumstance.",
  "Yes. Yes. The answer is going to be yes because we're going to hear it in one minute because, as you say, it follows a fortiori for Berghuis, you know, it's -- if you're going to have to make an explicit statement to invoke your Fifth Amendment right, when you're not in an inherently coercive setting, I mean, that's going to be the argument.",
  "You're not in an inherently coercive setting, as you are in the Miranda situation, you're not at trial, and, outside those two situations, you have to say explicitly, I'm invoking the Fifth Amendment --",
  "-- or tap on the Constitution or something in order to indicate --",
  "-- that's what's at issue and that's what --",
  "Yeah.",
  "Right. And that's saying because, there, we have a line. It's called the in-custody line. Once you get outside of custody --",
  "Well, I don't want to make the government's argument for them. They'll make it very well.",
  "So I think the argument will be, I think -- it is, at least in my mind, that if, after sitting there for 45 minutes -- or maybe it was an hour and 45 minutes -- without saying anything, I'm -- I'm maybe taking a dissenting position, but, if -- when he answers -- doesn't answer over that long period of time, but doesn't say, I want to remain silent, if that long period of behavior is insufficient without the express statement to show that he wanted to remain silent, so, outside custodial setting, should it be insufficient to simply remain silent to show that -- you see, it's argument by analogy, I think --",
  "What is that? That is what I'm -- I'm uncertain about this. And they cite page 468, note 37, of Miranda. All right. What is the law, in your opinion now, in respect to -- and what case would support this? A defendant comes in, he is warned and given his Miranda rights. He says, fine, and then he proceeds to answer a whole bunch of questions. Then they ask question number 432. He says nothing. You then go on to 433, 434, et cetera, and he answers them all. Okay? At the trial, the lawyer -- the prosecutor wants to comment on the fact that, in the face of that single question -- though answering many, many more -- he remained silent. Does Griffin say he can -- the prosecutor can make that comment, yes or no? And I'd appreciate the government answering this question, too, because they're -- if they -- are they speaking here? Or are you doing the whole argument?",
  "Well, that's -- I'd like to get the same answer.",
  "Because I -- well, now, they cite for the proposition, I think, that it -- that the prosecutor is forbidden to make that comment, note 37 of Miranda. Okay. I just read it.",
  "And I -- may be ambiguous on the point. It says you have the right to maintain immunity in the face of an accusation.",
  "No, fine. But what's your opinion? I mean, what is the law in respect to that single point? And at least to me, I'd -- I'd like to know your opinion on that.",
  "Is there any authority, or is it just your opinion that we have to go on?",
  "Are you -- are you conceding the -- the point that they make? I -- that -- that even if in the custodial setting he waives his Miranda right, he answers 500 questions, but doesn't answer one of the 500, that the prosecutor cannot comment on that fact that he didn't answer that one?",
  "Does it? What do you think? He says, no, you can't, and he quotes Miranda. Okay? So what do you think?",
  "And do you have a view on it?",
  "Okay. Then why not this?",
  "Well -- why not? I mean, look, this is -- Thomas Reed Powell once said, \"If you can think of a thing that is inextricably related to another thing without thinking of the other thing, then you have the legal mind,\" and that seems to be this case. All right?",
  "So somehow I have to get out of my mind the ex post facto part, the potential violation of due process part, the equal protection part, take that aside. Now I've got to just think about whether it has, Congress has the power under the provision that Justice Alito said. I'm trying to do that, and I've dissented in other cases on other grounds. All right. But in -- in just trying to do that, I think, well, the military, suppose they found a certain number of -- of individuals, men or women, have unfortunate problems in the military. They discover there is a mental illness problem. The person's out of the military. But the law says you can go and tell the local mental health authorities about this person even though he's no longer there. And suppose the person had a criminal problem in the military and was in prison and suppose the law said, you know, you're the ones who got the situation where he unfortunately got into that problem, and you, later on, can -- can go and tell authorities about his problems so they can take appropriate action. Now, if they can do that, why can't they have the power under Article I to say really, you all have to register. Now, maybe there are other things, but you got this problem in the military. You were convicted in the military. You did it in the military. We turned you loose and there you are, and we want, as part of our military regulation, to be able to tell authorities about you and to make you register according to State law. Now, no due process problem, I have to assume that away. No punishment, bad punishment problem, none of those. But it's a power, all right? Why not?",
  "Where you're leading me because I'm not so worried about this case, but where you're leading me is down in Commerce Clause cases and all kinds of other cases. Suddenly a distinction arises that Congress can, in fact, do all kinds of things having Federal authorities do this and that, but you couldn't make someone in a State -- you know, you can imagine a few that are coming into my mind -- and so what I'm worried about is following this distinction into other areas.",
  "But yet, now that's exactly the problem for me because the -- the wilds of Alaska you think I think, and I think I think, that -- that sure, if there's a post office there -- there's a post office there, then what -- the military is all right, they can mail a letter to the -- to be delivered to the local doctor to say, look, he has a problem. That seems to be okay. But you say it's not going to be okay to tell him he has to go and make that registration. At that point what you've done is like Madison. I mean, it's an interpretation of the Commerce Clause that I think Madison might have wanted, which is you're reading a lack of power because of a civil rights problem. I mean, it's -- the difference between the two cases is really not the need because we have to assume the need. The difference is the restriction on the individual. And it's that part that I'm suddenly worried about the Commerce Clause and every power in Article I being read with exceptions in the civil rights area even though we have the amendments to protect the civil rights problems.",
  "No, but it's the military -- look, it's the military that they are mostly -- that they're relying on.",
  "So they say -- I mean, the famous statement -- I looked it up -- \"Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate and not forbidden are -- fall within the Necessary and Proper Clause.\" All right? The end is to protect the communities from those individuals in respect to those matters that they became dangerous with when they were in the military, okay? That's the end. And is the means appropriate? They say yes. They say, after all, the means here is, notify them when we're -- you're moving around. And therefore, is it forbidden? Well, we're not supposed to consider that part, but -- so leave that out. But the -- the others, they say is okay. So that's the basic. Do you think maybe we should send this back to the -- to the Fifth Circuit? The government suggests that --",
  "-- because they didn't get it right in respect to what the previous statutes require. What about all that?",
  "I just want to know what to do if I end up thinking they are right.",
  "What's your recommendation there on that assumption? I'm not saying I would, but I'm just saying on that assumption.",
  "Well, why do you resist -- I'm just curious. I -- I would have thought that to answer Justice Alito you were going to say the answer is it isn't more accurate. If you write a will and say I want these proceeds now to go to my second wife, that is a better expression of the person's intent. But if you open that door, you'll get other wills that aren't quite so clear. And that's the problem that Congress faced.",
  "Is that right?",
  "If he is right, if the only consideration that led Congress to make this absolute rule and so forth the underlying the previous holdings, if the only consideration were ease of administration by the Federal administrator, this statute wouldn't undermine it. So -- so isn't that true? I mean, the Federal administrator writes the check to the person that's on the list. This is a matter after the check gets mailed, so this doesn't undermine it at all, there is no problem.",
  "Yes. And if that were the only consideration, administration, this doesn't interfere with Federal administration. So in order to find something to -- to have to interfere with, we have to figure that they are trying to protect an interest like the following, the person is married twice. He secretly wants to leave the insurance in the name of his first wife while pretending to the second wife it was just an oversight.",
  "I mean, that's what we have to make up in order to --",
  "Is there anything else?",
  "Well, maybe we should say, look, this is a statute that is absolute. There is no interest. All this does is run around, without being too pejorative, it runs around the earlier cases, which is your basic point. It's absolute.",
  "Right.",
  "Well -- well, on that particular point, what should we do -- as far as I can tell from the briefs, the people who work with the prostitutes to try to prevent AIDS uniformly tell us that, if you go to those prostitutes and you try to get them to take steps to stop AIDS, it's very hard to do if, at the same time, you've announced you're against all prostitution. So what they're saying is that the condition imposed will interfere with the objective, and if there is a germaneness requirement -- and nobody says the opposite. I mean, I've noted nobody denies what they're saying in terms of the effectiveness of their work, so -- I don't think. At least, I didn't read them all with great care; maybe you can point to somebody who does. But, if everyone is telling us that this is counterproductive and the exact opposite -- then can we say, well, it isn't germane?",
  "Well, that's quite a few, yes. That's true.",
  "I see that, and I see you have two sides to the policy question. And then it seems to me that the case that Justice Ginsburg was speaking of is pretty relevant. Why? Well, that case, Regan and League of Women Voters, all seem quite comparable. They are trying to balance the -- the desire of the government to further a policy objective with the undesirability of the government invading what would otherwise be a constitutional protected right to speech. And the way they have done it is quite technical and narrow, but it may be applicable. In both, what they said was, don't worry about your protected speech as much as you are because there is another way you can do it here. You go through a -- an independent structured organization. And where that wasn't present, namely, the League of Women Voters, the Court struck it down. Now, if that's the right framework, then, here, I don't see how you could have an independently structured organization for the reason that a group that said, I am -- I am opposed completely to prostitution, publicly, to get the money, and then set up a structure that said the opposite, would be seen as totally hypocritical. They wouldn't be able to get their message across. They wouldn't be able to express, in any way, what it is they think about the -- the administration of AIDS in the context -- anti-AIDS in the context of prostitution. That's a long question, but you see where -- where I've ended up.",
  "At the moment, for purposes of the question. So why isn't this case more like League of Women Voters and less like the other two?",
  "I wasn't excepting that one.",
  "I was -- I mean, the main difference it seemed to me is, assuming all of that away, is that, here, the separate structure does not fulfill the constitutional need simply because the basic condition has to do with express speech, because when A says, I believe in X, and then they set up a separate structure -- and every one knows they have set it up; I mean, that's the point of it -- and the structure says, \"just kidding,\" nobody believes them from day one. And so you can't do it, and, if the government has its way and has awarded the thing properly, according to your criteria, the part that won't be believed is the \"just kidding\" part. And so the structure -- separate structure -- just doesn't work in terms of communicating their belief. And I don't think that's true in Rust, and I don't think it's true in Regan, and I do think it's true in FCC v. League of Women Voters.",
  "Boy, if -- if the structure -- the separate structure is not really part of a constitutional analysis, then the government could say, why not? It's easy to find policy reasons, and really find very, very decent and thoughtful people who agree with the policy reason, you know? There -- there are people on both sides of these questions, and they come in and they say, okay, we're giving money for an anti-abortion purpose or a pro-abortion purpose, you know --",
  "-- and -- and, suddenly, people can't say anything in these areas in face of such a condition.",
  "But there's no way to separate -- with an organization in the field that does things, there is no way, I don't think, to separate what they do from what they say. Congress has two opposite views on this in front of it.",
  "One is the view that the way to fight AIDS is consistent with and is furthered by longer term efforts to abolish trafficking in women, okay? Prostitution. All right. The other view is the better way to do it is to go into the active sex worker area and -- and not express views on the merits of what they are doing, okay? So they have two opposite views, and -- and, moreover, the groups that do this act on those views. So why can't they say, we prefer view A or B, whichever it is, and -- because that's what our program is about?",
  "Only because -- see, it's not -- it's not, in my opinion, not a viewpoint matter, if they're going to fund a -- a group that wants to end discrimination against women around the world because they think all kinds of good things will flow from that. The government wants to fund it. Of course, such a group has a viewpoint; that's why they're in the business. So the word isn't \"viewpoint.\" And you started to say something about that there is more than that here, it has to do with the express nature. And, then, in answering Justice Sotomayor, you went a little bit further on that. And what are the form of words -- if you were me and if I were to decide in your favor, what form of words would you dictate to describe where it is in your opinion that the First Amendment cuts in with a preventative restriction? How do you describe it? I -- I don't think you can, in terms of viewpoint.",
  "I did, too, because I -- I didn't see the reason. I thought that was -- I can think of dozens and dozens of programs all over the world that the government supports, in some way or other, and, of course, the people in those programs have a certain viewpoint, and, of course, they don't hold the opposite viewpoint. Otherwise, they wouldn't be in the program. So -- so that's why I didn't find that useful. But, now, I don't think you can have it both ways between answering these questions. What is the answer?",
  "And then they're doing that, they say, because we're part of the belief, as a matter of policy, that the best way to go about this, whether you think so or not, is to restrict the grants to those people who will oppose the long-term extension of prostitution expressly. Now, that's their view of how to get rid of AIDS, you say. Might disagree with it, but there are plenty of people who think the opposite. So they're saying we're not doing it for any reason other than to further our policy.",
  "It doesn't say that. It says, \"No State is entitled to more than 25 percent.\" It doesn't say -- I mean that language doesn't say what happens if in fact there's a State that because of cliffs or something can't get the 25 percent to which it is entitled. It just doesn't say anything about it.",
  "Where does it say something about it?",
  "Yes.",
  "All right. Does that mean that a State can, when it can't get its pipeline to the river, go into some other State and take the water out of that other State? I mean, I would have thought, if that was their intent, there would be a mechanism for doing it. That you'd have some authority set up by the Compact that would decide where, whether it's really true, and how are we supposed to do it, and there is no such mechanism, rather if there is such a right, which it doesn't say anything about, it's left to the State courts in different States to try to do what is an extremely complex and controversial administrative job.",
  "It's not at all complex when Oklahoma is going to say, Texas, go run the pipe to the south of the Red River, and Texas is going to say, I'm sorry, we can't get there, there's too much cactus. And then they're going to say, don't you know that, in fact, when you put your pipeline into Oklahoma, you are going to be taking part of the 25 percent that belongs to us. And Texas will say, no, we aren't. And then we'll have to have a way of measuring how much goes into the river at different places and what are all these different pipelines are going to take out. You understand what I'm saying.",
  "I would have thought a mechanism would be set up to do that and there is none.",
  "Fine. But they do say expressly, and I don't know what the terrain is like in the other areas. And here it does not say anything about it. That's why I think we're here in the Court because all it says is you can't take more than 25 percent. It doesn't say what happens when Texas is unable to get its 25 percent from the south. I'm now repeating myself, but you point to the language that says what I just say is not consistent with the language.",
  "Which language is it not consistent with?",
  "Go back to the first one because what you have done is you've pushed me back to the equal rights. And now if I am going to fight you on it, I have to say the equal rights to water means equal rights to water arising within its boundaries. And all you have to say is equal rights to water arising anywhere in the subbasin. And if I just heard that, then I might say okay, I think yours is a little better. But -- but we have this enormous administrative mess that would seem to be created, and both those interpretations seem possible. So let's go back to that and let me hear quite clearly, now that I've focused it, what's the answer?",
  "Well, we're only considering the instance where there isn't enough water to meet the 25 percent in Texas. And in that instance, I guess there are 50,000 places, not just in Oklahoma, but also in Arkansas, where they might get some. And all my question, and I think that was being asked, is there anything else you want to say as to why that's an easy matter to decide?",
  "But there was a point, it seems to me, to favor them, which is go back to 1970 -- the '70s, when they drafted this.",
  "So they are in the room, and there are representatives of all four States, and as they say, okay, there is going to be more than 3,000 feet, what happens? And Louisiana would say, we want at least 25 percent, done. Arkansas, 25 percent, done. Oklahoma, same, done. Texas, same, done. But everybody in the room knows that Texas could never get more than 12 percent within its borders. And since it could never get 12 -- more than 12 percent, Louisiana would be sitting there with not really 25 percent but with 38. And so -- so -- - - - - --",
  "-- that would suggest that, hey, no, they all knew this and so they meant there must be some way for Texas to get the extra. Otherwise, why were they saying 25 percent for Texas? If - -",
  "You know, this is an example I made up because I think --",
  "-- an imaginary conversation.",
  "But if in an imaginary conversation --",
  "Why?",
  "Wouldn't that be a fairly easy thing to check going back to 1970 --",
  "-- to find out whether, you know, Texas was just on some little salt flat --",
  "-- near the river and --",
  "In Subbasin 1, that's mostly in Oklahoma, but Texas gets a lot of the water or the other way around? It looked to me like Subbasin 1's in Oklahoma.",
  "Subbasin 1. It says Subbasin 1.",
  "Oh yeah, 401.",
  "Okay. I get it. I get it. Anyway --",
  "-- because of that and because during the time when, let's say, there's 5,000 feet of the -- of the 2,000 extra, you know, Louisiana has to get 500. Okay. How do they know whether they're getting it? I mean, how -- there must be some system of measurement going on or how does this all work?",
  "So, so -- - in other words --",
  "Fine. So that -- I don't know how that cuts because certainly the people who drew this must have thought at least in those other provisions they are going to develop a measurement system in case of controversy.",
  "The relevant legal argument, I think, is look at what you just cited to us about this Reach in the subbasin. 60 percent goes to Texas, 40 percent to Oklahoma.",
  "Okay. Now, they've never measured it. That's because they never fought about it, I guess. And now we have a fight. So why is it any easier to develop the necessary measuring system there --",
  "-- than it would be here?",
  "And that argues against you because your main point, really, is that this is all too complicated --",
  "What about -- what about the mob goes to a grocer and says, you know, you're dead or something if you sell Cheerios, and the reason is because they have a monopoly, some other grocer who's connected has a monopoly. And they threaten him. Now, does that violate Hobbs Act?",
  "What he did was -- and he's -- he's not going to sell Cheerios.",
  "Now -- now, in fact, they're doing it to get money, and they do get money, but via the means of the other grocer. And there is nothing in the words of this Act that says that the property has to be taken from the individual whom you coerce. It's easy to imagine situations where the coerced individual has a relationship, direct, special and so forth, with the person who has the money. So what happens when, say, the mob coerces the person without the property so that he will do a thing such that the person with the property gives them the property?",
  "All right. Now just make it different. What they do is they get the assistant bank employee and they threaten him to do such a thing such as shout at a certain time where they know that that shouting will lead them to be able to rob the bank. I mean, you know, it's easy to think up. What I can't figure out here is, is there some requirement that the person who is coerced has to be the same person as the person who gives them the property. If the answer to that's no, then none of the Government's chamber of horribles is horrible because there's a way around it.",
  "And you haven't found anything on this. You'd be making it up now, is that basically it?",
  "Is the -- is the one?",
  "It has to be more property, more money, more money in return for less services or something than otherwise. That's what you're saying. But I don't think that's -- I mean, right. But the answer -- go ahead because I -- that's the qualification you're making, the McNally qualification.",
  "The obvious problem, which you might want to address at some point, is that -- that if you take your definition that this recommendation, legal recommendation, is property and the fellow said, you know, I'm going to fix you if you don't do it, if that's property, we're back to the honest services statute because anyone in the government and anyone in business, indeed everybody, has a job and those jobs always require you to do things. So if every time somebody threatens a person and says, we don't want you to do the thing you're supposed to do, we want you to do the thing like this, well, then you're violating this property statute.",
  "Now, that seems very far- reaching, hard to reconcile with the abortion case -- the abortion clinic case, et cetera, and it is easy to reconcile with the honest services case.",
  "Well, I mean, that sounds technical. You see, the problem I'm interested in is, by accepting your definition do we suddenly throw within the statute, which speaks of property, any time there is an appropriate threat which has as a condition the person doing the job differently? That's true of whether it's a postman, you know, any public official, any private official, anybody.",
  "That seems very far-reaching. So what's the answer?",
  "Yes, I understand that. But I still would like an answer to my question, and it's well-phrased with an example by Justice Kennedy. Every secretary in the United States who is about to write a recommendation for somebody to go to college or some other thing then is faced with a threat, you put in name such-and-such or put in yes instead of no, and is under your definition that person's property, that what she does the taking of property? The answer is either you think yes, in which case I would like you to defend it --",
  "Or the -- yes. Okay. Then what conceivable ground? I'm not -- I don't want to -- that sounds a little pejorative, but I say, what ground is there for a definition that is so broad that it sweeps within it all working people in the United States in the performance of their ordinary jobs?",
  "As I think about it in terms of the New York cases, as you write them up here, it sounds as if someone was trying to get control of a business. So I think business, land, labor, and capital. All right. I can see why somebody who's trying to get control of a whole business is trying to take land, labor, and capital. There may be no land there, but so what. And -- but a person's trying to take control of another's job by just telling him what to do 2 percent of the time seems well across some kind of line.",
  "No, no. No attaining question. I'm just thinking is it reasonable to call a secretary doing one job which takes 3 percent of her time that hour property, in a way is that different from taking control of Macy's?",
  "And -- and it seems to me that probably it is.",
  "No, no, I'm not worried about copyrights or other intangibles.",
  "That's not the issue.",
  "Why -- why, just as long as we are idly speculating, didn't you use 18 U.S.C. 875, \"Whoever with intent to extort from any person,\" you know, \"anything of value\"?",
  "You don't have -- you don't have property in there. You have a thing of value --",
  "-- is there some -- I mean, it just seems obvious you'd be in a much stronger position when you say that the recommendation not to buy or to buy a particular service from somebody is a thing of value.",
  "Have they in the Court been treated as a thing of value means property?",
  "So no.",
  "Is -- is this a violation of Title VII? I don't know the answer. Smith works for Jones. Jones' whole job is to supervise Smith and be certain that Smith, a well-known racist, has kept his racism under control. He didn't. Smith -- they fired someone -- Smith did -- did some terrible thing and got rid of somebody for racist reasons. He tells his boss. His boss knows it. His boss does nothing about it. All right? Is the boss violating Section VII? He -- he had no reason for doing nothing about it. He, himself, wasn't a racist. It was just his job. But he didn't. Is he -- is he violating Section VII?",
  "The immediate supervisor does --",
  "All right. Now --",
  "Yes, yes, yes. Okay. So, there, what we have is somebody is guilty under Section VII, even though that individual did not, himself, discriminate on the basis of race, it was circumstances where the subordinate discriminated on the basis of race. All right? And, yet, the -- there's no doubt that (m) applies to that. (M) applies to that, I imagine, unless you're going to start distinguishing, within Title VII, are you going to say (m) doesn't apply to that? My question's going to be, if (m) applies to that, then why doesn't it also apply here? Because you see, here, what you have is -- it's at one removed. It is the individual who is retaliating -- been retaliated against. That individual did not discriminate on the basis of race, nor did the individual in Farr read into it, but the whole thing is based on race. And if, sometimes, under Section VII, simpliciter, people are guilty, although the race motive -- the race involvement is one level down, why wouldn't you -- that, perhaps, is too complicated a question, and if -- you only have five minutes left, so I will take your answer as being, Judge, you better think this out on your own.",
  "Obviously, you are better off keeping your time.",
  "I would just like to get to what I think is one of their arguments, and I'm having some -- the argument is purely linguistic, all right? And they say, read (m). (M) says race is a motivating factor in an unfair employment situation. Now, we look to what the unfair employment situation is, at the beginning, unfair employment practice. It is to dismiss a person because of race, all right? So, obviously, it applies. Now, we look to the definition that we're at issue in here. It says it's an unfair labor practice to dismiss a person because of retaliation. Now, retaliation for what? For race, that's true. But we're -- we couldn't care less about whether that race is part or a little bit or it's all -- it could even be totally unjustified. What we're interested in is the retaliation. So they say, you see, the words of (m) do not speak about race. They speak about retaliation. They speak about race. So whatever the policy reasons are, you can't do it any more than if you have a statute that refers to carrots and you try to put in a beet. You just can't do it. Now, that's the answer -- I -- I would like to hear an answer.",
  "So you have to say retribution for race is race? Yes.",
  "Now -- now, what I was looking for, perhaps without success, is some other example that has nothing to do with retribution, but where that's clearly so, that's why the example came into my mind that it is possible that you could, under the basic unfair employment section, find a person liable of race discrimination, even though that person himself was not motivated by race, but perhaps had an obligation to report a race discrimination, which he failed to do because he wanted to go to the racetrack. You see? I'm looking for some other -- is there any other example in the history of these statutes where we've said, you, Mr. Jones or Ms. Smith, you are guilty of race discrimination, even though that's because of your responsibilities because of what you did or didn't do, it's not because you, yourself, held the motive, but you -- you'd attribute the motive to them for reasons to do with the statute. Is there -- does that ring any bell at all?",
  "Now, I have looked --",
  "How many holdings are there?",
  "I take it the answer is zero, right? I mean, I --",
  "-- I looked at your brief, and then I looked at their brief, and they say the answer is zero.",
  "All right. And the -- the holding is that -- the pure holding would be, if the trial court judge says no, you cannot raise it, okay? The defendant is convicted and appeals.",
  "And then he says to the appellate court, they wouldn't let me raise it. And the appellate court says, you have a right to raise it.",
  "That is Lynch. And Lynch is what year?",
  "In 1973. Okay. So we have one.",
  "And -- and was there any other case in 1973 -- this is 10 years before. Was there any other case in which the same pattern of facts and they said the same thing as Lynch?",
  "No, but we -- we have got Lynch on one side. Is there any case -- this is an intermediate appeals court -- is there any case in which the defendant says, I would like to raise it, the judge says no, convicted, appeal, and the intermediate court of appeals says, defendant, you are wrong?",
  "Okay. And so all this period from 1973 until 1995 or whatever --",
  "Carpenter.",
  "2001. All right.",
  "There is exactly one case on point which does favor you, and there are zero cases that favor them; is that right?",
  "Well, Mangiapane was a -- a lot of words, but the holding was not notice; isn't that right?",
  "Okay.",
  "So we've got one. That's -- I'm trying to find out what the state of the art.",
  "The state of the art is one for you, zero for them.",
  "Yes.",
  "There were no others, so, now, I've reduced your one to nothing to like .01 to nothing because it favors you, Lynch, yes, as the Justice -- Chief Justice just pointed out, and, now, you've already said there were no other cases.",
  "All right. But that's because -- everybody agrees with you, I think -- I agree with you on this anyway. I agree the bar puts it in the instructions, and, if the bar puts it in the instructions, people tend to follow it. That's true. So it's not surprising that a lot of people tended to follow it. But, as far as court decisions are concerned, we have no -- what I'm trying to think of is a pre-statute. I give you a little credit on that. That's Lynch. Pre-statute -- and we have what I might sort of exaggeratedly refer to as the great mentioner. We've noticed the great mentioner is often wrong, and -- and, here, even though there are judicial mentioners, they get something. I don't know how much in the scale to -- to give them.",
  "Can you think of a Federal case where -- I see what we have. I'm now adding up the something for Lynch, the something for the bar, which is a -- which is a something, and -- and then the fact that some courts have quite, not surprisingly, tended to follow it, and there were others that mentioned it favorably, but not the Michigan Supreme Court.",
  "Alright, it did mention it favorably. Okay. So -- so we've got that. Now, actually, that Kentucky case, was it? Tennessee?",
  "Yeah, Rogers. That went against you.",
  "Alright. Alright. But can you think of any Federal precedent on this issue that's come even close to that being sufficient? What's your best?",
  "I guess the alternative is you are going to allow the bar associations, helpful as they are, by writing instructions to determine issues that courts themselves have never determined -- or at least not authoritative supreme courts. And that's a worrying matter, where you are trying to create coherent systems of law.",
  "Do you have any idea -- a rough estimate, how many cases there were between, say, '75 and '93, where this defense was raised?",
  "Do you know about how many? About.",
  "But what's in the 37 cases then? I -- they got up there. I assume the defendant must have brought them. They must have brought them. They must have wanted to -- to raise the defense, and somebody said no.",
  "Yeah.",
  "My goodness. Are there cases where they brought such things? I mean, every State has laws that forbid fraud. And mortgages are probably ­­ and loans are probably made in the billions every year. All it takes is someone to say, on his sheet of listing assets, to have a covered security and say, don't worry, I'll hold these, I'll hold them. Or don't worry, I will sell this one and buy that one. Don't worry, I'll buy another one. I won't ­­ I won't put up the security of my sprinkler system. I will sell the sprinkler system and use it to buy a ­­ a covered exchange. I guess if those fall within the securities laws, we would have expected to see billions of actions. Why not?",
  "I know that's what you think, but I need to know why you think it. If there are billion ­­ if I'm right in my ­­ what I just said.",
  "Tell me a case where the SEC has ever ­­ there may be such cases ­­ but what is done is somebody simply tried to get a loan and he put on that sheet of paper listing assets a covered security. And he said, I intend to keep it. Or he said ­­ you know, I will buy some more, or I'll sell it and buy some more or ­­ you know, or put in your three things. Just list the case where they've ever prosecuted that as a securities fraud or private people have. After all, it's beneficial, sometimes, for private people. What are the cases?",
  "Well, what is the case? What is the specific case, private or SEC, that comes the closest ­­ I grant you there is none direct ­­ but comes the closest to Justice Kagan's hypothetical, if you marry me, I will sell my IBM stock?",
  "Try ­­",
  "What is the SEC's closest case ­­ but they may be better at answering this. What is their closest case to the horribles that they foresee if you lose?",
  "But ­­ but the ­­ the case that he said ­­ I'm quite interested in your reaction to which cases that you've ever brought, this would, if you lose here, would prevent you from bringing, and Line was the one that was mentioned.",
  "And in Line, there is a broker who says to a client, give me some money and I will buy some securities on the exchange for you. And they gave him the money, and he didn't. Well, that's directly related to a promise that is going to effect a purchase or sale of a security directly. He's promising someone to buy securities for his account.",
  "I don't think that that's this case.",
  "He didn't say, I will buy them for you.",
  "And I can understand how a promise to buy securities for you is a promise to a person or a statement that would lead a person to take a position. Whether it's this plaintiff or someone in the world, it would lead someone in the world to take a position. What your opponents say is that is what is present ­­ not present here; neither the person who is giving the money nor anyone else, with the possible exception of the defendant, is being led by this statement to take a position in a market for, buy, against, sell, or even, if you like, not sell or buy, hold. I'll throw that in.",
  "That's true, suppose ­­ I think what is difficult to define ­­ Jay Fisk gets into his horse and carriage, drives up and down Wall Street, and says, \"I'm going to buy Union Pacific, I'm going to buy Union Pacific,\" knowing that people will, in fact, all run out and buy it quickly, and what he really intends to do is, when it comes out, he didn't, he's going to sell outright. Anyway, typical fraud. Now, that is certainly covered.",
  "All right. So ­­ so now, here, what we have is Mr. Stanford, I guess, saying to people, \"I'm going to buy securities, I'm going to buy securities.\" And maybe he didn't.",
  "Just like Jay Fisk.",
  "Okay. So why does the first fall within and not the second?",
  "You mean, in other words, if they had done exactly the same thing, but with an intent or ­­ or maybe and the affect of a purchaser of stock or a seller of stock reacting to the statement, then it affects it?",
  "Okay. Where neither of those is present, it doesn't.",
  "Okay.",
  "I mean, that's exactly what I would like you to think about for a second because the last words of Ms. Goldenberg of the SEC, well, if you win, it's going to seriously hamper the SEC in combatting fraud. Of course, it wouldn't in a case like this, because they aren't limited by covered securities, they can deal with any security, and they did bring a case here. But they're worried about what you say, that somehow this will narrow their authority, and they quote Line, which is debatable. But assuming that it's debatable, Mr. ­­ Mr. Clement will have a chance to answer this exact question. And so you are saying there are none. And Line is debatable. And, therefore, it would not have hampered them in any case in the past, nor any one we're likely to think of in the future, but for Line, which is somebody's decision over at the SEC, and can be argued that it fits within your definition. Is that really your answer? Or are we going to discover Mr. Clement coming up and saying, you forgot about da, da, da, da, da?",
  "But there are a few things I ­­ I don't really know. I mean, does ­­ do you have to allege a claim under GERA for this particular individual? I don't know. And if you do, I don't know whether GERA simply picked up whatever saving of the equal protection otherwise would have existed in the ADEA or didn't. And I believe that GERA applies to employment discrimination claims based on gender or race or other things, right? Well, every circuit in the country has said you don't lose your ­­ your constitutional claim there. So are we supposed to read GERA, it goes this way in some cases and that way in other cases, when GERA is silent on the matter? And so I looked to see what the Seventh Circuit said. Nothing. I looked to see what you argued below. Nothing. I looked to see whether it's obvious that GERA does apply or doesn't apply and simply picks it up or not. I don't know. Maybe I'm just being thick. But nonetheless, where I don't know so much and the whole case turns on it, why are we hearing an issue that might not even be in the case?",
  "That's about people not like the client who's at issue here. That is about people whom the ADEA did cover. Isn't that an advisory opinion in respect to this case? I don't know. That has a certain ring to it. But ­­ but what are we doing, deciding whether the ADEA applies and in what way to a person to whom it doesn't apply, assuming that GERA is, in fact, a separate statute that you have to sue under, the answer to which I do not know and which has never been argued.",
  "And so, if there's so little about it, sometime, on occasion, we dismiss a case as improvidently granted, which is not a particularly desirable thing to do. But how could we avoid doing that here?",
  "It's pretty universal he's not an employee under ADEA, though he might be under GERA. You have to say yes or no because, if you're going to say ­­ I mean, you know, let's either do it or not do it. If you ­­ if you want to leave this issue in the case, it's possible to argue we should decide this whole issue on the ground that, although he's not really a bird, he's a fish or whatever.",
  "But, I mean, that ­­ this is supposed to be fairly realistic, I think, what we're supposed to do.",
  "There's no real possibility that any court is going to find that your client was, in fact, an employee without GERA. That's what you said; is that right?",
  "It's a different statute. But just without GERA ­­",
  "­­ he's a political appointment or whatever it is, so he's not within ADEA. That's what I think this is about.",
  "That's correct?",
  "And you agree with that?",
  "Okay. Then thank you very much. And then my argument comes into play that we shouldn't be deciding issues of an advisory nature that do not involve individuals who fall within the statute that someone once interpreted.",
  "What about doing ­­",
  "What if the ­­ is there anything unfair about this? I think Justice Ginsburg wrote an opinion in ­­ I recall a Third Circuit case involving ERISA or some medical thing, and an issue came up that was quite relevant, and nobody had really thought about it before or done much about it. And what she wrote, to my recollection, is, well, we would like the advice of the lower court if they want to give it. And so we send it back for the Third Circuit to consider whether it's appropriate to reach the issue and, if it is appropriate to reach the issue, do so. Or, if they think the district court should reach it, do so. In other words, we can't figure it out at this moment what's fair in terms of the entire litigation. Now, would that ­­ would that be a serious problem for you or your client?",
  "Can you clarify something for me about habeas corpus law?",
  "I ­­ I have to imagine the facts, so let's take it as a hypothetical. That ­­ The U.S. ­­ the district attorney says, this lawyer was adequate, and really, two factors make that obvious. The first factor is that the client said that she was innocent, and taking that into account with the other things, that could have justified, adequately, his withdrawal of the plea and not convincing her not to. Second, the sentence that the district attorney wanted to give was more than a year greater than the guidelines for manslaughter, and that could have justified it. Now, it writes ­­ the court then writes in its opinion only the second reason and never mentions the first. Now, we go to habeas, and the habeas court thinks that second reason is pretty flimsy there. Gee, she was exposing herself to murder, et cetera, it's pretty flimsy. The first isn't so bad, but they didn't rely on it. Okay. So now, what is the habeas court supposed to do? Is ­­ should the ­­ should the defendant have gone back to the State court first? Is the habeas court supposed to have its own independent hearing and make up its own mind? How does this work?",
  "I'm glad. I would love to know the answer.",
  "Well, are there rules in this area? I didn't think ­­ are there rules? I mean, doesn't every judge, whenever that judge is deciding a factual matter or the jury, take into account from every witness, whether that witness is making a pretty self­serving statement? I mean, that's a factor. And I guess we could have some situations, sometime, in some place, where a witness got on the stand and said something that was totally in his favor, but when you heard it, hmm, and you knew the case, hmm, he's right. And then that could happen with this kind of witness, too. It could happen. I'm not saying it very often does, but it could. So why should we have any special rule for these witnesses and not for any other?",
  "So the point is that there has to be some evidence. You ­­ you are saying that the court was wrong when they said your client said she wasn't guilty. Now, this affidavit doesn't show that. I mean, paragraph 6 doesn't say who spoke first, but common sense suggests that the deputy sheriff wouldn't have made that statement, unless she spoke first. I mean, does he go around saying to everybody, just generally, oh ­­ you know, if you are not guilty, you shouldn't plead guilty. I mean, it says they had discussions, and during the discussions, he told her she shouldn't plead guilty if she wasn't guilty.",
  "Where?",
  "Where ­­ approached her ­­",
  "­­ and had discussions with her. It doesn't say why he approached her. I mean, I just don't think people normally do that, they go to every person in jail and say, you know, if you are not guilty, you shouldn't plead guilty. I mean, somebody might, but something triggered that advice, and the affidavit doesn't tell me what triggered that advice. So I could infer that what triggered the advice was her statement she was not guilty, or I could infer this is an unusual situation where, for some reason unknown, he brought it up. I don't know, from reading paragraph 6.",
  "So whose burden is it?",
  "Okay.",
  "It doesn't matter. Why doesn't it matter? Because if she went, he ­­ she said ­­ you know, I'm not really guilty, he said, well, you shouldn't plead guilty, she said ­­ but I have a lawyer that will get rid of your guilty plea. If it went something like that, and then we assume the lawyer was told about this ­­ it doesn't say, but that's a reasonable assumption. And then the court opinion of Michigan seems to make sense that that was a reason ­­ that was one of the reasons that made his conduct in ­­ in withdrawing the plea or ­­ you know, not strongly advising her against it. That was one reason why that wasn't an inadequate assistance of counsel. Now, where have I made my mistake in this chain?",
  "I thought your argument was this ­­ there is a reason that they spoke about, which was, well, she said she was innocent. Now, as to that one, what they wrote is the record discloses that the second attorney's advice was set in motion by defendant's statement to the sheriff's deputy that he did not commit the offense. Now, you say that's just contrary to fact as you point to the affidavit. And the affidavit I read, I think it's a little ­­ rather ambiguous in that respect, and I can overturn that, or a Federal court can, only if this factual statement I just read you is clearly wrong, clearly. So I have a tough time saying it's clearly. And I know they overstated because they said automatically, and that’s good ­­ well, that may be an overstatement. You have to read it in light of that sentence. But then you're making a second argument, I take it, if this is right. Your second argument is, anyway, he was incompetent for a completely different reason. He didn't read the record. And if he'd read it, he never would have made the statement that this is just a manslaughter case. He would have seen that, if she withdrew her guilty plea, she'd be tried for murder, and then she'd get a really long sentence. So that's an ineffective assistance of counsel. Now, what does the court in Michigan say about that? Nothing. Nothing. So now, I wonder. Maybe nobody made that argument to them, or maybe they made it, and they rejected it sub silentio. That's why I asked my first question. Okay? So ­­ and you heard the response. Even if they had heard that argument and they said nothing about it, they don't have to ­­ they don't have to mention every argument made. If they just deny, we assume they deny it, and what we do is see whether they were within their rights to deny it. That's how we are supposed to look at it, does it clearly violate Supreme Court law to deny it? And there is going to be a factual part of that and a legal part. All right. How do we deal with that?",
  "First of all, did anybody make the argument as clearly as you have made it? I saw what it was, I think. So that's ­­ did anybody make that argument to the Michigan court?",
  "No. Okay. Well, that's the end of that, isn't it? What you are coming for is you have to proceed by asking for reopening in the Michigan court and see if they say it's too late. And then ­­ you know, et cetera, they're all spelled out in this opinion, which I can't remember, Cullen or Pinholster or something, and this isn't an argument for us now.",
  "How is that?",
  "Now, all these were there at ­­ but for one ­­ were there at the time of Buckley vs. Valeo, and I guess the Court thought something could happen like the following: Candidate Smith, we can only give him $2,600, but he has a lot of supporters. And each of them ­­ 40 of them gets a brainstorm. And each of the 40 puts on the internet a little sign that says, \"Sam Smith PAC. This money goes to people like Sam Smith. Great people.\" Now, we can give each of those 40 $5,000. They aren't coordinated. They're not established by a single person. Each is independently run. And we know pretty well that that total of $5,000 times 40 will go to Sam Smith. Okay? What does that violate.",
  "$5,000 is ­­",
  "$5,000. So we all have is my $5,000 going to the PAC, and there happened to be 400 PACs. So 5,000 times ­­ 4,000. Five times 40, five times 400, how much is that? I'm not too good at math.",
  "No, no. There is no earmarking.",
  "Because earmarking requires that you write on a check or in an accompanying letter that you want the money to go to something.",
  "It does not?",
  "No, no. They'll contribute to several because they'll get more than one contribution.",
  "All we're trying to do ­­ because it's hard to do in oral argument. But what we're trying to do in both, I think, our cases is that we looked up all the rules and the regs ­­ or my law clerk did ­­ and ­­ and what she discovered ­­ and it may be wrong because I'll look at it again ­­ is there has been no significant change in the earmarking rules, in any of the rules that you're talking about, but for one change since Buckley. The one change ­­ the one change is the change that all contributions made by political committees established by or financed or maintained or controlled by a single person will count as one. So what you're seeing in these hypotheticals is, simply, the construction of precisely the same situation that existed in Buckley while being careful to have not one person control the 4,000 PACs, which is pretty easy to do. And if you want to say, is this a reality? Turn on your television set or internet because we found instances, without naming names, where it certainly is a reality.",
  "Here is the actual ad ­­ the actual ad. I won't name the candidate. You see a picture of the candidate. There is a sign that says \"Smith PAC.\" Okay? That's what it says. And then it says, \"Make a donation to help Smith PAC support Republican,\" if you like, or \"Democratic candidates.\" Period. And then they have an address. All right. Now, it doesn't take a genius to figure out what they're going to do with the money and that maybe Smith will get a pretty good share of it. Now, if Smith has 400 people who figure this out, he will have 400 times 5,000 times one person. Now, you say that really couldn't happen because of the designation. We haven't found a designation rule that would stop it. But then Justice Sotomayor is saying, I don't know. And I don't either because there's been no hearing, there's been no evidence presented. There is nothing but dismissal.",
  "So ­­ so I read in one summer before BCRA ­­ I spent several weeks reading the record before the District Court in that very lengthy case on this. And it was filled with testimony by senators and congressmen that a handful of people can give hundreds of thousands of dollars. They know who those people are and that those people do have undue influence, which means, in First Amendment terms, that the individual who, in fact, has wonderful ideas and convinces others, even by paying three cents to buy the internet or something, hasn't a shot because it will influence people, not ideas, but the money. Now, there was a record on that. Here, there is no record showing whether this aspect does or does not have the same tendency. That is why I ask: How can I decide this on the basis of theory when the record previously showed the contrary of what's been argued and, in fact, at least might show that even in respect to these limits?",
  "That actually does very much ­­ while I don't ­­ I'm looking for an answer here. It's not that I have one at all. It is rather basic, the point I think that's being made now. I mean, as I understand it, the whole reason ­­ it is no doubt that campaign limits take an ordinary person, and they say, you cannot give more than such­and­such an amount. There are apparently, from the Internet, 200 people in the United States who would like to give $117,000 or more. We're telling them, you can't; you can't support your beliefs. That is a First Amendment negative. But that tends to be justified on the other side by the First Amendment positive because, if the average person thinks that what he says, exercising his First Amendment rights, just can't have an impact through public opinion upon his representative, he says, what is the point of the First Amendment? And that's a First Amendment point. All right. So that's basic, I think. Now, once that's so, Congress has leeway. And you are saying ­­ and I have seen all over the place, that that's why we don't want those 200 people to spend more than 117­ or 120,000 because the average person thinks the election is ­­ after the election, all the actions are affected by the pocketbook and not by the merits of the First Amendment arguments. Okay. And now, you say the person can do the same thing anyway; just call it independent. And what independent does, he can spend 40 million. He can spend 50 million. And all that does is sort of mix up the messages because the parties can't control it. Now, that's, I think, the question that's being asked. And I think that that is a very serious question, and I'd like to know what flows from it. Is it true? So what? What are we supposed to do? What is your opinion about that question?",
  "So what would you think? I was just listening to your dialogue, and you heard ­­ this is pretty tough, we try to construct some hypotheticals, and ­­ and the counsel says, oh, I've got this part wrong or that part wrong or the other one, and they may be right. And we can't do this, figuring out all these factual things in an hour, frankly. And they may be right. I'm not sure. There hasn't been a full hearing. It seemed to me there are things to explore in respect to the circumvention. Who is right? Should you change the hypothetical slightly, or what? There are things to explore in respect to the question of whether being able to write a $3.6 million check to a lot of people does leave the average person to think, my First Amendment speech, in terms of influencing my representative, means nothing. There are things to explore in terms of the relationship between what is permissible; namely, spend $40 million independently. And what isn't permissible; namely, spending more than 117,000. None of these have been considered. They would seem relevant. So what do you think about going into these matters in a district court where the evidentiary aspects of them can be explored at some length?",
  "Well, if it's interrelated. But the ­­ the record, as far as I recall it from several years ago, talked about at length, I don't like to use the word \"corrupting\"; I like to use integration ­­ \"integrity of the process,\" that notion to get people to think that their First Amendment speech makes a difference, etcetera. Let's say \"corruption.\" Mostly when it got to this part, the aggregate, it was about circumvention. And I think you are quite right to say, but there is a huge corruption aspect to this. But we don't have a lot of information in the record about that, do we? If I just ­­ did I just miss it? Did I miss something?",
  "Yeah.",
  "It is a close parallel when I think about it, maybe ­­ or you think about it, but if you're really talking ­­ they don't think about it that way. And so that's why I've been pushing this idea, you see, of let's go into this, okay? If they want us to go into it, go into it.",
  "So what?",
  "So what? That is, I mean, as I understand it, you agree that, on the partnership level, the IRS could say the following in a hypothetical, I'll now give you. The partnership says that this asset has a basis of $10 million. We sold it for 8. Therefore, the partnership has a loss of 2. The IRS says the real value is not $10 million basis, it was a $2 million basis, and therefore, in fact, you don't have a loss of 2, you have a gain of 8. Moreover, your understatement was more than 400 percent or whatever the percent is ­­ you know, it was a ­­ it was huge. It was an $8 million ­­ you know, overstatement and, therefore, penalties of 400 percent attach. Okay? You agree they can say that.",
  "Yes.",
  "At the ­­ right correct.",
  "Okay. I understand you're making this, but what they've actually done there, since it doesn't say anything about inside/outside, is they're saying, partners, to the extent that you use this on your own return, remember, there's a 400 percent penalty attached. Okay. You agree they can do that. Now, what they've done here is they've said, there is no partnership. So to the extent that you use this as your ­­ as a basis, as you use this on your individual return, remember there's a 400 percent penalty attached because 4 times zero or whatever it is, you understand the mathematics. So we haven't got any reference to inside/outside basis here. In both cases, it seems to me they're doing roughly the same thing. And so where in the statute does it say they can't do it? They're saying, indeed, a penalty attaches to ­­",
  "­­ the use of this partnership by you, the partner, to reduce your taxes.",
  "Now, to the extent you don't use it, of course, you don't have to pay anything, but to the extent you use it, you have to pay whatever it is, plus the 400 percent.",
  "So then the question is ­­ the question is do the words \"partnership item\" in the section \"scope of judicial review\" refer only to those items that the partnership in fact is concerned with? Or do they consider the partnership itself?",
  "That's the issue. Okay.",
  "We're interpreting the word \"partnership items\" in that statute, and you are saying the partnership itself is not a partnership item.",
  "What? No?",
  "Oh, no, no, But I'm ­­ that's just a question of how they use it on the return. There are many ways in which a person could use a partnership item on the return. If this is a partnership item ­­ I mean, a person might, for example, have no tax, in which case ­­",
  "I understand how someone could be confused, and I am genuinely confused. I have read this several times.",
  "And the reason I'm confused is this: That I ­­ I understand your difference between the outside basis and the inside basis. Now, what I'm trying to do is to figure out, via the statute, I think like what Justice Scalia was trying to do, I think, where does that matter?",
  "No, I understand that, too. I'm just trying to get the precise words of the statute that it would make a difference because, in common sense, it doesn't seem to me to make much difference, but ­­ but maybe in this statutory language it does, so I want to know what words.",
  "Okay. Now, you just told me. I said that, I thought, and you said, no, it didn't, those weren't the right words. But if you say those are the right words, then explain to me why a partnership item cannot include a partnership itself.",
  "Try with me again. Again, just try once more. Suppose that a person owes a gift tax and what he gave to his children or whatever was in part an interest in a partnership. Now, go back to my example, all right, because I want to get ­­ my example is everybody agrees that the 8, 10 million versus 8 million, there's a penalty attached. Well, he ­­ he doesn't take that into account when he gives the gift. Now, if he did give the gift, it would ­­ he'd have to pay a tax on the gift, on his gift tax return. Okay? He ­­ they assess that on the ­­ they would assess that, wouldn't they, even though it's a gift tax return, not an ­­ not an income tax return. MR. GARRE. Right. I mean, ultimately ­­",
  "Okay. So no matter what kind of return you use, no matter what the tax situation, if the partnership real ­­ real value makes a difference, you have to put it in, don't you?",
  "Yes, yes, in individual gift tax return. Maybe it's in a State tax return. Maybe it's an income tax return.",
  "So it affects the taxpayer differently, and I'm just saying, why does it matter?",
  "­­ that the way this affects the taxpayer is through what you call his outside basis. Why does that matter?",
  "Yes, yes. But of course, any ­­ in my example, too, it will vary. Of course, it will vary. Some people will use ­­ have no tax to pay, no extra tax, because their ­­ their income tax that they paid was zero. In fact, the government owed them a refund, so it didn't matter. It varies in many ways. So since it varies in many ways and varies by many returns, it might vary depending upon whether it affected your outside basis or something else.",
  "How does it not? \"Partnership items\" is defined to include legal and factual determinations that underlie the determination, among other things, of income, credit, gain/loss. Okay. Whether there is a partnership at all does underlie the determination of whether the partnership return, which had all kinds of numbers on it, if it shows anything.",
  "All right. So therefore, it's a partnership item. Does this penalty relate to a partnership item? I don't want to say that you are right for the wrong reasons, so you better be sure I'm right. That is, the ­­ the ­­ does it relate to a partnership item? I just told you what a partnership item was. It certainly seems to because zero is what it relates to.",
  "End of case?",
  "It can't be that simple. We have three courts here ­­",
  "I have one question here. into thinking, well, perhaps it doesn't matter, frankly; you can get to the same result under any one of these three approaches. But then one thing Professor Sachs says does bother me, that if we take your approach, then how do we deal with the problem of removal? I mean, you can only remove a case to a court which is in the district where the person ­­ the plaintiff filed. Now, if there is a forum selection clause, the defendant seems to me to be stuck, because he can't go to a ­­ he can't go to a ­­ to another. He can't go to another court. He can't go to the court within the district because of the forum selection clause, and he can't go into another court because of 1441(a). So that argues to me that we ought to either take the 1404 approach, or we ought to take Professor Sachs' approach, unless you have an answer to that.",
  "You didn't really explain ­­ I'm sorry. I'll read it more carefully later. But how ­­ it says you have to ­­ you have to remove to the court or the district and division where the place of action is pending, so if it's filed in State court in Texas, you have to remove to the Texas Federal court. Now, how do we get ­­ and you can't go to the Texas Federal court, according to you, because of the contract. Okay. Now, how ­­ now, you explain how ­­ how this provision over 1390(c) gets around that?",
  "Well, you ­­ in other words, you can remove to the Texas court, even though it says you can remove ­­ you can remove to the district court despite the contract.",
  "Despite the contract.",
  "So what the court should say in Texas is, we have a contract which says you have to go to Virginia, but because of 1390(a) we forget about the contract and we remove it here.",
  "That's what you're saying Texas should say.",
  "No?",
  "Yes.",
  "Now, what about ­­ suppose the plaintiff says, Please dismiss this immediately because of 1406 or ­­ you know, because 1406 says you have to dismiss it; venue isn't proper here.",
  "No, no. The contract says you go to Virginia.",
  "They filed it in Texas State court. You tried to remove it to Texas Federal court.",
  "And they say, I'm very sorry. The contract that he loves says we can't remove it to Texas Federal court.",
  "Well, what is the problem with this? You admit that if he goes to Virginia ­­ well, he files his suit in Virginia. All right. Then he says, judge, everything's in Texas, please remove under 1404(a) ­­ you know, go ­­ send it down to Texas. And you agree that ­­ that in an unusual case, you say, because you give a lot of weight to the contract, he could win and go to Texas, right?",
  "That's your position, fine. If that's your position, what conceivable difference does it make if he goes to Texas in the first place, and then you say, remove it to Virginia? I mean, it should work out the same way. It should work out that the balancing under 1404 ­­ you know, it gives you the ­­ the factors should be the same, shouldn't they?",
  "It's a terrible thing. You have to say 1404(a), and the other case he has to say 1404(a) and it ­­ I mean, maybe it makes some tremendous practical difference. But if it makes not much difference, I have three routes that seem to me all should work out the same way, and in favor of their route is the absolute language that Justice Kagan pointed out before, plus the footnote. Okay? So I'm thinking, hey, this doesn't make ­­ it's important to have a rule. It's important to have one clear approach. But as between the three, it shouldn't matter, and they should all reach the same conclusions. So let's go with the language of Stewart. All right. What about ­­ now, what's the answer to that?",
  "All right. So why ­­ why then couldn't you go to Virginia with all these factors? I mean, maybe the jury has to take 42 visits to the bottom of an oil well shaft. I don't know. I mean, there could be something that would weigh in your favor. I don't know the case. So why not go to Virginia and then file a 1404 motion? And it should reach the same result, whether you ­­ you go to Texas and ask to stay there or whether you go to Virginia under 1404(a) ­­ you win this case, let's say ­­ or whether you go to Virginia. It should get to the same place, shouldn't it?",
  "So it's actually your expense because you would have to go to Virginia and you would have to file the motion. Maybe you can do it by mail or you'd have to ­­ but I don't know.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, no. They are not saying ­­ they said that you could make the 1404 motion in Virginia, and they think it would only be granted in an exceptional case, but that's their opinion in that, and so it should come to the same conclusion. They aren't barring you from that on their view. But my thought is that, if all these come to the same result in the end and you just need one ruling, we have something pointing on their side ­­ your side, which is the Stewart footnote and the language of the ­­ you know, the absolute language of the venue statutes, and you have something pointing in their side, which is, if we count by numbers, five circuits are in their favor and only three in yours. All right. Help me.",
  "That argues, then, it might be slightly against you.",
  "The ­­ if, in fact, you specify a State court, if, in fact, you specify a foreign court, if, in fact, you specify arbitration, you agree, in those instances, you are going to use forum non conveniens or you are going to use 1406. But you are saying where you specify a court in a different State, namely a Federal court in a different State, there you use 1404.",
  "Yes, it was forum non conveniens. Oh, you use forum non conveniens in all three? You don't use ­­ I mean, they specify a State court?",
  "They say venue is a State court ­­",
  "­­ use forum non conveniens in all those? Okay. Use forum non conveniens in all those, but you use 1404 if they specify another Federal court. That's what ­­ that's what ­­ that's what you're ­­",
  "All right.",
  "You use 12(b)(3), okay.",
  "But my point is you're using something else, so they would say, well, let's have it the same ­­ you know ­­ okay. I see the answer.",
  "Forget it.",
  "Do you know the answer ­­ this is another ­­ I keep thinking they should all come to the same conclusion. But, then, what about this point Justice Sotomayor raised? Suppose you sue in Texas ­­ you know, you get there, but the contract, let's say, was a different contract from yours, but it just was made in Nevada. Everything about this concerns Nevada. Are they really going to use Texas law to interpret the contract rather than Nevada's? I would have thought that the choice of law question is a different question, and where you sue should be irrelevant to the choice of law question except insofar ­­ I don't know. Maybe you looked ­­",
  "Are ­­ are you finished? All right. I'd just like, if you'd want, to give you a chance to take what I've ­­ I think Professor Sachs says, look, there is a way which you can both follow the statutes literally and say, well, venue is here, and also get the place to the right forum respecting the contract. Just say it is an affirmative defense, which Justice Ginsburg says the First Circuits follow this approach. You put it in the complaint. The answer, and once it's in the answer, the judge can put it front and center. Indeed, in case he forgets to do that, the defendant will remind him and say, you've got to get it to the right court, and let's decide this affirmative defense thing first. And ­­ and now, we're back in the same place. What do you think of that?",
  "So how do we deal with that? That's what's ­­ I mean, it's in your interest to argue that ­­ tell me how to deal with this. It's perhaps true ­­ I think it's true that a State doesn't have to allow companies to have wholly­owned corporations. Under the Constitution of the United States, nothing says they do. Or a State could say, wholly­owned corporations? Well, there's no limited liability. Or they could say, in certain kinds of accidents, there's n o limited ­­ et cetera. You see, they have lots of choice. So what really seems to have been going on here is the Ninth Circuit, from your perspective, just really misstated California law by out to lunch. When they say we want it to be as broad as the Constitution, they don't mean, because we could get rid of limited liability, that that's what we do. So ­­ so how can we deal with a circuit court that seems to seriously misstate the law of a State?",
  "I understand that that's what you would like as the bottom line.",
  "I would like to know the chain of reasoning that gets ­­",
  "Really, suppose I think that this was crying out for an en banc. After you got your decision, we decided Goodyear, didn't we? And yet, even though there is no effort to reconcile the case with Goodyear, as there couldn't be ­­ we hadn’t decided it ­­ by the time we decided it, it still could have been taken en banc.",
  "But I guess we have no power at all to force the circuit, although that's what they are there for, to consider such a matter en banc.",
  "And they didn't say anything about it ­­",
  "But, now, we're ­­ look at the odd thing. It might not violate the Constitution. I mean, it's the same question, but it is bothering me, too. It might not violate the Constitution of the United States, for a State to say, we don't have limited liability in respect to the subsidiary corporation of a general corporation. It's very unlikely to do that. It's going to be a big problem to get investment in that State, but it might not violate ­­ it might not violate the Constitution as here, to say ­­ you know, we are, in California, not going to have subsidiaries when a plaintiff comes in and sues on the basis of something that happened outside the country; but we will have it when, in fact, he sues on something that happened in California. Now, a State could do that, I guess, but it's pretty odd. And if you look what the ­­ what the Ninth Circuit said in its opinion, it never referred to California law directly. It's all Ninth Circuit cases or Second Circuit cases. The only thing it says about California is probably something that was quoted in the Ninth Circuit case, something like that. So what am I supposed to do? Because State law is up to the State. How do I handle that?",
  "So you think, in other words, that California has abolished ­­ I mean, California says there is no corporate insulation, a corporation, when it tries to work through a subsidiary, that subsidiary has unlimited liability from lawsuits in California? Is that what you think California law is?",
  "The answer then to my question is yes. You think right today, in California, the law is there is no ­­ there is unlimited liability for a corporation that is a subsidiary of another?",
  "Well, you can bring a lawsuit, unlimited liability.",
  "It’s the same problem, and I don't know what to do. It's really ­­ Justice Scalia has been mentioning this problem. You're seeing it through the lens of jurisdiction. I'm not. I'm seeing it through the lens of corporate law. Five shareholders get together from outside California, and they set up a corporation in California. Why? To insulate themselves from liability, particularly lawsuits. Now, instead of those five shareholders, everything is the same, but now, it's a German corporation, and suddenly, they can't insulate themselves from the lawsuits in California. I think it unlikely that California would have such a corporate law, whether it goes by the name of jurisdiction or some other name, but that's a State law question. So what am I supposed to do? That's where we started this argument. And that's what I ­­",
  "What?",
  "Well, another thing we could do is we could say we've decided, now, two cases that seem to bear on this, and one is Goodyear, and the other is Kiobel; and we could say we'll send it back for consideration of this case, in light of those.",
  "Some people think that there is a difference between the plus and the minus. Some judges differ on that point. Some agree sort of with you, and some agree sort of not. All right? Let's think of those who agree sort of, and then I have a question. And you know this area better than I. So think of Grutter. Grutter permits affirmative action. Think of the earlier cases. They permitted affirmative action where it was overcome, the effects of past discrimination, but probably not otherwise. Now, that's what I want to know. Are there areas, other than education, where affirmative action would not be forbidden to achieve a goal other than overcoming the effects? Have you got the question? And does an answer come to mind?",
  "Okay. So there are a set.",
  "Fine. If there are a set, what I ­­ what I'd like you to explain, if ­­ if you can take a minute, is think of how a city is set up. There are a vast number of administrators. There are a vast number of programs. It could be an administrator somewhere says he'd like to give a preference, maybe for good reason. But then the city council votes no. Or because there are other ways of doing it, by, you know, first come, first served or some other criteria that doesn't use race. Are all of those unlawful? Every one? Do you have to leave it up to the ­­ no matter what the subject, no matter what the ­­ or are you going to draw a line somewhere? Is there a line that you could draw that would take your case on the right side from your point of view, but would say we're not giving power to every administrator in the city to decide on his own whether to use racial preferences without a possibility of a higher­up veto ­­",
  "­­ which I don't think you want to say, but maybe you do.",
  "So what's the line? Is there any line that you can say, look here. We were trying to be very helpful, and all of a sudden they put this thing on the ballot, you can't even get it through. Okay? That's your basic point. But ­­ but if you think of ­­ you have to write something, and that something has tremendous effect all over the place. So what kind of line is there, in your opinion?",
  "I'm not saying instead of political process. Don't let me put words in your mouth. Think what you think here. You say where the authority is divided in a certain way, and that is true under the constitution of the State. So the State government lacks the power. And then you have to take the power from the people and change the constitution, and when you do that in respect to a benefit. Then, in respect to benefits, Washington ­­ you know, Seattle and Hunter kick in. See, where you’re not dealing with past discrimination.",
  "That's the benefit to a minority group. But what I'm thinking is go read the cases. You yourself seem to say these cases seem to apply alike to the benefits or to the discrimination against it. I mean, there is lots of language in Seattle.",
  "You come ­­ now, suppose you take that and say, all right, it was meant in context, but the context includes constitutional amendments. Because with the constitutional amendment you are restructuring. Now, you would lose on that theory, but there would be a limitation on the extent to which the people have the right to move powers around.",
  "What happens ­­ what happens if you brought suit before the exhaustion, while it was still going on, before it ended, but you said to the judge, Judge, we're in the middle of exhausting, so don't ­­ we don't want to hear the case until that's finished, can you do that or not?",
  "It's an open question. So then if it were held that you could do it, you could file the lawsuit within the three years and if exhaustion had not taken place, well, just don't hear the case until the exhaustion does. That would solve your problem.",
  "I mean, it wouldn't solve your problem because you waited too long. But I mean that would solve the problem of other people in the future in your situation.",
  "What is it that stops that? I mean, on that ground you would say these clauses are valid. It's valid to say he has to ­­ you have to bring a lawsuit within three years. Nothing wrong with that. File a protective complaint.",
  "­­ What about our saying that, and what about our saying to the courts as a judge­made doctrine, exhaustion has to conclude in enough time so that they have time left to file a lawsuit?",
  "Yes. Because isn't ­­ isn't exhaustion a judge­made doctrine?",
  "It would be an unfair process that doesn't leave them a reasonable amount of time to file a lawsuit.",
  "I suppose the problem here is that we have found nine cases ­­ you know, we can do computer­assisted research, which my clerks are good at ­­ and ­­ and they found five cases in which the exhaustion period was actually longer than the 3­year statute of limitations. And then they found four others that were ­­ well, there was like 5 days left in one, and there was 5 months in another. And in most of ­­ almost all those cases, the judge got around the problem by saying the statute begins to run at the time the exhaustion is finished. Now, I can think of other ways of solving the problem. One was, you get a reg. Another way was that we interpret the exhaustion doctrine to require leaving at least a year. But what's your way of solving the problem? Are you just going to let those nine people just ­­ they can't bring their lawsuit, or what?",
  "The question was, what do you want to do with those nine people? Now, I know there are a lot of ERISA cases, but still there were nine people ­­",
  "­­ who will have this problem. And my question is, what do you suggest we do about them?",
  "My question was, what specific doctrine or ­­ I saw three routes. Now, you can name some others, and we do about those nine people precisely, not in some general terms, but we do what about them?",
  "And now, I suppose ­­ so we could use equitable estoppel, even though nobody has said anything, even though nobody held out anything as a basis for estoppel. But we could say use equitable estoppel. I'll think about that one. Is there any other thing we could use?",
  "There, your opponent is saying, I have a simpler answer. I mean, instead of having to worry whether 14 months is too long or 7 months is too short or a year and a half is adequate time, instead of having to worry about that in difficult cases, I have a simpler idea. We will just run the three years from the time the ­­ the internal exhaustion is finished. Then you don't have to worry about it. You don't have to worry about equitable tolling, and you don't have to worry about all this other stuff. That's their point.",
  "But if they do that, the question answers itself. The ­­ the ­­",
  "The ­­ the question I would like to know is if you know empirically, roughly, what are typical statutes of limitations in this area? The basic rule is State law unless contract, is that right?",
  "And how long on average? Do you have any idea of ­­ of how long people normally have to bring their action?",
  "It's the standard provision in contracts?",
  "Well, I mean ­­ in certain types of insurance contracts. So ERISA is all over the place. I wouldn't even know where to start. Does the Department of Labor keep statistics on this or what?",
  "It's ­­ the doctrine of exhaustion is a judge­created doctrine.",
  "And therefore you cannot, in your contract, contract yourself around it. You can't get out of it.",
  "So what this would require would be to say that that judge­created doctrine requires exhaustion to take place before the accrual of the statute of limitations, end of opinion. For the reason of certainty, for the reason of uniformity, for the reason of avoiding, through hiring lawyers, et cetera, an interference with the voluntary nature, simple nature, and hopefully pre­legal involvement nature of that exhaustion process, all right? Da, da, da. Now, the reason ­­ what trouble would that cause?",
  "What trouble in the industry would that cause?",
  "Look, you agree that we would overturn the plan term if the plan term was no exhaustion?",
  "The courts would overturn a plan term which plan term said no exhaustion.",
  "Of course not because what we are trying to do ­­ and employers are very cooperative and we are trying to work out a system with the exhaustion thing that will not destroy ERISA plans or something.",
  "It ­­ it's which is the ­­ and that's why I phrased it in terms of an explanation of the exhaustion requirement.",
  "They do that, fine, done. What we interpret the statute as saying, under constitutional compulsion, it uses the word \"may,\" and if the magistrate concludes that there is ­­ after all, the basic principle of hearings is you don't need a hearing where there's nothing to have a hearing about. So unless the defendant demonstrates that there is a sound reason to believe that the grand jury was wrong, they only heard one side of the story, and that there is no probable cause, you don't have to give him a hearing. But the word is \"may.\" And so, like five circuits, Mr. Magistrate, if you think that there is a good chance ­­ phrase that as you want ­­ that they can show that the grand jury was wrong and they want the money to pay a lawyer ­­ by the way, without a good lawyer, they're never going to make their case ­­ and then, under those circumstances, the magistrate may. Now, that's a narrow exception. It preserves the lawyer. It's consistent with the words of the statute. It respects the grand jury, at least to the same extent that bail hearings ­­ and when you have ­­ oh, yes, and probably, I could think of a few others or something. But the ­­ it's not undercutting the grand jury. What's wrong with it?",
  "No, it leaves open ­­ it leaves open the question in Monsanto explicitly, and the only change that I've made with that explicit leaving open the due process question in the footnote in Monsanto is, instead of turning it on the Constitution, I turned it on the principle of constitutional avoidance.",
  "You say \"never\" is consistently, and I think it is consistent with the footnote.",
  "It didn't actually. What it says is, we reject the discretion in the context of Judge Widener having said that, even where there is probable cause, we are going to balance a lot of factors, and what it says then at the ­­ wait, I had it a second ago. I'll find it again. It says, at the top of the next page, it says that the \"may\" thing refers to that. I'll get it for you later.",
  "Here it is. It says, \"Thus, it's plainly aimed at implementing the commands at 853(a) and cannot sensibly be construed to give the district court discretion to permit the dissipation of the very property that 853(a) requires to be forfeited upon conviction.\" Okay?",
  "Exactly. That's what it says. So the claim here is this is property that 850(a)(3)(A) does not require the defendant to­to forfeit upon conviction, for there can be no conviction because there is no evidence, and, therefore, I don't find that that sentence in Monsanto destroys the use of the word which Congress put in, \"may.\"",
  "Okay. So far, this is very conceptual, which is absolutely fine. I just want to leave that plain for a moment, and if I leave the conceptual plain, what I find is that they have a pretty complicated case. They are saying that this ­­ the defendant took some medical devices with permission from hospitals that were old and used, and he didn't return them to the manufacturer, who didn't want them. And what he did is he figured out this way of selling them and making money. Now, they are saying that's not that, and you're saying it is that, and so to make the arguments is complicated. You can't do it without a good lawyer. He has some money here to hire a lawyer, and you say, oh, but it will undercut the grand jury. You say, this has been the law in five circuits, and the government has not come to the end of its prosecutions, it hasn't injured prosecutions. So as a purely practical matter, First Amendment, no real harm to the government that I can see. And so let's impose some kind of statutory limitation on use of this, but where there is a good claim for it, let it be used.",
  "Has that happened in the circuits that have permitted this? jeopardize the safety of its witnesses ­­",
  "You know, I think, in the circuit, you've now given us some statistics. So in how many cases in the circuits that have permitted what they want or my version of it, the circuits that have permitted some form of allowing the magistrate to look behind the grand jury indictment in appropriate cases and find that if it's there, there is no probable cause, so you can use this to hire a lawyer. There are a bunch of circuits that have had rules like that. In how many cases in those circuits has the government faced the serious risks that you're talking about?",
  "Can you give me a guess? You are ­­ I mean, you make a huge point of how this will put the government at a disadvantage, so someone in your office, probably you, asked people in the Justice Department, do you have any examples? Or how many cases have there been where these serious problems arose? And you probably got some kind of answer, so you probably have some kind of idea.",
  "How many anecdotes?",
  "In a number of cases, several specific. Is that more like four? Or is it more like 24?",
  "Can I ask you a related question, since it came up? I was curious as to how much of this forfeiture money gets to victims. So the best we could do is looking up three years, and on the basis of the figures that I got out of the DOJ on that, about 25 ­­ 20 to 25 percent goes to a category called third­party interest. Now, the third­party interest includes mortgagees, it includes other creditors, it includes States, who want taxes, et cetera. And if you subtract all those, a rough guess would be 5 or 10 percent goes to victims. Now, do you have a better estimate?",
  "That is what the ­­ if you look at the actual amount in general, but the interests at issue here are, one, this money goes to pay for a lawyer, so the person can prove that there is not even a claim against him; and it risks, of course, sometimes of depriving the recipients of the forfeiture monies, and those would normally be, almost entirely, the DOJ for the expenses of going to the forfeiture expense of the trial. It would ­­ various criminal justice taxes, very little is being deprived of victims. Is that a fair comment?",
  "We could deal with that, couldn't we, by imposing conditions surrounding the use of the word \"may\" with conditions that would reject ­­ you would say they rejected it. The magistrate thought this was just a fishing expedition for evidence. That's not a ground. He has to believe it's not a fishing expedition for evidence and that there is good cause to think that the defendant will succeed.",
  "Under those circumstances ­­ under ­­ which is pretty limiting , under those circumstances, then he has discretionary authority to grant a hearing at which the defendant will be able to show ­­ you know, that there is not probable cause to believe a crime was committed by his client.",
  "Well, it's about a different subject. It's not we work through osmosis here. It's about the subject of quashing a warrant, or it's about the subject of injunction. Now, grant you, a grand jury thinks it's there, but it's also there, when you're talking about certain bail hearings.",
  "Should we say anything about that? I mean, one of the things he testified to ­­ that is, the government expert testified to ­­ the defendant was one of those unusual people who was actually exposed to a variety of different people in his life. He had people who were criminal types. There were drug users. He found himself identifying and looking up to people alternatively described as \"bad boys\" or “outlaws.” Looking up to them, being impressed and awed by them and in certain circumstances, wanting to outdo them. Well, that doesn't seem to have much to do with the issue that the defendant put into the ­­ wanted to put in, in the Federal court, which was he wanted to ask about his ­­ about his ­­ his words exactly are \"a defense of insanity,\" which can be interpreted broadly, namely, whether he is insane or not. So we both have the government expert saying no, he's not insane, and the government expert going on to give an explanation of why he shot the sheriff. So is that ­­ is that, in your opinion, something we should say that's a serious question, whether that exceeds it, et cetera? What should we say about it?",
  "All right. So your words would be, because they have introduced what we'd say as, the defense has introduced an argument, that even if it's proper for the introduction of the government's expert witnesses under the Fifth Amendment, it still cannot be beyond ­­ go beyond what is ­­ what's your exact word, \"reasonably\" ­­",
  "­­ reasonably related to the defense of insanity that the defendant himself raised, and then that would be an issue for the Kansas court to decide.",
  "Well, you'd bring up arguments why this is okay, and they would bring up arguments why it isn't reasonably related, and Kansas would decide.",
  "You're ­ you're ­­ the State admits that all that they could put on is information from the psychiatrist that is reasonably related to the defense that the defendant raised. Do you disagree with that?",
  "All right. Then we both agree ­­",
  "Fine. You both agree that the test is \"reasonably related.\" So we could simply say that. They both agree.",
  "And now, we send it back to the Kansas court and say, we are not going to go through the record here because you should do it.",
  "Then why are we here? Everybody agrees.",
  "The authority for that is what?",
  "Well, I mean ­­ you know, the obvious, it's not a question of policy. But one thing, the Fifth Amendment prevents you from being a witness against yourself, you didn't take the stand. So what you did was introduced three psychiatrists, and they said, this man was totally insane, he could form no will whatsoever, totally insane. The government says, we have seven psychiatrists who would like to examine this man, and they'll come to the opposite conclusion. The judge says, okay, examine him, under compulsion. And they say he is totally sane. And they each have reasons. Now, you're saying, in that case, the government cannot put any of those seven on the stand?",
  "Really?",
  "No, but they ­­ they base their testimony on an examination compelled by the ­­",
  "All right. So you ­­",
  "But that ­­ that puts the government in a ­­ in an impossible position. The defense is allowed witnesses who've examined the defendant and ­­ oh, you mean you're only limiting it to the case where the defense witnesses don't examine the defendant?",
  "You're ­­ I'm giving you a hypothetical.",
  "Psychiatrist A, hired by the defense, examines the witness. He says he is totally mad. All right? That's his conclusion based on the examination. Psychiatrist B, who works for the government, has examined the witness under compulsion. All right? And he's done it under the authority of 12.2 because the defendant, just as here, made a 12.2 motion and said that this was a ­­ all right, just like here. He examines him. He comes to the conclusion this man is as sane as ­­ whatever the most sane thing is. All right.",
  "That's his conclusion. You're saying the government can put on its witnesses, but the Fifth Amendment prohibits the ­­ sorry, the defense can put on its witness, but the ­­ the Fifth Amendment prohibits the defendant from putting on its own witness?",
  "That means it's something ­­ I can't imagine how the Fifth Amendment can say that. But go ahead.",
  "What is your argument?",
  "No, no. They put on my witness, my imaginary psychiatrist A.",
  "Well, that may be, but does the Federal Constitution ­­ it's my example. It's my example.",
  "Because ­­",
  "What do we do with this? The defense says, my defense will consist of the fact demonstrated by an expert that my heart is too weak to have made it up the stairs. All right. And I have Mister ­­ Dr. Smith, who has examined my heart, and he will testify it's impossible I could have been on the third floor, I would have been dead. So the government says, we would like to have you examined by our doctor, Dr. B, who we believe will ­­ and the judge orders it. All right. So now, Dr. B says, his heart is sound as an ox, and he goes to it. You're saying the government could not put that Dr. B on the stand?",
  "I think what he's saying is that, look, in Simmons, there is a Fourth Amendment problem, and the defendant wants to testify in a Fourth Amendment hearing. And if he does, the State will take that statement and use it at the trial. So because of the reasons ­­ I'd say the policies underlying the Fourth Amendment, the court says, that's wrong. He can go testify at the suppression hearing, and then they can't use his statement later. So by analogy, he says, it's a similar situation. He says, it's the policy behind the Fifth Amendment that says, if you're going to go see the government under compulsion ­­ the psychiatrist, you shouldn't be able to introduce that later. I mean, I think that's, in my looking at them ­­ because I'm trying to see if I got the argument basically right, which is what I wanted to find out, and now, what's the response to that particular argument?",
  "You'd have to say then there's difference between the Fifth Amendment and the Fourth Amendment, and that difference would be what?",
  "I have an underlying question, just for my understanding of this. Now, the unions are on your side and ­­ I think, and I wondered why. And I'll ­­ this is my thought, which suggests that ­­ that I may not understand this perfectly. It seemed like, to me, a brilliant statute, because if, in fact, the unions ­­ those they represent, the workers, don't want ­­ want to be paid for donning and doffing, all they have to do is not put something in the collective bargaining agreement. But ­­ and if they do put something in the collective bargaining agreement, they can exert their bargaining power to get something else, which they must want more. So you with your narrow definition do is you prevent the workers from doing that. And so I don't know why the ordinary worker would be on your side of it. Now, I say that because I want you to explain what I'm missing.",
  "Yes.",
  "I see, so that's where the problem lies.",
  "Is there a way around that that doesn't involve this case, the Secretary of Labor? Or I guess you can amend the statute, but that's tough. I mean ­­",
  "Yes, what I think he's saying is this, that my puzzle was, why was this a big deal for the unions? All they have to do is keep their mouths shut, and the employer is going to have to go to them and say, we want this in the agreement. But he says, but you haven't read those words \"custom or practice,\" and if you see the words \"custom or practice,\" you'll see that an awful lot of businesses or firms or manufacturing across the country actually has long had a custom or practice where they didn't pay for that ­­ you know, they didn't exclude it, or they didn't ­­ so in those circumstances, it's the union that's going to have to go to the employer and say, please put some other words in the agreement, so we get this out of the statute. And now, I have no idea ­­ I think that's what his point was. And, of course, this is an empirical question in part of that kind of point, which is logically sound, affects a certain number of workers in industries. And I would next be curious if either you or the SG or anyone has some estimate of what we are talking about quantitatively.",
  "Well, what is difficult? Why not just say clothes ­­ at least from your point of view, clothes are ­­ are those items that have, as a significant purpose, the covering of one's body.

  "Well, is there anything wrong with what I just said?",
  "What?",
  "Opening your locker is not clothes.",
  "Well, that's not ­­ but still, we're back to the statute, which says, \"clothes.\"",
  "And, therefore, what's wrong with the definition I just proposed?",

  "Yes, I know. Now, all that's true.",
  "But, nonetheless, the fact is in many claims ­­ in many instances, though perhaps not yours, this kind of claim, i.e., that person's patent does not cover my product ­­",

So their point is, call it what you wish, but where you have a claim which amounts to a claim that my product does not infringe his patent, the rule that should apply is the person who owns the patent should have to prove that the claims do cover the product. And there are a lot of good reasons, et cetera, that they put in their brief why that should be so. It's easiest for the patentee to know in what respect it violates the claim. Normally, a patent, being a monopoly, should not have too many advantages beyond the scope of the monopoly. And we don't like false patents because that ­­ you'd have different results in the same kind of patent with different people depending upon whether, in some other instance, your client brought a suit or whether this was ­­ I mean, you've read the arguments. So looking at those functional arguments, is there any answer that you have to their point, other than cases in different subject matters, where burdens of proof did shift?",
  "Well, how ­­ what do you do with the government's argument here, which I take it as being on page 17, they make an argument which, as I understood it ­­ which is a big qualification ­­ the ­­ the ­­ some of these things are awfully complicated. You might have a ­­ a claim or, really, it's a set of claims that cover 48 pages with all kinds of symbols and ­­ and 42 different sort of division possibilities. And ­­ and then the ­­ the so­called infringer, or the person who falls outside the coverage, is looking at his product, and it's one of the most complex things you've ever seen. And he has to think to himself, well, how ­­ how am I supposed ­­ how does the claim cover this? And ­­ and it's ­­ there are many, many, many possibilities. I take it that's what they mean when they say it makes sense to put the burden of demonstrating how the claim limitations map onto the accused product because infringement may be found only when the product falls within the scope ­­ scope of the asserted claim or claims in every respect. Your client, who's the patentee, knows how. Otherwise, he wouldn't be bringing this infringement suit or the inside­the­coverage suit or responding to someone who says it's outside the coverage. But ­­ but the person who is the alleged infringer might not know it, and therefore, it makes sense to put everything in the same place; notice of infringement, burden of production, burden of proof.

  "All right.",

  "Because the first question would be, well, you tell me how ­­ how this infringes.",
  "So you're saying, I don't really care about what is an action where there is an infringement action or there even could be one in the circumstances before us, that's not my case because they're going to pay me forever, if they lose this declaratory judgment, so there's no shift. And where there's no shift, you ought to follow the rules for where there's no shift, which is that the burden lies on the person bringing the suit.",
  "That's your argument?",
  "I ­­ I see.",
  "And your argument is that the horribles don't exist because the one on page 19 never has come up, and as far as the no ­­ no res judicata, I don't care because I'll come to the same result with a different means.",
  "And any other ­­ is there any other ­­ is there any other practical point that they brought up that you want respond to?",

  "And if they said either an infringement suit or a declaratory judgment action, then, again, you would have the burden of proof, even in the declaratory judgment action because then they would be totally parallel. I mean, then you'd have, if you brought the infringement suit, it's yours. And then, in the declaratory judgment action, it should be true, too, in your view.",
  "But I mean ­­",

  "Is the chemical used here one of the chemicals that's listed in the annex to the treaty?",
  "It is? It is? It is? That's the part that I can't yet get my mind to these dramatic questions of whether, here, the local police power or, in some other case, some other inherently State power make a treaty beyond the power of the Federal government to enter into. It's a very big question. But I'm not there yet. And the reason I'm not there is because there's some words in this treaty called \"other peaceful purpose,\" and we have to interpret those words, and the same words are in the statute. And my question to you is: What reason is there to think that those matters on List A fall within those words? What is List A? It's infinitely long. A few things on it are in Holmes' opinion in Peasley, a great case on attempted murder where he talks about paying a small boy to move a barrel of kerosene with a candle in it alit, so that it will burn down a barn after a few hours. The kerosene is a chemical. He talks about a case where a person went to a racetrack and gave a horse a poison potato. He talks about a case involving somebody else trying to light a match, which is a chemical, and setting fire to a haystack. We can all think, sadly, of athletes, Lance Armstrong, at least accused of unlawfully taking drugs. I mean, why do we think matters of List A fall within those words, outside the words \"other peaceful purpose,\" even though they're unlawful? And by the way, did anyone say to the drafters of the convention ­­ I found nothing in this brief on the point ­­ or did anyone tell Congress that poison potatoes, drug­enhancing ­­ performance­enhancing drugs, the example that Justice Alito used last time, you give vinegar to a goldfish ­­ I mean, these are all chemicals not in the annex, but they are chemicals. And they are absolutely nothing to do with chemical weapons. And why do we think that we have to get beyond that fact?",
  "No, no. There's an easy way out of that. All we do is say the chemicals involved are the chemicals in the annex. But you're not prepared to say that, I guarantee it.",
  "Okay. Now, we're outside the annex. And I guess once we get outside the annex, we either have to draw lines or we have to say, well, this encompasses the poison potato, the poisoned goldfish, the small boy with the candle, the ­­ for performance­enhancing drugs. I would say judges are here to draw lines, and between throwing all those things into it or drawing lines, it's better to draw a few lines.",
  "No, no. These are real cases, by the way. The poison potato was in fact ­­",
  "There's chocolate all over the place.",
  "No, I'm not ­­ I want your answer to the line ­­ my question was a question to get your answer. And the answer that I wanted you to address yourself to is the problem of, once you depart from the annexes in defining the chemicals, you throw into it a list a thousand miles long. And we can tell joke after joke, but it's not a joke that it's so easy to make up examples that seem to have nothing to do with the problem of chemical weapons, like the Syrian problem, nothing to do with that.",
  "So what is your answer? That's what I want to know.",
  "Why don't you tell us ­­ can you tell us what the line is that we're trying to draw?",
  "Well, look, also, if you're telling me ­­ I am attempting to draw the line, that's just what I was going to do. And if you're saying it's against the national security interest, which is the first time I've heard that, that it is the national interests ­­ against the national interests of the United States for me to attempt to draw such a line, then I guess the State Department better file a brief explaining why or you ought ­­ or why you ­­ why you want to push this case or ­­ I mean, I'm ­­ is that what you're telling me, that if I write the opinion that I think the law requires me to write, that I somehow am hurting the national security interests of the United States.",
  "You're the one ­­",
  "Oh, no. That isn't the problem.",
  "That is the question ­­",
  "Oh, but it is. That is the problem. There is an underlying ­­ I don't mean to cut you off, but at some point, you seem not to see a problem that I think I see. And the problem underlying it, if you get into the treaty area, is this: Given the power, as there is in Medellin's majority, to have some self­executing treaties, in principle, your position constitutionally would allow the President and the Senate, not the House, to do anything through a treaty that is not specifically within the prohibitions of the rights protections of the Constitution. That's Missouri v. Holland. And I doubt that, in that document, the Framers intended to allow the President and the Senate to do anything. Now, you ask us, now, to say whether the answer to that question is yes or no. We still have a democracy, in other words, of which the House is part. Now, if you carry it to an extreme, that's what you are ­­ that's where you are, and I am worried about that, and I think others are, too. So I had asked you, isn't there an easier way to deal with this case? And you tell me, no, no, because it will interfere with some problem of foreign affairs that was never mentioned in any brief ­­ or at least hit me for the first time when you said it. Now, there, you have an expression of my uncertainties at the moment, and any way you want to reply to that would be helpful.",
  "Does it matter if it's just purely Federal law? I mean, think of a civil case involving a State on one side and private parties on another in a State court, which has jurisdiction over Federal laws. The State claims that the defendant has violated, civilly, a Federal statute. There's an action also in Federal Court. In your view, does the Federal Court have to abstain?",
  "No, no. There's no action for an injunction. What they want is the judge to decide the case. The private party wants the Federal judge to decide his case. That's all. It's a matter of interpreting Federal law. Now, in your opinion, is Younger ­­ does Younger, not some other doctrine, does Younger require abstention?",
  "Yes. Okay. So on your view, we can never have a case proceed in Federal court even on a purely Federal issue if, in fact, there is involving this estate civil case on the same question?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, I can't think of a ­­ doesn't it often happen that there are such cases? I mean, I ­­ I would think that wouldn't be too difficult. I mean, either there never is one and you tend to be right, or there are a whole lot of them and you tend to be wrong. I've just never heard it put in that extreme way, and maybe you're right. I don't know. What's your ­­ do you have authority for it or any light to shed?",
  "Does Younger say \"before\"?",
  "Does Younger say \"before\"?",
  "You just said before.",
  "No. So ­­ so in your view, it doesn't matter which is brought first, I guess.",
  "If Younger only applies to ­­ to State proceedings that are brought first, then I guess we could have a ­­ a criminal defendant, who's not yet one, bring an action in Federal court to say that the law is unconstitutional or something or violates a Federal law. And then the State prosecutes him criminally, and the Federal court couldn't ­­ and the Federal court could enjoin the criminal proceeding.",
  "So we've said they can't ­­ you can enjoin a criminal decision ­­ a criminal proceeding in a State court, as long as the criminal proceeding wasn't brought first. Is that what this Court has said?",
  "No, no. There is a pending one by the time they get around to it. Then what? I mean, I ­­",
  "I'll ask you to clarify. You've come up with a couple of rules that strike me as counterintuitive, and so I'm trying to figure that one out. The before or after one doesn't seem to work too well in my mind because it would seem ­­ you know, you couldn't ­­ Federal court couldn't. Federal court could enjoin a criminal proceeding that came up later in your view, I guess.",
  "All right.",
  "Can you tell me, when you come back, where the money goes if you win?",
  "Why is that? I thought that in a ­­ maybe it's changed since I knew the law in this area. But I thought, because of Illinois Brick, the ultimate consumers couldn't recover, but rather ­­ you have to be a direct purchaser rather than an indirect purchaser of the price­fixed good.",
  "Yes. All right. So this is a State law case.",
  "I know your case is, but the one that settled previously?",
  "All right. So you have a double dip claim. I guess my question, procedurally, is that, here, the State of Mississippi is the named plaintiff.",
  "And moreover, the State of Mississippi is suing in order to obtain money, is what we just heard, for its treasury. And, third, the State of Mississippi is suing because of their belief that the defendants injured the economy of Mississippi, and they injured it by hurting the pocketbooks of many individuals in Mississippi, the names of whom they don't even know. All right? Now, they say, look at ­­ read the statute. Read the cases which say if you are a nominal plaintiff, that's good enough, as long as you are not suing as some kind of ­­ I forget the words ­­ quasi­sovereign, whatever it was, one way or the other. You know the cases better than I. But why isn't what they just said sufficient?",
  "I understand that, but why does that fall within this statute?",
  "What about ­­ see, I can understand a complaint where they have taken 100 individuals, or 102, and they list them as plaintiffs, and they don't call it a class action. And that would fall right within the meaning of mass action, if the numbers are right.",
  "But if we take your approach and depart from that mechanical, but simple ­­ simply administered interpretation, what is worrying me, and perhaps you can help me with that, is that there are perhaps all kinds of State actions where one of the motivating reasons is ­­ behind the lawsuit is some person hurt our citizens. And so, now, we will get into the instantly interesting, but very difficult question of, well, when you say hurt your citizens, do you mean hurt them by giving them rise to an independent cause of action for each of them, who we don't know who they are, and we don't know if the statute of limitations has run to some, and we don't know if others have other disabilities; but, nonetheless, we're not certain this suit is entirely for that, it may be mixed up with other things. Do you see the problem once I start down your road?",
  "I've departed from the clear and simple.",
  "You can hold him to that, and I guess he can say, no, I don't want to be held to that or ­­ but that seemed to be not for this Court. Once he says it, I guess ­­",
  "But can we not take him at his word? He said it wasn't.",
  "What he says is ­­ in the complaint, it says ­­ \"prays that the defendant be ordered to restitute any and all monies for the purchases of its citizens.\" All right. Now, you look at the statute he quoted, the Mississippi statute, and it says there is the authority to have restitution to restore to any person in interest any monies which may have been acquired by means of a practice prohibited. So he says that sounds as if what you're talking about is you want restitution, though, given to the State, the restitution is for individual purchases of individual citizens because there could be no other. And, therefore, you have a list of people in mind, or you must find one, where there were particular individual purchases, by individual citizens, and get that restitution into the treasury. All right. Now, that ­­ I think something like that was his argument, and I wanted to know what you were going to say. Are you going to give up these last five words, \"and the purchases of its citizens\"?",
  "Right.",
  "Yes, and the purchases of its citizens.",
  "I know they'll get the money ­­",
  "­­ but he's saying, to get the money, you have to say which money.",
  "And to get the money, which money means you better have a list of the individual people who bought something, or otherwise, there is no such money. And that's enough to make those, in respect to this paragraph, individual people whose claims the State of Mississippi is pursuing. Something like that is his argument. And I just wanted to know your response.",
  "Do you have any objection to ­­ to doing one thing that was suggested in the circuit court opinion, which is to publicize rather thoroughly in ­­ in the area that those who were not Christians, and perhaps not even religious, are also welcome to appear and to have either a prayer or the equivalent, if they're not religious? Do you have an objection to that?",
  "Well, then ­­ then there ­­ is there a disagreement on that point because certainly, that was one of the concerns. It wasn't on anyone's website. There are ­­ Greece is a small town very near Rochester, and there are, at least in Rochester, lots of people of different religions, including quite a few of no religion. So ­­ so could you work that out, do you think, if that were the only objecting point?",
  "No, no. I'm not saying it's a constitutional problem I got from the opinion of doing the opposite, of ­­ of not making an effort to make people who are not Christian feel, although they live in or near the town or are affected thereby, participants, over time.",
  "I'm not saying it's not. I want to know if you have any objection. I ­­",
  "Do you ­­ would you have ­­ if all that were left in the case were the question of your making a good­faith effort to try to include others, would you object to doing it?",
  "Yes. That's different from putting it on a website. That's different from making an organized effort to see that people get the word.",
  "I suppose he's asking me that question, and I can answer it later.",
  "Are you ­­ I would like you to take into account an aspect of this. I mean, in my own opinion, I don't know of anyone else's, I'm not talking for others. But one ­­ a major purpose of the religion clauses is to allow people in this country of different religion, including those of no religion, to live harmoniously together. Now, given that basic purpose, what do we do about the problem of prayer in these kinds of legislative sessions? One possibility is say, you just can't do it, it's secular. But that is not our tradition.",
  "All right. The second possibility is the one that you are advocating. And it has much to recommend it, try to keep non­denominational, try to make it as inoffensive to the others as possible. That's the upside. The downside is seeing supervised by a judge, dozens of groups, and today, there are 60 or 70 groups of different religions coming in and saying, no, that doesn't work for us, this doesn't work for us, and that's the nightmare that they are afraid of. I mean, even in this town or in the area, there are significant numbers, as well as Christians, of Jews, of Muslims, of Baha'is, of Hindus, and others. All right. So there's a third approach, and that is say, well, you can't have them if there's any aspect of coercion. But we just saw people walking into this room, \"God save the United States,\" and you want to win your case. I didn't see people sitting down. All right. Then the fourth approach, which is the other that has ­­ makes its appearance here, is to say let's try to be inclusive. Now, was enough ­­ in other words, so you didn't get the right prayer today, but you ­­ and even with the nonreligious, you know many believe in the better angels of our nature and the spiritual side of humankind; it's not impossible to appeal to them. So you say, you'll have your chance. And that's the thing I ­­ I would like you to explore. I mean, is there a way of doing that, or is that preferable to the other ways, or do we get into trouble?",
  "Well, Congress has a set of guidelines which you've read and are here in the papers and so forth. Are those satisfactory to you?",
  "If those are satisfactory to you, then I wonder, are they satisfactory to everyone? And ­­ and you will find all kinds of different beliefs and thoughts in this country, and there will be people who say, but I cannot give such a prayer if I am a priest in that particular ­­ or a minister or whatever in that particular religion. I must refer to the God ­­ to God as I know that God by name. And what do we do with them? That's what ­­ I mean, we can recommend it, but can we say that the Constitution of the United States requires it?",
  "Suppose you did this: You combined your two approaches. The town has to ­­ it cannot ­­ it must make a good­faith effort to appeal to other religions who are in that area. And then you have these words from the House, the chaplain should keep in mind that the House of Representatives ­­ or you would say whatever relevant group ­­ is comprised of members of many different faith traditions, period, end of matter. Is that sufficient, those two things?",
  "So what's the limitation? That is, if the argument against throwing the contractors in the way you want, I think is, well, then there is no limitation. So a company that let's say is a publicly traded company, lives in a ­ they have a building and they hire a gardener. And the gardener is a gardening company and it has three employees and it works one day a week cutting their lawn and it works four days a week cutting somebody else's lawn. And ­ Is the mail fraud ­­ and then they fire one of the three employees, or two. And he gets annoyed and­ and says it was because of fraud. Now, the fraud has nothing to do with the company that they're cutting the lawn for. It has to do with some other customers. All right. So what ­­ how ­­ I don't think the statute intends to get that. I mean­ Does it want to make every mom and pop shop in the country, when they have one employee, suddenly subject to the whistleblower protection for any fraud, even those frauds that have nothing to do with any publicly traded company? This is not really this case.",
  "But I'm trying to foresee is are you arguing for no limitation or ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "Could you limit it as also ruling out frauds by companies that are not publicly traded themselves of course, but where the fraud has nothing to do with the contract? That is, the whole activity just has nothing to do with the contract. It's just chance that they happen to have a contract.",
  "Can you rule out frauds where the fraud at issue ­­",
  "­­ has absolutely nothing to do with the contract?",
  "It isn't written that way.",
  "The road is when you see a statute that says \"any policeman,\" they don't mean a policeman on Mars, nor are they likely to mean a policeman in Europe. The \"any policeman\" is likely, although it says \"any policeman,\" to mean a policeman in the United States. And similarly where they talk about this, the contractors, they don't mean frauds related to ­­ you have to use some kind of scope for the word ­­ for the kinds of frauds that are included in the statute, and you have to read that into language that says nothing about it. And that's ­­ I don't say that that is necessarily easy to do and that's why I started with my first question.",
  "The argument about this, the reason that we're ­­ that I've brought this up is ­­ is because I think that the strongest argument in those courts of appeals that kind of held against you is that they fear that otherwise this statute would create any fraud by any gardener, any cook, anybody that had one employee in the entire United States and engaged in any alleged fraud would be covered. But it seems to me there are many ways to skin that cat. And ­­ and one way that I suggested and now Mr. Schnapper said, no, that's ­­ that kind of thing related to the contract isn't going to work very well because it's too complicated to try to figure out. So maybe we don't have to figure it out in this case. I mean that's possible. I ­­ I just wanted a universe of possibilities.",
  "Then why isn't the SEC ­­ sorry.",
  "When you're going to go through this, I'd appreciate your telling in your opinion ­­ what the statute says, taking the extraneous words out, is that no contractor of a publicly­traded company may discharge, demote, et cetera, any employee because of his lawful act in reporting a fraud. That's what it says. So, what did they have in mind if they didn't have in mind forbidding any contractor of a publicly­traded company from a contractor ­­ and, you know, maybe there are limitations there ­­ but a contractor from demoting an employee because of his lawful act reporting a fraud?",
  "Or any ­­ I just eliminated the extraneous words and instead of the not the word \"such,\" I put in what \"such\" refers.",
  "All right. So all they're interested in here, you say, is this workout contractor, but not for example where you have a fund which has virtually no employees and does all its work really through investment advisors such as here, and you think Congress didn't want to include the investment advisor firing its whistleblower even if it's directly related to the fraud, the hot fund and everything else, but it did just want to include the people who ­­ who are there because the contractor is a workout firm, and ­­ and not the investment advisor.",
  "Now, all that's a conceivable reading, I agree.",
  "But what is it that leads you to that conclusion other than ­­",
  "You're right on that. I mean, it is correct that that's what they talk about. And so that sends us on a search for limitation. You have one limitation. Your limitation says the person who is dismissed has to be an employee of the publicly­traded company. Now, the government, and ­­ and even your ­­ Mr. Schnapper has come up with accepting some limitations. There are possibly others. One would be on the nature of the contractor, which you want to do, but it would be somewhat broader than yours. Another, possibly, is on the nature of the fraud. Is it related to the contract? Another might be the one the district court proposed, and there could be others. So I think if you want to say anything about this, it seems to me that taking as given ­­ I will for argument's sake anyway ­­ say all the legislative history is about publicly­traded companies. And I do look at it. But nonetheless, they did use this language in their other possible limitations that would serve the same purpose. Then you say to that, saying yours is the best, what?",
  "Oh, that itself is a big limitation. Huge.",
  "They didn't say that today. And ­­ and if, in fact, the fraud is related to the contract or by certain kinds of contractors who do investment work, who do all kinds of important work for the company, why shouldn't it be covered? I mean, and the language, of course, does say what I read, as you agreed. It says a contractor.",
  "So it may be that you have a good point, that it's the SEC we should defer to and not the Labor Department. But then, as was pointed out, fine, then you're going to have that rulemaking and given their position here, it looks as if they will hold something you don't like. But ­­ so what are we supposed to do about that, in your opinion?",
  "Why is it ­­ we may have to get to this. I thought Section 3(a) of Sarbanes­Oxley ­­ that's what we found here. Quote, \"The Securities and Exchange Commission shall promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary and appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and in furtherance of this Act.\" So why doesn't that delegate right to the SEC the power to interpret the general provisions of the Section 802?",
  "Well, so I mean, I don't know that we should interpret that provision since no one has briefed, given ­­ on that basis.",
  "Where did it come from? That is, where did the words \"contractor\"? Some human being wrote them for the first time. You probably know who did and where and under what circumstances. What? What, you know?",
  "Some of us are interested in that. At least I am.",
  "I know. So who is the human being who wrote them and what did he have in mind, or she?",
  "Let's go back to the hearings. I mean, there might have been hearings.",
  "What cases should I look up for that?",
  "That is to say, I thought generally in the criminal law a person who commits an illegal act is liable for the known consequences of that act. That is the general rule. I can't think ­­ I mean, people use all kinds of terminology, different kinds of terminology, but I thought that's the basic principle.",
  "When you say \"purposeful intent,\" He didn't want it, but he knew it would happen.",
  "And moreover, he helped to produce the occasion on which it would happen.",
  "Well just tell me where in the brief they are, or whatever's easier.",
  "They used the word \"intent.\" Some people used it in order to encompass the situation ­­",
  "­­ of the known but undesired consequence.",
  "It's language. I am sure you will find language. I want really an instance where the holding of the case is that a person who commits an unlawful event ­­ action with knowledge that the other unlawful action will occur is not liable for it.",
  "You know, blowing up the carriage and you kill the maid, who you didn't want to kill. You are liable.",
  "Which one is it?",
  "LaFave.",
  "LaFave.",
  "That's the reason ­­ maybe I should put to you at the outset the problem with the case that's bothering me. Neighbors hear a noise. Police come to the door. Man and wife are there. She, as in this case, has a bump on her nose, holding a baby and is crying and blood on her shirt. The police, for whatever set of reasons, arrest the husband. The woman says, Mr. Policeman, I would like you to come in the house. I'd like you to look at a couple of the closets. I'm worried about what's in them. I can't quite tell you what it is. I don't know. But I'd like you to look through the house. Now, is that woman never to be able to get a policeman in the house? Never? I mean, months go by. She owns the house, too. And by the way, I've tried to keep out of my hypothetical any other basis for getting in. It's not a ­­ she's not a danger. The husband's gone. She is ­­ no destruction of evidence. She won't destroy it. You see ­­ and so that ­­ she owns the house. Can she never invite the policeman in?",
  "On what basis?",
  "On what basis?",
  "No, she says, I don't know what's in the closet, Mr. Policeman. I don't know that it has anything to do with my bloody nose. I just would like you to take a look around. Now, see, I tried to keep out probable cause.",
  "I've tried to eliminate any other basis. And that's what is worrying me on the ­­ worry stemming from, but it's her house, too. Can't she invite people into her house, too, whom she wants, including the policeman? Now, that's the example that got me to write separately in the other case. That's the example that keeps gnawing on my mind, and I ­­ and I'd like you to address it.",
  "How could she invite them in? The husband has said, never, I don't want a policeman to set foot in my house, and it's not just the closet. She wants the police to take a good look around.",
  "That doesn’t answer this question, you see, because once you say right, you assume the answer. I mean, if the wife has ­­ to the extent she has the ability to ask anyone into the house, even over the husband's objection, then the conclusion is he doesn't have a privacy right or a reasonable expectation of privacy vis­à­vis what his wife wants. And if you decide it the other way, he does. And the hard problem, I mean the hard problem for me, is ­­ but I'll ask the other side that ­­ under what circumstances, when, how do we work out? And the answer in Randolph was social expectation. And, frankly, I don't know what the social expectation is.",
  "That's ­­ that's the initial problem I started with in this case. The policeman is standing at the door. She owns the house. She says, come in. Come in. Maybe it's I'd just like to talk to you. Maybe it's I'd like to show you a few things. The four­year­old says the spouse hit her. That's why she's bleeding. She later says, oh, no, it wasn't the spouse. It was a woman named Veronica. Maybe that's all true here. But you could surely imagine cases where you had a little window of opportunity to find out what was going on in that house, which is hers. And now you say no, as long as the husband who may have beaten her up six times is now being held in jail lest he do it again, policemen can't go in, even when she's willing to talk to them, even when she's willing to show them a few things, we know not what. Now, perhaps, I should just sweep that ­­ that problem aside and pay ­­ say it isn't controlling. But that's what's worrying me.",
  "Smith goes up to the house and Mrs. and Mr. Jones ­­ Mrs. Jones: Please come in. Mr. Jones: Stay out. Well, I mean, Randolph says most people wouldn't go in, in those circumstances. So now Mrs. Jones says: Tell Smith ­­ my husband, rather: Smith, you tell my husband that there's a telephone call for him at the local pharmacy, and so he does so now he's not there. And so now they can go in. I mean, that seems like more fantastic than people entering the house in the first case. And so there does seem to me to be a real Problem here, if you write Randolph and agree to it, as I did, that you're going to say, okay, the police can just get him out of the way for a little while, legitimately, get him out of the way, maybe there really was a phone call, and now they go in the house. I mean, I don't see how I could write that without saying I was wrong in Randolph, which I still think I was right. So therefore I ­­one thing here. What about saying that that \"stay out of my house\" is at least valid for a reasonable time thereafter? And an hour and a half is not a reasonable time thereafter, at least when ­­ when the police got him out of the way.",
  "That's all true, but can you answer my straight­faced question, which is how can I do this with a straight face, both come out one way in Randolph and say when the police get him out of the way knowing about what he doesn't want, that's all different. Can you explain how I can do that with a straight face?",
  "I don't think there's ­­ reading your brief and the other, I don't think this is a case where she wanted to talk to the police. Is it? The policeman says he wants to get in there because he's afraid a hostage ­­ a child is being held hostage. And why wouldn't that give him grounds for ­­ was it an exigency? I mean, why wouldn't he get in on other grounds there? The exigent circumstances, the child might be held hostage. Isn't that a good ground for going in immediately without a warrant?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. They say they could do that. So the problem is when they came back.",
  "Okay. When they came back, and she says apparently ­­ or what they give the impression, as I read it quickly, that it isn't a case where when they came back, she wanted particularly to give evidence to the police.",
  "So we have everything here ­­ the things ­­ the everything ­­ the search at issue was a search solely for evidence?",
  "The objecting party was present and made his objection known clearly and directly to the officers seeking to enter the house?",
  "A little earlier, but he did. The officers did not justify their search on grounds of possible evidence destruction. And as far as the record reveals, the officers might easily have secured the premises and sought a warrant permitting them to enter. All these factors are there, and the other offsetting factors, that the officer ­­ the invitation could reflect the victim's fear about being left alone with an abuser. No, because the abuser is not there. It could also indicate the availability of the evidence in the form of a willingness to speak that might not otherwise exist. As far as we know, that isn't present. Therefore, it fits totally within Randolph, but for one thing: The police themselves took him away. Now, I mean, it's not ­­ it's not really a subterfuge, but it might look like that you've just eroded Randolph for no reason you get around your point by saying at least that known consent ­­ I mean known objection ­­ has enough force to last for a reasonable time, which isn't the best way of writing perhaps a Fourth Amendment opinion. But it does have the ­­ leaves it up to the lower courts to figure out what is, and it maintains some life in Randolph. Okay. That's a fairly long question, but you see where I'm going. And your ­­ your answer is what?",
  "Well, the problem, for as long as he can't enforce it ­­ he's the worst criminal in the world; right from the house to 20 years in Sing­Sing. So she can't right ­­ let anyone in the house, the police department, for 20 years. That can't be right.",
  "Fine. But what is the ­­ suppose that the employer had written a check for $100,000 to the union and everything else is the same. Now, you ask, why did he do that? He said because they have to have the money so that they can run the organizing campaign along the lines that everyone wants. Is that covered or not?",
  "So then when I write the opinion that says that is covered, but the access, the employer lists, and the ­­",
  "­­ yes, and the neutrality, those are not covered because. $100,000 is, but they aren't because; and then what comes after the \"because\"?",
  "No, no. We specify how they're going to use it. They're going to use it just the way ­­",
  "Okay. Okay. No. Continue with the because. One, because money might be a go­beyond. Okay. What's the other?",
  "It's not covering. As I understand the argument it goes back to like Jurisprudence 1. Can you have ­­ the sign says no vehicles in the park. Okay? Does that apply to a Jeep used as a war memorial? Answer, no. That's been the law since the twelfth century. You spilled blood in the streets of Bologna, a crime, but that's not applicable to the barber. All right? So, here, I think what they're saying is that read this statute. You don't have to get into a metaphysical argument about things of value; rather, those things which play a central role in the organizing campaign are things that are governed by the other parts of the NLRB and to throw them in here ­­ NLRA ­­ and to throw them in here is going to create a mess. Lists, access, promises to stay neutral are central to many aspects of organizing campaigns, and they are no more within this statute, this part of the thing than the Jeep on the pedestal is part of the no vehicles in the park. Now, that's what I understand roughly their argument to be, if I've got it right. And what is your response?",
  "I didn't say they had a right. They didn't say they had a right.",
  "What they said was the kinds of property or things of value are at issue here are the kinds of things that play important roles in organizing campaigns. And we needn't go further than that. We don't have to talk about rights to it. We don't have to talk about who said what to whom. It's just that these kinds of things are organizing things, and therefore they're outside the scope ­­",
  "­­ just like the Jeep on the pedestal.",
  "The question is the same, I think. And to go back, I thought the most clear statement of your view was when you said to Justice Scalia that if we don't accept your interpretation, there's a hole in the statute.",
  "In fact, I think you said a big hole.",
  "All right. Now ­­",
  "I get the point.",
  "I'm focusing on the hole.",
  "Now, I thought the area that you're calling a hole is an area where the National Labor Relations Act gives the National Labor Relations Board all kinds of authority to set rules and to say what is an appropriate practice and not. Am I right about that?",
  "All right. If the answer is yes, and I'm sure there's some qualification, but if the heart of the answer is yes, then it's the contrary that creates the hole, because if we throw those things which are central to the NLRA's regulatory power into this particular provision, the NLRA loses the power to say when they're okay, when they're not okay, to make a thousand qualifications. Hence, the NLRA's regulatory provisions and this case are the Jeep on the pedestal or the barber in the street. Even though I have to tell you, in Bologna in the 18th century, despite the exception of the eighth century, it did not mention barbers specifically in the statute. They had to be read in by the courts.",
  "Yes.",
  "I don't ­­ I can't find ­­ it seems to me this has sprung, full blown, from someone's brain, but is not well embedded in any law that I could yet find. That is the ­­ this is not meant to be rude. I'm trying to figure out where this idea of the consent thing comes from. After all, it apparently comes from our Korean treaty and maybe one other, but I can't find it in ­­ I can't find ­­ the question in the case is, is this particular agreement, namely an agreement to go to the court first ­­ shall we count it as that kind of matter as to whether this is arbitrable that goes to a judge? Or rather is it that kind of procedural Howsam/Wiley type thing that goes to an arbitrator? Now, we did our best, I think, to try to explain how to distinguish the one from the other in our precedent. Now, you use different words. You use these words about \"consent,\" which doesn't appear anywhere in this treaty, but I think you are trying to get at the same thing. And if you are not trying to get at the same thing, why? Why not? What are you trying to get at?",
  "So if in fact there was the sate that said, Look, they don't say anything in the treaty, but it turns out, for purposes of counting time limits, filing a brief, they count Saturdays, but they don't count Sundays. All right? And the government says, quite sincerely, if we had known that they were going to do that, we never would have agreed. I am trying to get an example of something that is as purely procedural as I can imagine, something no one in his right mind would think a judge, rather than an arbitrator, should decide. But, under your rule, you're going to say the judges decide that and not the arbitrators, and that is what is bothering me about your rule.",
  "By the way, in the treaty itself, you can have dozens of things, as was true of Howsam, we will follow the UNCTAD, whatever that is, the UN ­­ or AAA rules, and you look up AAA Rule No. 1872(b), and it says just what I said. Okay? So, now, it's in the treaty itself, and why should that matter?",
  "I have only found two, by the way. One was Korea, and I can't remember the second.",
  "But in any case ­­",
  "­­ you explicitly say, these are our conditions of consent, and you raise the question to me, you don't answer it, because suppose one of those conditions had to do with blue paper, rather than white paper, suppose that they were just what I said, nobody still would think the United States was resisting arbitration on such a matter.",
  "So, here, you are putting yourselves, I gather, that the UN rules, the AAA rules, the scholars who file our briefs, the Doctrine of Competence­Competence, whatever that might be, is, in fact, far broader than what they want. It submits virtually every question of arbitrability to the arbitrator. And the United States is taking a position quite contrary, I guess, to most of the world.",
  "What's wrong with the House ­­ and I'm being a little defensive here ­­ but I didn't think there was the presumption you are talking about. I thought it said there's a presumption about that procedural rule, and I thought important language was the language that the Court has found the phrase, i.e., for the judge, applicable in the narrow circumstance where contracting parties would likely have expected a Court to have decided the gateway matter. Now, that, it seems to me, a little bit easier to work with than this notion of whether a state gave consent or didn't give consent or it doesn't mention it in the treaty.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Everybody's getting to the same question, I think, but I haven't quite heard the answer. Of course, you're right in many countries. The question of arbitrability, that is to say, is there a contract is for the Court. In an investment treaty, I can find a lot of authority that says whether this counts as an investment is a matter for the Court. But the question in front of us, is this that kind of decision? Is it one for the Court? Or is it one for the arbitrator? And to just summarize why it might be for the arbitrator, A, it's procedural, but that's not sufficient. B, it refers to UNC ­­ whatever it is ­­ UNCITRAL?",
  "Yes. It refers to their rules. Their rules provide all matters of competence over the arbitrator. The scholars have done exhaustive work saying most countries think that. The Doctrine of Competence­Competence goes further, and you also have the AAA rules which say the same thing. So those are all against you. For you is the position of the ­­ the item in the document, first and foremost. All right. I'm trying to summarize what I've got as the arguments for and against. Now, what do you say to make me think there's even more for ­­",
  "So I agree that's not ­­",
  "But those are not relevant ­­ I mean, those are relevant. I'm saying they would farther. And I think, in what I've seen so far, it gives, on certain kinds of procedural gateway questions, deference to the arbitrator, which is what is at issue here. And now ­­ now, I'm back to the same question. What is your evidence from this contract that this is not the kind of gateway question that is for the arbitrator?",
  "The question is this: Three situations ­­ I think it's the same question Justice Kennedy was driving at. One, France opens up a casino.",
  "Two, California opens up a casino.",
  "Three, an Indian tribe opens up a casino, okay?",
  "Now, what is it that says that the State where the casino is located can sue France? What is it that says it can sue California? All ­­ they all object. What is it that says it can sue the Indian tribe?",
  "Now, was that a statute or common law?",
  "Okay. California?",
  "Okay. All those are common law. Both ­­",
  "Then what do you do about Kiowa?",
  "You know, but the question specifically then ­­ I think we're driving at the same thing ­­ is, remember, you just cited to me two cases ­­",
  "­­ one involving France and one involving California.",
  "And I had assumed ­­ but maybe I was wrong to assume ­­ that when I read those cases, I will see, although a State can sue France, although Nevada can sue California, a private individual could not. Am I going to find that when I read those two cases?",
  "Now, I think the answer to Justice Kagan is I'm not going to find it. So we're looking for authority, back to Justice Kennedy, that will support your proposition that the State could sue France, Nevada could sue California, but a private individual could not.",
  "Now, what you're asking us to do then, if the answer is what I now think you're saying, is to say it's awfully complicated that, although a State could sue an Indian tribe for something that is outside the reservation, the State ­­ it's so complicated that I'd like some good authority for it, because a private person couldn't, but a State could sue, and it's only in certain places.",
  "How about drawing the line with Kiowa?",
  "Yes, but he was wrong on that, apparently, if that's what he says. He was wrong, that, if we look at the cases, what we will see is it was the courts that said there's a common law abrogation of France's sovereign immunity, when they go into business in downtown Iowa somewhere.",
  "The same thing ­­ same thing with the State, he says in Nevada and California, and then he says it would be totally anomalous to think that an Indian tribe could go into downtown Des Moines and open up a clearly illegal business, and you could sue France ­­ the State, which was not Kiowa ­­ they could sue ­­ France could ­­ the State could sue France, it could sue California, but it couldn't sue the Indian tribe.",
  "All right. What about the California and Nevada?",
  "Now, Kiowa is about ­­ is it Kiowa? ­­ is about individuals who are not the State.",
  "All right. I'll look at those with care. But, now, assuming you are right on that, is the question in front of us, on the assumption that these are Indian lands, does the Indian tribe have sovereign immunity? Is that the question you want answered?",
  "Yes or no?",
  "Do you want us to say on that assumption ­­ now, on that assumption, I look at i and number ii under a, 7(a), and a quick reading of them suggests to me that they're in parallel, that the Indian tribe can sue the State when the State won't open negotiations, and the State or an Indian tribe can sue the Indian tribe when the Indian tribe refuses to follow the compact. Now, what's your answer to that?",
  "Well, I know, but you said to decide this on the assumption that it's on Indian lands. If I make that assumption and then I look over and read i and ii, it sounds as if, as I said, i, the tribe can sue the State to get the compact; ii, the State can sue the tribe when it violates the compact.",
  "That's why I want to ­­ I'm trying to get what question I'm supposed to answer. If I'm supposed to answer the sovereign immunity question on the assumption that these are Indian lands, contrary to what was decided below, I might get one answer. But if I'm ­­ supposed to do it on the assumption that they're not Indian lands, I might get a different answer. What assumption am I supposed to make?",
  "So you are prepared to live with the following: Is it the case that if California opens a business in a commercial activity in 20 other States, at least one of which it is totally illegal, this other State, say, Utah, cannot ­­ can sue California or not? What's the answer?",
  "So what the opposition says, in your view, is absolutely correct, that a foreign nation opens up an illegal business in a State. The State can sue them, now, because of a treaty, but previously, because of the common law. If California opens up an illegal business, the State can put them out of business by bringing a suit. But an Indian tribe, they can't? That's the United States' view?",
  "But I'm saying that is your view, though? I just want the bottom line.",
  "Why? Because you are representing the United States. You have ­­ you understand Indian policy. This case has tremendous implications, if we follow your approach. It seems to me well beyond anything to do with gaming. My belief is Indian tribes all over the country operate businesses off the reservation, and businesses all over the country are regulated. And does the State, I guess, in your view, does not have the power to enforce the regulation against the Indian tribe.",
  "Why is that ­­ not against the tribe itself. Why is that in the Indian tribe's interest? And is it a trap for the unwary lawyer? And how is this supposed to work out, in your view?",
  "He's adding one thing, which is, as you've just heard, that the Indian tribes are in the same Eleventh Amendment type position as the Principality of Monaco before the treaty.",
  "They didn't participate in the convention and the Principality of Monaco was held to be immune, presumably, even from commercial activity. Let Congress change it. That's what Kiowa says. And that, I think, is their basic argument. And if it's a wash ­­ I mean, I hate to put it this way because it sounds like a joke, but it isn't meant to be ­­ in this case, if it's a wash, follow the precedent.",
  "That's right. All right. But, now, the question I have, which is, I think, for anyone who wants to answer it, particularly the government, I absolutely agree with you that ­­ that a free market in price is at the heart of the Deregulation Act. Given. I also think frequent flyer programs are simply price discounts. Given. I also think that, if you don't have contracts, you can't have free markets. Given. But I also think that the State cannot, under the guise of contract law, regulate the prices of airlines. If you allow that, you're going to have worse than we ever had. It'll be 50 different systems, all right? So, if I think those four things, what standard do I use to separate when a State is and when it is not using its contract law to regulate prices?",
  "Well, good. Then you'll give me the answer because what I'm missing is what the standard is.",
  "Well, you would ­­ you would agree ­­ it's the same question I asked the government. I would like your answer. I imagine that you would agree that a State says the following: We read into ­­ like common law courts used to do all the time, for a transportation company, we believe the price must be fair and reasonable, and a contract in our State, for transportation prices, has to set a fair and reasonable price, and I personally think many fares are not reasonable. They are too high. All right. And, therefore, we have substituted the judges and the States for setting prices instead of the parties. All right. You agree that would be preempted?",
  "All right. Now, so what is your standard for distinguishing what is and is not preempted where the State uses its contract law to imply a fair and reasonable term?",
  "That isn't what your ­­ your complaint that I think ­­ paragraph 56, which I think is the key paragraph says, that the ­­ under the ­­ the law is ­­ the contract law that you want to enforce is, even where a party to a contract is given absolute discretion, it must exercise that discretion in good faith in a manner consistent with the reasonable expectations of the other party or parties. Now, that's, I think, what they're objecting to because, there, it sounds to me like I go in to ­­ you know, get a ticket, my reasonable expectation is they're not going to charge me what they're going to charge ­­ you know, I mean, it's unbelievable. But there ­­ but, you see, that's my reasonable expectation, and I'm the other party. And so that clause sounds as if you could, under State contract law, govern the price according to my reasonable expectation, namely, the consumer, that might be a great idea, but I don't think that's the idea behind this act. That's what ­­ what ­­ that's what I just read you. So what do you say about that?",
  "I didn't see anything in the complaint about anything other than airlines.",
  "Is there anything in your complaint that talks about anything other than airlines?",
  "No, I know. But, I mean, what we are taking about is what Count 2 of the complaint says. I think that's their objection. But, as far as Count 2 of the complaint says, it's about airline miles, I take it, and airline miles are used on airlines and ­­ et cetera.",
  "Well, if there is something else in this complaint, tell me, and I will have to figure out whether we go beyond the complaint.",
  "Does it say that in the complaint?",
  "And an airline partner, I take it, is another airline?",
  "So if I want to find out about that in the record, where do I look?",
  "All there is, is the complaint, and it doesn't talk about it in the complaint. What I'm thinking about, obviously, is we might reserve that question for another day.",
  "Suppose you have the ­­ shouldn't a supplier have standing to sue the competitor of the firm to which he supplies, where the alleged liable or slander or whatever it is, is directly about what the supplier supplies? The example, make it clearer. Suppose that Bailey's sells ice cream sundaes, and the defendant has said the chocolate sauce in Bailey's ice cream sundaes is poisonous. Now, the chocolate sauce does not compete with the defendant because he's an ice cream parlor, but, nonetheless, he is directly affected by the statement that he is suing about. He is, therefore, different from the other suppliers who might have supplied Bailey's with cushions, heat, electricity. But shouldn't at least that supplier of chocolate sauce have the standing to bring a claim against the ice cream parlor that competes with Bailey?",
  "Why not ­­ why not in this Lanham Act suit, why shouldn't the chocolate sauce supplier have standing? He is directly victimized by ­­ he has not just lost sales, but the comment is about him.",
  "Well, the answer to your question, if you're asking, is no, because the person who supplies labels is totally ­­ the statement that is sued about has nothing to do with labels. So the people who have nothing to do with the statement wouldn't have standing. But my ­­ do you remember my question?",
  "All right. Well, why shouldn't that person who is talked about in the statement have standing? A clear distinction. Not every supplier could sue.",
  "How do we tie that in? I'm sort of sorry I used that hypothetical because it ­­",
  "But it nonetheless illustrates ­­",
  "But it illustrates the point. I mean, in my own mind, the standing question is designed to answer, are you the kind of plaintiff that Congress intended, in this statute, to protect against the kind of injury that you say you suffered? Now, that goes back to Justice Brandeis, and it goes back to saying, did you suffer a common law injury, or do you fall within the scope as defined? Normally, Congress doesn't think about that, and so courts decide, and we're right in the middle of that decision. So if I think that, basically, you have a point, that at least the supplier who is mentioned in the defamatory statement by the competitor who bought the supplies, at least where he is mentioned explicitly, there should be standing, which means your side would win, I guess. What do I write to tie that in to the three separate kinds of tests that the circuits have talked about? That's what I can't quite see because they talk about the reasonable interest test, they talk about the zone of interest test, they talk about some other kind of test. How do I tie this into that?",
  "If that's so ­­ if you go back and you just lift the APA test ­­ because I think Justice Ginsburg is absolutely right, that this is not an APA suit ­­ the word \"arguably\" was inserted in the normal standing test by ADAPSO, which Justice Douglas wrote. Now, if we take that and simply lift it, the first thing, the person who would get a new lawsuit, I guess, is a consumer, because the consumer could easily say, I didn't buy this product because of the false statement that the competitor of the person I would have bought from made. And, indeed, you could have very big consumers, and they could allege all kinds of injuries. And so, if I simply lift the test, I’d rather worry that I am changing the law quite radically.",
  "But \"arguably.\" Isn't it arguably, in part, to protect consumers?",
  "But, now, does that ­­ just thinking of Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, that suggests that maybe the reasonable interest test is okay because what that's trying to do is ­­ you have McDonald's that's allegedly made the false statement, and then there are a range of people in terms more or less distant in respect to being direct competitors. There is ­­ what you said, Burger King, direct competitor, then there are the health restaurants. Then there are ­­ so you need something to cut off at some point the plaintiff, who claims to be a direct competitor, but, really, he's not going to lose much money, and he's quite distant, a health restaurant in a foreign city, I mean ­­ you know, you see? And the reasonable interest test, I think, is trying both to get at that and also to figure out what kind of supplier you are. Are you one who falls within the scope of the false statement or the ­­ or are you not? You don't want the electricity company to be able to sue. So what do you think about using the reasonable interest test, but explaining it in something like the terms I've just said?",
  "What about ­­",
  "If it's who's affected, who specifically are we leaving out? Look, you put in ­­ I don't want to leave out ­­ you've read all the cases. I haven't read them all. But I see that you put in ­­ we put in the direct competitors. They fall within it. We put in certain suppliers, those who are disparaged. We don't want the electricity company to be able to sue, according to you and the cases, and I guess we have the mirror case, which we'd put in, would be certain buyers like retailers or wholesalers and probably applying the same rule about their being mentioned in the ­­ in the false advertising ­­ or in the statement. Who have we left out? Who has been given standing in some of these cases that is left out of the description I just gave?",
  "All right. Who do you ­­ who do you ­­ well, who ­­ who has not been left out who should have been left out? I mean, I'm trying to see ­­ I'm trying to see am I forgetting someone that ­­ that your reading of the cases suggests has been given standing.",
  "To go back to ­­",
  "The difficulty that I'm having is the Ninth Circuit said the reason that your client won is because the ­­ the piece of grass between the road and ­­ and the sign was not ­­ it was subject to an easement and the government lacked the exclusive right of possession. All right. When I saw that, I thought, well, there ­­ there are thousands of different kinds of easement, as Justice Kennedy just said. They're there for utilities. They're for ­­ they're there for people might want to ­­ I mean, I can imagine a million, as you can, too. So not all of those would involve First Amendment anything, and ­­ and, yet, the ­­ the Ninth Circuit would seem to say that your client could go and demonstrate, as long as the utility company had an easement. So how are we supposed to interpret the statute to avoid the First Amendment problem without getting into an interpretation that, to me, would seem ridiculous.",
  "Now, why does the First Amendment allow a person to go to the heart of the military base, put on any demonstration they want, the statute doesn't apply for the reason that, once every four months, the PG&E has an easement to go out and read the meter.",
  "Now, that's exactly ­­ I know you wouldn't ­­",
  "­­ and that's why I want to know what your position is as to the interpretation of the statute that avoids my absurd PG&E result, but, nonetheless, does what you want, which is to protect the First Amendment interests.",
  "Oh, that's what I don't understand. Let me press ­­ at the risk of repetition, the reason I'm asking this question is the record is not developed. I looked at the Google maps. It looked to me like this area is sort of a suburban house with a lawn in front of it, and you drive along the street, and you suspect that the street may belong to the city a little way up the lawn; but beyond that, it probably belongs to the homeowner. And when you try to see where does the green line cross that grassy area, you can't easily tell, and ­­ and it may be just a foot or two. So it may have been inconceivable that your client didn't cross the green line or maybe he didn't. I don't know. So, therefore, you're back to a more basic test, and you say, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that, if they do not have exclusive control, the military can't enforce this statute. But what do we do, which was my question, about instances where the military does not have exclusive control, but the reason it doesn't has nothing to do with roads, nothing to do with green lines, it has to do with thousands of other easements that have nothing to do with this case; therefore, I'm pressing you to get a definition of this statute that will serve your ends without getting into all these other kinds of easements.",
  "And what is that, in your understanding?",
  "It's more than that. It says I mean ­­ you know, if you wanted to take someone to school. It said ­­ first, if you need medical treatment, you can just go in, and then it said you ­­ you have to receive prior written approval from me, the commander, or my designee, but if you get it ­­ so I suppose if he had a child at the school, he would ask and they'd give it to him. I mean, it didn't seem to me an absolute bar. It seemed to me a bar for purposes of going to that particular ­­",
  "Do we have to get into any of that? Do we ­­ just like I don't know where he really was physically. I don't know whether that grass strip is within something, without something. These all sound like First Amendment relevant matters.",
  "Where did it say \"material\"? I thought ­­ I thought ­­ I think, so far as I've read this, the argument is about the truth or falsity of the statement. And you're saying that the Colorado supreme court should have said it has to be false. Isn't that your argument?",
  "Okay. Now, I've looked at ­­ I've looked at footnote 17 ­­ or footnote 6 or whatever it is on page 17, and I think that their characterization of the Colorado supreme court is right; that is, the Colorado supreme court is going to be very surprised if we tell them that they never said it has to be false. What they said here is, \"In the determination of immunity, we need not and, therefore, do not decide whether the statements were true or false.\" Correct. Why not? Because, they say, \"The trial court properly submitted the case to the jury. Accordingly, the jury was entitled to determine the elements of a defamation claim, including whether the statements were false.\" So, as I read that, which I think you'll hear from the other side in about ­­ a few minutes, the ­­ the Colorado supreme court says, look, the jury found that the statement was false, so we don't have to worry about that, we're worried about whether the false statement was made with reckless disregard of its truth or falsity or knowledge that it was false. Okay? That's how I read the footnote. And they say something like that on ­­ on page 30 and 31 of their brief. So ­­ so if I'm right about that, what are we supposed to do? Are we supposed to say that matters of truth or falsity are not for the jury? Are we supposed to say that the jury went beyond what any reasonable person would go ­­ would do here? What is it we're supposed to do?",
  "I do. I'd like an answer ­­ well, you can do it in your rebuttal, but I'd like an answer to my question.",
  "I accept that for the moment ­­ accept all that. What's bothering me, a picky little point, but the picky point is that your statement of the question, whether ATSA immunity may be denied without a determination that the air carrier's disclosure was materially false? No, can't be. But I read the footnote, footnote 6, last sentence, it says there was such a determination, the jury made it, and we don't have to go back over it. So what are you arguing? Are you arguing that there should be like, as there is in free speech cases ­­ you know, a special duty upon an appellate court to go back over such a jury finding? Are you saying the Colorado supreme court was wrong in the second part of footnote 6 when it says the jury made it? What am I supposed to do, in your opinion.",
  "They may have waived it ­­ you know.",
  "But we have granted cert on this question. So ­­ so given that fact, could we do this: One, yes, it has to be false; two, the Colorado supreme court, because of footnotes 5, as well as 6, which I haven't picked up, and other things they've said, is at least ambiguous about the role the jury's finding played. And given that fact, what we'll do is we'll go through and see where the parties agree about what happened in ­­ in the world, and insofar as they agree, we'll take it, you see. Your side will get the underlying assumption, and looking at it, as it's agreed upon, we find either that it would be or wouldn't be within the scope of the immunity. And on that one, you might lose. But is there ­­ is there ­­ what do you think of that procedure?",
  "No, it doesn't say that. It says ­­ footnote 6 has to be read with footnote 5, which I hadn't picked up. And once I put those two footnotes together, I have no idea what the Colorado supreme court says.",
  "All of us have had the experience ­­ at least I have, of ­­ if I get very angry at something, one of my children will say, God, he's mentally unstable. See, I mean, that's ­­ people use that word in different contexts. And what's worrying me is ­­ is that some real threat comes along and the lawyers get involved and the people are going to report it to the TSA, start watching their words and they don't know what the lawyers mean exactly ­­ and you understand the problem.",
  "So why isn't the best thing to say is, look, there is leeway here ­­ considerable leeway on the part of the airline or anyone else who's reporting ­­ that are reporting things to TSA. All it means is they are going to search him more thoroughly.",
  "Well, that's the problem. I mean, put Justice Kagan and Justice Sotomayor together. I don't see any problem that I can see in deciding whether a case is contractual or statutory because the judge has to decide. If there's a contractual part of it, if he's going to deny it, he has to decide the contractual part. So if it's both, it's both. It counts as contractual. The Eleventh Circuit rule applies. On the other hand, if we don't ­­ if we don't follow the Eleventh Circuit, we get into the question of, well, what about auditor's fees, what about witness fees, what about prelitigation attorneys' fees, what about some language in the contract that seems to cover attorneys' fees, but we're not certain, et cetera? And before you know it, that could even shade into the merits. And so the simple thing to do is just say what the Eleventh Circuit said. So we have one argument, that yours isn't really an administrative objection, and you have the other argument that, if we follow you, there's a big administrative problem.",
  "All right. So all we're going to have is a contract which, in its discussion of the merits, makes some general mention of fees. And now, what we have is the initial notice of appeal has to be within 30 days of the judgment, when the fee issue is not yet resolved, and you're going to try to separate the merits from ­­ I mean, some ­­ you see what I'm worried about, what Justice Sotomayor was worried about, that these things will be very messy when you get to many contracts.",
  "Because, now, you're saying not just attorneys' fees, also auditor's fees.",
  "And what about witness fees? Experts?",
  "No, no. Experts, experts, the payment of an expert.",
  "No, no, no. It's a contract.",
  "So expert witnesses are ­­ are also, so we're talking about Budinich'ing or whatever, you want to do that for the attorneys' fees, auditor's fees, expert witness fees, experts who helped the attorney, but don't testify, what's the rule of what we're putting in here and what we're not?",
  "No, no, no. The words that make your point, I think, not absolutely obvious were when you said, \"which may or may not involve other kinds of fees.\" Now, at that point, I'm thinking, well, if we follow your rule, there might be quite a lot of litigation going on about those words, \"may or may not.\" If you follow the opposite rule, we've got a clear exception for statutory attorneys' fees and nothing else. All right. So ­­ so do you want to add anything?",
  "The ­­ in my own mind, what matters is you have to have one clear rule, one way or the other.",
  "And ­­ fine. Okay. Both agree that's right, I think. The ­­ so the First Circuit's approach is less referable. Which should it be? Well, go back to Justice Alito's question. What are ordinary lawyers going to think? What they normally think now, I guess, is this: There's a piece of paper separate. It's called a judgment. Counsel, one set goes into the file. You have 30 days, if you're not going to change that judgment, and the fact that you want costs doesn't make a difference. Now, what you want us to say is the fact that you want costs sometimes makes a difference. It makes a difference when it's nonstatutory. I grant you, that's fairly simple. But isn't it better to tell the lawyers ­­ I mean, I think that's what they would say ­­ it's better to tell the lawyers, look, counsel, a piece of paper is there, you have 30 days, and try to minimize the exceptions to that.",
  "I believe this rule was cost of litigation.",
  "In this case, it's lawyers, but it's going to treat the same ­­ experts, such as 1988, experts, real estate, all those things the lawyer simply thinks, costs of litigation, if it's cost of litigation I want, that doesn't make a difference, I better file it.",
  "Oh, '97.",
  "Sir, I don't want you to ­­ finish your argument, if you had something to say on what you started out with in describing the plan. You said there are three aspects. The first aspect was you cut out anyone ­­ any State that's contributing less than one percent. You said the second aspect was that you used a metric of $500 per ton of NOx reduced, and you applied that to the States still in, and then you said there were three, and you never got to three, and I want to be sure you do, if you had that.",
  "Well, they don't know exactly how to do it. I mean, this is a tough problem. So it sounds as if what you're making is a procedural objection here, to which the government's point was, you're right, we'd all been talking about this. We wanted to see what the States would come up with, so we look. The States haven't come up with enough, in our opinion; and so, now, we go to the Federal process, and we put out our thing, and you comment on that. And then, if you feel that their thing is no good, propose your own solutions again. That's what he's saying. But it's supposed to advance the ball. So there is a procedure for the States to come in, if they can come up with a better plan, that's what you've just heard, and so do it. So what's ­­ what's arbitrary or capricious about such a system?",
  "Well, they objected it once. Now, they think it works here. I mean, all the time it happens, that people change their minds about how problems are best solved, or they cite this problem's better solved one way and better another way. So if your only point is, once they did it a different way, they'll say, well, what's unreasonable about changing our way? We're trying to get the job done.",
  "Well, years and years, the neighbor board ­­ the labor board decided things in adjudications, rules. One day, they say, no, we think we should preside rulemaking processes, like other agencies. Does anything in the law prevent that?",
  "But they may not know ­­ you know. They may not know. There's six States that contribute to the seventh State's pollution, and how much each State can cut back depends. It depends on what it costs. It depends on how much they contribute. It depends upon what the other States will do. It depends upon where the wind blows, and that changes all the time.",
  "So they have a tough problem. They can't tell you exactly how much you should cut back until they know what they have in mind or what others have in mind for solving the problem. So it sounds to me as if you're asking them to do the impossible, and they’d had a very good reason for not doing what they did before; namely, it would be impossible here to have a ­­ or not actually impossible, but very tough and very expensive. So that's why, I gather, they went the way they did. Now, I don't know anything in the law that tells them that this statute was meant to force them to proceed in a way that would either be hugely more expensive and perhaps impossible. What's your ­­ what's your reaction?",
  "Why is it wrong? That is, I focused on your argument here in the briefs, which is very clear and very good. And ­­ and the example that comes to my mind is we have an overgrazing problem in State A. All right? It's caused because cows come in from State B and sheep come in from State C. The cow men and the sheep men are in different States. They're not friends.",
  "Now, it turns out ­­ it turns out that EPA, which is in charge of preventing the overgrazing, discovers that, if the sheep men build a fence, that will cure the problem, even though they only contribute half or maybe less. Well, if we bury it ­­ you know, we divide it equally, you each have to pay ­­ you each have to cause half the problem because that seems fair, it's going to end up that the people in State A with the cows, they're going to starve to death. So our choice is between taking two people, two States, each of whom cause half the problem and getting an overall plan where you solve the problem at minimal cost or just dividing it 50/50, which seems fair in mathematics, but leads to starvation, cost and death, et cetera. Do you see what I'm driving at? And that's what they've done here, the second method. They ­­ rather the ­­ they're not treating each State alike, you are right. And the reason that they're not treating each State alike is they know, one, all the States are partly responsible in more than one percent, and with this plan, we get the job done at much lower cost. Now, where in the statute does it say they can't do that?",
  "On that point ­­ now, you remember, please, that ­­ that my cow/sheep example was meant to pick up precisely the disproportion that you're talking about. And ­­ and keep that in mind because I found it a helpful example. Now, my point is, did you find in Congress ­­ and I'm interested in legislative history ­­ did you find anything in the legislative history that suggests that, where the EPA faces this kind of regional problem, and it's a regional, not just a statewide problem, that people in Congress thought they had an answer or a glimmer of an answer, as opposed to taking this language, which is pretty open, and saying, we're going to leave it to ­­ we don't know, we don't have a clue. The EPA is there to figure this thing out, and we're giving them a broad authority here. Is there anything that cuts on your side that you see, as opposed to the other side of reading this language?",
  "Yes, but you're ­­ I mean, you want me to write ­­ look what I would have to write, if I made it very specific. Two units floats over the air from the cow State. Two units floats over the air from the sheep State ­­ or three. It happens that, if we treat them alike, we're going to tell the cow State, your unit is the same as the sheep State's unit, both make the same significant contribution, and we have to say that, even if for you to remit your unit causes death and destruction, destroys your economy, see, and I have to write those words to accept your argument, don't I? Because ­­",
  "Of course.",
  "Well, I'm trying to use the most ­­ I'm trying to use the most extreme words I can, so that, then, you will either have to draw a distinction or something. That's why I'm ­­",
  "All right. So there's an ambiguity here because, I mean, when you use the word \"amounts,\" I think it does help you. Add the word \"amounts\" to \"significantly,\" and I think that Justice Scalia's point might be ­­ he knows it better that I ­­ an amount is an amount. An amount is an amount. That's what you want to say.",
  "Yes. Yes. It is. And then the ­­ the response is, well, not always because you say, an amount, you're talking about a specific amount coming out of a State, and is the one ­­ the cow one, as significant as the sheep one. All right? And that's, I think, where ­­ I think you hit the nail as to what the issue is.",
  "As in the answer is that some one point ­­",
  "Can you give me an idea of how ­­ just to follow up with Justice Alito. Can you ­­ I don't know if you asked the IRS ­­ the INS this question, you may, or something like it. Let's look at all of the derivative beneficiaries in the Fs, F1, 2A, And for the most part, they're grandchildren, they would be, or children, sometimes, nephews and nieces. And now, think of the set of all those people who age out. Okay? They started out as children, but it's 15 years later ­­ what's this thing­­ they're now aged out. Now, think of that set. It's ­­ call it a certain size. What percent of that set do you think are accounted for by the F2A people, who are the only ones on your interpretation that (3) would apply to?",
  "Any idea ­­ any rough idea? Because, if you just look at it, one's natural instinct is just what Justice Alito said. This is a minuscule component of a set. It's much bigger, and therefore, it's just unlikely that Congress meant (3) to apply to a ­­ to a ­­ to a little molecule, when there's the whole ocean. Now, that ­­ that's the kind of argument that you're up against, I think, so I wanted to ask you that empirical question. If you can give me any idea of the empirical?",
  "You ­­ did you ask ­­ anything that would give me ­­ that's the total global picture. That's the 2,000, 3,000, sometimes 10,000 aging out. All right. But ­­ but the real relevant thing is if we can get some idea, which seems in the paper, that your interpretation applies to ­­ only to a subset of those people. And just from reading it, that it's qualitative reading it, it sounds like a tiny subset of those people. Now, we can argue about whether that's for you or against you. I think it's against you, but nonetheless ­­",
  "That's F2A. But we want F2B now.",
  "F2A. You're right. You're right.",
  "All right. So it looks like it's between 10 percent, and sometimes, it gets it up to 30 percent ­­",
  "We don't have numbers on separation from parents. We do know that these people, the ones that would be caught on the broad interpretation, have also been waiting for years and years and years and years. They've all been waiting for years and years and years and years, and it becomes hard to choose among them.",
  "You can find sympathetic stories all over the place, and I mean ­­ all right. Go ahead.",
  "What do we do with a reasonable reading of the statute? I looked at the board's opinion here, and it seems to me, in the two paragraphs just prior to Section 5, at the end of Section 4, they have as a critical step in their ­­ in reaching their conclusion, their belief that the legislative record demonstrates a clear concern on the part of Congress to ameliorate the delays associating with the process of the visa processing. And they say the same thing in the paragraph just above that.",
  "So that's what they think this statute is about. But that statute ­­ that problem is taken care of in (1)(b). And so the question would be, if that problem, which subtracts all the days that there was a processing delay, is taken care of on (1)(b), they can't be right, that that was the purpose of 3. So unless you can say to me how that could possibly be right, that reasoning, then what we should do, I guess, if we think that you have authority in the government to interpret this minor part of the statute, which I do, is generate. Send it back. And ­­ and maybe give them ­­ say you ought to do this again because the reason you gave is not good. Or why not?",
  "But how does ­­ how ­­ can I try an example? Because I find it easier.",
  "All right. Imagine Steven is a citizen. His brother Charles is not. So under 4 ­­ and Charles has a son, Joseph, who is not. That will help you think about it. All right. So we're under F4. Steven files a petition. The beneficiary is Charles. Charles has a minor son, Joseph. Visa is granted, et cetera, for ­­ not visa ­­ you know, he's given ­­ everything is in order, and now, Charles has to wait about ten years or so. By the time he gets ­­ at the time his number becomes current ­­ the number becomes available for the alien, namely for Charles, at that moment, we calculate Joseph's age, and it's 24. All right. So your idea is that Charles is current. Everything is fine. He goes to the port or the office, wherever he's supposed to go, and he brings Joseph with him. At that point, Joseph, since he's no longer a child, has to come in under another category, and that category is going to be, I guess, 2B because Charles will be now an LPR, and Joseph will be unmarried over 21, right? Am I right so far?",
  "This is an imaginary ­­ he spells it with a V.",
  "Okay. Now, if I have it right ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "All right.",
  "Okay.",
  "Yes.",
  "All right. Now the ­­",
  "All right. But there is one thing missing. Charles has not filed a petition for Joseph. So what do we do about that?",
  "And doesn't ­­ doesn't Charles, as a lawful permanent resident, have to file a piece of paper called the petition ­­",
  "­­ in which Joseph is named primary beneficiary?",
  "Yes.",
  "But there is no ­­there is no F2B petition because Charles never filed it.",
  "I mean, yes; right.",
  "That's what I want to know. You don't need ­­",
  "We do all this, and ­­",
  "Can I ask you a quick question ­­",
  "­­ about your alternative argument, with you and Justice Scalia. I take it your argument is, look at the words; the part before the comma defines a group, and that group is not in dispute. It's all the F derivatives.",
  "All right. Then look at the first part. It says, the petition shall automatically be converted.",
  "See, if I lose on that, then look at the second part. It says, the alien shall retain the original priority date. And you say, as to that, that has an independent life.",
  "That's the B. So it's either A or B. And we think we win on A and B, but if not, we at least win on B. Now, has the Agency ever expressed a view in respect to whether you are right or wrong about your independent B?",
  "No. So wouldn't the right thing to do there be, in respect to B, send it back to the Agency so that they can express a view in respect to that?",
  "What do we do about ­­ I mean, I think the relevant pages are ­­ it's at 526 U.S. 328 to 330, probably read those 17 times. All right. When I looked at those, I saw they reaffirm Estelle. As they quote Estelle, they say its reasoning applies with full force. Estelle says, \"The court could discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of Respondent's capital trial so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned.\" I marked five separate statements in those two pages that came to the same thing. I looked at Estelle. Estelle has to do with the right to note ­­ note the comment that he wanted in respect to a sentencing fact that the jury was going to decide; namely, future dangerousness. Nothing to do with a fact about the crime, a sentencing fact. So then I said, well, what favors you here? What favors you is the last sentence of the first paragraph on 330, which says, \"Whether silence bears upon the determination of a lack of remorse or upon acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward adjustment provided in 3E1.1 of U.S. Sentencing Guidelines is a separate question. It is not before us and we express no view on it.\" Right. It's, one, not just a sentencing fact, but a state of mind of the defendant, lack of remorse; two, it's in the sentencing guidelines; three, it is a decision for a judge, not the jury. If it isn't confined, as I just said it, then Mitchell overrules Estelle, what it explicitly denies doing. Here, we have sentencing facts, facts about his childhood. He wanted the Estelle instruction. The judge wouldn't give it. That's the argument against you, I think. And I would like to hear your specific response.",
  "Well, I thought the facts ­­ what was at issue here, he has put on witnesses that show that he had a bad childhood, and he didn't himself testify about his bad childhood. And in that context, he asked for the no silence/silence instruction. The government did not object. The judge then refused to give the instruction. All right. Now, what's the difference between the facts about how his parents raised him and the fact of future dangerousness in Estelle?",
  "I didn't see that in Mitchell. But let ­­ let me go back, just elaborating on that, to Justice Alito's first question. I want to see if this issue is still in the case. You looked at the instruction, and the instruction is just a broad instruction. It says no adverse inference may be drawn from anything. All right. So there seemed to be some objection you had to the breadth of that instruction, so I looked at the instruction. The instruction does say exactly what Justice Alito said and you have said. It says the ­­ the instruction is ­­ \"The defendant is not compelled to testify, and the fact that he does not cannot be used as inference of guilt and should not prejudice him in any way,\" with a couple of, here, irrelevant modifications. All right? The instruction I just read you is not from this case. It's from the Carter case. In the Carter case, the court said that instruction must be given. It must be given at the sentencing phase. So what they did was copy the instruction out of the case, the very instruction that the court said, in Carter, the Fifth Amendment requires to be given in the sentencing phase. And that was a noncapital case. So what's the objection to the instruction, on its breadth? Not only is it the same, but the government never objected that it was too broad, and the only issues in the case were factual. They were about what happened to him in his childhood, namely, sentencing facts. And the instruction that you did read about what they should consider referred to facts and circumstances. And where, in Estelle, does it say that matters at sentencing related to facts and circumstances, you don't have to give the very instruction that Carter and Estelle required?",
  "I see.",
  "Does it overrule ­­ does it overrule Estelle?",
  "Yes. Does Mitchell ­­ Estelle talks about ­­ you apply the same rule to facts and circumstances of the sentence, in a capital case anyway.",
  "No, Mitchell doesn't.",
  "A low IQ and a personality disorder, I take it, were the mitigating factors?",
  "So in a case where there are witnesses who says there are two mitigating factors, he has a very low IQ and he has a personality disorder, he says nothing. The jurors go in the room. They have to decide does he have a low IQ and personality disorder and what weight should we give that as mitigators? This instruction says, jurors, do it. Just, when you do it, don't take account of the fact that he, himself, did not testify.",
  "Is that ­­ that ­­ so that jurors are perfectly clear, I would think. What I think is difficult for you is just what your friend raised. It is true that the Carter instruction refers to guilt. You took that instruction, word for word, and you've cut out \"guilt\" because this has nothing to do with guilt, right. Estelle says, I would think, that you have a right to a Carter instruction in respect to some sentencing factors, namely future dangerousness. The last sentence on the page of Mitchell says, we are not deciding whether you're entitled to that instruction in respect to other sentencing factors, namely, remorse. So the question for you is why does that thing ­­ that sentence about remorse in Mitchell, why isn't it at least ambiguous about whether your client is entitled to that instruction here? And your response to that is what?",
  "What I say ­­ what we said here, what I've gathered from the record, as best we've been able to see it, is in that sentencing hearing ­­ you were there?",
  "But you know it pretty well.",
  "Okay. There were five matters at issue. He had a low IQ, a personality disorder, the child of a troubled home, he had grown up in poverty, he had been sexually abused. All right. All of those things are basically factual matters about his background. Now, in that context, this instruction, which was the Carter instruction without the word \"guilt,\" referring to his failure to testify is ­­ doesn't mention those five things specifically. It doesn't say testify about those five things. But in context, was there anything else in that hearing that the jury could have thought failure to testify referred to?",
  "Is there anything else any juror might have thought, oh, he didn't testify about this other thing, too? Was there some other thing there?",
  "That's not what I'm thinking of.",
  "I'm thinking of what is it that we ­­ is there an issue in this case about whether the instruction, on top of whatever other problems it had, was too broad? So I'm thinking, if that was the only issue, if those are the only issues that this instruction could have been thought of as referring to, we don't have to get into the breadth matter. That's why I ask you. Was there something else in that hearing that the jury might have thought, oh, he didn't testify about it?",
  "He's got the point. But you have to answer, in terms of what the facts are at the hearing.",
  "But was his remorse an issue at the hearing?",
  "Then the answer ­­",
  "The Convention says, in the preamble, that the parties ­­ that's countries ­­ are firmly convinced that the interests of the children are of paramount importance in matters relating to their custody. Okay? Paramount importance. So the provision you're talking about, Article 13, says, well, would returning the child lead to physical harm, psychological harm, or otherwise put the child in an intolerable position. So they mean intolerable. So I think this would be a pretty typical case. The husband says he was fine. The wife says, no, he kicked me in the stomach and did a lot of other things. The judge hearing the two sides says I can't say the husband's right.",
  "So we don't know. Now, your idea is to send the child back to the husband unless the child gets up there and chooses between parents. That's pretty tough on 8­ or 9­ or 10­year­old children and ­­ very tough. And you're going to keep ­­ the ­­ you're going to send it back to the father in this situation, unless the mother can prove it's intolerable, either because of physical ­­ I mean, my goodness, a physical or psychological, you have all the doctors saying he should stay in New York. A typical problem for a family court judge, really tough. So you have the Convention, which says in the preamble, look to the interests of the child. You have every other country saying, that's what it really means; in other words, they're against you. You have the Department of State, in charge of the treaty, saying that's what it really means and otherwise against you. And so what do you have going for you? That isn't your fault that there isn't too much going for you, but nonetheless, I'd like to know what it is.",
  "Well, what is the answer? I'd like a straight answer in your opinion because Justice Kagan's case, the mother kidnaps the child. They live in a grain elevator ­­ a nicely refurbished grain elevator, in Peoria for a year. And after the year, a month later. The father finds both of them, goes to a family judge ­­ a very tough job by the way ­­ and the family judge reads this, and he says, well, I have to admit the child is settled here now in Iowa. All right. It's settled.",
  "But send the child back to London, he's going to be just about as settled. I mean, really, it's not that much difference, but I can't say the child is not settled. The father says this is the most unfair thing I've ever seen. She hides out for a year. The child would be just as well back in London. Almost as well. Who knows? Maybe better. But now, what can the family court do ­­ judge do? That's the straight question we've been trying to get your answer to that, and it isn't an answer to say ­­ you could say, if that's the answer, I don't know.",
  "No, what can they do? I just want to know if the family court judge will say please settle this, and the two of them won't.",
  "And so, now, what can the judge do? Is the father simply out of luck or not?",
  "But can you give me any authority? I read that exactly in Article 12, but you've now given me a different impression. What Article 12 says is that, if it's less than a year, the child is returned forthwith. If it's more than a year, the child shall be returned forthwith, unless ­­ unless it is demonstrated the child is now settled in its new environment. It doesn't say you don't return it if the child is now well settled in the environment. It just says you don't have to return it forthwith.",
  "So I would have thought that that would have opened room for discretionary factors, but you have not given me a case that said that that's so. You have not given me anybody who said that what I thought was the natural reading and which you'd like to be the natural reading, you've not given any support for the proposition that it is the natural reading.",
  "So I should read that case because the language says, \"Unless it is demonstrated the child is now settled, you return it forthwith, unless it is demonstrated the child is well settled.\" Well, now, it's demonstrated well settled. Does that mean I cannot return it? Or does it mean I don't have to return it?",
  "And I say ­­ or you say I read that case in the House of Lords, and I will discover it means you don't have to return it.",
  "Are you ­­ can I ask you how it works here? I realize I don't know. A year has passed. The father never found out where the child was. Now, he suddenly finds out. He runs to Iowa. The judge looks at this Convention, and he says, well, the year's passed. You've lost, let's say, and I don't have to ­­ I don't have to return him forthwith. The child's not going to suffer intolerable injury. I can't use that. I don't have to return him forthwith. Now, I look, is he settled? Yes. He's settled. All right. End of the matter. But do we now, in the discretion of the father, have a custody hearing? The father can say, yes, all that's true, but I should have custody. And he goes, and under Iowa law, we see who is entitled to custody. And he has something going for him. Namely, the mother's acted pretty badly, unless she has excusing circumstances in abducting the child. Does that happen or not?",
  "No, it would go to the family court, so is that ­­ would that happen? Could that happen? Of course, I think.",
  "Okay. If the answer is of course, what we're talking about here is, on the one hand, we don't want to encourage abductions. On the other hand, we don't want to treat the child as a yo­yo.",
  "So the question is whether the custody hearing will be in a family court in Britain or whether it'll be in a family court in the United States.",
  "That's the correct question; is that right?",
  "So our issue about whether there's discretion or ­­ it's a little bit secondary because we can have a big, full­blown hearing about who should have custody, though, it will be in a different court. It's true. You lose. There is more incentive to kidnap the child. It's also true, if you win, there is a much greater likelihood that the custody hearing will be in Britain, rather than the United States, which is the yo­yo problem.",
  "All right. Now, go ­­ now, say what you want to say. Now, if I understand it correctly.",
  "So what do you say about the Twentieth Amendment, which says that that January 3rd was a meeting? Are you saying they violated the Twentieth Amendment? January 3rd. This says the Congress of the United States shall meet on January 3rd every year, unless they appoint a different day.",
  "And they haven't. And, therefore, they met in pro forma session. Or do you think it wasn't a meeting? And what do you think about the other part of the Constitution, which says they can't adjourn for more than 3 days without the approval of the House, which they didn't have. So are you saying that the Senate violated those other two amendments of ­­ the two parts of the Constitution, or are you saying that they have different meanings in the three parts?",
  "Okay. So you're saying they violated, if that ­­ if they have pro forma sessions on January 3rd, they violate the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution. You are saying that if they had a pro forma session on January 3rd, that since their meeting ­­ their recess was still on and lasted more than 3 days, it was a violation of that Adjournment Clause of the Constitution. Now, that's one way to interpret it. Over a long period of time, they have apparently met pro forma on those days. Or we could try to make them mean the same thing, which would mean it was up to the Senate. They consider that a meeting, it's a meeting. What do we do?",
  "Would you write that opinion, saying the Senate of the United States has violated two ­­ two provisions of the Constitution?",
  "All right. Why not?",
  "Would it ­­ would it ­­ I mean, that's my basic question, really. Why is this an important case? I see what you're saying on this one. That's fine for an answer. Thank you.",
  "What my really basic question is why is this an important case, in your opinion? Now, you've said, oh, because there are thousands of recess appointments, not on the happen clause. You've listed 7600 or so, really, on the recess part, but on the happen clause, you've only been able to find 102. And moreover, we've had an example of ­­ where this Court, for better or for worse, said that two members of the board is not a quorum, and we got some more members, they dealt with the problem. They ratified all those opinions, they dealt with it. It didn't take them too much time. So ­­ and we have different political parties taking absolutely opposite sides, it seems to me, or some members thereof, depending on the political party of the President. And we have a clause that had to do with the Constitution and the problem of intra ­­ inter­session recesses when they were 7 months and nobody could meet. Okay. That isn't true anymore. So explain to me. I'm not saying you're wrong. I just want to hear from your mouth why this is an important case.",
  "What, where is this ­­ the most surprising thing to me that you have said, and it's important, is not just the view of language at the time of the framing, but what the purpose of this clause was. I mean, this is a very well­briefed case, and I have looked at them. I have read them, actually.",
  "And I’ll tell you, I cannot find anything, so far, and I may have missed it ­­ I'm asking ­­ I can't find anything that says the purpose of this clause has anything at all to do with political fights between Congress and the President. To the contrary, Hamilton says that the way we're going to appoint people in this country is Congress and the President have to agree. Now, that's a political problem, not a constitutional problem, that agreement. And it was just as much true of President George Bush, who made six appointments that happened previously, as it is with President Obama, who's made four. All right? So ­­ so where ­­ and he says this clause is a supplement, a supplement, to the basic clause to take care of the timing problem. So, what have I missed? Where is it in the history of this clause, in its origination, that it has as a purpose to allow the President to try to overcome political disagreement?",
  "Well, if it isn't a purpose, can you give me an example where the language, particularly that word \"happen\" ­­ I mean, your example was a good one but I don't think it applies, but that's a different matter. I can't ­­ the language is over here. The number of appointments on \"happen\" is few. If you are worried about James Tobin, Congress has passed a law that can be taken as looking at a vacancy occurring when it occurs within 30 days of the beginning of the recess, which would have taken care of Tobin. So look at the language difficulty. Look at the comparatively small practice in that area. Look at the other ways to get around the problem, and then give me another example in the Constitution where you have both language and purpose pointing one place and yet this Court because of practice has come to the opposite conclusion.",
  "\"Happen?\" Of course, battles happen. That's because battles occur over time. Give me an example with the word \"vacancy,\" where that word \"vacancy\" is used with the word \"is,\" but not \"occurred.\"",
  "But just give me an English example where it’s natural to say ­­",
  "Your statutory example has to do with a battle, not a vacancy.",
  "A financial emergency, correct. I'm sorry. I'm asking you for an example with the word \"vacancy.\" That's what I am having trouble with.",
  "I'm not talking about ­­ I just say, could you find an example, and I'm gathering, from my answer, you couldn't.",
  "And ­­ and I couldn't either.",
  "One reason they could have put the language in is because they were afraid, otherwise, the President would have the power, simply, when somebody died two or three years before, and they've had a big fight in Congress to save up all the controversial nominations and then put them through as recess appointments. That could be one thing they didn't want to happen. I don't know. You see, it's the same problem. Same problem.",
  "What happened in that period at around 1970 is that's about the first time that you have intra­session ­­ an intra­session recess that's longer than an inter­session recess. And so now if we look from 1970 on, that's fairly common. And so all that's happening is that the Presidents are appointing recess appointees during periods where they are out for a longer time. Now, how are we supposed to go and say that this thing ­­ thousands of people on the recess part ­­ is unconstitutional? I mean, it isn't unheard of. What about the Due Process Clause? Does that easily cover the language? Substantive due process. What about the Interstate Commerce Clause and the doctrine of ­­ you know, the implicit clause there? I mean, it isn't unheard of that over time language in the Constitution takes on a somewhat different meaning.",
  "How do we ­­ I mean, probably different judges have different approaches. But if I'm concerned about the basic practicality and the basic objective here, why would I agree with you?",
  "If I do place more weight on this, should we ­­ I mean, I do believe and agree with you to this point that this is basically a matter of politics for other branches basically. That doesn't help me resolve this. But it does lead over to this possibility. Congress did pass the No Pay Act. And then they passed the Pay Act. And in that Pay Act on this \"happen\" part, which I think is the strongest ­­ very strong for your side, but it defines the vacancy in terms of 30 days prior to the recess. And that would take care of most of these. You see, if vacancy could be defined as something that stretches, because Congress says it stretches in terms of pay for 30 days.",
  "What do you think of that? And I would love to know what the SG thinks of it.",
  "The third question, by the way, just put in your mind, if you digress in your answer, put in your mind what would have happened in 1830 if someone, when they had a 9­month recess, close to 10 months, someone had the bright idea, well, you live near Washington; go show up at wherever we are holding our sessions and sit there for 5 minutes, and we'll stop President Andrew Jackson from making recess appointments. What would we be saying then?",
  "Actually, I think I remember what they were ­­",
  "­­ and they were 1483 and 1490­something, and then there was an asterisk that said \"obsolete.\"",
  "And in fact ­­ in fact, I couldn't figure out what they were talking about.",
  "Do you want to say anything before the ­­ about the ­­ the language on the \"happen,\" I support you. But the ­­ the practice, and in particular, the practicalities, because you say, well, the President can make an acting appointment, make a recess appointment even. I mean ­­ you know, they have much less authority, somebody appointed in that way, much less than a person who's been confirmed by the Senate. So if the government won't grind to a halt, it still faces a problem.",
  "What do you want to say about that?",
  "That's the end of it, exactly the same, if this all took place during the 9­month inter­session recess in 1835.",
  "No, no, no. Exactly, same facts. Same facts.",
  "And, therefore, in your view, the clause, even if they were all scattered to the winds in 1835, there would have been not possible for President Andrew Jackson, if I have that right, to make the recess appointments.",
  "Yes. But your view would be the Court should reject it.",
  "You say anything that would ­­ on this, if you want to, that would turn it back to the practicalities. Imagine, hypothetically, that I would have thought President Theodore Roosevelt acted unconstitutionally when he tried to make all of his appointments, dozens and dozens, during a two­second ­­",
  "Yes, yes ­­ inter­session ­­",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "And by converse reasoning, the Congress would not have been able, in 1835, to prevent recess appointments simply by having a nearby senator show up for a ­­ for one second, once every 3 days, over a 9­month period. It seems to me what goes around comes around in this ­­ in this ­­",
  "The question of reports. There were reports, remember? Sorry, I didn't mean to ­­ your six minutes couldn't be up already.",
  "Yeah, but I'm focusing on 30 days and the reason I'm doing that is this seems to me, hypothetically at least, a real matter for the political branches to resolve among themselves. Now, we have to decide this, so I thought, well, why not look and see what Congress objects to the least? And I got that 30­day thing from the Pay Act by analogy.",
  "So I want to get your view on that.",
  "I'm really interested in how you think the 30­day idea, if practical, plays out in terms of your concerns.",
  "The same thing is true of certain retirement funds.",
  "So if, in fact, the person has $4 million in this special retirement fund account and he's behaved in the most extraordinarily dishonest way, the trustee has no power to impose a sanction on those funds, even if he'll earn a big income, he's lied nonstop, etcetera.",
  "An IRA.",
  "He behaved very badly, and in view of this, I agree with that. Why wouldn't ­­ or why didn't the ­­ or why couldn't the trustee simply sanction? I mean, you have apparently the authority here in 105 to sanction conduct abusive of the judicial process. That includes an order directing payment of expenses. Okay. I guess this is an expense. And that wouldn't be discharged, because it's a postpetition debt. So why not just do that? And even if he doesn't have money now, if he ever gets any he's going to have to pay it. So it looks as if there's an alternative way of paying for this.",
  "No, it doesn't. But why, when you have pretty clear language saying this shall not be used for administrative expense ­­",
  "­­ and you have general language over here saying a general power to sanction, and you have an alternative way that's perhaps almost as good, why read the language that says no to say, well, yes?",
  "If he has the exemption, (k) says: \"Property that the debtor exempts under this section is not liable for payment of any administrative expense.\" That's why I thought it seemed a fairly definite no, unless you read the general knowledge and tradition to mean yes.",
  "But couldn't the ­­ couldn't the bankruptcy judge just deny him, deny him bankruptcy?",
  "It made me think of a ­­ think of a bankruptcy petitioner who, in part, has a debt arising towards a creditor that consisted of the most frightful conduct you can think of. I mean, something really awful that he did to somebody. And yet that debtor can be excused, bankrupt, and keeps the Now, while lying to a bankruptcy trustee is bad, it's not hard for us to think of conduct that's far worse. And yet, he can keep the $75,000. Why should ­­ why should this particular form of bad conduct allow the invasion of the homestead?",
  "Is there any case law ­­ because 522 says in (b), it says \"The following property may be exempt.\" It doesn't say it has to be. So is there any case law where the debtor writes down ­­ you know, a piece of property and a creditor comes in and says: He can't exempt that he has behaved outrageously, and it fits within the category, but he has behaved outrageously. Is there any case law that says under those circumstances the bankruptcy judge can refuse the exemption one way or the other?",
  "I mean, you first have to get to the thing where the ­­ we are pretending to put the creditor, the bankruptcy judge, as if he were another creditor. The thing, the property, appears on a list that says exempt. And then the trustee or the judge says: No, I'm not going to let you exempt it. And that's basically what he's done.",
  "You see what I mean? Not only is it administrative expenses, but you have to somehow say, well, the judge is a constructive creditor, and he constructively objected. There are an awful lot of \"constructive's\" in that sentence that I just gave you.",
  "It's all right.",
  "What they are saying, I think the government's point is ­­ the other side is saying, and I don't remember the term of my property law. What's the right term? It's ­­ you grant to A, black acre to A and his heirs; it's a fee simple. But it's subject to a shifting; it's subject to divestiture, subject to a condition subsequent. What's the right term?",
  "It shifts the ­­ it shifts it back.",
  "It could be. There was a technical term they used to have. But anyway, that's what they're saying.",
  "And they are saying that that's, for purposes of who owns the land, the mineral rights, it's treated as an easement. But for purposes of deciding who it reverts to, it's treated as a fee subject to a shifting use or whatever you call it. Subject to ­­ what did you say? Subject to ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, it's different in this respect. It's different that there they were talking about who owns the mineral rights. So for those purposes they say it's treated like an easement. But for who gets the reverter, it's treated like a shift of the fee.",
  "All right. We have a brief here from the cities, and they point out that ­­ that, of course, there is reliance on your side; you're ­­ I believe you are absolutely right. But they say there is also a lot of reliance on the other side, because cities have built highways, and they've ­­ or states have, and they've converted it to use under patents or under statutes that the United States gave them that right. And all those are going to be invalid if you win. So what's your response to that?",
  "Why ­­ why?",
  "Now, what about when 912 says that when the railroad abandons a piece of the right­of­way, okay, it then says that the interest of the United States, with all right, title, and interest in the state of the United States shall be vested in the town that builds the highway. But your point is, that's true, but where they previously ­­ where they have previous ­­ where they have given ­­ where they conveyed it to a private person, they didn't have any right, title, and interest, because on abandonment it was simply an easement. And on abandonment, that goes to the property owner who owns the ­­ the land on either side. Is that ­­ I mean, your point is that the United States didn't have any right, title, and interest on the abandonment unless the United States continued to own the property.",
  "All right. So that is your point. They can't convey what they don't have.",
  "Okay.",
  "I got that point.",
  "All right.",
  "All right. Let me put it this way.",
  "But what are the numbers? I mean, look, this is what I'm thinking. This is property law. It's not just a question of trying to work out what the case could or couldn't have stood for. If I try to remember my property class, it vaguely was ­­ which was a great class, A. James Casner, real expert. And he ­­ he, I think, said that when you convey subject of divestment, the ­­ something called season under the common law went to the recipient of the conveyance. But if you conveyed an easement, season did not pass. So in holding that it is an easement, you're holding there was no season, and therefore, it couldn't be a divestiture. Now, whether that's true or not or I've misremembered it, I'd go back to Justice Scalia's question. Is there a single example since the Domesday Book, since Dadonis, since the Bracton, on little to whatever it was, I mean, in the history of the common law up to the present, where a court has interpreted an ambiguous phrase, which doesn't say to grant an easement for one purpose, but not for the other. There may be some, but I didn't notice any cited in the government's brief.",
  "No, I said in any case at all.",
  "Yes, yes. What is the case?",
  "What is the case? I'd like to read it.",
  "Oh, but they had ­­ they had a different view.",
  "They didn't say it was an easement.",
  "I didn't read what ­­ it did?",
  "Which case?",
  "Where do I ­­ where is it roughly in your brief?",
  "Oh, all right. Well ­­",
  "I'm surprised that ­­ but the ­­ if you think there are some, I'll get my law clerks to look ­­",
  "Can you imagine or explain to me why a property lawyer worth his salt since 70 years ago or more, 1942, wouldn't have read that case and advised his client, who was buying the land, if the railroad abandons it, it's yours.",
  "Where is some evidence of that?",
  "No, not reasons. I want to know if there's any authority, and then you get to the the reasons.",
  "Well, I see that they do and I certainly think bicycle paths are a good idea, but the problem that I see here is just what Justice Kagan is bringing up; that is, as I read this, I think there might be millions of acres in the last 70 years that have been conveyed. For all I know, there is some right of way that goes through people's houses ­­ you know, and all of a sudden, they are going to be living in their house and suddenly a bicycle will run through it, which isn't so bad, but I'm concerned about that, and your answer makes me more concerned ­­",
  "­­ because you haven't suggested anything that makes me think there aren't millions and millions of acres involved. Now, what are you going to say that disabuses me of that?",
  "Exactly, because the lawyer would think ­­ when he reads the case of Great Northern, you think it's an easement.",
  "So how much is that? How much roughly is that? How often has it turned out that there was a conveyance ­­ after 1942 there was a conveyance of an abandoned right of way by the United States to land that had been previously been granted to a private owner?",
  "How often?",
  "I know you don't have good numbers, but can you give me a rough estimate?",
  "I will say ten times as much reliance on the one side than the other side, is that totally wrong?",
  "That's true, but when you talk about ­­ I mean, I went and read ­­ when I read ­­ I thought your brief was very persuasive but then I read Great Northern and I thought they have ­­ they are really quoting it correctly. Here's what they said about the cases that you refer to like Stringer, The conclusion that the railroad was the owner of a limited fee ­­ which was the conclusion of those earlier cases ­­ was based on cases arising out of the 1871 Act, not the 1875 Act, and the change of policy in 1875 was brought ­­ was not brought to the Court's attention. And then they say that conclusion is inconsistent with the language of the 1875 Act. It's history. And it's early administrative interpretation. We therefore do not regard this earlier case as controlling.",
  "Well, I thought they say in the Stringer case. Is that same as ­­",
  "Yes, that's the one you were ­­",
  "That's ­­ that's basically my problem. I guess you just don't have any specific things of what property lawyers were saying. But those two cases are from the era of Stringer, and at that point, apparently, the Court thought it was a limited fee.",
  "And then you get ­­ they were all ­­ was any of them after Great Northern?",
  "So ­­ so then in Great Northern it comes along?",
  "Can you think of anything I can do about this? It's a case, in my mind at least, where reliance interests on ­­ on a previous case in the property law area are important, and yet none of the briefs here really gives me a ­­ a reasonably concrete idea of how much reliance there has been. And ­­ and ­­",
  "So I'm somewhat in the dark.",
  "Doesn't Interior or some ­­ I mean, doesn't the highway ­­ aren't there people in the government who keep track of where the highways are built?",
  "I guess it would be the private parties that would have brought it up in Great Northern, wouldn't it? And do you have any light to shed on the comparative amounts? I mean, they're saying ­­ for all we know there are billions of dollars worth of takings claims that will come out where the highways run, and you're arguing, of course, any reasonable property lawyer would have relied on Great Northern to think it was just conveying an easement. But ­­ you know, I'm not a property lawyer, and so what actually happened matters. And the amounts matter, at least to me. And do you have any light to shed?",
  "What about on your side? What about the possibility that millions of acres has been conveyed and there are tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of abandoned railroads that property lawyers thought went to the person who bought them, and run through somebody's house? I mean, is that a figment of my imagination?",
  "And you would say no, it isn't, and therefore I'm asking you is there any empirical support anywhere for how property lawyers have treated Great Northern, how much was conveyed, et cetera? Anything you can say on that would be helpful.",
  "There is a ­­ I want you to get on a bit, because I'd say the question that we're, at least for me, is one of congressional intent, not in necessarily your case but in future cases. And the argument that is that the statute can be read, it silences, to say if Congress wanted to allow people in noncore cases to submit reports and recommendations, they surely would have wanted it in what they thought was a core case that turned out to be noncore. So I want your response to that, and I would couple that with my own research for an opinion when I was one the First Circuit about the fraudulent conveyances, and they are about bankruptcy. I grant you that there is a Statute of Elizabeth, it's a legal matter for several hundred years, but the person who is defrauded, the people defrauded are the creditors. And in most instances, the fraud consists of transferring property to a friend, rather than a creditor, where you know you are insolvent. Now, that is a legal matter. But it is about bankruptcy. And it's State law, but it is about bankruptcy. And it is, according to you ­­ I may not agree with that, but I think we have to take it as noncore. But why wouldn't Congress have, of course, wanted reports and recommendations if they couldn't get what they really wanted, which is to have the bankruptcy judge decide it?",
  "I know that, and I would have said they were right. But, nonetheless, I am faced with case law that says to the contrary. Okay. So my question is, if they couldn't get ­­ if they couldn't get what they wanted, which is to have the bankruptcy judge decide it, why wouldn't they at least have wanted the bankruptcy judge to write a report and recommendations and send it on to the district judge so he can review it de novo?",
  "If I find an ambiguity in that language, then you would say I would be sensible to read it contrary to what you want.",
  "Well, okay. That's ­­ I got that point. One is you say, It's totally unambiguous, you can't do anything about it. But if, in my opinion, it is ­­ take it as a hypothetical ­­ it's ambiguous enough to get what Congress wanted. Now, can you give me any argument against what I just said?",
  "I've got it. I'd like an answer to my question. My question is I want you to assume that the language is at least somewhat ambiguous. And on that assumption, is there any reason not to adopt the government's position.",
  "I thought there were two aspects to the Article III problem. One affects the individuals and it's an unfairness, and the other is structural, as Justice Scalia has said. But both are at issue. And so where you have only a structural issue and it's a question of getting the bankruptcy courts to work and nobody's hurt by it, doesn't that at least cut in favor of interpreting a statute to prevent chaos ­­ not chaos, that's too strong ­­ but to prevent ­­ to allow the function of the court to work better?",
  "You're saying basically, I think, the words are, for core proceedings, it gives the power to the bankruptcy judge to hear and determine.",
  "And if I tell the assistant chef, you deal with orders for bacon and eggs, that might mean that the assistant chef can deal with eggs orders alone, or it might mean only those that order both.",
  "That's why I thought perhaps it's ambiguous.",
  "It's true, but if you were in the Ninth Circuit, and I would have ­­ you would have thought this was a core proceeding.",
  "So he says, you know, of course I didn't object. I am faced with all kinds of precedent that say it's impossible; and therefore, there is no reason to object. That wasn't consent.",
  "What are we supposed to assume here on this point? In Thomas, this Court held that what Northern Pipeline establishes is that Congress cannot vest in a non­Article III court the power to adjudicate without consent of the litigants. So that's the holding. Now, if we are going to go back into Crowell and Benson and the power of agencies and whether we want to reverse the things that were held in 1938 and so forth, I guess we should have briefing on that. Am I supposed to assume that this is a case ­­ I thought I assumed what we have held before in respect to constitutionality. Not whether Northern Pipeline extends to where it is with consent of the parties.",
  "Now, you heard what I read from Thomas. I was just reading it, and it talks about without consent. So what I want to know is are we going to open up these issues again? Because I have my own views on that, but they don't necessarily ­­ they won't necessarily command a majority, but I think we should have briefing.",
  "My question is are we supposed to go into that or do we just take as assumed what Thomas said and Stern said, and I think ­­ you know what I said. I don't want to repeat myself.",
  "I think we should have briefing on the point if we are going into it.",
  "It is, but it ­­ really, if you have anything ­­ the definition is very broad. I mean, it says \"'wages' means all remuneration for employment.\" All remuneration ­­ wages means all remuneration for employment paid basically for any service of whatever nature performed by an employee. Now, I agree with you that it's the same definition for the withholding. But Congress, it passes the withholding change with conflicting interpretations. So it wouldn't be the first time that Congress passed a statute to say: We don't care what the conflicting interpretations are; ignoring that, you are going to withhold this money, period. And it said, whether it's other than wages or not. I grant you, they might have thought they had to pass it, but so?",
  "We could also look at it as they didn't have to pass it. It was subject to withholding anyway.",
  "Well, no, there would have been a need, if different people think different things. So you want to be sure.",
  "I mean, Congress does that quite a lot. It ­­ it ­­ on certain, different people tell them different things. They say, we don't care; do it anyway. And that's what this statute basically says: Withhold anyway.",
  "And maybe ­­ could we say that? Could we say, well, in our opinion you are right. Both statutes cover supplemental unemployment benefits. It's never come up in the other context since this because Congress wanted to be sure it was withheld.",
  "I'll take it that you're right, that the Congress that passed the withholding statute thought it fell outside of the definition of wages, but Now, that wouldn't be the first time either. So ­­ but Congress did think it. So what weight am I supposed to give to what Congress thought then about what an earlier Congress, namely, the Congress that passed the wage definition in the withholding statute thought?",
  "Well, yes. But that was so much the more so, you see? They had authority saying it wasn't wages. That doesn't mean that authority was correct. And ­­ and so that's why they passed the statute.",
  "How far do you want to go in your concession? Would you want to concede this point that imagine the State has two groups of people and one group feels what the other is doing is terribly wrong. And the second group feels, We absolutely want to do it. And everyone is in a fragile state of mind, and they want to, if possible, at least one group wants to sort of shout as loud as you could at the other, Please don't do this. And the other says, Please leave me alone. And we are not saying which group is which; the analogy is obvious, but I keep all the titles out. Does the State have the right, in your opinion, to say, It's tough to referee this, we see the potential for real harm on one side or the other, so we're going to have this kind of 35­foot boundary? You want to concede that and say, okay, but the evidence here didn't doesn't justify it, or do you want to fight that, too?",
  "But now you are into the details. I want to know about the principle. I mean, I can imagine the principle applying special care and need must be taken outside of hospitals for veterans, even though there are some who are very much opposed to the war, because these people are gonna be coming out, they'll be in wheelchairs, it will be terrible. And others thinking ­­ you know, we can think of many, many situations, irrespective subject matter, where there is a need for such refereeing. And I just want to know if the ­­ if the concept is okay with you or if not.",
  "With the details.",
  "Do you see now why I am trying to narrow it? Because in my case, in Schneider, I thought it was pretty important that the demonstrators were behind a hill somewhere and the police restricted where they can go. Many States have enacted similar laws, and I thought that's important, because maybe it would have come out differently. I mean, you could argue that, I could. So I'm trying to narrow it. I'm trying to see to what extent do I have to look at this particular set of facts, in which case we are into the hearings, et cetera; and to what extent is there a matter of very broad principle here, and any help you can give me on that would be appreciated.",
  "Okay. So that ­­ now, at this point ­­ that was a better way of getting what I was trying to get at. Just assume that there is ­­ let's look at the narrow part of the case, and let's assume that the Colorado case is right. And this particular restriction is more a restrictive than Colorado in two important respects, which you've gone into. Now, the reason that they did that is they had hearings in Massachusetts, and they discovered that the Colorado law didn't really work very well. And so, what are we supposed to do? Are we supposed to now go look at ­­ as long as those hearings are ­­ are legitimate hearings and they have good explanation on something like whether the zone is 8 feet and consensual or whether it's 35 feet and different amounts of sidewalk, depending on the nearness of the facility, when doesn't it become just up to them? We can't ­­ we're not legislators. We don't know the situation in Massachusetts. We can insist upon a reasonable record. But how can we do more than that on this detail?",
  "But you understand that. We all understand that. It's one thing to try to prove an intent on such matters, particularly when people are, in good faith, they're trying to explain it, and it's another thing to actually stop the congestion and to protect the interests of the woman who wants to have the abortion, may be in a fragile state of mind, and this kind of thing could interfere with her health, et cetera. So there are two interests, one on each side. We know 8 feet with the bubble is okay. We're not sure about 35 feet, and they have an evidentiary record.",
  "That's why I just asked you that question. It just happens that the police testify with some evidence and examples that the 8­foot bubble doesn't work. And it also ­­ they have some evidence and reasons for thinking that if you want to have a conversation, you have to convince the woman to walk 10 feet. I mean, the difference is about half ­­ you know, if you were near me, Price is near we have Colorado. If we're over to where the first row is, we'd have Massachusetts, and ­­ and they have some evidence that we can't enforce this Colorado thing very well; it doesn't help. Now, go ahead. I want your answer.",
  "I'm not trying to put words ­­",
  "I'd hear you.",
  "I'm not denying the difference.",
  "I am asking you, we've now heard different characterizations of the record. I didn't mean to characterize it. I want you to explain what it is in the record, from your point of view or lack thereof, that means that the Constitution intervenes to prevent Massachusetts from doing it.",
  "I'd just like you to go back to Justice Scalia's question for one second. I didn't hear the ­­ as he was saying that this case is not a protest case, it's simply about calm conversations. And that is what I want to know if the evidence showed that.",
  "No, the evidence upon which Massachusetts based its decision to go to 35 feet instead of 8 feet. There were hearings. Did the evidence show that what was involved was calm conversations between one person trying to counsel another or did the evidence show something else?",
  "What?",
  "Rather ­­ I note there's some people who are peaceful, in which case I would accept Justice Scalia's suggestion this is a counseling case. But you've cited some other evidence that suggests there were other people who were screaming, pushing and shouting, which sounds like, in his characterization, a protest case. And the reason that Massachusetts found it difficult to write a statute that distinguishes one from the other is? Why do people write statutes that sometimes do not make these fine distinctions? Why did they in this instance?",
  "Could you have written such a statute that would have worked?",
  "To go to ­­ go back for a second. I see that. Is there anything in the record ­­ the obvious reason for a legislator, I think ­­ I did work in the legislature for a while as a staff member ­­ that you don't write these fine statutes is they won't work. They have too fine a distinction. The activity is commingled. The activity ­­ all right. Now, I knew you were just going to nod my ­­ your head as soon as I said that. So I was trying to get you to say it in spontaneously if it's true. Is there anything in this record that suggests that this is one of those cases where it's just too tough to say whether they're counseling somebody or whether they're screaming at somebody, whether they're pushing somebody or whether they're standing near them peacefully? Is there any evidence in the record I could turn to that would suggest that?",
  "She can't say yes if it isn't there, because I'm going to ask her where because I want to read it.",
  "What kind of ­­",
  "But I understand you're saying the reasonableness of it.",
  "But go back to Justice Alito's first question. Maybe we can make some progress here. The regulation of labor is up to the NLRB. All right. Now, the NLRB does regulate picketing. It does say what you can do and can't do, and the courts have reviewed that. And you ­­ what standard do courts use when the NLRB decides, in its wisdom and expertise, well, the pickets can go here, but they can't go there. You can do this, but you can't do that. All of which have speech implications. What standard of review do the courts use?",
  "Are you aware of any case ­­ I'm putting it ­­ loading it because ­­ only because to show my ignorance of it ­­ where the standard has differed from the ordinary APA standard?",
  "Should we create a new standard for reviewing this kind of regulation? I think that's actually a serious question.",
  "Excuse me. If you look at the history of it, it's certainly true that Congress did intend to get misdemeanor domestic felonies. That's what they said. And as it works out in the States, if you take the same definition in, there would be very, very few States misdemeanor of domestic violence that would be covered.",
  "I can't believe that Congress wanted to write a statute that did so little.",
  "Some people who don't read legislative history don't know that, but if you did read the legislative history, you would see that they do want to have an effect with this statute.",
  "Well, on your reading, what would it have accomplished?",
  "I agree with you. I agree with you on the tough ­­ what they were thinking. But now what I want to know, and you've read all these briefs and ­­ and you've actually done a lot of work on this. So ­­ so if you adopt your definition ­­ you know, making them parallel, how many State domestic violent misdemeanor statutes, in how many States would this cover it, in your opinion.",
  "Please.",
  "That's true, and that's what I was trying to get at because it seems to me that some of the ­­ quite a few, actually, of the statutes that they cite have different categories and some of the categories would escape being covered by offensive touching and others wouldn't. So I thought you might ­­ on that assumption, if you win this case, then how many States would be ­­ how many States would have written their statutes so generally that it wouldn't fall within the scope of the provision we are talking about in your opinion?",
  "When you say \"substantial,\" I mean, you've read all these and do you have he an idea of ­­",
  "You've thought about this question, so you must have some rough idea. You could put a range on it.",
  "Yes.",
  "Let's assume, just to help for a change ­­ I mean, not for a change, you help a lot. But the question in my mind is, can you imagine losing this case, hypothetically, just on a hypothetical, and that the Court were to say, just what Justice Scalia said, and the offensive touching does not fall within the definition of physical force, but touching that produces violent injury does. Now, were we to say that, then can you give me a rough answer to my numerical question?",
  "See, what we do is where it's ­­ where it's separable, where it comes in two separate clauses, then modified categorical approach applies. And ­­ and that being so, the only States where domestic violence wouldn't be included would be those that have a crime and use general language that you can't divide in the statute and cover both bodily injury and offensive touching. And are ­­ are there some such States? There must be some ­­",
  "Well, how ­­ now, just drawing on your criminal justice experience, say whether my sentence I'm about to utter is true or false. That's what I'd like to know. The ­­ the many statutes, which include in the same section, the physical injury and the offensive touching, such as Arizona, you intentionally or knowingly cause physical injury or knowingly touching another person with intent to injure, insult, et cetera. What we will find when we look back at the record of the prior convictions, it will say charge Arizona revised statute 13­1203(a), pled guilty. And we'll have no idea which it was. And ­­ and that is a general problem with this area. We'll have no idea. Now, is that generally true what I've just said, or false?",
  "Then I don't see ­­ I think it is generally true, too, and I can't work this out. I mean, we'll work it out, I'm sure. But look, on the ­­ on the one hand, if you just can't know, as is often true, then on the one hand, you're not really picking up serious domestic violence. You see where there was serious domestic violence. And ­­ and although it was under a general charge and so the person has a gun. Even did he really beat the spouse up and so forth. Or on the other hand, you pick up the offensive touching, too.",
  "So what do we do?",
  "Yes, yes. So what is your view after all this practice in this area? What would you recommend?",
  "Can you remind me of something which I ­­ if you interpret this broadly, to include battery, suppose you do offensive touching. Then one consequence is that the person cannot later carry a gun, is that right?",
  "Is it also the case that there would flow ineluctably an extra year 15­year prison sentence, or not?",
  "No. The only consequence is that he couldn't carry a gun.",
  "I mean, if you’d say yes, contrary to your argument, the same words do mean something differently in the two sentence ­­ in the two sections. Physical force means one thing for this purpose; the other for the other. I'm not saying I would do that. I just say if that happened.",
  "And if that happened, and you defined the physical force in the misdemeanor section as much broader, would in fact there be a consequence for anyone, other than not being able to carry a gun? I just want to have every possible consequence in my mind.",
  "No, no. It's different definitions for the same word in the two provisions. And that's what I want to be absolutely sure; there is no consequence other than the fact that he would not be able to carry a gun.",
  "Yes. There would be a penalty, but would it be an enhanced penalty?",
  "It wouldn't be the extra 15 years you would get for violent felonies.",
  "When you come back, I'd appreciate your thinking about this, but obviously, you're asking us to overturn a case that's been the law for 35 years. I count hundreds of citations in the opinion, and I guess there are millions of instances in which employees and employers and others have relied on it in collective bargaining, so I'd appreciate your saying sentence a or two of why we should upset reasonable expectations over so long a period of time.",
  "The question you're being asked, I think, is a broader question. Collective bargaining with any employer, meat packers, hours, safety depends on hours, always can involve public interest questions.",
  "But I think the question you're being asked is where you have SEIU or AFSCME, and they're government unions, does it have a bigger mix of public policy issues; and therefore, should this Court get into the business ­­ I'm putting it in a little loaded way because I don't want to suggest the answer. Should this Court make that distinction and get into the business of saying, when the union is too much of a ­­ wages, hours, and working conditions are too likely to affect public issues, and the other ones less likely, et cetera, you see the distinction that the question that was added suggests? Now, I would like you to think about ­­ that's a philosophical question ­­ or a very broad First Amendment question. And I'd like to hear what your answer is and the government's.",
  "I suspect you're going to answer my question, so I want to focus it ­­ and I'm sorry to do this, but I think it's important. All right. I suspect you cannot answer my question about reliance without accepting one of the following three propositions: First, unlike every other employee, government employees have no right to organize. Or, second, they have a right to organize, but they cannot bargain about wages, working conditions and hours, unlike any other, that's the same as the first. Or, third, the courts of the United States are going to fashion, using the First Amendment as their weapon, a new special labor law for government employees. And I'd remind you we have some experience on that in the 1930s, where courts tried to do something analogous. All right. Now, answer my question about reliance.",
  "Why, by the way ­­ I mean, I guess the ones that increase the statute of limitations, do they apply, too? It doesn't say anything about them.",
  "Can I just take exactly your words, and I fill in, instead of \"tolling,\" \"laches\"? So?",
  "Yes, yes, yes. All right. But I mean, now, what you're talking about is custom. You're not talking about language.",
  "Because the language sounds to me like the same. And so then I'm obviously going to ask you if the court ­­ courthouse burns down or fraudulent concealment or ­­ you know, there are dozens of ­­ not dozens, but there are quite a few such doctrines. And why would we apply those and not apply the shortening ones, too.",
  "That's not surprising because, to show laches, you have to show unreasonable delay plus reliance. So normally, it won't be unreasonable within a limitation period, but this is a unique statute. The uniqueness is not in the words, but in the facts. And therefore, the uniqueness is that it's rolling. And as long as you have a movie that's going to make money over 30 years, in year 33, they bring an action against something that didn't happen till year 30. So when the government comes in and says, oh, we'll just allow it as a defense ­­ you know, to law but not to injunction, law here has the same effect as an injunction. If you just leave it up to the legal part, they can bring whenever they want, as long as the movie is still making money. And therefore, it has exactly the same effect to let them ­­ they say, oh, you can't recover ­­ I mean, you can recover under law, you just can't have an injunction. Who in their right mind would go ahead and make this year after year, if a huge amount of money is going to be paid to this copyright owner who delayed for 30 years and didn't even seem to own it?",
  "I understand the words. My specific question is, in the copyright area, as here ­­",
  "­­ once you have given them the right to apply laches to an injunction, you have given them precisely nothing because exactly the same thing will happen to them once you bring 15 legal actions, as if you gave them the injunction. And if there is a difference there, I haven't been able to think of it yet. So ­­ so I don't really understand the government's position in terms of the practice.",
  "You still haven't answered my question ­­",
  "­­ which comes to the same thing. You're giving me legal arguments. You may be right in that. I'll look into that. But I'm saying, in practice, no one in his right mind could go and continue to produce this movie when every penny is going to have to go to the copyright owner ­­ not every penny that they spent, but every penny of profit. And ­­ and who's going to do it? Because, every three years, they face a lawsuit.",
  "I take it, in the example that Justice Ginsburg gave, your position ­­ tell me if I'm wrong ­­ is, of course, the defense laches in principle applies, but the defendant will lose because the plaintiff did not wait an unreasonably long time.",
  "She waited a reasonably long time, for the reason that Justice Ginsburg gave.",
  "I thought you might agree.",
  "What about this: In J.L., the Court made quite a point of saying, \"An accurate description of a subject's readily observable location is reliable in a limited ­­ limited sense, namely, identifying the person. Such a tip, however, does not show that the tipster has knowledge of concealed criminal activity.\"",
  "All right. Not concealed here.",
  "So that's an obvious difference. I mean, one case, it was concealed; this case, it isn't concealed. What do you say?",
  "Didn't ­­ didn't the tip here have something to do with his driving around in a wild way ­­ or at least an unusual way? I'm not sure I would have followed him, if it had been me. Anyway, you see the point.",
  "But ­­ that's why I asked you, and I pressed the point a little bit, because in the beginning of your brief, it says that the anonymous tip, what did you say, indicated that a Ford F­150 pickup truck had run someone off the road.",
  "Now, maybe you do have to be known specially whether the person's drunk or not, but you don't have to have some special knowledge of anything concealed to know if somebody has run somebody off the road.",
  "Even if the person weren't drunk, I think it's illegal to run someone else off the road.",
  "No.",
  "My question ­­",
  "Yes. But you're just saying ­­ I mean, but his basic point is, on the other side, is these are all variations of the famous white horse defense. You don't know the ­­ the white horse defense? Your Honor, my client was innocent because, at the time of the crime, he was in Yugoslavia wearing a white horse ­­ riding a white horse. And to prove it, I have the horse here in court. You see? I mean, you can't ­­ it's bootstrapping to put it more succinctly. All you know is that somebody came in and quoted ­­ and said there was a crime. And that's all you know. And now ­­ now when ­­ when are instances where no more than the report that it's a crime, that's reasonable suspicion. That's ­­ give me some other instances where the courts have upheld, well, that's enough.",
  "I'm not saying common sense. I'm saying what the courts have held. Sorry.",
  "Not a bare­­, a description that a crime is occurring, where has ­­ that's all, I mean, and ­­ and then we have a question of, well, is it in the one category or the other? Because what we have here, someone phones in and says, a crime is occurring. And ­­ and we know, we've corroborated the following. If a crime was occurring, he was in a position to know because he can define ­­ he can talk about the white horse, or he can talk about the car.",
  "I don't know if we have to get into the drunk driving. It's 3 miles south of the Humboldt County border on ­­ do you know the answer to this? Is it in the record? I mean, on many sections of that road, in Mendocino County, you drive someone off the road, they are dead. I mean, there are sheer drops, and so I just wonder, if I look that up here, what's the situation where this supposedly took place?",
  "Language matters in a statute. I mean, I do believe that. And here, the relevant language seems to me ­­ what is material to the government says ­­ is the statute about selling or delivering? Now, did this person ­­ was he the buyer, your client? Was he somebody that they sold or delivered it to? Well, he's a straw. A straw purchaser is someone who doesn't purchase. The person who purchases is the person who uses the straw. Now, you can't say that about a giver, a benefactor is ­­ the person who's the beneficiary of the benefactor is not the purchaser. But the straw purchaser is not the purchaser. And it comes from \"straw bail,\" where someone else put up the bail, and it was called straw because the people who made a career of that used to wear straw in their shoes. Interesting.",
  "But in terms of ­­ in terms of this case, the straw ­­",
  "No, I didn't. I thought it came from the Wizard of Oz, but it doesn't ­­",
  "The fact is that is where it comes from. I think, in every legal context, it means someone who is not the real. So who is the real? In this case, it is the person for whom the straw purchased. So we fit that within the language. We can't fit the beneficiary of a gift within the language and that's the reason for the distinction, and so why not do it that way?",
  "That's awfully broad. It isn't the language, his point is I think that the statute, it has to be material to the lawfulness of the sale. Now, we look to see what section is it material to, and you say in your brief it's material to the section that says ­­ you have two of them, but they come to the same thing ­­ selling or delivering any firearm to any person. All right. Now, he says did they sell or deliver this firearm to what you call the real purchaser. No. They sold or delivered it to the straw, and that's the end of the matter. And at least the statute is open to this interpretation, and it's a criminal statute. And besides, the ATF for a long time interpreted it that way. So what we should do is interpret it strictly. Now, that's I think the basis of their argument if I understand it. And so you have to get those words \"sale\" and \"deliver\" and explain how in a criminal statute they apply to what you're calling the real purchaser.",
  "But you also quote \"material,\" the need for it to be material to the lawful ness of the sale.",
  "You seem to concede that in the brief. It has to be material, and there are two sections and both come to the same thing, which is what I said.",
  "If he was ­­ if he then ­­ if he is the actual purchaser, then he falls within the term of a person to whom the firearm was sold or delivered. That's your argument.",
  "Oh, there's no question about that.",
  "Yeah, but still ­­ look, what I thought was a very good argument on your side is exactly what I said. The narrow interpretation would also apply to a straw man who buys a gun for Al Capone. And so this ­­ this part of the statute would be virtually worthless. Their response to that is don't worry about that. There are plenty of other provisions that will take care of that. Are there? And if it's so obvious about the Al Capone, why did the ATF decide it their way for 20 years? I mean, how ­­ how did they get into that?",
  "But it's going to be the same problem, which is the straw because the transferee, in context, probably refers to the person to whom the dealer transferred the weapon; namely, the buyer. And does it apply, for example, if he knows that the buyer is going to give the ­­ the weapon to another person? And you will say no. Then he's not the transferee, the other person. You admit that. You say it. And so why is the person to whom ­­ the one who puts up the cash is going to later transfer the weapon is the same question as to whether he is really the purchaser. I just don't see a difference. And, therefore, I thought ­­ but you can explain to me why there's a difference. I'd like to know that. And I guess I'd like to bring you back to the ­­ to that issue and ­­ and I'd just like to know how the ATF reached the contrary conclusion if it would so undermine the statute.",
  "Then what about the donee?",
  "But the other purpose that they said this provision has is to get gun dealers to run checks. And you can't run a check if the name isn't there.",
  "Yes. But the other problem ­­ we're back to the language. The ­­ there ­­ they say your client ­­ you know, falls within the language and you say he doesn't. Is it ­­ all right. Forget it.",
  "Well, what's the answer, though, to the problem, forgetting this case? There's a problem in child pornography cases. Congress clearly wants restitution. Makes sense to me. But if a thousand people look at it, then each one can say, but I didn't cause more than a tiny fraction at most, and so there virtually is no restitution; right? Now, every one of the thousand says that, truthfully, and so therefore the victim gets no restitution ­­ opposite of what Congress wanted. But their answer in the lower court was, we'll make each one of those thousand liable for the whole thing. The government's answer is aggregate cause. It's called a concept that they've sort of created, but it's there to answer the problem. What's your answer to the problem?",
  "Yeah, it is.",
  "All right. All right. I suppose that it does. If you have the same problem, you have the same problem. Where there ­­ you understand. So how ­­ how do we answer this problem? And the difficulty of saying ­­ dividing ­­ the government doesn't find a thousand ­­ you know, it only finds two or three. And so you're going to be 997 who escape. And those three, what should they pay? What ­­ should they pay nothing? Should they pay the whole thing? Should we do it somewhere in­between? How ­­ just restating the problem and ­­ and you have experience in this field. So what do you really think?",
  "Can we with ease say, look, it's very complicated. I can think of some answers, but they're too complicated for me to tell you what they are. And Justice Scalia has a possible answer. Justice Alito, it seemed to me, is pointing out that the second person to look at the thing, if they're only two, probably adds a lot of damage, but the 1000th person compared to 999 is near zero. Now, do we count this defendant as Number 2 or do we count him as Number 1000? Very hard to answer, no answer, really. But can we say, we can't answer how you do this in practice. Leave it to the sentencing commission. That's their job. Now, can we say that?",
  "Yes.",
  "But can we say ­­ can we suggest that the sentencing commission ­­ you can't order them to do it, of course not. But can we suggest that this is the kind of problem, very difficult, technically several ways to do it, that they can go into this. Is that true, that they could go into it and recommend or perhaps order?",
  "Why? I mean, the person didn't cause the full amount. I mean, do you think Congress didn't intend ­­ do they want to have people pay for injury they didn't cause?",
  "Well, if you think he caused the full amount, fine. But, I mean, immediately, you'll say at least they have four other people that they prosecuted for this, and those people caused it just as much, and so let's divide it by five.",
  "So ­­ so contributed, also, a person who didn't have a picture of her, but watched other victims.",
  "That person contributed to her, too, because it creates a market for the entire situation. So some limiting principle has to come into play, and the limiting principle that I think people are driving at is, because there's a terrible crime, we don't convict the person who didn't do it, all right? And similarly, because this is a terrible crime, you don't require a person to pay what he didn't cause. Now, that's sort of a principle going on. Now, if you accept that, at least hypothetically, can you give any answer ­­ I'm afraid you can't and you're going to say ­­",
  "But answer to what seems to be bothering me and a lot of others is, okay, let's accept the notion of cause, but what is a ­­ this is called restitution ­­",
  "­­ it isn't called fines. And so, given that, what ­­ how do you do it? How do you distinguish, so she gets some reasonable amount? How do you do it that you're ­­ I can think of ­­ we've had about four different suggestions here. But what's your opinion, if you lose on the first? What's the best way to do it? That's what I think people are struggling for ­­ with.",
  "That's what I suspected you would say.",
  "Well, what about doing ­­ what you'd say is make the department, you can find out figures, you could find out from figures what's the likelihood that X number of people will be caught. And say it's 3 out of 1,000. Then what you do is you divide by three. I mean, that way, everybody would be treated fairly, and moreover, the victim would at least have a shot at getting ­­",
  "And how many ­­ how many are going to get caught and convicted?",
  "Well, you can find out. There's no ­­ it's not an impossible question for people to come in and use the numbers and figure it out. My guess would be a very tiny percent.",
  "All right. Fine. Then she's going to get a lot of her ­­ then she's going to get from each one a pretty good share, only ­­",
  "How does the ­­ this differ? I mean, there are many statutes, I believe, particularly in the regulatory area, where Congress passes a statute that tells the agency, do A, B, C and D. And then it turns out, since there's so many of the regulated things, that it just doesn't make sense to apply A, B and C and D to all of them. So often I would think courts read in an exception where it makes no sense. For example, if there were a statute that said you have to throw out all bubble gum that's been around for more than a month. Well, what about bubble gum used in a display case that nobody ever intends to eat? You see? And so what we do all the time is we say, well, it doesn't mean to apply to that. Now, why can't we take the same approach or EPA takes the same approach here? It says 250 tons or more and we apply that all over the place, except it doesn't make sense here, so we read an exception into it, unwritten, for places where it makes no sense?",
  "So in your opinion ­­ is ­­ I'm not sure what the statutory cite is to the provision you are talking about. Is it 7411?",
  "All right. So you're saying they could use 7411(a) and (b) to get to just the same place they are today.",
  "You don't see an objection. There must be some reason they didn't do that.",
  "They are doing it? Well, then I don't know what this case is about. I mean, it's a question of whether they do exactly the same thing under one provision or another provision. And you agree with them that they could do it under the other one and we'd end up at exactly the same place.",
  "It says, \"such standards with such modifications as he deems appropriate.\" That's the language of 7411(b).",
  "Okay. So if this is the right program, why couldn't they copy it word for word into the rules and just put a different section number at the bottom? I know you'd have a preferred way to do it, but if they disagreed with you and they think this is the perfect program, why can't they do it?",
  "But that's a difficult ­­ I think where Justice Kagan is going ­­ and I will if she wasn't, but I think she was ­­ is put the definition from 7479 in your mind. That means something to you, right? You know what I'm talking about.",
  "Of the major emitting facility.",
  "Okay. Now, we look at 7475, and it says you have to have a permit and use Best Available Control Technology. For what? And then we go to the definition, and it says, among other things, \"For any source with the potential to emit 250 tons per year or more of any pollutant.\" Now, that doesn't ­­ my God, that maybe means every 500 people, every school is applied here. So you say we've got to do something about this statute because they don't really mean to every football game they're going to have a permit, or it doesn't mean every 500 people, like all of my relatives are together, they have to have a permit. No, it can't mean that. So we have two choices. Choice A, which is what you would like, is it means any air pollutant, any regulated air pollutant, but not greenhouse gases. Okay. That's choice one. Choice two is it means any air pollutant including greenhouse gases, but implicitly EPA has the authority to exempt small emitters. You see? Now, which does the less violence to the statute?",
  "I knew you would say that.",
  "All right. So let me modify my question. I get that answer on the language there. But if you had been sitting in Congress and the Senate, Mr. Billings, I think, is the staff person, Senator Muskie, and suppose that you had this choice put to you with your language. We'd either like to have the authority implicit here to exempt the football team, the tiny emitters, or we'd like it not to cover it at all. Which do you think the Senate would have chosen in enacting this bill from the evidence in the language itself, in the evidence which I look at, the history of the bill?",
  "All right. If you can narrow it, why not narrow that one? Any air pollutant, including greenhouse gases, to the extent that they can be sensibly controlled under this statute. Now I've worked with the words \"air pollutant.\" You see, I can do it any way you want if I'm prepared to read in exceptions. And, of course, we do have exceptions when agencies enforce statutes. We do have exceptions from general language all the time.",
  "It can, though. It can in large quality ­­ quantities. I mean, you don't see anything wrong with large quantities. It's just the small quantities you have a problem with.",
  "I mean, are you saying it doesn't make sense to control major emitters of CO2?",
  "But then they'll ­­ then they'll be back down to ­­ to 41,000 people fully within this. And when you get to Number 5, Title V, 6.1 million, that sort of changes what ­­ I mean, if that's the question, does, in fact, this provision give the EPA the ­­ the obligation to impose permit requirements on 41,000 businesses of a size that really are ­­ constitute, at most, 10 or 15 percent of the problem, well, that's ­­ that's pretty hard to accept.",
  "What I thought the question was, was whether EPA had the authority to implement this in a way that EPA itself thinks makes sense, which might be, on their own reasoning, to not impose permitting requirements on tens of thousands, perhaps millions of small businesses. I thought that was what the question was. That did seem to be the way they put it.",
  "Are they going to get some new standards? But are these ­­ but the words they used in their opinion were streamlining.",
  "The words they used in their opinion implied to me when I read them that they're never going to want to put tiny boilers under this because it just doesn't do very much good and it's expensive to administer. That's how I read it.",
  "All right. Then my question is back, because you've been ­­ this has been very helpful. I learned I'm not a net emitter of carbon dioxide. Believe me, because that means I'm a part of sustainable development. I thought ­­",
  "All right. So I learned quite a lot from this, and I'd like to learn one more thing, which is, look, 7411, remember what the Chief Justice just said about the 83 percent and the 86 percent. And even if you lose, they still can regulate 83 percent, and if you win, you can regulate 86 percent. And, my goodness, if 7411 is over there letting them do precisely what they want, why do you need this, too? That's the part that I haven't got a clear answer to in my mind.",
  "Well, put those all in. Put those all in. Write ­­ write complicated standards. Write standards that have certain enforcement capacities and abilities. Write standards that require you to get a PSD permit. I mean, what's wrong with all that?",
  "But why? Why does it have to do that? Statutes all the time have implicit exceptions, and not every statute has such exceptions written in words into it. I mean ­­ you know, it's a classic example, one after another. A statute that requires animals to pay 50 percent on the train does not apply to snails. Okay. I mean, that's the most common thing in law. So what's the big problem here that everybody seems to have, except me, just about. I mean, what's the big problem with writing an implicit exception so that you don't regulate tiny little things which no one normally wants to have regulated?",
  "And now, my problem is I will hear from many that what I would ­­ perhaps it isn't a question of what I'd like to do. The question is, what does the law permit? And therefore, it's helpful if you can or others think of similar examples.",
  "All right. And the other is ­­ I mean, this is quite ­­ I see ­­ I've got it focused now. It seems to me in my mind that we have two questions, and I think they were well stated by Justice Scalia, actually. The first is, what is the alternative interpretation that doesn't apply it here? And that would be an interpretation that doesn't put greenhouse gases within this PSD provision at all. And that might be really unthinkable ­­ no, not unthinkable, but have worse consequences than worrying about the interpretation of this trigger provision. So either we have to do the one or the other. Either we have to interpret the trigger provision with flexibility so that there are written exceptions ­­ unwritten exceptions in it, one way or the other, or we have to say you can't do that, and therefore they don't apply to all. Which is worse? Is that a ­­ have I got it right?",
  "Why ­­ two things. One is, you haven't said anything about the Title V problem, which they said was at 6.1 million persons or individuals or, you know, businesses coming into it. So how do you get them out of that one?",
  "It's the same basic point. Okay. Why ­­ and there would be a good reason for this, but the bell that it rang is that agencies have tremendous authority about how they distribute their enforcement resources. They don't have to enforce everything against everything. And that is a basic principle. They have to put their money where it will do the most good. And so why wasn't that ­­ no one's really argued it ­­",
  "I just wondered. It's sort of like the missing ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "In other words, you would be out of it totally, and any citizen could go bring a suit and say where is your permit?",
  "I see.",
  "Can you answer this ­­ could you answer, it just happens, not this case, an ordinary case. Defendants ­­ defendant goes to Mrs. Smith: Mrs. Smith, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you. Wonderful. Let's go to the account, your account, take out $100,000 and give it to me. She does. Now, it turns out he didn't own the bridge. So he owes her $100,000. Judge: Pay her $100,000. Your Honor, I don't have the money with me. In fact, I don't have it at all. But I also gave her my valuable Babe Ruth bat. And I don't have to give her 100,000. After all, she has the bat. Okay? Now, what happens? I mean, variations on that theme come up every day of the week, I imagine. What happens?",
  "Not under your theory. You practice in this area. I want to know what normally happens. This is a variation, I imagine, of a very common theme.",
  "Yes, she did. The bat is on her mantel.",
  "Perfect. And it comes under A, not B?",
  "Wouldn't you say it comes under A, because, after all ­­",
  "­­ if ­­ if he doesn't have the 100,000, does he? So if you're going to say that means the fact that he doesn't have it, that he can't return it, and we're under B, what B says to do is pay $100,000. So you'd end up not being able to read B. It would be incoherent, I think. So it must come under A, not B. I mean, I would have thought so.",
  "They'll read it while ­­ while I make these criticisms, and then they'll show me on the Government's side, I haven't read it correctly. All right. So but in any case, whatever it comes under, we subtract the value of the bat. So why don't we do here just what they do there.",
  "And is that ­­ is that how the courts have run this? I mean, you know, it strikes me as so common that they're supposed to return some money.",
  "And, in fact, they will return the money, but it has to be less the value of something that's already been given to those individuals.",
  "I guess it would be up to the judge.",
  "The judge is not ­­ there for something, and the judge would, in fact, normally, if she sold the bat, take the ­­ take the value at the time she sold it. And there is 90 days he can ask her to sell it. Your Honor, I don't want to sell it. I don't want to sell it. It's a Babe Ruth bat. Very well, madam. I will value it for you. We'll call in an assessor. That's at least one way I would expect it to work, and I don't understand why it doesn't work that very same way here.",
  "No, it doesn't, you just say ­­ look, \"in the case of an offense resulting in the loss of property.\" My poor victim lost $100,000. So that's this case. Return the property, i.e., return the $100,000, okay? That's simple. That's A. But ­­ so the judge says, defendant, return 100. Now, let's try ­­ take B. If return of the 100 is impossible, say because he's broke, then what are you supposed to do? Then pay the greater of the value of the property, which is 100,000 on the date of loss or pay the 100,000 on the date of sentencing. Now, wait. I'm sorry. That makes no sense. If you can't pay the 100,000, then what you have to do is pay the 100,000 or pay the 100,000. I'm sorry. That's why I say that reading it that way to me doesn't make much sense, and therefore, I think this is a case of A; it is a case where he's simply ordered return the 100,000, and there is implicit in that you don't have to return more than she ­­ than you took, and you already gave her the bat. I mean, the bat counts as some kind of a return. We have to value the bat. It doesn't tell us what to do. It's up to the judge.",
  "Oh, yes, yes, yes. It's ­­ you have to give her 100,000. It doesn't say anything about what form it has to take. Our problem is some of it takes the form that isn't cash.",
  "Does it make any difference? I mean, you know, it's odd to read B as applying because it says if you can't pay back the 100,000, you're ­­ now we're in B, and what B tells you to do is pay 100,000. Unless ­­",
  "You know, I mean, that's what it says. And then ­­ and then you have to subtract the amount you already gave, which of course you would have to do anyway.",
  "Return the 100,000.",
  "No, no, forget the bats. It's just $100,000.",
  "­­ quality to this discussion which may not have contributed as much as I hoped.",
  "But the ­­ the ­­ the point is imagine it's all money.",
  "I mean, if it's all money, A applies, that should be the end of it. If you want to apply B, do, but it's a wash.",
  "All right.",
  "If you want to read it that way, it's the same problem. It seemed redundant, not circular. But you don't think it's redundant, okay. Fine.",
  "The same problem is there. You go to 3664, and what happened was it says in 3664: Enter a restitution order, judge. And when you do that, provide for a lump­sum payment or partial payments or at specified intervals, in­kind payments, a combination of payments. It gives a judge a lot of discretion. So I imagine the judge, if he'd already given her back 20,000, would say: Now, defendant, pay her $80,000 more.",
  "Now, the problem here is, instead of giving her the $20,000, he gave her an in­kind payment. You see, he gave her a baseball bat or in this case a house.",
  "And so now our question is how do we value the house, and the statute doesn't tell us. Since that's so, I would have thought ­­ you have a very good point ­­ if, as here, the victim has sold the house already, well, what he got for it? That's the end of that. Unless, of course, it was an unreasonable, fraudulent, or hooked­up sale, which the defendant can point out, and the judge could ­­ what happens if she won't sell the house? She says: I love the bat, I love the house, I'm not selling. Then you say you have 90 days to do it ­­",
  "­­ or you ­­ or let it befall on you what help befalls. And then what you have to do is value the house if she still won't sell it.",
  "And you have to value the bat if she still won't sell it. Do I have that right?",
  "It was not a return.",
  "It's in­kind property they're try to get rid of.",
  "I see.",
  "I think I understand now better than I did what his argument is. I see now why you want to go from A, because there are all kinds of property that could be taken, not just money.",
  "And they say now A is out of it because he wasn't able to return it, so we're in B. And I was saying well, B requires the same thing; and you say that's right. So what's the point? Well, you say but that's how it works for other property, anyway. Now, when we get to B, we get that last phrase, and they want to make like doubly sure that ­­ that if in fact some of the property had already been gone back, it's going to count; and he's saying, well, it did go back. It was in­kind, the baseball bat or the house, and he's saying now, how do we value that? And you say, well, let's value it the same way as we would value in­kind property were there a list ­­ is that right ­­ of 3664? And ­­ and you then go on to say, the simplest thing to do is if they ­­ they should sell it. And then I say, okay, maybe they should, but they don't want to. And then what do we do? And the answer is call in experts like he wants. Now, have I got that right?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Oh, I'm not sure you'd say no part of the property they lost has been returned.",
  "What's been happening is they've got some in­kind return.",
  "That's true.",
  "And when they sell and they get much more money than they otherwise thought from the house, that extra amount also counts, then, in the defendant's favor?",
  "I followed you up through here, I think. You're into B.",
  "He is pointing to little (ii) and you're saying that really is not relevant here because it's cash. None of the property was returned; they gave him a house, not the cash.",
  "Well, right. What they have is the house.",
  "Oh, I see.",
  "And that is if they've sold it before the sentencing.",
  "Well, let's suppose it doesn't and they still have it as of the time of sentencing, then we're over into 3(a). It's an ­­ 3664.",
  "It's an in­kind payment. The judge has discretion as to how to value it. He could say, sell it within 90 days, and we will take that.",
  "Or he could say if you don't want to do that, we call in the assessors.",
  "You're saying because (3)(ii) applies, that when it's transformed into cash prior to the sentencing, then they have received ­­",
  "­­ some part of the money back ­­",
  "­­ and often that will work in favor of the defendant.",
  "Sometimes, as in this case, it won't if the housing market collapses.",
  "Why not? Why not just say, hey, I'll tell you what happened here. They ­­ we gave him a house worth 100,000, and they sold it for a dollar, and they only want to subtract a dollar, the Government. But I will tell you something. I would count that house as an in­kind payment ­­",
  "­­ an in­kind payment, and they were wrong to sell it. And it was worth 100,000, that was totally crooked, their selling it. And therefore, I want you to say, fine, perfectly right subtract $1 under (ii) ­­ (ii), but subtract 99,000 more because of the in­kind payment that was made. Would you say that?",
  "Why?",
  "Well, they do sometimes. I mean ­­",
  "There are a lot of areas of the law where they do. I mean, Holmes thought reasonableness, given undisputed facts, is really a question of law. Probable cause matters are really questions of law, if the facts are undisputed. Cases all over the law, there was a case we had ­­ I had, I saw once, it said, is an Eclectus Parrot a wild bird for purposes of a statute that says wild birds cannot be imported, and the judges there said, Well, is this characteristic factual? Da, da, da. And is this characteristic really ­­ if you really put your mind to it, you'd have to say that was legal; does \"wild\" mean in the country of origin or in the country of import? You know, so you could separate it. But there are many, many areas of the law where judges don't bother to separate the two things. And isn't claim construction like that? I mean, you have a case and the claim constructionist always has in mind what this infringing item might be in respect to the claim, and so the judge is always looking at that and doesn't often separate law and fact. I mean, am I ­­ you know this area better than I do.",
  "Oh, I guarantee.",
  "So I'm thinking that maybe claim construction is like that very often. Factual matters are there, legal matters are there, and judges cannot always separate the one from the other, or even if they could, they don't feel it's worth the effort.",
  "The problem with ­­ the problem is ­­ the one I think that ­­ that really seems to me at the heart of what you have to decide, is it worth saying to the court of appeals start distinguishing between which of the two categories it falls into. Because the statement that you read, most lawyers would agree with that statement as a general principle. And then the question becomes, well, it's work to decide whether this is purely legal or whether it's legal/factual mixed and sometimes it's one and sometimes the other and they are really no key to it exactly. So what you're doing is saying, in an area where there are a lot of the deferential kind and some of the nondeferential kind, we want to say the Federal Circuit and all the district courts have to stop and figure that thing out, while the other side says, look, just leave it to the district court and tell them to review. Theirs is simpler. What do you say?",
  "I see that. But, look, what you listed in your brief on page 17, which I think was nonexclusive: Willful infringement, litigation misconduct, inequitable conduct by the patentee in securing the patent, vexatious or unjustified litigation, bad faith, the assertion of frivolous claims and defenses. And then you cite cases which say all of those in different instances have been sufficient, either alone or together. Well, why don't we just copy that? Isn't that your view?",
  "All right. Do you want to add to that list, or to subtract?",
  "You don't think it. Where it comes from, which maybe you don't want to say, is the Senate report on the bill, that is similar to this one enacted in 1946. Still, there are some of us who think that's a highly relevant consideration.",
  "Why does it always have to be objectively baseless? I mean, I've read enough cases in this area to be able to approach it as a district court judge who's not expert. I patent the following: For a computer, enter somebody's name; ask phone number, and they'll give you the phone number if you put in the right city. That puts some lists in the computer. They can patent that? Well, you add a couple of things, and then, apparently, you can have an argument that they can patent it. Okay? Because it'll be very abstract language. It will be able to patent almost anything. No, you can't finally, but objectively baseless? Patent attorneys are very brilliant at figuring out just how to do this. So we're never going to have attorneys' fees in a suit if that's your standard.",
  "But you could couple that with just barely over the line. What line? This vague line, no one knows what it is. In addition, all they did was say, We don't want to go to court and cost you $2 million. Please send us a check for 1,000, we'll license it for you. They do that to 40,000 people, and when somebody challenges it and goes to court, it costs them about 2 million because every discovery in sight. Okay? You see where I'm going?",
  "And so I do not see why you couldn't have an exceptional case where attorneys' fees should be shifted. But if I'm honest about it, I cannot say it's objectively baseless. I can just say it's pretty close to whatever that line is, which I can't describe and look at all this other stuff. Are you going to say that I can't shift?",
  "No, no, but I’m ­­ of course, it may be a small slice of litigation, but it is a slice that costs a lot of people a lot of money.",
  "And so I would like to know if I do run across that small slice why cannot I, the district judge, say, I've see all these things, taken together they spell serious injustice, and therefore, I'm shifting the fees. Okay? Why can I not do that even though, as I've just said and repeat, I cannot in honesty say it's frivolous given the standards for patenting that seem to be administered?",
  "Not nothing there. It's highly abstract language. I gather you, like I, have read some of these claims. They are very hard to understand and when you get to the bottom of it, the abstract nature of the language, plus the fact that it has something to do with computer input, plus the fact that, you know, you suspect very strongly it's baseless, but you really don't like to say something that isn't true and you can say, well, I could see how somebody might think there was something to this claim, just in that tone of voice, which you can't write down that tone of voice. You see?",
  "Yes. You see the problem. I don't see why it shouldn't be ­­",
  "Well, let's send it back and tell them that they were imposing a standard that was too narrow, that was ­­ didn't take count of all the circumstances where something could be unusually ­­",
  "­­ unjust, and then let them, no clear and convincing, but it's up to you, district judge. You're the expert on litigation. You decide.",
  "That's true, but you could then appeal. I mean, you're making an argument on the merits there. And really the question is, is who's better suited to figure out whether this is a ­­ whether this is a really special case. And if, you know, of course, you're right. Plaintiffs are often right in these things, and sometimes they are wrong. So ­­ and they costs everybody a lot of money. So you go to the Federal Circuit and ask them to review it for an abuse of discretion.",
  "Yeah, but the ­­ the difficulty here, I not ­­ see it from my point of view for a second. Of course I think that ­­ that there's no plaintiff/defendant necessary difference of who can act badly.",
  "All right. And ­­ and so the question is really who is likely most to know. And I think probably the district court. But then if you give the power to the district court, there's a problem, of course, that you'll abuse it. So I say, Well, then go to the Federal Circuit, and say they have. You see, well, there's another way of approaching it, and that is have definite standards, which is what you want. And then the difficulty with definite standards is I can't think of a set of definite standards that doesn't do what you don't want to have happen, that it leans one way or the other. I mean, it looks as if, you see, the Federal Circuit's current standards leaned pretty much against the person who was sued. And it looks like the ­­ the ­­ and so the government comes up, well, we can't do better than this. It's a long list. And ­­ and nobody's been able to think of some, so then I say, Okay, let's try the first approach, which is what we do with the Lanham Act. That's the whole long story. And what you would like to say, I'd like to listen.",
  "Is that what you want? That is, I go back to Justice Sotomayor's question. Start monkeying around with 95 percent. It's all over the law. I mean, 95 percent is a classical measure by scientists of when they have confidence that the fact that the regression analysis seems to establish is in fact a fact.",
  "That is in tort law. That is in whether jury trials are ­­ are discriminating because they don't have black people on the jury. It's all over the law. So I assume that we ­­ you're not asking us to muck around with that number because I don't know what the consequences would be. And if you're not, here's how we reduce it. You give the same test six times and now we've reduced it from 5 percent, if he's above 70 all the time, to maybe one ­­ one one­hundredth of one percent. Is that what you want to have happen?",
  "Am I right? Am I right in what I said?",
  "Okay.",
  "No, no. Let's go before the last thing.",
  "I'm not saying it isn't important, but I want ­­ my thinking to the last thing is dependent on my being right on everything before the last thing. So am I right before the last thing, about how 95 percent ­­",
  "So what is wrong ­­ this ­­ there may be agreement among you on this. What the ­­ what Atkins says is there are three parts, as you say. One part is significantly sub­average intellectual functioning. That's the first part. And so what you say is, if it's above a 70 on an IQ test, or a couple of them, that's the end of it. We don't go further. All right. What they say is, I want to tell the jury something, or the judge if the judge is deciding it: \"Judge, I have an expert here. Thank you.\" Expert: \"I want to tell you, Your Honor, that that number 70 is subject to error.\" It could be ­­ and indeed the State can do the same thing. If it's 68, the number 68 is subject to error. So if somebody measures 68 you could bring in the witness, and you would say 5 percent of the time, it's within 5 points either way. I think that's all they want to do. Now, there could be other ways of going about it, and maybe you would give the same test six times with different questions, and that may not eliminate but it might reduce the possibility of error, or there may be some other way to do it. You call in a psychiatrist and he says okay; or an expert: 72, he's still. We have other ways. We have other ways, not just tests. Now, I think you would do the same thing if you wanted to, on the down side, I guess. And that might lead people not to ­­ to being executed. You see? And that's their position, though, I think. And they get to do it on the upside. All right, what's wrong with that? It doesn't sound so terrible. And anyway, the Eighth Amendment ­­ this is a way of enforcing the Eighth Amendment. This doesn't need to be, I don't think, an independent Eighth Amendment violation. But go ahead; that's the kind of question I would love to have some ­­",
  "It doesn't raise the limit to 75. What it does is it says just what I said, and I don't want to repeat it. When it's there at 70, they call their expert, who informs the decisionmaker just what I said. Now, that would take a little time, maybe 15 minutes, maybe a little longer. But that's what they want to do, I think. And ­­ and why not? I mean, what is so terrible about doing it?",

  "Because?",
  "Can you ­­",
  "What happens if right now, today, under the law of Florida a similar case and there is an IQ score of 71, and the prosecutor points out to the judge that that's higher than 70. And the defense lawyer says: Your Honor, I would like to bring in my test expert here who will explain to you that, even though this test did show 71, there is some fairly small but significant probability of error, and it could in fact be as high as 76, and he would like to explain to you that that's the situation. And therefore, can I have him testify. Does the judge have to let him testify or not?",

Your second question you raised, which I think is a very good question, why didn't they shoot the tires out? And my answer to that is I don't know. I don't know.

It comes up every so often. But am I right in thinking so far, there just hasn't been a case on it? There hasn't been an effort to do that.

And the other side says: Well, what we think it's fair; we don't think the treaty covers this. Now, what we have here is a common issue. So we don't have to decide, to judge who's right. We've just noticed it was common issue. And so they make their case, at least prima facie, that they have a side and the other side will rebut it on the merits. Well, similarly, here, they're saying: We don't have to show that the markets incorporate every piece of information. We think they incorporate this information, and it’s a general rule, they do incorporate most information. The other side wants to show they didn't incorporate this. That's fine. It's a common issue. We'll decide it at the trial. All we're trying to say is, is it a common issue, and it's not a red herring to throw in whether the markets incorporate information because normally they do, period. Now, what's wrong with what I said?",
  "What happens if the ­­ if the plaintiffs say, Your Honor, I have 5,000 people here, all of whom bought the stock on the New York Stock Exchange between March 15 and April 15, and as far as people who had other kinds of reliance, we'll bring a separate case about them later. But everybody in this case bought on the New York Stock Exchange and our theory of this case is that the stock exchange did absorb the information and the price went up and then went down. Now, what ­­ what reason is there for purposes of certification to go beyond the efficient market? Is it good enough? I mean, why not? They all bought on the exchange. It's not an irrelevancy. Everybody would have to say it's certainly relevant to the case and they all have the issue in common.",
  "Why go into the event study? Why?",
  "Of course that's true. Indeed, that's the defense. The defense is, well, Your Honor, here it didn't. And the plaintiffs say, you're right; we think it did, but if he's right and it didn't, he wins. But you have to concede if they're right, you win. So why is that ­­ I don't understand why that is an appropriate issue. I can ­­ I don't understand still. Maybe it's the same. Why is that an appropriate issue at the certification stage?",
  "I ­­ I see that and I understand that. But that still strikes me as a different legal issue, and your answer is, well, we decide other things at the class certification stage. Now, I might put in parentheses: Which don't belong there. So if ­­ why are we deciding any of ­­ why, in other words? I still have my question, why?",
  "Yes, that's ­­ that's what's nagging at me that I don't fully understand. It may be elementary, but if we had a case where all the plaintiffs had, in fact, and every one in the class had bought on the New York Stock Exchange at such and such a period, then I guess in principle neither would be appropriate for the classification stage ­­ certification stage.",
  "Neither would be appropriate for the certification stage. You wouldn't have to prove efficient markets; all you would have to do is allege them; because, after all, if they do exist then the reliance element is proved subject to rebuttal; and if the rebuttal wins, it's not. And that's not a question if it's all in common, it's all in common. That's ­­ that's the conceptual point I haven't quite understood.",
  "Why not?",
  "If we had a class, they all conceded that they bought it on the market at the same time, had no information, then it would go to the later stage?",
  "What is to prevent now a defendant from going in after the efficient market is shown, and saying, well, we have our event study; and our event study shows that this particular piece of information had no impact, and therefore they are not going to be able to prove reliance by just relying upon efficient markets; and therefore don't certify the class. Why couldn't you do that right now under Basic?",
  "Well, is there anything ­­ is there any court that said, no, you can't do that; we forbid you even though it says in Basic that you're allowed to rebut?",
  "You don't? Because I suppose one reason I thought you might want to do it is because in (d) there are a list of, \"the following property may be exempted,\" and then we have 12 items. And the first item, number one, the debtor's aggregate interest; two, the debtor's interest in the motor vehicle; three, the debtor's interest in furnishings; four, the debtor's interest in jewelry; five, the debtor's interest in 1225; six, the debtor's aggregate interest in; seven, et cetera, life insurance owned by the debtor; eight, the debtor's interest; nine, prescribed health. You know, I can go through those.",
  "And then we get to number 12. And Number 12, oddly enough, just says retirement funds.",
  "It doesn't say anything about the debtor. And moreover, it has four paragraphs earlier in which it describes retirement funds in which it says nothing about the debtor. And then there are three paragraphs prior to that in which, once again, we're talking about State exemptions, we talk about the debtor's interest in real property, et cetera, and then we say retirement funds.",
  "So I guess that's the reason you didn't want to say it means the debtor's retirement funds.",
  "No, I see your argument here. I ­­ I just thought there is no easy answer, one way or the other, because this is a case where common sense, frankly, in my case doesn't get me anywhere, and that's why ­­",
  "And I sort of looked at the statute and the statute kept talking about the debtor's interest in everything else and then we get to this one, it says retirement funds.",
  "So I thought it means retirement funds.",
  "You don't have to, on my account, go into this, because I was just giving that as an example of why I find this not an easy case. I don't see an easy answer to it. That's all. I ­­ I understand your point and that's why you're making a different point of what retirement funds are.",
  "Oh, no, but they were.",
  "And so a retirement fund is a fund that was set aside for retirement. At some point in time, someone set aside for retirement. Now the question is, they were set aside for retirement and no one denies that and so ­­",
  "­­ do they change their nature because a different person now owns the fund?",
  "Now, if you were talking about pearl earrings, you would say they stay pearl earrings no matter who retains it. If you say retirement funds, you say, but they were retirement funds. When did they change their nature? And at that point you have to make your argument, which I think is a more ­­ is complicated, but perhaps I understand and he makes his argument and says, let's keep this simple. They were retirement funds, period, okay? And that ­­ that's where I am, if you want to know. I mean, that's ­­ I have to figure it out.",
  "The problem, I mean basically, is that you're not going to make us go into subjective intent. You don't want us to.",
  "That leaves somebody out. I'm never going to retire says X, but when I'm 70­ 1/2 I'm going to take that money out of there and buy my own airplane.",
  "Okay. That's beside the point.",
  "While the daughter who inherited thinks this is fabulous, I'm going to keep it through my retirement, at least I'll be able to ­­ that's out of the question. Okay. Once you put that aside, then you're falling back on, well, are they the retirement funds of the debtor? And it's pretty hard to do that ­­ that's what the court of appeals did ­­ because of the language of the rest of the statute. And now, once you're past those two points, then where are we? Because now it seems what we are doing is just drawing a line that's somewhat arbitrary. Makes some sense policy­wise, but it just seems like a line that says: Inherited ones, no; not inherited ones, yes.",
  "You have some theory behind that, but how can I do more than that?",
  "I don't think it's arbitrary, either. But I mean the trouble is what is it resting on? If it's not resting on subjective intent, it's not resting on these words refer to the funds of the debtor, what does it rest on?",
  "Not necessarily. I think her point ­­ now, it's been very helpful to me, the argument, but I think that it's a by and large point. You see, by and large the funds in the hands of the original setter­aside of the funds. By and large, they are used for retirement of that person and therefore, they are retirement funds. Not always, but by and large.",
  "And in the hands of the inheriting person, by and large they are not.",
  "And so that's why she thinks the one falls within and the other falls without the phrase \"retirement funds.\"",
  "I just want ­­ before you get to this point, and my question reflects no point of view at all on my behalf. I just ­­ but I took Mr. Clement, one of his points, which I thought was an important one. He says there are some people here who strongly object to helping with abortions which include abortifacient contraceptives. Everybody says, yes, they do object to that and that's sincere. So he's not saying this, but I might. But there is a compelling interest in women's health and in the health of the family, and they're not having a religious objection to taking it. And so the government has said provide it. Then he says, but there is a less restrictive way, and the less restrictive way is the government pays for it. Says it wouldn't cost much. You'd have to have another piece of paper that would go to the insurance company that would say, insofar as your employer has a sincere objection against paying this, the government will pay for it. Now, what I want to hear, and this is not coming from any point of view, I want to hear your precise answer to that kind of argument.",
  "I'm not interested in whether they made the argument sooner or later. What I want to hear from you is I want to hear ­­ and it's not ­­ you've thought about this. I want to hear your answer to that kind of argument.",
  "I want to be sure you have a chance to give it.",
  "Still, I want to get ­­ press this a little further, and I don't want you simply to just agree with what I'm about to say.",
  "No, I mean ­­ I mean, after all, somebody, a taxpayer, might say, \"I don't want to pay for this small war.\" And it would be a religious ground, and it would be very, very little money, in fact, that you take from him. Or the church might say, \"I want a Sunday morning reduction in the cost of municipal parking.\" And by the way, that will not only not cost the government anything, they'll make money because nobody parks there on Sunday, particularly with this high a fee. Now, I'm thinking of ­­ I'm trying to figure out where this case fits in that spectrum because I think the answer to the first two questions is no. And I know, so you're just going to agree, and that's what I don't want. I want to understand your thinking on that.",
  "I mean, the point that Justice Alito was making is that ­­ take five Jewish or Muslim butchers and what you're saying to them is if they choose to work under the corporate form, which is viewed universally, you have to give up on that form the Freedom of Exercise Clause that you'd otherwise have. Now, looked at that way, I don't think it matters whether they call themselves a corporation or whether they call themselves individuals. I mean, I think that's the question you're being asked, and I need to know what your response is to it.",
  "I know that, but the reason that you ­­ the reason I think these questions are being asked, my impression is exactly what Justice Scalia said in respect to a Fourth Amendment case against a police stop. But my impression also is that where you have a First Amendment case and it's not against the policeman, against Secret Service, this Court has not said that. Am I right about that? And the reason that your position, if I am right, is relevant is because I think maybe we shouldn't say that for the first time in a case where the government hasn't even argued it.",
  "Now ­­ and what is the answer to what I just said?",
  "Am I right on part one, and am I right on part two?",
  "Well, we all know you don't need to win on that question. The question is: Should, in your opinion, the Court reach that question. And my hesitation would be that it is one thing to talk about ordinary policemen. It is another thing to talk about First Amendment matters where we are engaged with a kind of special protective force, and certain residences there that make ­­ residences that may make a person hesitate to extend into that area. And so what is the government's view?",
  "We understand that and I think that that's the problem, and I think you're being sort of picked at for this reason in my mind, and I don't know if you have an answer to this. I know everyone understands the importance of guarding the President in this country. Everyone understands the danger. You can't run a risk. At the same time, no one wants a Praetorian Guard that is above the law, and we have examples of history of what happens when you do that. So everyone is looking for some kind of line that permits the protection but denies the Praetorian Guard. And if you have anything to say that we're immersed in details about how to get to that general objective, I would love to hear it from either side.",
  "The question is, what is ­­ there are so many different theories floating in this case that I've had a hard time trying to figure out what you want me to decide ­­ on what theory you want me to decide. Is your allegation that the Secret Service agents were motivated in part by security reasons and in part by bad ­­ what you would say, bad viewpoint reasons? Or is your theory the Secret Service was motivated only by viewpoint and zero by security?",
  "It's the latter. Okay. So then if it is the latter, I think you're hearing the government saying, yes, that is clearly established, that they could not in fact be motivated only by bad viewpoint reasons and zero by security, and therefore, you have stated a claim, if your complaint does say what we both just agreed you wanted to say.",
  "All right. Maybe they didn't and I have to decide that.",
  "Okay. Then I would have to decide is it the case that if the Secret ­­ if the Secret Service was motivated not at all by security and a 100 percent by viewpoint, does that state a claim? Now, we’d running into the Bivens problem, et cetera. But leaving all that out of it, the next question would be, which I haven't heard argued yet, which is why I raised this, what more do you have to do than state a claim? 5 years ago, I would have thought nothing, that if you have an absurd claim, I'm not saying it's absurd, but if it were absurd, a district court could deal with that. They would deal with it by giving you 5 minutes of discovery and then saying hum, or 10 minutes plus summary judgment. Or have you really certified this under Rule 11? Are you kidding? Be careful. Or you know, they have five or six different weapons. Now, that is what you're arguing, I think. But then along comes Iqbal.",
  "Now, it's a long way of focusing you on that question.",
  "You say in your complaint, \"The Defendants claim that Defendant Secret Service agents told Tao and the police defendants that the reason for the Secret Service's request or direction was that they did not want anyone within handgun or explosive range of the President. To the extent the agents, in fact, made such an assertion, the assertion was false, and the Defendant Tao and police defendants knew or should have known that it was false.\" So you think it's false. They think it's true. That's called a dispute of fact. And the normal circumstance is that the judge has various weapons at his disposal, legal weapons, to try to prevent ­­ to try to prevent court's time being wasted, officer's time being wasted and other's time being wasted on factual allegations that are unlikely to be true. That was true before Iqbal as well as after. That's your position, isn't it?",
  "All right. How do you do that? Because I want to follow up on just what the Chief Justice said. Imagine that what he just said is the real case. You have a client, imagine, who's quite sincere, absolutely sincere, and really feels he was very badly treated, and you can sign a Rule 11 statement, but suppose that the facts are just what he said. Then suppose that Iqbal were not the law. Forget Iqbal for the moment. Now, you've got my hypothetical.",
  "All right. What weapons does the district judge have, which I have so blithely been assuming, to prevent a waste of time by the Secret Service, a demoralization of the service leaning in the direction of being overly careful and therefore risking the President. What procedural weapons does the present law, absent Iqbal, give him to dispose of a case quickly without disturbance if the true facts are what the Chief Justice said?",
  "But what about ­­ what about the ­­",
  "Why is that less abstract?",
  "Why is that less abstract? I mean, imagine King Tut sitting in front of the pyramid where all his gold is stored, and he has the habit of giving chits away. Good for the gold, which is given at the end of the day. And he hires a man with an abacus, and when the abacus keeping track sees that he's given away more gold than he is in storage, he says, stop. You see? Or my mother, who used to look at my checkbook, when she saw that, in fact, I had written more checks than I had in the account, she would grab it. Stop. You see? So what is it here that's less abstract that the computer says, stop?",
  "How is that less abstract than King Tut, if we had the same thing with a grain elevator, if we had the same thing with a reservoir of water, if we had the same thing with my checkbook? You see the point.",
  "Methodology is just as you said, stop.",
  "So what we have different here is the computer stops rather than the abacus man stopping or my mother stopping or the guy that the grain elevator has that says stop. So just saying, what ­­ is that it? In other words, if you say, computer stop, you have an invention. Useful add ­­ but if you say, mother stop, you don't?",
  "Of course it's a caricature. It's a caricature designed to suggest that there is an abstract idea here. It's called solvency.",
  "And what you do is you take the idea of solvency and you say apply it. And you say apply it through the computer. Is that enough to make it not just the abstract idea? And now we're at the heart of why I used my exaggerated examples ­­",
  "­­ because you will tell me why ­­",
  "­­ this is enough.",
  "And this is exactly the question I really would like to you to focus on for me. Why is it ­­ and I'm not saying this from a point of view, but it seems to me pretty clear that if what you did was take the idea of solvency ­­ remember King Tut, that’s why I use the exaggeration ­­ and what you say is implemented by having the abacus man keep track and say stop, okay ­­",
  "Then we implement it by having somebody with a pencil and a piece of paper and this is all that they add, you see. Say: Have a man with a pencil and a piece of paper keeping track and saying, stop, or we say, implement it in the computer, which will automatically keep track and say stop, are they all enough? Are some of them enough? What's the rule? And you realize I couldn't figure out much in Prometheus to go beyond what I thought was an obvious case, leaving it up to you and your colleagues to figure out how to go further. Am I making enough ­­ making clear enough what's bothering me? And I'd really like to get your answer to this.",
  "Can you in fact ­­ now, this is ­­ look, there are 42 briefs in this case. I actually read them and I found them very, very helpful up to the point where I have to make a decision, because they're serious. I mean, you know ­­ now, the problem that I came away with is the one that you're beginning to discuss, that if you simply say, take an idea that's abstract and implement it on a computer, there are ­­ you're going to get it much faster, you're going to be able to do many, many things, and if that's good enough, there is a risk that you will take business in the United States or large segments and instead of having competition on price, service and better production methods, we'll have competition on who has the best patent lawyer. You see where I'm going on that one?",
  "And if you go the other way and say never, then what you do is you rule out real inventions with computers.",
  "And so in those 42 briefs, there are a number of suggestions as to how to go between Scylla and Charybdis. Now, I would like to know ­­ I don't know if you can step back from your representational model. That's a problem. But you’re all we have now. And ­­ and from my point of view, I need to know what in your opinion is the best way of sailing between these two serious harms.",
  "It was like ­­ there's a Bloomberg brief out here that was on this, that said, no, you can ­­ you can patent computer software when it's an improvement in the computer, when it's an improvement in software, when it's an improvement in a technology that is developed out of computers like robotics, when it is an improvement in a machine or technology, but you cannot improve it where it is simply an improvement in an activity that is engaged in primarily through mental processes. But what they mean by that is business, finance, and similar arts. That's ­­ I mean, that's ­­ it wasn't quite what ­­ I know. That's what I want to know what you don't agree with about that, because it's a little more refined than you suggested.",
  "But I'm asking you ­­ I'm asking you, what about this one that I just mentioned? You see, I went through those five steps ­­",
  "­­ and four of them you could patent and the fifth one you can't.",
  "Can I ask you at some point, not necessarily this second, to say in my ­­ this is just ­­ you know, you have an opinion for a court. Different judges can have different interpretations. All you're getting is mine, okay? But I think it's pretty easy to say that Archimedes can't just go to a boat builder and say, apply my idea. All right. Everybody agrees with that. But now we try to take that word \"apply\" and give content to it. And what I suspect, in my opinion, Mayo did and Bilski and the other cases is sketch an outer shell of the content, hoping that the experts, you and the other lawyers and the ­­ the circuit court, could fill in a little better than we had done the content of that shell. So, so far you're saying, well, this is close enough to Archimedes saying \"apply it\" that we needn't go further. Now, will you at some point in the next few minutes give me your impression of, if it were necessary to go further, what would the right words or example be?",
  "Yeah, but the trouble with that particular test is, as I think partly the Chief Justice said, how long, et cetera, and then add to that, though you could do it without a computer, what happens at the end of the line is the automobile engine goes off or it begins to sputter or it turns left. You see, it's possible to take Archimedes or King ­­ ­­ you know, I use that example purposely to call attention to the problem. You can take those things, and you're not just saying apply it, and you're not even just saying ­­ you are saying use the computer, but at the end of the road, something physical in the world changes and everybody would say, now, that's ­­ that falls within, I mean, probably, I mean, my hesitation shows I'm looking for the right words.",
  "Could ­­ could ­­ could you go on with that because you were just getting to the point where I think you say a computer improvement that, in fact, leads to an improvement in harvesting cotton is an improvement through a computer of technology, so it qualifies. But then I think you were going to say, or I got this also from the brief, a computer improvement that leads to an improvement in the methods of selling bonds over the telephone is not an improvement in technology reached by the computer. Am I right about the distinction you're making?",
  "What is your view? Yeah, what is ­­ how do we deal with just that problem?",
  "Yes.",
  "We've got that. Yes, yes. We got the computer. But then it doesn't improve the computer, but rather, it improves through the computer the harvesting of cotton. Now you've got it in what you said was your second category, which is an improvement through the computer of a technology. And I thought in your brief you were distinguishing an improvement through the computer of a human activity that is not a technology and, in particular, to pick an example of that, something in finance or something in business. Now, am I right about the distinction you're making?",
  "If I'm not right, what is the distinction?",
  "And how is that justified?",
  "That ­­ that is Judge Dyk in ­­ in Bilski in the Federal circuit, four people sort of picked it up maybe, five didn't pick it up. Would you say a few words about it?",
  "How does it work ­­ how does it work if you have Mr. Crook, Mr. Crook has a bank account at Bank of America, he has $32 in it. He writes a check for 5,000. He sees somebody on the street whom he vaguely knows and says, here, take my check; go to the bank; give me $200 or give me 1,000. Now, he's got the money from Mr. Smith. He didn't obtain money from the bank. It was Mr. Smith who did or did not go into the bank to get the money. Does that fall within the statute?",
  "So this doesn’t fall within the statute at all. In fact ­­ in other words, have we got some cases on that?",
  "No, no. This is not good, but I mean, you know, what you tried ­­ you didn't get the money from the bank. What you did was just write a false check, knowing that in all likelihood the guy you give the check to is going to go right to the bank and get the money. Now, I just wonder is there some authority as to whether that falls within these statutes or not. those kinds of not­sufficient­funds cases. Ordinarily, it goes down somewhat differently, that you've presented the check that you know is going to bounce to a merchant, not to some guy in the street. And the government's theory is that thereby you're obtaining bank property. But most of the cases say that that's not actually bank fraud because you're not intending to deceive a bank. And that's perfectly fine.",
  "It wouldn't matter. Look, I don't think you have to ­­ when you say \"intend,\" \"intend\" can encompass a known but undesired consequence of an intentional act. And so you may not care ­­ you couldn't care less when the money comes from the bank or not, but you know that the bank is likely to pay it.",
  "So therefore, you have the requisite intent. But what I'm trying to figure out here is what's the case law on what should be a very common situation. If you give it to a third party, your fake check, insufficient funds. You just want the money from the third party. But you know the bank is likely to honor it.",
  "All right. Try two ­­",
  "Try two ­­ two different paths here. Path A, he believes that the bank will honor Smith's, his check, when presented by Jones. I got my names mixed up.",
  "Mr. Crook believes that the bank will honor his check when Mr. Smith presents it. And the second is the one Justice Scalia said, is being sophisticated about these matters, Mr. Crook believes that the bank will never own ­­ never, never pay the check when presented by Smith. I just want to know the state of the law on those two situations.",
  "You come back to those general statements, you do have the language of the statutes which favors you this question. But I guess the theory would simply be where Mr. Crook gives him a bad check, to Mr. Smith, he couldn't care less whether Smith presents it to the bank, and he, as far as he's fairly sophisticated, thinks probably Smith won't present it to the bank. He may to an insurance company or something and, therefore, he did not either obtain or try to obtain or believe he would obtain money from the bank.",
  "Whether it's money that the bank itself owns or whether it's money of which the bank has custody. That would seem to me the simplest theory. And I wonder, is that what courts have said?",
  "If I have it right, I just want to be sure, in my Crook case, which you may or may not remember, you're reading the word \"obtained\" to mean whoever knowingly executes a scheme or artifice to obtain. It doesn't mean for him to obtain. It means for anybody to obtain. That's how you read it.",
  "And that has been ­­ and that has been pretty much the universal ­­",
  "Okay, okay, okay. You don't have to argue it. I just wanted to know now ­­",
  "Fine, fine, fine, then is the way you see the statute.",
  "That Mr. Crook goes to Mr. Smith and says, dear Mr. Smith, here is my check for $50,000, knowing he only has $3 in his account. All right. Now, case one is Mr. Smith, not too bright, gives him $500. Now, he might, Mr. Crook, think that Smith will then go and present the check to the bank and maybe get some money. In that case, he has violated this, in your view, because Mr. Smith obtained money from the bank and that was part of Mr. Crook's idea as what was likely to happen whether he'd wanted it to or not.",
  "All right.",
  "There's also Justice Scalia's point which is an important matter to me, and that is that there also is the case when Mr. Crook doesn't know how the banking system works at all and he has no idea that the bank will, in fact, give any money or whether it will give any money. Those are the two cases.",
  "It doesn't need a response. All I want is explanation.",
  "Answer ­­ what's the answer to Justice Sotomayor's question?",
  "Mr.Crook is not too bright and Mr. Crook doesn't even know what a bank is and all he knows is he's can get $500 from this other not­genius Mr. Smith. So he does not care about banks. He doesn't know how they work. He has no idea if they pay or don't pay. What's the result?",
  "I would say that ­­ well, what the problem ­­ but can you give me any example of any case? There may be so many you can't even give me your best one. But trusts have been around for probably 800 years. And can you give me an example of one where a court said a trustee has breached its fiduciary obligation because he failed to use inside information?",
  "You think there is not such a case?",
  "Fine. If there is not such a case, what's the problem? Because what's the rock and the hard place?",
  "The person has an obligation to act prudently in respect to the fiduciaries ­­ to the beneficiaries, of course. But he cannot, irrespective of that, have an obligation to use inside information. End of the matter. What ­­ what's wrong with saying just that?",
  "What I mean by it is just what I said. There is no rule of trust or ERISA law that you can breach a duty to a beneficiary by failing to use inside information, period. I don't know what the SEC's brief is. I'm going to ask ­­",
  "­­ the SG what their opinion is because they don't seem to appear on this brief.",
  "The answer is there's not been a case ever holding the contrary ­­",
  "­­ but you yourself disagree with it.",
  "Now, what the reason you disagree with it?",
  "I'm sorry. I'm saying go back to England. There are many cases where settlors have said what kinds of things you should invest in, and they invest in them. They have inside information that it is a bad investment. Is there any case that says they have a duty of obligation not to do what the settlor says? I wouldn't have been surprised if you had found some cases, but I'm also not surprised that there aren't any. That's why I asked the question.",
  "Here when you say ­­ I am totally with you on this. We walk into the trustee's office. It's like Ralph Nader investigating the FTC years ago. There is someone asleep on the sofa. In his inbox is ten feet of papers telling him about all public ­­ telling him about the corporation's condition. It's apparent he's never read them. If he had read them, he would have taken action. Of course you would have a case, I would think.",
  "But you want to go beyond that?",
  "Not just information. Remember I carefully said all this was publicly available information. You want to say it also applies when it's not publicly available information. Am I right or wrong?",
  "In a way, what happens is that the trustee, knowing that the company has announced an enormous oil strike, is having to sit on a private meeting where three people come in and you say, yeah, there was an oil strike, but it's impossible to get the oil out. Ha, ha, we put one over on that time. Okay.",
  "Now, what's that trustee supposed to do?",
  "No. There's a false.",
  "He alone, when two other people, know that this oil is worthless. The market doesn't. It's totally inside information. What, in your opinion, is he supposed to do?",
  "Okay. So your answer is, totally inside information, he sells, right?",
  "Well, the ­­ the union brief says the thing to do in that situation is, without saying anything, turn the trusteeship over to a person who doesn't have that knowledge. That takes care of the problem. And the reason I raised the question, of course, is there are trillions of dollars probably managed by ERISA funds. I don't know what percentage of those involve stocks. Not this kind ­­ of this kind. Maybe you know, but my guess is a lot. And obviously, before I wrote a word that said what you have to do or don't have to do with inside information, I would like to know directly, not indirectly, what the SEC thinks.",
  "And maybe you can tell me. But the SEC isn't here. And at least there's no SEC lawyer that signed your brief. So I don't know the extent to which that's ­­",
  "It might be you might have a good reason for it.",
  "But right now I am supposed to write some words or join some words.",
  "And those words will tell trustees of possibly ­­ I have no idea ­­ but maybe hundreds of billions, or maybe billions anyway, of ­­ of assets in the stock market, what they're supposed to do when they learn some inside information that affects the company's stock. And I hate to tell you, I don't know anything in this area about what the likely effects are. And, therefore, I'd like to know what they think. And the closest I came to it was the AFL­CIO brief, frankly, where they said what you're supposed to do here is ­­ is turn this over. So what do I do?",
  "But the market will see through that in about two seconds. But the ­­",
  "That isn't really my question. It's a numerical question. What ­­ you know, I was making up numbers wildly. What are the actual numbers? That is, approximately how much in assets is accounted for by ownership of the company's ­­ you know, this kind of a plan where you buy the company's stock. Do you know?",
  "About?",
  "Well, what's the reason ­­ I mean, I read this like Justice Scalia. I thought when you read Rule 69, obtaining discovery, you can obtain it in aid of the judgment or execution as provided in the these rules. So you look to the rule on discovery. It's certainly broad enough to encompass this. I thought, of course, you can get discovery, in an appropriate case, to find out if the judgment creditor or debtor has property in Florida. And the question is: Well, can you do the same thing where the executable property is in France?",
  "And then I think that's the issue, at least as I saw it. And I don't see ­­ well, there are two ­­ three ways of doing it. One, you could just say no. Two, you could say yes, but the State Department has to tell you it won't mix everybody up. Or you could say yes, but the State Department has the right to come in and tell you it will mix everybody up. I mean, those are three possibilities, or you could say let's mix them all up. Are those ­­ those are the four. In other words, the Court can just do it on its own. So ­­ so I see four possibilities. Now, maybe I'm not analyzing it correctly, but that's where I was, starting where Justice Scalia started.",
  "I know. But just to sort of shorten this, I understand there's a statute. The statute says nothing about discovery. The statute does permit you to execute on property within the United States anyway. And it does that under exceptions which are relevant here. For example, on the back of a bond they said, we waive all sovereign immunity. So ­­ so it does allow for execution in the United States. It does, in fact, say nothing about discovery in aid of execution. The rules do. Okay. So I've given you four possibilities that I could see. There may be five or six. Which do you favor? Why?",
  "All right. Suppose I don't ­­ I have exactly the same question. Is the only reason that you cannot ask a New York court for discovery to tell us where in the world there is property upon which we can levy ­­ they don't want to know about property where they can't levy. They don't want to know about property they can't execute, so they're happy to write into that, even if it isn't written, which they think it is, we're only talking about property that we can seize. No other property. Now, you agree that we can go do that in respect to property in California, Florida, and New Mexico. Well, in today's world we want the same information about France, Italy, and Turkey. And by the way, we won't take one penny from those countries except in accordance with the law of those countries, not a penny. We'll get the information, we'll go over and go ask the court. Now, why not?",
  "Well, I didn't find language in the statute that forbids it, but I'll look that up again. If the language is not an absolute barrier, why not?",
  "All right. Let's assume we go back and we say it has to be limited to property that they have a right to obtain to under execution. So we're all agreed between the two of us we're going to do that. Now, why not?",
  "Okay. Okay. I'm interested, though, about Turkey, France and ­­",
  "Right. The word ­­ there are two different ­­ look at the rule. Rule 69 talks in (a) about execution of money judgments. And in (a) it talks about the need to conform to statute. In (b) it talks about obtaining discovery. It doesn't say a word about American statutes. It talks about the rules and statutes of the state, but it uses the word execution. So if you're saying it means execution in the United States and nowhere else, it applies to the private plaintiff just as much as ­­ the private defendant just as much as to the ­­ to the other defendant.",
  "If we need not, then I'm back to my question: Why not allow it with all these qualifications? And the only answer I've heard is from Justice Alito, who says that it would be too complicated to try to figure out all the laws of France and Turkey in relation to execution. Is there anything you want to add to that before you sit down?",
  "Clearinghouse, we're trying to get away from this issue by assuming out of the case the military things, all those lists. Then we're trying to assume out of the case anything that isn't relevant to an asset which you can attach and seize. And now we've got two sets. In the United States everybody agrees they can do it, and then there's a set abroad. We have a statute we passed, a case, Intel, which says that anybody in America can go ­­ you know, the Intel case, anybody can go under 1728 and go ask a trial judge to have the Los Angeles firm issue some discovery and they are going to give that to the EU. We aid their judgments all the time. So what's the principle? What is wrong where it's clear like that with a Court saying, We want to find out if they have a supermarket chain in Sicily?",
  "Could we say no to that and just say, look, here is the difficult question in the case, of course, every subpoena ­­ every subpoena has to have limits, and the limits are typically limits that have to do with the purpose of the subpoena, and where a sovereign is involved, maybe a District Court has to be more careful, but you are indeed searching for information in respect to assets out of the country that you could execute upon? Make that assumption with me for a second.",
  "If you want to fight it later, go right ahead. But I have a question I'm trying to get to, and it is this, on that assumption, and we're only talking about butcher shops in Italy, there's marvelous Argentine beef, it's delicious.",
  "And that's the kind of thing you want to levy on. Okay. Fine. Now, if there were property in the United States and it were against a private person, another private person could get the information. If it was against a sovereign, the private person could get the information. If it's abroad and the shops are in Sicily, a private person can get the information despite the fact that to know about levying, you may have to know a lot about Italian law. Now, if it is a sovereign that you are trying to get the information, the other side is saying that's different. You say, why? Why ­­ I knew you were going to say why. And the answer is going to be because there could be various interferences. We can't even tell you exactly what. But you're talking about every country in the world. Who knows? Now, assume that there is something to their answer. Then where are we legally? We may be back A, before the Tate letter, in which case we could say to the State Department, if you see such a problem, come in and tell us, or we could say to the District Courts, go ask the State Department case by case. If Congress wants to make a rule later, they can, but they haven't yet. Or we could say something else. That's the question ­­ those are the questions that I would like answered.",
  "Can you do this in discovery normally? Can't someone go in and say I don't think ­­ I think the subpoena or this order is too broad. It will do da, da, da. There isn't that much need for it. Please don't do it, judge. And the judge has a lot of discretion to say no.",
  "All right. Now, is there any objection on your part, which there may well be, if we were to say one of the problems here is that this order, although they may have reason for it, is requiring discovery of airplanes, it's requiring discovery of consulates, it's requiring discovery of all of these other things, things that at least presumptively our statutes would not allow them to execute upon. Before you give an order allowing discovery of that kind of thing, judge, you'd better have very good reason for it.",
  "No, I'm not saying that ­­ no. I'm just saying where it is on its face something that couldn't be discovered.",
  "Something that couldn't be executed upon.",
  "Be very, very careful. We do those things, and they are very often ignored, but nonetheless ­­",
  "Why? Why?",
  "Why can't a person say, you know, there are things I want to say politically, and the Constitution says that the State does not have the right to abridge my speech, and I intend to say them. And if I say them, there's a serious risk that I will be had up before a commission and could be fined. What's the harm? I can't speak. That's the harm. Right? So why isn't that end of the matter?",
  "Why shouldn't it be the harm? That is, whatever ­­ has any case said when somebody says, we’re going to take an extreme, you want to speak in a campaign, and we have a law here that if you do we will throw you in jail and you really do want to speak and the law really does prevent you from speaking, why shouldn't that be the end of it?",
  "Well, I'm saying is there a statute ­­ not a statute. Is there a case which says the little syllogism I just went through is not the law of the United States? Now, there may be. That's why I asked the question.",
  "What would you say as a lawyer ­­ you're now a lawyer for the Commission. You understand it better than I. I'm just making up an example. Do you think they'd prosecute this or not? Somebody walks in front of the House of a political opponent has a big sign that says murderer. Now when asked, you said but he voted for legislation that led to the death of many cats. Would they prosecute that or not?",
  "I just want to know your opinion as the lawyer for the Commission, do you think that's going to be prosecuted or not?",
  "Probably not.",
  "But why did they prosecute this here?",
  "I mean, we've heard in other cases, you know, just recently, a very major case, where people really believed about the same thing and they were sincere in their beliefs. So why ­­",
  "I had a reason for asking what sounds like a silly hypothetical, but a possible one. We understand how people take different views on that. And then you have a hard time, it seems to me, distinguishing this case from that one in terms of their exercising their authority. And so at least it must raise a question, a First Amendment question on the merits. It seems pretty serious. So if you lose on this procedural matter, how quickly can you get this decided? I mean, there are elections coming up. People would like to know. They want to know what they're supposed to say. And how long is all this procedural skirmishing going to take, which in and of itself is an obstacle to what they might say in the next election?",
  "I mean, you're saying, well, they don't have standing ­­ you know, I was interested in this field, administrative law, and even my class, despite the scintillation, would sometimes go to sleep when I got to such questions.",
  "So ­­ so I'm saying that these seem to be preliminary questions on a matter in respect to which there seems serious doubt. I'll repeat myself. The elections are coming up. And people have to know what they're supposed to say and what they can say and what they can't. So how do we get this decided?",
  "It is suggesting that. I agree, it is suggesting that.",
  "Well, I would say one of the purposes of standing is to allow people who are really going to be hurt to be able to be heard in court. Well, of course, if they're not going to be hurt, there's no reason. And what the merits discussion is designed to suggest is that there are real people who would really like to speak in an election campaign. And if they feel they can't, they are really being hurt. That's what the other side is arguing. And I've listened to the argument. I'm curious as to the practicalities. If they're right, when is this going to be heard and decided in your opinion?",
  "You tell me how to do it.",
  "I'm saying if you were to lose on the ­­",
  "Yes. But that's why they don't want it.",
  "That isn't the question.",
  "But I'd still like to know the answer to the question, in your opinion. And, of course, if you want a reason, I'll give you my reason. If we take the public performance, maybe we run into what Professor Nimmer saw as a problem. Why isn't what used to be called a phonograph record store that sells phonograph records to 10,000 customers giving a public performance? It seems to fall within that definition. But if it is, there's no ­­ no first sale doctrine and it's a big problem. So we could avoid that problem. Now, that's why I'm very interested in the answer, not just what they want.",
  "Alright, assume that it isn’t our problem. I'm hearing everybody having the same problem, and I will be absolutely prepared, at least for argument's sake, to assume with you that if there were ever anything that should be held to fall within the public performance, this should be. All right? I will assume that. I'm not saying it is. But then the problem is in the words that do that, because we have to write words, are we somehow catching other things that really will change life and shouldn't, such as the cloud? And you said, well, as the government says, don't worry, because that isn't a public performance. And then I read the definition and I don't see how to get out of it.",
  "To the public? You see, separate, at the same time, or at different times? Separate or together? So a thousand people store in the cloud the same thing, as can easily happen, and call it back at varying times of the day.",
  "How do we get out of the Nimmer example? I mean, how do we get out ­­ what words do I write to get out of this, throwing into this clause a music store that distributes via Federal Express, a device, or the U.S. Postal Service or even someone over the counter, distributes to 10,000 people a copy of a record which they then will take and play it? They have, to the same degree, transmitted something that will electronically make a performance of the music. So are they when they sell the record violating the display clause?",
  "Because? Because?",
  "Of course they are. The sounds are received beyond the place. It requires the person to take the record, put it on a machine, and then play it.",
  "Of course there is. And that separate exclusive right has such things as first sale doctrine attached. But if they also flow here, if they ­­ if this covers them, which is why Nimmer wrote the paragraph that was quoted, if this covers it, there is no first sale doctrine, and that has a lot of consequences. I think so. Anyway, if you don't know and you haven't got something right there and you haven't thought about it, you're not going to think about it in two minutes, nor will I.",
  "The answer is very significant. And the reason it's very significant is because what the local antenna person doesn't do but you apparently could do, even if you don't, is with the same kind of device pick up every television signal in the world and send it, almost, and send it into a person's computer. And that sounds so much like what a CATV system does or what a satellite system does that it looks as if somehow you are escaping a constraint that's imposed upon them. That's what disturbs everyone. And then what disturbs me on the other side is I don't understand what the decision for you or against you when I write it is going to do to all kinds of other technologies. I've read the briefs fairly carefully, and I'm still uncertain that I understand it well enough. That isn't your problem, but it might turn out to be.",
  "Would you ­­ would you explain in a sentence or two, which will sound as if I'm favoring with you, but I want them to have a chance to reply, the thing that frightened me somewhat in your brief was, I think, of the cloud storing everybody's music. Vast amounts of music. And now they then send it down, perhaps to a million people at a time, who want to all hear the same song. Now, what you said was, if I understood it, but explain it if it is, that there is a provision of the copyright law that says when that happens, it's subject to a compulsory license. And if it's subject to a compulsory license, then, of course, people can get it and it's paid for by somebody. But if we decide with them, there'd be a different provision that would come into play, namely, the performance, and it wouldn't be subject to the compulsory license. There's no point telling me I'm right if I'm wrong. What I want to know is am I ­­ have I got your argument correctly? And if not, what is it?",
  "It's not my argument. It's a parody perhaps, or an incorrect version of your argument.",
  "All right. So that would be the same then, it isn't going to be a problem.",
  "But it should work out in a parallel way. That is, when I look at the program, I am making a copy of the program and, therefore, I'm violating the nonexclusive right ­­ the exclusive right to copy. Now, if that's fair use and therefore, I can do it, it should also be fair use if exactly the same thing happens but it comes from a cloud.",
  "115(c)(3).",
  "Once you take them out of the compulsory licensing system, they're going to have to find copyright owners, who owns James Agee's pictures? Who owns something that was written by ­­ like a French silent film in 1915? I mean, the problem is that they might want to have perfectly good things that people want to watch and they can't find out how to get permission. That is a problem that worries me and it worries me again once you kick them out of the other systems.",
  "Why is that?",
  "I mean, you can easily imagine circumstances where there's a subpoena, an administrative subpoena issued against Mr. Smith. By the time he comes around to enforcing it, where there's very little reason to enforce it, Mr. Smith is suffering an incurable disease and the district court would say, no, it's oppressive. Right? I mean, I've never heard of this rule that you ­­ a district court would be forbidden to look at the circumstances in which the ­­ a subpoena or any other discovery document is being asked to enforce it now. I mean, where does this rule come from that the district court can't look at the circumstances now?",
  "Very well. Once we say that, they've asked this question on the merits here. They say, why in heaven's name have they issued ­­ why have they asked this enforcement? There are only two possible reasons. One is to get some information in the years 2005, 2007 that would show that they owe more money than you claim they do owe, since you issued a final thing, which would be impossible because the statute of limitations has run. And the other possible reason is that you want to obtain information to put in the tax court proceeding, which, in fact, is supported by the fact that the agents who came to enforce it were tax court lawyers and not the regular lawyers. And, in fact, it would be absolutely illegal under the law ­­ the rules of the tax court. So they said, that's our information. That's why we think this is oppressive. And your response to that is if they're wrong, why do you want this information?",
  "Very good. Then you will explain to me why is it ­­ why is it that the government wants this information? To do what?",
  "My question was: Why do you want the information?",
  "Wait, wait. Now, explain that one to me.",
  "Now, when you say information, isn't the final partnership determination ­­ the final partnership for the years 2005, 2007, is it you want the information to revise that? Is that why you want it?",
  "Yes. So you want the information ­­",
  "I want to know yes or no. What are the reasons you want this information? One is you want to change the number on the final partnership assessment of liability. Is that one of the reasons?",
  "Yes or no, please.",
  "You want ­­ in other words, I want to be quite precise. I've asked the question, do you want the information with the idea in mind that it might show you should change the final number?",
  "Yes. Is there any other reason you want the information?",
  "Okay. Thank you.",
  "Yes. But there's more ­­ that's why ­­ what I don't have clear in my mind is how to write the facts into this. I mean, before we had our previous colloquy, I guess they had no idea why you wanted this information more specifically than you're saying. And then you say, quite truthfully ­­ it only took three seconds ­­ and you said no, we want it because we might want to revise the ­­ the final partnership ­­ final partnership administrative adjustment. And then what perhaps they'll say next ­­ I'm just getting this out of their brief, they’ll say ­­ in your own handbook you say, once that's issued, \"The examination has been concluded and the Service should no longer be in the process of gathering data to support a determination.\" And then they have a whole paragraph full of similar things from the IRS. So they'll read them to you, not you, but the lawyer, and they'll say, well, what was special about this that you decided to have this extra examination? And there'll have to be an answer to that. Well, as a ­­ as a sort of lay person in this area reading that, that sounds like a good set of questions to ask. You'd be interested in what the answer is and they should be able to ask them. Now, am I missing something? Can I say ­­ would I cause some kind of big problem for something or it's ­­ if I were to say in an opinion, look, this is the kind of thing that they want to know, and it sounds as if, since we don't know your side of it, but it sounds as if this is the situation, and they should be able to find out.",
  "No, I think she said it was the possibility. I asked her. If there were others, she didn't",
  "But there will be an argument whether they can or can't.",
  "Well, I mean, if you change it to that, the only reason there that she in her affidavit, the agent, just says she wants the information to help decide the tax liability. She doesn't say anything specific. So you're saying the reason we wanted it is we wanted to change the tax liability possibly. That's a matter in the Tax Court. And therefore, you wanted it for the Tax Court. So now there's a question. Can you use a subpoena enforced through a court to get information that you, I think, are saying ­­ correct me if I'm not right ­­ has no purpose other than to change, modify, or help our case in the Tax Court.",
  "I realize that.",
  "So if that is the only reason for enforcing the summons, I don't know, is there any more need for a hearing? I mean, it's a legal question.",
  "You said you can get information to help their case or change the liability in the Tax Court. And they say you can't.",
  "I don't think we can decide that, can we?",
  "I'm a little confused here. Imagine there are two kinds of electrodes, a blue one and a green one, and you have to have a blue one and green one on left hand and a blue one and green one on right hand. And now, you cannot let them touch. The blue can't touch the green. I got that. And suppose on your left hand you put the blue one here and the green one there. And in the right hand, you put the blue in here and the green in here. See, they're not touching, but they're different distances from each other in the two hands. Does it work or not?",
  "Look, look. This is like that one hand.",
  "And this one's like the other hand. Okay? So does it work or not?",
  "All right. Look, on the green one is two inches ­­ the space between the green one and the right one is like a half inch for the left hand, and it's like one inch for the right hand. Okay? Does it work?",
  "It was asked in a pretty roundabout way.",
  "Then did he know that they had to be ­­ like if you put it two inches across here, so there are two inches between them, and over here it's like a half inch between them, did he know it did work or did he know it didn't work?",
  "He knew if it worked, but I want to know if it does work.",
  "Okay. Now, as soon as you say that, that's his point. His point is that when I read it ­­ I guess that's the point that's being made. When I read it, it just seems to me that the green one can't touch the blue one, and the whole thing has to fit within your hand, so each of them catches a finger. And he's saying that isn't good enough. That doesn't work. They have to be the same distance. And what that distance is, this document doesn't tell us. And it doesn't even tell us they have to be the same distance. So therefore, since it doesn't tell us that, it's ambiguous. Is that the correct argument? All right. We think it's the correct argument. So now, what's your answer?",
  "It doesn't even say that. It doesn't even say that. It doesn't say go experiment whether somebody with great big fingers on one hand and tiny little fingers on the other hand ­­",
  "What worries me about that, which is certainly attractive, what you just say, is that lawyers will come up with all kinds of experts, you know. And quite often, if this situation ever arises, and I don't know if it really ever does, it could reflect a difference of opinion among scientists. I mean, you could have those who followed the phlogiston theory of fire. You could have those who follow the oxygen theory of fire. All we have to do is update that, and you could find different experts who would have different opinions while all agreeing that it is absolutely clear. I doubt that the Patent Office will very often find that problem arising. And if it does, why not just say, forget about it? As long as you can say reasonable experts can clearly ­­ you know, what you just said ­­ that's the end of it. And we'll tell you what to do later, when we really find the problem or you tell us what to do. I mean, I'm having a problem about it, and I'm explaining what my problem was.",
  "Can't we just stop there? I mean, do we really have to go into this theoretical dispute between the two scientists, who have opposite theories of ­­",
  "We might have to send it back. If we were to say, yes, they did violate the Constitution, next question would be is it clear? I mean, the Second Circuit thought they didn't violate the Constitution. Isn't that right?",
  "And so they say obviously they didn't violate the Constitution, they didn't clearly violate the Constitution. So if we were to say, no, you did violate the Constitution, that footnote does not express any view.",
  "So if they got the whole thing wrong from beginning to end, they might have to send it back, we send it back and say you got it wrong, it did violate the Constitution; now tell us if it's clear. So which should we do, decide it ourselves whether it was clear, it’s a matter of Eleventh Circuit precedent or should we send it back to their tender mercy?",
  "Okay, so what’s your rule? So there are three possibilities: Possibility one, smartphone, no, get a warrant, unless exigent circumstances. Possibility two, yes, it's just like a piece of paper that you find in his pocket. Or possibility three, sometimes yes, sometimes no. All right, which of those three is yours?",
  "No, no, I mean of my three choices. I mean, call the first choice never except exigent without a warrant; always, you don't need a warrant; or three, somewhere in between. Which of the three choices is yours?",
  "In between. Okay. Now we're in between. Then I get to my follow up question.",
  "My follow up question is, please tell me what your in­between rule is?",
  "Your rule is sometimes. So I say: Sometimes; what's that? And you say if it is the kind of thing that the police could have searched for if it wasn't on the computer, then they can search for it on the computer. Now, since they can search for everything in your pockets before when it isn't the computer, then why isn't yours everything? I mean, by the way, they don't know whether a call is or is not going to turn out to be evidence when it's in your trash box if that's, or wherever you put it, I don't know. They don't know that 'til they read it. So I guess what you're saying is I thought it was category two, sometimes, but really it's category three, always. Now, why am I wrong?",
  "That gives you time to think.",
  "By the way, GPS information, I don't want to admit it, but my wife might put a little note in my pocket\". Steven, remember, turn right at the third stoplight, proceed three blocks forward. Of course you could have looked at information that showed where you had been and where you were going as long as it was on paper. Now it's in a GPS. So how does your rule help?",
  "Or how ­­ there's an analogue with photos. The arrested person has photos, pre­digital age. Of course you can look at them. On the phone there are photos. Absolutely analogous, except there are 10,000. It's indeed his entire life history in photos.",
  "On your rule, can the policeman look at the photos by analogue or not, because there are 10,000. Okay? What's the answer?",
  "What we have is, by the way ­­ you understand where I'm going. I think there are very, very few things that you cannot find in analogue to in pre­digital age searches. And the problem in almost all instances is quantity and how far afield you're likely to be going. Do I accept your rule?",
  "We've had a couple of States where this has been so, where they've had a rule that you can't search, for Michigan, I think, and Vermont. And are there any instance out of those States where these scenarios have taken place?",
  "You don't know of any. I take it you don't know.",
  "All right. So isn't this a problem that might be postponed because we have warring technologies, et cetera? And is it ­­ you're saying now we should allow searches of all cell phones because there might be a technology that hasn't yet in fact been used in any of the States that have this rule. That sounds a little hypothetical. I'm not quite sure how to handle it.",
  "I mean, you have a problem. Apparently, neither you nor I actually have this on their phone, as far as I know. So I'm imagining something. Maybe you have it. There is some kind of system that once it goes \"bzzz,\" you never can get the stuff again except after eight months, and when this \"bzzz\" happens, is it happens at least ten minutes after the arrest and not before, so the policeman would have time to look at it. But the ­­ by the time you get to the stationhouse, the \"bzzz\" has already happened, so now nobody else can. Maybe there is such a thing. I've never heard of it before this minute or before the briefs. Well, why wouldn't ­­ you see I'm similarly incredulous about it from my tone of voice because I don't see why somebody who wanted to \"bzzz\" actually to keep the police away wouldn't do it after 30 seconds.",
  "I don't either because I can never get into it because of the password.",
  "My point is, somebody who really wants to go to all that trouble will surely have it turn off after 30 seconds and the policeman won't be able to look at it either.",
  "Yeah. Well, but the dim criminal who is thinking about the magistrate at the station but not thinking about the policeman. I mean, you see what I'm doing with my questions?",
  "I'm casting a little cold water on this as a rationale.",
  "No, the point of a warrant is that a person who is not involved and is objective listens to what the policeman is saying, knowing that sometimes, like me or any other human being, a policeman can get a little carried away. So if, in fact, he does show the warrant, that there is this basis, you issue the warrant. Many, many ­­ and if he doesn't you don't. It isn't because they're different legal questions. It's just you want that third dispassionate mind to review what the facts are. Now, if that's a purpose of having a warrant, how long does it take to get a warrant in the mine run of these cases? Is it not a matter of hours in most places?",
  "In some places I'm sure it's difficult. But I'm saying most places, major cities, et cetera, my guess was ­­ and I want to be corrected if I'm wrong ­­ it's a matter of a few hours and you could do it more quickly if you needed to. Am I right about that?",
  "Well, you are in a department that keeps track pretty much. You're much more expert than I. And therefore I would like your best guess on the mine run of things of a range of time to get a warrant.",
  "I see your point. I see your point.",
  "Assume a range. But my question I'm trying to get to is this. What, from what you've said is the harm in saying, yes, you need a warrant, but remember, there are exigent circumstances? So where is someone ­­ the bell rings on the phone. Depending on the kind of crime, it may be pretty important to let the policeman answer to find out where it's coming from, because it may be other people on the gang who are coming with weapons. Or alternatively, if you're right on the technology, it may be someone about to push a buzzer that will erase the information. So remember we have the exigent circumstances. If your view of the technology is right, they will perhaps be used with common sense and caution. But you don't need a special rule other than the rule, get a warrant. How will that hurt?",
  "Can you work with exigent Circumstances. Why?",
  "Do you ­­ do you see what I was trying to do with the word \"exigency?\" I was trying to figure out if that's a way of dealing with the unknown here, which is your problem. That if, in fact, technology is such that the policeman, it's really true if he has five minutes to search, he can get this valuable evidence and if the technology is such that it doesn't even give him five minutes, or if it's such that it gives him four or five hours, or if it's such that he can press a button, or if it's the opposite and they can just cough and encrypt it, well, all that will be fed into the word \"exigency,\" which we wouldn't have to decide now, but rather, you could make your arguments about the real exigency for preventing the destruction later in the context of ­­ of what turns out to be the technology of the time. That's what was going on.",
  "I mean, if, in fact, you can search the phone thoroughly for everything in the person's life, they might have come up with something when he was six years old, there is, in fact, a picture of an elephant at the zoo. Totally public. But it would still fall within the rule, which what I thought one of the things we're arguing about in this case.",
  "All right. Well, what is your argument for the proposition, look, when you search a phone, sometimes what you come up with is perfectly public information; sometimes what you come up with is private information. Now, you want to say the absolute rule should be no. But what's your argument, rather than trying to say sometimes if you get the private information, no; but if you get the public information, yes, et cetera?",
  "I think what he's saying, is there any good reason that they aren't liable for infringement? Is that ­­",
  "All right. And I thought the reason ­­ you have to answer it ­­ is because when you have many steps in a process, and this is a very similar process of the book I'm reading now about the Seabees building constructions in World War II, you know, they put some forward warehouses and they put some other stuff in some other warehouses and they make the eventual thing by shipping this from over there and the other place. So it's tough. Now, you’ll probably want to insist upon a pretty strict relationship between the different parties in a joint venture or more before you hold them liable. In other words, there's an issue I don't know about. How close was this relationship? And I ask you that because you're going to answer his question and I want to just see if my stab in the dark here is somewhere close to the ­­ to what you were about to say.",
  "My problem is I have no idea. I mean ­­",
  "I have no idea whether they should be liable or not on a theory of patent infringement themselves. It sounds simple when you take the invention that you gave, but it doesn't sound simple to me when I start thinking about this one, because this one does seem to me a variation on a very old theme. And that is a supplier who makes customized materials, some of which involve standardized materials and some of which have to be made fresh, and where the specialists are in crowded cities. But ­­ and so it takes time to put it on the truck and get out of the city. But the standardized parts can be shipped from anywhere in the country. Has a system of phoning up standardized people and customized people and putting them all together, and it involves the customer. And there are not just two steps. There are 87 steps, and many of them involve very innocent things like taking a truck and driving it from one place to another. Now, when we get into something as complicated as that ­­ and this is one is even more so ­­ and many of them are things that people do every day, and there are all kinds of states of knowledge, I become very nervous about writing a rule that suddenly might lead millions of people to start suing each other. And that's what I would not like to do unless I have pretty thorough briefing on this subject.",
  "And of course, my problem is a rule. And if this is a simple case, it's hard to me. Why do they have a patent? Well, they do have some forward warehouses and they had ­­ phone up and say, which one comes from which place? But, you see, I don't understand the underlying stuff. So they probably have a valid patent. I assume that. But for some of them, could be 87 steps, and I don't have one rule for four steps and another one for 87.",
  "And I'd have the same question, by the way, as to 271(b), exactly the same question. For X number of years, the patent bar and everyone else has lived with the statute and the interpretations which are different from this one. And now suddenly we have a new one. And I get the ­­ and now do you understand my question? Can you apply it to this one, too, and explain why we should say the Federal Circuit is right to depart from a pretty clear understanding differently?",
  "And my question is one you probably can't answer, which is a problem because you have limited time, and the way ­­ you have such limited time in these complicated cases. And my problem is, the question is this is so complicated. And the reasons I found it so complicated is I can ­­ and I'll spare you the details ­­ think of so many different kinds of situations with so many different steps in method patents where so many rights and wrongs of it are differently at play that I become worried about setting forth any rule. And it's under those circumstances that I say okay, let's go with what we've had for 30 years, and if Congress feels they should change it, change it. And that's the ­­",
  "­­ that ­­ that is basically my idea. And it depends upon the complexity, which I'm seeing in my ­­ as ­­ as I think about it.",
  "And it doesn't depend just upon that there were 4 steps in this case, because there could have been 104.",
  "There could have been 104 different circumstances.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. Well, anything about (a) and also about (b), because (b), if you're liable under (b), my goodness, you could become more easily liable perhaps or less easily in some circumstances, but you didn't even ­­ I mean, it's the same question for (a) and (b).",

  "Yes. And you say, I am applying for just that. And I am applying for just that. My application, here it is, in writing, is that I want you to do just that for Smith, who's sitting at the table.",

  "All right. So if bribe, then we're back ­­ if bribery is extortion, then why isn't conspiracy to commit bribery conspiracy to commit extortion? We're back where we began. The odd thing is in calling bribery extortion. Once you cross that bridge ­­ that's where we started. But we're back ­­ in my mind, it sort of got back where we started. And you're trying to drive a wedge there, and all your arguments seem to be me, really, to be aimed at why are we calling bribery extortion?",
  "Because they are showering with money. They love it.",
  "I know that, but, I mean, how you're asking me to make that distinction, how do I do it?",
  "And what payment of a bribe is not extortion?",
  "All right. So the only ground, then, we could say is say, well, they went just up to the limit of the logic in the other case, and we're just not going to be logical to extend it further.",
  "Is that ­­",
  "The ­­ the answer, as I understand this now, the purpose of this active participation doctrine is let's look at the substantive offense. And all of a sudden we're saying every policeman, every State official, everyone in the country who goes to any person and says, give me some money for my position, they're already guilty. That already is extortion on this case that we've been talking about before, right?",
  "Okay.",
  "So now what you're going to do is you're going to make not only them guilty of the Federal crime, you're going to make anybody who pays them guilty of the Federal crime. That's the purpose of this case. Now you say don't worry about it, because there's situation A and situation B. In situation A, the policeman is the heavy, and all the victim's done is stop at the traffic light. He says, give me the money, and that's a bribe, all right? He's a bad guy, the policeman; the victim is not so bad. But in the other case, the victim says, I love it, like these people, because we're really getting money from the public. That's what they're trying to do ­­ who are the real victims here, but they're not ­­ that's not charged that way. And that's what the active participation thing is designed to do, separate the ­­ the sort of innocent victims who aren't policemen from the cooperating victims who love the policemen to take the money because they want the result; is that right?",
  "Okay. I've got it right so far.",
  "The argument on his side is don't make a bad situation worse.",
  "We already are federalizing vast numbers of State crimes, which really are the States' business. And now you're not necessarily doubling the number, but you're increasing it by about 80 percent. Now that ­­ that's what I've got as a practical argument that he's making. And ­­ and your answer to that is, don't worry it's not your business. It's just follow the logic.",
  "I understand.",
  "What I'm interested in is if I understand it correctly.",
  "Well, is it ­­ if ­­ what ­­ I'm still ­­ a crime requires that the victim give consent. Now, what kind of ­­ it could be obtaining consent to do something. Smith obtains consent to do something. The victim agrees with Smith to participate in that crime. But in agreeing to do it, he is giving consent. So from that point on, there is no further consent to be given. So it's like robbing the pocket of a stone idol or some ­­ what used to be called in law school ­­ once the consent is given. So maybe he is agreeing to participate in a conspiracy to attempt to get the consent. But he's agreeing to the ­­ he gives the consent at the moment he agrees.",
  "So how can you be conspiring to ­­ to do something to get a consent that was already given?",
  "You could conspire to attempt to get it, but not to get it, if you're being really picky on these words.",
  "Why didn't you just charge them with getting money from the customers? I mean, that's who ­­ they're conspiring ­­ after all, they're giving $150 to the policeman. They aren't philanthropists. They think they're going to get that money back from the people whose cars are wrecked.",
  "So those are the other people. I mean, this is really a conspiracy on behalf of the policeman and the ­­ and the owner of the repair shop to get money from a customer, a person whose car was wrecked. That's why they do it; isn't it?",
  "Will you, in your answer, get to what I think is the main point; the main point being, look, two policemen and a shop owner. The policemen say, give us money and we'll help you out later. That's extortion. All right. If that's extortion, then why isn't it conspiracy when, three weeks before they meet and bit by bit say, we will do that very thing which is extortion ­­",
  "­­ the shopkeeper is helping the policemen do what is the thing that counts as extortion and, therefore, he's conspired with them. That's their very simple argument. A simple answer is?",
  "Yes. The \"other\" ­­ \"another\" means another other than the two policemen.",
  "That's ­­ that's what this other case says. And the law says that it's another ­­ another other than them.",
  "No, no, no words. Another. Another. Joe and Bill are the policemen; Sam is the shopkeeper. In the substantive crime, the other, another, means not the two policemen; it means Sam. And Sam, two weeks earlier, helped and conspired with the two policemen to get money from another; namely, Sam.",
  "Odd, but English.",
  "What about the problem that this is California law and a California court said that's what the contract means under California law?

And suddenly we have Federalized, if not every area, a huge area of State contract law.",
  "Now, there's another way to do it. We could just ask the California Supreme Court. Now, what about that?",
  "Or ­­ or come up with an answer to what Justice Alito just asked.",
  "Why not ask. No. Ultimately, it's a State law question, what does the contract mean. And the contract, on reading it, seems to mean that it applies to laws that are laws, not laws that have been held unconstitutional. So what I've looked at, I've looked at civil rights cases, for all kinds of cases. I can't find any.",
  "Maybe that's so. But if the California Supreme Court had said this, I would look ­­ they would read the Contract as if it said, if there is a law in the State of California, a State law, or if there ever has been, whether that law is constitutional or not constitutional, whether it violates the Supremacy Clause or not, if they ever wrote those words in the State legislature into a law, there is no arbitration contract. Okay? I guess parties have the right to do that. And if the California court said as a matter of California law they did it right here, I don't know that we'd have a ground to stand on.",
  "I'm back to my point. I looked in civil rights cases.",
  "The south passed statute after statute like the sit­in statutes and so forth to try to prevent the Equal Protection Clause from being implemented.

In none could I find the court saying this matter of State law where it isn't itself unconstitutional, you know, what ­­ what is a trespass and so forth. There ­­ it violates the Federal law, what they'd say is we interpret the State law.",
  "They've gone that far, because we think the State would interpret the State law this way. But I can't find an analogy to what you're saying.",
  "We'd have to say an interpretation of a contract where that interpretation is ­­ is what?",
  "What ­­ I'm looking for the standard.",
  "You read me the words. It didn't say what to do.",
  "It said they have to conform with Federal ­­",
  "That looks like we're the supervisor of all State contract interpretation judges.",
  "My other suggestion ­­ we're not going to make too much progress on finding the standard, but California does accept requests from us, or other Federal courts, to explain what California law is. I've looked at that statute. And if this is so outrageous as a matter of contract interpretation of State law, why don't we just ask them?",
  "They have not considered this case.",
  "Go back to Justice Scalia, please. What I understood this to be is one reason this interpretation from your perspective is an unreasonable really weird one is because the statute basically says go to arbitration unless you are in a State where the law would require class arbitration. And if that's the State you're in, dump the whole arbitration ­­",
  "­­ business. Okay. Now, one reason that's a bad interpretation is that probably what they meant is valid State law.",
  "All right. That's one.",
  "Now, is there any other?",
  "So if you said that ­­",
  "What he'll say, I think, is ­­ we certainly pressed him on it enough ­­ is that the ­­ read the sentence, the relevant sentence. \"If the law of your State would find the agreement to dispense with class action procedure unenforceable, then the entire Section 9 is unenforceable.\" All right. That's what it says. Now, would the law of California find the agreement \"dispense with class action\" procedure unenforceable? The answer to that question is clearly no. Because they did have a law like that, but it was invalid. So in order to read this in your favor, you'd have to say these words: If, however, the law of your State would find this agreement, you have to read it as saying, if, however the invalid law of your State would find this agreement to dispense with class action unenforceable, then. Now, nobody ­­ it's very hard to say that the parties meant if the invalid law of your State would find it and, therefore, contract interpretation is a question of law, this question of law was decided by California to read the word \"law\" as \"invalid law,\" there is no case in California or anywhere else, to our knowledge, that has interpreted contracts in such way out of the arbitration context, and therefore, this rule of law interpreting this word this way is discriminating against arbitration. That's something like what the argument he's making. Your answer to that is?",
  "But does California have a law, a valid law that would find the agreement to dispense with class action unenforceable? Does it or doesn't it?",
  "It does. In other words, California now has a law that makes it okay to dispense with class action procedures.",
  "It may have. They may have. And I just don't want ­­ I want to give you one other issue.",
  "Because it's in my mind, and I'd like you to respond to it, if you wish. Because I think there's some pretty good arguments that this particular interpretation, consciously or unconsciously, is flying in the face of an opinion of this Court, which I disagreed with. That was an opinion that ­­ that said that this particular provision of California law is invalid. I dissented. All right. So we have, on the one hand, the risks that we'll get into, too many State law cases, if we take their side. On the other hand, there is the risk that they'll run around our decisions. Now, when you get to that second thing, even though I dissented, I think it's an extremely important thing in a country which has only nine judges here and thousands of judges in other places who must follow our decisions ­­ and think of the desegregation matters, et cetera ­­ that we be pretty firm on saying you can't run around our decisions, even if they're decisions that I disagree with, okay? Now, I raise that because I think it is a factor, and so I would like you to ­­ to say whatever you want.",
  "Well, you'd also have to look ­­ you have it at the top of your head, maybe forget if you don't, but what I thought I would do is I wanted to look to the aggravating circumstances, what were they.",
  "Let's call it \"he was the monster\" approach. Reginald was the monster and Jonathan was the puppet or whatever. I want to look at the aggravators. I also want to look at the mitigators that Reginald said existed, and then see if this comparative monster, let's call it, fits into any of them. Do you know? Do you know the pages where they are, just by chance?",
  "Okay. I know where they are.",
  "On what page do you list them?",
  "If, in fact, this gets in, then I guess what I have to do is go through this huge record on the sentencing anyway and see do I really think that this evidence that came in that the younger one thought the older one was the monster, et cetera, did it really have an effect?",
  "Is that what I would have to do? I don't see how I could avoid that if they are at all relevant.",
  "It would depend on what is was, wouldn't it? I mean, so I'm still asking the same question. If the ­­ I take it that Reginald could not have introduced evidence refuting these brothers' state of mind that he was the monster. That's what you're referring to by the bad influence. So the jury might have taken that evidence into account in trying to decide whether Reginald, for other reasons than in the statute, was a sympathetic enough character not to provide the death penalty. That's conceivable. But severance is very, very rare, and joint trials are very common. And very common is the claim on an appeal in any kind of a case that it shouldn't ­­ it should have been severed. So do you have cases that you can think of that would be good precedent for you where a court, including particularly this Court, said, of course there might be a little prejudice here, some, but it's not enough to warrant severance? Because I think what I have to do is read the record on this point, and then I need something to compare it with.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, normally in severance cases, forgetting the death cases, seems to me the argument has been, look, they never would have gotten this piece of evidence in against my client. They brought it in against the other client. Now, go look at that evidence and you'll see how much my prejudice ­­ that my client was prejudiced by that. I do not know whether you call that due process. Maybe you do. But that's the kind of argument which seems for a quantitative weighing. That's why I asked the question.",
  "But are you saying the severance rule is the same in non­capital as in capital cases?",
  "And you just look for prejudice?",
  "So if you're right, joinder being among the most common kind of thing that gangs and drugs and so forth, why won't the same argument be made over and over preventing ­­ requiring severance in dozens and dozens, perhaps hundreds of cases where the government tries people together? Because they will say there are different relationships among members of the gang. Those relationships ­­ some evidence would come in that would negative the relationship that would tend to show that this particular individual wasn't actually involved in this aspect of it, et cetera. That's why my experience on the Courts, lower courts particularly, leads me to think it's a very rarely accepted argument, severance.",
  "And that's why I'm interested in ­­ I mean, because if it were, you'd find it very unusual to try people together, which, in fact, is very usual. And so when you told me there is no separate thing for the death cases, then I imagine it would affect every criminal trial of gangs throughout the country.",
  "And that is something that's concerning me and I am looking for an answer.",
  "That's what I'm looking for. Why is it you believe that if I were to decide in your favor on this case and find the sufficient prejudice to warrant severance here, I wouldn't at the same time be throwing a huge monkey wrench ­­",
  "­­ into the ordinary cases of gangs, drugs, et cetera, where joinder is very common and reversal is very rare.",
  "So this ­­ maybe you can, in your experience, cure what's bothering me about the case. It's nothing to do with the facts, or for this ­­ this concern. It has to do with ­­ with Zafiro.",
  "And that's the ordinary case of joint trials, right? And what the Court says is you can have the joinder as long as there isn't a serious risk that the joint trial would compromise ­­ it doesn't say harmless error, it says compromise ­­ a specific trial right, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment. That doesn't talk about harmless error. Now, that's the standard that's used in dozens and dozens and dozens of cases. Or if, in this case, we start talking about harmless error, and that you can't have the joint proceeding if there is error that is not harmless. Well, what have we done to that sentence? And what have we done to the trials that are joint in hundreds of cases that don't involve murder or death? That is the legal problem that is worrying me. And you will either cure that worry or say I've made some elementary mistake. It has nothing to do with your case. Say what you want, but I want to hear what you think about it.",
  "So we should not use the words \"harmless error.\" We should quote from Zafiro and say could they make a reliable judgment? Now, that sounds harder on you, because if all you have to show is the error was harmful, it sounds like an easier task you have than to show that the juror ­­ jury wasn't reliable. Or are they the same thing in your opinion?",
  "Is there ­­ to go back to the question that Justice Ginsburg has asked, as we say, this Court has never held that there is an absolute requirement that you give the reasonable doubt ­­ don't say it's no reasonable doubt in a mitigating case, just what you said.",
  "We send it back because, as you said, they just ­­ if the law in the State is different, they've changed it. When they changed it, did they apply the change retroactively?",
  "What did they say?",
  "But that court's held it's only prospective?",
  "Well, you very simply say, yes, have a new trial, that's how. I mean, you simply set a new sentencing hearing ­­",
  "There would be a need if Kansas law, as is now revealed by their pattern instructions, suggests that you do have to give the instruction that's required, that the ­­ that the defendant wants, and you'd have to have a new sentencing proceeding, wouldn't you?",
  "Why not?",
  "Yes ­­",
  "My thinking is the following, so you'll understand why I ask this question. It, I think, could be the case that you're right, that this Court has never held that the Eighth Amendment requires giving such an instruction. Next question: Should it now hold it? Well, the answer to that question could be this is not a good case to decide that. Because it may be that the Kansas court has held it as to the future and may apply the future rule as to the 9 people who are involved in the past. Therefore, send it back. What do you think of that reasoning?",
  "Probably not much, but I'd like to know your reasons.",
  "Harman didn't.",
  "Harman didn't.",
  "No, no. But they say just what they said here.",
  "But then as a succession of references back.",
  "As we said this ­­ so as we said, just that. Four sentences you quote, they're wrong. Now, as to whether the ­­ the instruction in content here was too confusing because of the placement all the arguments you heard, they didn't really go into that. Nor did they really go into the question of State law. Nor did they get into the question of whether the new State law is retroactive. All those remain open on remand for the parties to ask the Court to consider it, and if the Court decides it's appropriate to raise it at that time, to consider it. Is that satisfactory to you?",
  "Not just State law, it's the confusion. Sorry. Go ahead. Forget it. I wanted to know if it's satisfactory. The answer is no.",
  "How ­­ how ­­ suppose ­­ let's think of the first Teague exception. Suppose ­­ substantive matters. Suppose that many States had sedition laws that make certain conduct unlawful so there are a thousand people in prison. This Court in a new rule holds you cannot criminalize that behavior. All right. What is the law that would make that retroactive to people in prison? It sounds to me that it isn't like some kind of statutory discretion. Rather, there are human beings who are in prison, who are there without having violated any valid law, because it was always protected by the First Amendment. And if that's right, then it's the Constitution, the Due Process Clause, that says they are being held ­­ even though they committed the crime 22 years ago, they are now being held in confinement without due process of law because you cannot criminalize their behavior.",
  "Do you see where I'm going?",
  "That being so, it's a Federal Constitution rule, the exceptions of Teague, Teague drops out of the case. The only question is whether they satisfy the two exceptions.",
  "I've made it a new rule.",
  "For purposes of my hypothetical, I'm making it a new rule.",
  "Yes.",
  "Danforth was the case saying that the States could be more generous. It wasn't a case ­­ this is a case that ­­ the opposite of being generous: Can they be more stingy? And I cannot find anything in ­­ in Harlan ­­ maybe I'll read it again, but I can't find anything there, nor can I find anything in Danforth that answers the question. So I thought it is a new question. Hence, that question I posed to you, because I want to get your response. I don't think you can answer it by means of precedent. I think you have to try to figure it out without the help of precedent.",
  "That's all right.",
  "That's true. But then we have Teague, and Teague is saying we don't like Linkletter ­­ and ­­ and ­­",
  "All right. But you're saying that we have ­­ then maybe that's wrong.",
  "I mean, why doesn't it violate the Constitution to hold a person in prison for 20 years for conduct which the Constitution forbids making criminal?",
  "That would be the reason.",
  "Is there anything else you can say? Because I can make ­­ you know, I can say, which witch is being a witch? There were some people in Salem who were imprisoned for being a witch. And lo and behold in 1820, it was held by this Court that that violated the Constitution. Now, you see, I just make a more outrageous example of the same thing.",
  "And ­­ and what I want you to say, okay, I got your point. It didn't violate the Constitution at the time. I've also got the point you have some authority. Anything else?",
  "How ­­ how ­­ how does it work? It ­­ it should be pretty elementary, but ­­ I mean, I looked at the Indian case, and that seems a little far out. The ­­ the ­­ the ­­ though it definitely gives you support on your statement here, suppose you took Justice Scalia's example: We have Iowa State Rule 56. We interpret Iowa State Rule 56 the same way as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. That's our rule. And now this is what it means in that case. And they say, but we're doing it under Iowa State rule. Now, you say we can review that because they said that Iowa State rule is the same as the Federal.",
  "Is that right?",
  "Now, I just ­­ how do you fit that in the words in 1257?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, they say in a particular case, it's guidance. It's great guidance. We agree. Our interpretation is the Federal interpretation.",
  "Now, can we review that ­­ because, in fact, it wasn't the Federal interpretation? But can we review it?",
  "Yes or no?",
  "So you say the Court does not in the example of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that Justice Scalia gave?",
  "Okay. It's a thought.",
  "We clearly have jurisdiction, don't we? Why ­­ I'm just trying to figure this out in my mind. We have jurisdiction where there is a person ­­ that's the defendant ­­ and the defendant says the court's decision ­­ that's your court's decision ­­ is contrary to the Constitution or statute of the United States. That's just what they say.",
  "So we have jurisdiction to answer the question. Now, the question is: How do we dispose of the case ­­",
  "­­ in which we have jurisdiction? And in three instances, I guess, the Court has done, in disposing of such a case, what the Solicitor General says; namely, they have said, we are ­­ we are not going to say whether he's right in saying it's contrary to the Constitution. That's because there might be an adequate State ground; there might not be. Their adequate State ground was one that was ­­ was elucidated or explained as being ­­ flowing from a certain interpretation of Federal law.",
  "We will say their interpretation of Federal law was wrong, and now we'll send it back to see what they do.",
  "Is that right? Have I got it right?",
  "But the Teague standard ­­ the Teague exceptions could well be constitutionally required. The Teague exception ­­",
  "­­ means Teague doesn't apply.",
  "You were going to say ­­ at some point you started ­­ suppose you look at the watershed procedural change. My ­­ my impression from the case you cited, Summerlin, is that deciding whether that's retroactive has two parts. I think we were unanimous on this point. The two parts were: Is it implicit in the concept of ordered liberty? And here it would seem to be, because it's applicable to the States. And the second is: Is it central to an accurate determination that life without parole is a legally appropriate punishment? And the ­­ the ­­ the rule that a mandatory can't exist is central to making that ­­ that was the whole point of the Miller opinion. So if that's the correct analysis for watershed rule, procedural rule that's retroactive ­­ if I'm right about that, why doesn't it fit within that category?",
  "All right. But that's the language ­­ \"bedrock\" is ­­ I don't think is the right language, because that was the language he referred to in a sentence in Mackey, correct? I've just been looking it up. And ­­ and ­­ but then in Teague itself, Justice O'Connor tries to get the right words, and ­­ what she ends up with here is that the procedural is the first test, the first part, is ­­ can be addressed by limiting the scope of the second exception ­­ that's the watershed rule ­­ to those new procedures without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished. Okay.",
  "And that's joined by the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and the fourth I can't remember. But ­­ so is it seriously diminished? Now, we read through Miller. It's pretty hard to say ­­ I mean, my goodness, Miller is just filled with paragraph after paragraph about how a mandatory requirement for life without parole fails to take account of all the characteristics or many characteristics adherent in youth. And it's pretty hard to come away from that without thinking, gee, accuracy under a mandatory life without parole does seriously diminish the accuracy of imposing life without parole when you apply the mandatory to a youth.",
  "No, no. But you have to say the accuracy is seriously diminished. And she says, then I don't think there will be too many such cases.",
  "Suppose that the jury comes back at the sentencing phase and says, we recommend life.",
  "And the reason, though I guess no one would know it, is because they ­­ no ­­ nobody found an aggravating.",
  "Can the judge, nonetheless, give death.",
  "No.",
  "No, we ­­ we have ­­ they have a page in their opinion, in their brief, you know, Page 20, where it cites about six Florida cases, which suggested to me that they thought the answer to that question as a matter of Florida law was, yes, the judge can sentence to death.",
  "Is that so or not so?",
  "That's ­­ I missed the last part.",
  "The jury comes back.",
  "They say life.",
  "And we know, through mental telepathy ­­",
  "­­ though I guess the judge doesn't, that the reason that they did that is no one found an aggravator. My simple question is: As a matter of Florida law, can the judge impose the death sentence? Yes or no.",
  "That isn't Florida ­­ I mean, it is. It's Federal law. So ­­ I mean, Ring is over. So ­­ so you say the answer is now no ­­",
  "­­ because of Ring. Because you agree that this case is like Ring, and therefore Ring would apply, and therefore ­­ not this case, but any case in which they recommend life.",
  "I am, too, actually. Sorry.",
  "Go for a second to an analogy.",
  "There's ­­ there are two good other analogies in other areas of the law. The one that supports you is robbery, force or threat of force. No one ever asks or needn't ask whether six members of the jury thought there was a threat but no actual, or seven members thought there was actual but no threat. Threat or threat of force. I don't think we have to say. I don't think so. So that supports you. On the other hand, imagine a normal sentencing case. The statute says, you ­­ you get aggravated punishment if you had 50 grams of cocaine. The jury finds he had 50 grams of cocaine ­­ no. Sorry. The statute says aggravated sentence if 50 grams of cocaine or meth. The jury finds he had 50 grams of cocaine. I don't think under Apprendi, which I didn't agree with ­­ but I don't think the judge could say, I'm going to give you the aggravated sentence because I don't believe there was any cocaine, but I do believe there was meth.",
  "But we do know that the judge here ­­ now still you're having conceded Ring, where the jury says no aggravating factor. We know that the jury can, if the jury finds aggravating factor X, have death on a completely different aggravating factor, but the jury never thought of, namely why. Now, we know that. And now compare that to the hypothetical of cocaine and meth. And then we have Apprendi, which I disagree with still, but...",
  "That's true. That is true. That ­­",
  "That is true. What you say is true. Every reduction in demand for a unit of retail electricity is ipso facto a demand for a reduction of a unit of wholesale electricity, and vice versa. So it's hardly surprising that anything they do in the wholesale market that adds to demand will add to demand in retail, and vice versa. But I thought that their motivation here is the following: On the 4th of August at 4:00 p.m., people turn on electricity for air­conditioning. That's the peak hour. The industry, leaving reserves out of this as a fixed matter, has to supply that. So if there are not enough generators at 4:00 p.m. on August the 4th, they have to build one. And to build an additional generator ­­ I don't know what gas costs now, but let's imagine it's $500,000, and that will be passed on in the wholesale price, and then probably, though the States are free to do what they want, in the retail price. So FERC thinks I have another way of doing this. For only $400,000, I can be sure that on the 4th of August at 4:00 p.m., the demand is not great enough to spend the 500, and so we group the people who will promise to fulfill their air­conditioning at other times. That way, the price of wholesale electricity falls. And, therefore, we satisfy all demand at a lower price. We are interested in wholesale. We are interested in how to satisfy peak wholesale demand. And we have worked out a way to do it cheaper. Of course it affects retail prices, so does everything we do in respect to wholesale prices. End of the matter. So I accept your characterization, but I do not see any law that prevents them from raising or lowering wholesale price despite the fact that that affects retail price.",
  "It didn't affect ­­ it didn't try ­­ what it said was, we have a group of people who will put customers together, and those customers will, in fact, cut demand at 4:00 p.m. on August 4th. As I say, that affects retail price; so does everything.",
  "And ­­ and what is the difference here ­­ and that's what you want to get at, so I'm letting you do it ­­",
  "­­ the difference here and what I just said? Everything.",
  "I guess if you're ­­",
  "If you're right, then I guess the FERC could not direct the grid approvals in a way that would, in fact, prevent certain retail customers from buying electricity at certain times. I guess that FERC could not, in fact, allow large consumers of electricity to buy at wholesale, because that would take the retail customers away from the jurisdiction of the State. I guess that FERC could not, in fact, insist upon a marginal capacity being generated from natural gas instead of from other things, because that will affect the price of natural gas, will affect the wholesale rate, thereby raising the retail rate, thereby stealing customers away from, let's say, Ohio, where it goes up, and forcing them to go to Texas. I mean, I have not been surprised that I have found no case in which FERC ever tried to do anything roughly comparable or even by the roughest analogy that would say that they cannot do this for the reason you suggest.",
  "I was grasping your point, which I hadn't grasped previously. And your point seems to be that the problem here is the way they are reducing the demand, and therefore, the cost of wholesale electricity, is by taking a ­­ groups of people and preventing them from buying electricity at all at certain times, which, of course, affects their buying retail.

And the example here is not just the Chief Justice's, which is one, but the more immediate example, which seems to be in this case ­­ I didn't think it was but it now seems to be ­­ are people ­­ perhaps not this plaintiff ­­ but people who in fact notice that someone like the defendant has filed bad procedures leading to false information. And those people who were not injured bring a lawsuit, and they say they're following bad information. That's it. Bad procedure. And Congress gave me a hundred dollars, so give it to me. Now, that's the person I didn't know was in this case, because this plaintiff seems to argue specific discrepancies in fact that, in all likelihood, hurt him. Okay? But we're leaving him out of it. Now, I want to know what the government thinks of the case I've just put. Do ­­ does the government think a person who admits nobody said anything wrong about me, they did say something about me, it was all correct, but they are using bad, bad in ­­ practices for assembling consumer information ­­ In the government's view, does the person in my hypothetical, similar to the Chief's, maybe identical, does he or does he not have standing? Yes or no?",
  "Fine. If you say he does not, then we are limiting this case to the case of people who are victims of not just bad practices but false information about them, and that's what the words \"with respect to any consumer\" mean.",
  "They mean any consumer who has obtained ­­ who suffers from false information.",
  "If that's the government's position, then it's not a public action. It's a private action.",
  "You have to say, don't you, in answer to Justice Scalia, that the words, \"follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy in respect to any consumer,\" the one who can sue, means that the ­­ when you fail to do it in respect to a consumer, you say something false about that consumer. It doesn't use those words, and we would have to so construe it in order to save the constitutionality of the statute.",
  "Right ­­ right here we have in the complaint, I guess, there were certain errors: A photograph of the wrong person; a statement that he's in his 50s; he isn't. That he's married; he isn't. He's employed in a professional or technical field; he isn't. That he has children; he doesn't. That he has a graduate degree; he doesn't. That his economic health is very strong; it isn't. And his wealth level is in the top 10 percent; it isn't. Okay? So that, I gather, is what he is complaining about. Something like that.",
  "Fine. Now, for purposes of deciding this case, are we simply to refer to this and say, this is a case about a person who's complaining this? And is this, which I just listed, a sufficiently­concrete injury?",
  "Thank you.",
  "You did ­­ we ­­ I ­­ I ­­ we looked at ­­ I looked at the statute. The statute says in a habeas case, State habeas, that the Georgia Supreme Court must review it. It says it must review it unless it's without merit. I forget the exact words. I was looking for them.",
  "Do they state that?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, wait, wait, wait. Then I've been looking at the wrong place. You heard your brother here say ­­ he quoted some words. I don't remember the exact words, but they were exactly what I'd read, and it was from a statute in Georgia.",
  "And the Georgia statute said ­­ I just can't find it in my book here. Sorry. The Georgia statute said they shall review the case unless it's without ­­ it's totally without merit. Something like that. I ­­ does that ring a bell?",
  "Does it ring a bell, what I'm saying?",
  "Or what are the exact words?",
  "Yes. That's it.",
  "Right. Right ­­ that doesn't ­­",
  "Okay. Does that govern this case?",
  "Does the word that he ­­ that the Chief Justice just read from Georgia law govern this case? The answer is yes or no.",
  "They do not govern this case.",
  "Okay. What, in your opinion, is the Georgia statute that says that those words you just held do not govern this case?",
  "Okay. Thank you.",
  "What is the reasonable explanation?",
  "In other words, the argument you're making here ­­",
  "­­ is that ­­ is that the reason he highlighted all the black jurors in green and thus said black ­­ what about the black jurors and did all these different things was because he was preparing a defense in case of a Batson challenge.",
  "All right. Now, if that's correct, why this is ­­ is this the first ­­ is it ­­ was this argument made before your main brief in this case?",
  "It was not. So if that had been his real reason, well, isn't it a little surprising that he never thought of it ­­",
  "­­ or didn't tell anybody until you raise this argument in your main brief?",
  "All right. It seems to me you have two arguments. One is this argument that he never thought of, apparently, or at least never thought to tell you until quite recently. And the other, after years, and so it's hard to believe that's his real reason. And then there's the second argument that he had about 40 different reasons. And at least some of them could be valid. Okay. Now, if my grandson tells me, I don't want to watch ­­ I don't want to do my homework tonight at 7:00 because I'm just so tired. And besides, I promised my friend I'd play basketball. And besides that, there's a great program on television. And besides that, you know, I really ­­ my stomach is upset, but I want to eat spaghetti. And so he's now given me five different reasons. What do I think of those reasons?",
  "One may be valid.",
  "Which one?",
  "Well, wait. The point is he gave 40 different reasons. And the very fact that he gives 40 different reasons ­­ and many of them are self­contradictory, obviously not applicable, totally different from ­­ you know, that's why I used my grandchild's analogy. All right? And so I would say my answer to my grandchild is, look, you're not too tired to do your homework. And I think any reasonable person looking at this would say, no, his reason was a purpose to discriminate on the basis of race. Now, tell me why I'm wrong.",
  "I ­­ I want to ask you a different question before your time is up. And I'd like you to respond to the question that Justice Alito initially asked.",
  "And that is, is there an independent State ground here? Now, you're familiar with the record.",
  "And I read on page 192 of the ­­ of your record the decision. And the first paragraph supports your ­­ the view that you would like to hold, I think, that this is based upon res judicata, which is a State matter. And then there is the paragraph that was read to you on page 195 and 196 where the judge says, \"The reason that I reach that conclusion is because the notes and records submitted by Petitioner failed to demonstrate purposeful discrimination on the basis that the race was the basis.\" Okay? That sounds like Batson to me. And then he goes on to say, \"And in addition there is no good reason given, now or then.\" And then he concludes, \"Accordingly, the court finds the renewed Batson claim is without merit.\" So if I read just that paragraph, I would think the reason that the judge found in your favor is he decided the Batson claim in your favor. He didn't have to. He could have gone on some other ground, but that's the ground he did go on. But at worst, why isn't it ambiguous? And if it is ambiguous, then why don't we take, you know ­­ I think it's what's in the ­­ Long, you know, all those cases. If it's ambiguous, then aren't we required to assume that the judge went on the Federal ground? Okay? Now, that's both Alito's question. It's what I think is the hardest point for you to overcome. And I want to hear your response.",
  "Well, that's the end of it, isn't it?",
  "You could, perhaps, treat it as we treated the $10,000 ­­ million in the ­­",
  "Right. And ­­ and say, yes, Congress did mean to pick up this definition, the jurisdictional part. But since no State explosives law will have that in the language, you can ­­ the government could, if it wanted, prove it at the ­­ prove that it was interstate­commerce related at the deportation hearing. That's what we did with the 10,000, isn't it?",
  "The reason really is pretty similar here. The ­­ the reason is there isn't a ­­ you know, there isn't a theft statute in the States which have a $10,000 thing in it, and so it didn't make really sense to think Congress wanted to exclude all those. And ­­ and ­­ and so here this is a big thing, explosives. I mean, that's quite ­­ quite a major problem trying to have an explosive to blow up a building. And I think if anything counts as an aggravated Felony, it's that. But there is this jurisdictional problem. What do you think about that? I just ­­",
  "The penultimate sentence of what?",
  "I just need to read it.",
  "It's 1101(43) ­­",
  "Thanks.",
  "But I ­­ I thought ­­ I agreed with that when I came in. And ­­ and then I thought, my goodness. Of course. It's an explosives crime. My God. Blowing up a building or a person, if anything's an aggravated felony, that must be. Then the first words out of his mouth, your friend's mouth, were, have no fear, read on, because there is a section that makes it an aggravated felony to commit a crime of violence. And \"a crime of violence\" is very broadly defined. So any human being who commits an explosives violation where that's a State law violation will fall within the definition of aggravated felony because they will have committed a crime of violence. So now, if that's right, I'm left with only half the problem I thought I was left with. And the half I'm still left with is, if we follow your interpretation, what we will suddenly do is put into the category \"aggravated felony,\" which forbids the attorney general to exercise her discretion and keep the person here even when she wants to, though the Mor case isn't a problem, because after all, she doesn't have to keep him here. All right? We put in every tax fraud state, every racketeering, gambling. I mean, you know the list. And it includes an awful lot of trivial stuff. So now I have removing the attorney general's discretion when she wants to keep the thing here ­­ keep the person here in a whole lot of trivial stuff, if I accept your definition. And if I accept theirs, I don't have the problem I thought I had, which was that people who commit very serious explosive crimes are not in the category \"aggravated.\" So what is the answer to that?",
  "I didn't think of it until I heard his first argument.",
  "I have the list in front of me, thanks to my law clerk. And I couldn't find anything on that list which either wouldn't fit within crime of violence or would be so terrible to leave out.",
  "The basic point is I counted ­­ made an effort to count these. I accept your argument there are about ten of these sections that ­­ you know, you ­­ you couldn't use that as a limitation. But if I look at those ten individually, I will discover that I ­­ Congress did want to pick up State crimes there or they don't use exactly jurisdiction language like evade a tax imposed under this title.",
  "And it isn't really going to be the anomaly I thought it was. That's your point.",
  "It wouldn't be strange if those were things that covered offenses that it makes sense not to want to put in ­­",
  "­­ to the definition.",
  "I thought that some of them did, but ­­",
  "The tax one, for example, the fraud ­­ tax fraud, but he uses different language.",
  "But the only thing you've been able to think of, my guess is, that gets around his argument that arson and explosives will be covered by the crime of violence is that: What if a person sets fire to his own property? Now, when would a person set fire to his own property? When he wants to commit fraud. And here we have a provision that puts fraud within it. And moreover, it has the limitation of $10,000. So therefore, serious fraud crimes will fall within this other section. So not even the case that you've really brought up is ­­ actually needs this provision to prosecute State explosives crimes, because either they're against other people's property, in which case they fall within crime of violence, or they're against your own property, in which case they are a specie of fraud over $10,000.",
  "So what do you think about this? I mean, I ­­ I think I dread the suggestion, but when I got into that, I thought, God, there is no way to avoid just doing this section by section and saying, what did Congress want, section by section. And then sometime ­­ you know, and then if we did that section by section, maybe it would be satisfactory to say, you know, let them prove the jurisdictional hook in the ­­ in the deportation proceeding. That gives the attorney general considerably more discretion. She can do it if she wants; she doesn't have to do it if she doesn't want to.",
  "Well, we might be ­­ when did they write? We're looking at, call it \"your section,\" which is (a)(4); is that right? Or what is it? It's ­­ for the three things in it. The one you're interested in is ­­ let's ­­ I don't want a name for it.",
  "I call it \"your section.\"",
  "All right. I'm going to call it \"your section.\"",
  "Your section. Then think of several other sections, which are the one I hadn't thought about which Justice Alito raised. That's really suspicious the way that looks there. 41, 42, 43. Now, when you pull up 41, 42, 43, law or written before the relevant parts of your section were written.",
  "Okay. If that's so ­­ and I don't know if this helps you or hurts you, but it seems to me that there is a ready­made right there for a drafter explanation of why he uses these words. Because we first look to 41, and that's aggravated. And then we look to 42, and that's sexual abuse without aggravated. And conduct is just the same as contact, but the drafter is thinking maybe we should go a little bit bigger. Now, the difficulty is in each of the sections I've mentioned, there is a special related section for children. So the difference between the two for adults is the nature of the force requiring a person to perform a sexual act. A threat of violence, et cetera. That's one. Right? And then the next section, abuse, it can be some other kind of threat. Then we get to the way it deals with children, and it deals with children under the 12 ­­ under 12. That's one. And it deals 12 to 16. That's the next. And then we have a section called contact, and that has to do with sex acts basically that really weren't sex acts but for a certain kind of conduct which is defined. All right. So I read this, I say, hey, that's what they picked up. They just ­­ a drafter just picked it up and changed a little bit, but that's what he had in mind. Then the question is: Your question. And in your favor, I think, is the fact that each of these earlier sections does have a special section dealing with children under the same number. Now, don't tell me I'm right if I'm not right, but that's what I suddenly saw when Justice Alito asked his question. Just tell me your reaction.",
  "What were the ­­ what were the other three? You said there were four reasons. I started where I think Justice Scalia did. Of course, I might more often than he think that the canons don't help us all that much. And this ­­ this is a poster child, I think, for that proposition. And so you said, no, there are four things here that show that this isn't ambiguous. You shouldn't end up that way. Now, one was a redundancy, which I'm not sure what it was, and then you didn't get to the other three, which I'd like to hear.",
  "No, it wasn't.",
  "Yeah. And the other?",
  "Right. And the fourth.",
  "Fourth, fourth.",
  "Okay. So he'll say \"or\" is in this one and it's not in the other one for a reason. He'll say they're superfluous reading both ways. He'll say that ­­ I can't remember the third ­­ but the fourth he's going to say, yeah, it's underinclusive versus overinclusive. Yours is it would be somewhat under­inclusive for the reason you say, and you take your reading, it will be overinclusive for the reason he says. So if we're at ­­ this is the only place that ­­ if we are absolutely at equipoise, which I can't say we are now, but I think it through ­­ if we are absolutely at equipoise, before turning to the rule of lenity, I would like your comment on my temptation to say at least here, the legislative history helps. And indeed ­­",
  "Indeed ­­",
  "­­ it isn't just a letter from the Justice Department. It is that the report, the way these are actually written is that a general idea is given to a person whose job it is to draft. And that drafter tries to put in words the general intention that's been described, and the report is used to describe what the general intention was. I'm not saying a hundred percent, but very often with technical statutes, that's how it works. So I read that report, and what do I discover? A repeat offender with a prior conviction under da­ta­da, or under any State child abuse law, or law relating to the production receipt or distribution of child pornography. And it is only two years later after they pass that that the Justice Department writes its letter noting that the provision they just passed involved individuals with prior convictions for child abuse. And recommending an enhanced penalty as well if they had a prior conviction for sexual abuse of a minor. Okay. So I read that and said, short, but clear. And that's what the drafter would have been looking at when ­­ the first one, anyway ­­ working with the staff of the committee when trying to translate general intentions of senators and representatives into actual language. And I think it's not contrary to popular belief to say that senators and representatives do hire staff to do such things and do not sit there with pen and pencil thinking, where does the \"or\" go? Okay? So what is ­­ what is the Justice Department's response to that?",
  "You asked a really quite broad ­­ I don't know what the 4,000 people over there are doing, if ­­ if they're not entrusted by their principals to write words on paper that would reflect the general idea. You think they can't do that?",
  "No. But it's followed by what could be taken as. They just gave it a different number; isn't that right? 2243 does, in fact, deal with minors?",
  "Right.",
  "Yes, yes, yes, yes. I ­­ I saw that.",
  "Well, she's saying why ­­ but they ­­ they do include the sexual abuse adult when you're talking about prior conviction of a Federal crime.",
  "And the answer, I guess, has to be that you ­­ the drafters know what they're getting into with the Federal crimes, and they have no idea what they're getting into when they're dealing with 50 State crimes. Is that your response?",
  "I'm not trying to put words in your mouth. I want to know what ­­ that's what I read in the ­­",
  "If you don't know ­­ I mean, I can't get anything out of the second sentence, to tell you the truth, because I think that a prison is usually within a single district. And so when you're worried about a multiple filer, what he does is he files about 15 cases in the same court. And ­­ and therefore, it's perfectly understandable why Congress would refer to multiple fees, because they are going to be like ten of them. It's the people they are really worried about are ­­ are what's at issue. So I can't get anything out of the second sentence. It's the first sentence that ­­ that is, it seems to me, both your strength and your weakness. There it talks about after payments of the ­­ the initial partial filing fee. Okay. It sounds as if it's talking about a case. And so what do we do about that? I mean, there it is. \"After the initial partial filing fee, the prisoner shall be required to make monthly payments of 20 percent,\" et cetera. That's where you have the word \"fee.\"",
  "I don't mean it's exclusive.",
  "I'm just giving you an explanation as to why they might have used the words \"fees,\" even though they previously defined a filing fee of $350.",
  "If you're clarifying it, $11, I guess you'd take a dollar. All right. I mean, what's unclear?",
  "They can't administer it that way. I mean, is there somebody who is administering this that way?",
  "And they are really doing that?",
  "Is there a way of interpreting the statute, which I think would make ­­ I ­­ I would guess, not in every case, where this multiple thing is likely to arise is where: Files a frivolous case, it's dismissed by the district court, and then he takes an appeal. Okay? There we have two. And so the question is ­­ he has to get the filing fee. Then the next slot is going to be, like, 20 percent or 40 percent, right? But you should leave him with $10. Given the purpose of the statute, which is to stop these frivolous suits, or at least make it a little tougher, doesn't it make sense, say, what I just said: Leave him with the $10, but you can take the 40 percent: 20 percent for one court, 20 percent for the other? Now, maybe what I've just said doesn't make sense. To me, it makes sense at the moment. But it would ­­ it would both leave him with the $10, but allow the clerks to collect the 20 percent for the district court, 20 percent for the Court of Appeals. Is ­­ is that impossible to bring about?",
  "You can interpret it the other way, linguistically. You say, you forward the 20 percent each time the amount in the account exceeds $10. Well, the instant you write that check, you say, it ­­ it does not exceed $10, and therefore you can't forward it. So you can't write that kind of a check. I mean, isn't that literally ­­",
  "Well, now we're getting into the technicalities of banking ­­",
  "­­ which ­­ so ­­ so I ­­ I ­­ I think you can read it the way I suggested, if you're not too technical about it. It seems consistent with the language.",
  "You say the word \"fees.\" What about the word \"fees\"? Does that show?",
  "Anyway, why can't you read it that way? You forward the payment each time the amount exceeds $10. Forwarding it consists of pressing an electronic button. And so the instant you press that button, it does not exceed $10. And there we have it. So there is a way of construing the language which is consistent with the obvious purpose to me, which is to leave this prisoner with at least $10.",
  "We might get to this question, but at some point somebody is going to have to say whether you do have a substantial claim.",
  "Is it?",
  "Because?",
  "Because?",
  "Well, they ­­ they want to raise about as important a question as you can imagine. They want to say, reading Vieth, that the State legislators are forbidden to draw district boundaries the way that has been done here. I take it that's their basic claim. And if they are right, that would affect congressional districts and legislative districts throughout the nation. So what reason could Congress have had for saying, although we want three­judge courts to decide these kind of cases generally, where the single­most important issue that could possibly be raised ­­ I exaggerate only slightly ­­ is raised, that kind of issue is for a single judge?",
  "Bailey is ­­ I mean, Bailey was the mirror­image case. I mean, it was a case where some African­American plaintiffs were saying they have a constitutional right to travel without discrimination in interstate commerce, as I read it. And they convened a three­judge court because they wanted to set aside Mississippi law to the contrary, in 1961. And the court said, but it's absolutely clear that a statute that requires segregation is unconstitutional. So this shouldn't have even been heard by a three­judge court because there has to be some kind of an issue. And the words it uses are it doesn't require a three­judge court when the claim that a statute is unconstitutional is wholly insubstantial.",
  "He's speaking nonexistent. And they said it's nonexistent because it's clear what the Federal law was. I mean, that was the nature. So ­­ so I don't see how that helps you.",
  "That's true, but I mean, they put down a standard as to whether or not a three­judge court is necessary. And they say a three­judge court is not necessary when the reason for giving the three­judge court ­­ you know, if it's ­­ if it's insubstantial. In that case you have to have a three­judge court, I guess, when there's some constitutional issue. They said there is no constitutional issue, not because it was frivolous or from Mars, but for the opposite reason: The law was clear.",
  "Yes.",
  "All right. So here his ­­ I guess you're going to think certainly, he's not clearly right, and the question is, is he clearly wrong.",
  "I ­­ as far ­­ as far as I understand it, his strongest argument on the other side would roughly go ­­ he didn't put it this way ­­ like this: On your side is the fact, well, why wouldn't a three­judge court decide a very important question of law in this area? On the other side of it is that, well, you just have left, in three­judge courts primarily, almost exclusively, reapportionment issues, which are specially political. And to put these all, you know, they are very ­­ because of the opinions you point out in Vieth, there's a huge variation of all kinds of different legal claims that might be made. And if there is a set of cases where this Court should be careful as to when and how and which it enters in which order, i.e., discretion, if we accept your view, that set of cases where we should be particularly careful as to how we proceed will be the set of cases where we have no choice and we have to take immediately whatever variations on the theme of disproportionate gerrymandering, da da da, whatever order they happen to arise and whenever they happen to arise, because we have no choice.",
  "Why can't ­­ in a case where there's no time problem ­­ forget the delays and so forth ­­ but like this one, the Plan sue the lawyer? I mean, if there was $500,000 and the lawyer received 200,000 ­­ but he certainly received it with notice. It's not any kind of good­faith purchaser ­­ why can't they get it back from him?",
  "Why couldn't they normally in my situation?",
  "All right. If they could, then doesn't that solve the problem for them because lawyers will be awfully careful not to dissipate the funds if, in fact, they're going to be subject to the lawsuit?",
  "I don't see why it would be. There is a fund. The fund belongs to person X. The lawyer knows it belongs to person X. Nonetheless, the lawyer takes $200,000 out of the money that belongs to person X and gives 300,000 to the client. I assume the client is more likely to spend money down than the lawyer, because lawyers tend, in general, to have a larger bank account than poorer clients. So therefore, I do not see why they wouldn't sue the lawyer. But they aren't, so there's something I didn't understand; hence, I am asking the question.",
  "I'm ­­",
  "­­ thinking in my mind ­­",
  "There is a model. There is a ­­ two diamond rings belonging to a trustee. They end up being given to the cousin. The lawyer has them in his safe. I do not believe that no matter what the agreement between the cousin and the lawyer, the lawyer can take the diamond ring that belongs to somebody else ­­ and he knows it ­­ and put it in his pocket, no matter what the agreement.",
  "So I ­­ I found a list. On this list I have, one, there is the fund, 500,000 in it. It belongs to the company, not to him. Now, he takes the fund and he begins to distribute it with the aid of his lawyer. Some of the money goes to the lawyer. If that money is still there, I imagine you could get it. Some of the lawyer's goes to his bank account. If, in fact, that bank account has not gone, from the time he put it there to the time you sue, below $121,000, you can get it. Indeed ­­ and if it has gone below, you can still get it even if there's a penny, but you can only get the penny. If he has taken the 121,000 out of it and given it to a person with knowledge, for example, his wife or children, and it is in their bank account, I guess you could get it. And indeed, if they have got and bought with it some tangible item that you can trace it to, I guess you can get it. But what we could not find and, in fact, if you can't find any of those, you could still sue him under State law, under State fraud statutes, and recover in damages. That's at law. And maybe you can do it even under such a remedy where it's much more mixed up than the other side was prepared to give you credit for, in which case, you have State law remedies at law. Now, what I could not find is a case embodying the theory you are now advancing, that he simply gets the damages even where he doesn't have any of the remedies that I just mentioned.",
  "Right. So Mt. Clemens says exactly this. I'll read it. I think it's correct. \"Where\" ­­ \"Where an employee's records of time worked are,\" quote, \"'inaccurate or inadequate'\" ­­ that's your case, right? ­­ \"then the employee attempting to bring a claim can show time worked by producing sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just and reasonable inference.\" That's what it says to do.",
  "And then it says the employer can't complain that the damages lack the exactness and precision of measurement that would be possible had he kept records. But he didn't. So they used some statistics to show it. What's wrong with that?",
  "Yeah.",
  "Well, they did through statistics. I mean ­­",
  "I mean, you say an antitrust case. Okay. Let's imagine an antitrust case. There's an agreement among sneaker manufacturers to use shoddy material. And large customers, distributors buy these shoddy materials. They're hurt. How much are they hurt? It depends on how many sneakers their employees used and when and so forth. There is no way people don't keep sneaker records, so what we do is we hire a statistician to use sampling. And if he's a good statistician and uses sampling correctly, we have probably a better measure than if we asked the employees to go back and remember how many sneakers they wore and what days and what hours 50 years ago.",
  "Well, some of them, it might turn out, actually did not wear sneakers during the period of time that the conspiracy has been shown to exist. But we didn't know that at the beginning because we thought we could prove a conspiracy from January to December, but we only ended up proving it from January until June. Now, there we have it. We put them in the class to begin with because we thought we could prove injury. As it turns out, we can't. Now, I ­­ I've never heard that you had to be able to know exactly how you're going to win your case when you form the class action because you don't know quite what the proof will be. I mean, isn't that how class actions work?",
  "Why not?",
  "But why decertify the class? If we've shown or we do show the conspiracy lasted from January until June, not through December? Some people will recover; other people will not recover. Can't we wait until the evidence is presented before we tell the people who didn't ­­",
  "­­ buy the sneakers, then you don't recover?",
  "I'm still having the same problem. When I heard Justice Scalia's question, I thought the answer is of course you can put in your class people whom, it will turn out, are not hurt. I have a class of people who were hurt by a price­fixing conspiracy that lasted from January to December. That's what I said. I have good reason to think it. But I prove it only lasted until June. That's a failure of proof. Half of them were not hurt, okay? So we don't pay them.",
  "I thought that's the most common thing in the world. Am I wrong? Is it not?",
  "That's right.",
  "Yes.",
  "But I'm actually puzzled by the same thing. So put yourself in my puzzlement. The ­­ there is a green room, a yellow room, and a blue room, all right? Now, we discover with our statistical experts that in the green room, doffing and donning, those people on average ­­ some more, some less ­­ but the sampling shows it's half an hour. In the blue room, it's 20 minutes. In the yellow room, it's 10 minutes. So, we add those three numbers on to green room, yellow room, and blue room people. And we get a number. Now, that number in individual cases will be wrong, but that's what averaging is about. And if there is no other proof in the case, well, is that good enough?",
  "Is that the substantive issue?",
  "Okay.",
  "Then skip it.",
  "Okay. So that's exactly, perhaps, what I ­­ I read the question, the first question. I'm taking it literally. It said, \"Whether differences among individual class members may be ignored, liability and damages will be determined with statistical techniques that assume everyone is like the average.\" Now, I thought the answer to that question is yes, and it depends, of course; you have to be reasonable. I mean, that's why you use the four rooms. We don't know everybody in the room. What we do is we take an average in the room. If it's a good statistical average, why not? Now, I want ­­ I don't want you to agree with that if that isn't the law, but I don't see why it isn't.",
  "Why is that the principle? The principle ­­ they're talking about money that doesn't belong to the defendant.",
  "It belongs to Smith or Jones of the bank. Now, let's try that principle in a case where it's the defendant's money. The principle is that the government, without proving that he's guilty of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt, can take all his money. Oh, because he might be fined. I've never heard of such a principle, frankly. I've just never heard of it. Now, if there is some case that says ­­",
  "So ­­ now I can imagine ­­",
  "I can go from there and find interests on both sides, da, da, da.",
  "Yes.",
  "I ­­ I understood that. I just wanted to try it with the facts here. I mean, the first principle is if, in fact, the defendant has somebody else's money that he's taken unlawfully, and he has to give it up at the end of the trial, we can make him give it up at the beginning to make sure it's there. Now let's try it with the facts here. If a defendant has some money, which maybe he will have to pay in a fine, what we'll do is we'll take all his money away before he's been convicted beyond a reasonable doubt. Okay. That's the difference in the propositions. And I'm saying it's pretty hard for me to think in a country which says that before he's convicted, you have to release him on bail except in unusual circumstances, that nonetheless, you can take all his money away so he can't hire a lawyer. I know that's a little simpleminded, but nonetheless, that seems fairly basic. I don't know where it comes from.",
  "That's correct. That is the principle, and now we make a number of exceptions. And one exception is if you think he's going to ­­ I mean, I can think of exceptions where we do keep people in jail. That is, of course, right. And ­­ and here, what they're saying, I think, in essence is, let's try and think of an exception for this one. Pretty hard. And anyway, if there is one, what he wants to use the money for is to make sure he has a lawyer. It's called the Sixth Amendment. All right. Now, there we are. That's where I ­­ at this moment in my mind, that's where the case is.",
  "I think ­­ I think that's a ­­ what you say is, look, this is equivalent to the case where we keep the guy in jail because he might run away. That's your point. That's not a bad point. So I have on that on one side, and I have on the other side that he'd like to have a lawyer which is a Sixth Amendment right. So I have a suggestion that I want you to focus on. The suggestion is ­­ let's read this statute in light of what you've said, that there is an interest on your side and there is a constitutional amendment on the other side. Why can't we read this statute to say they accommodate those interests in this way? If they're going to run away from ­­ with the property, then the court has the authority to enjoin the alienation or disposition of property, say tainted, then you can ask for a restraining order to prohibit the prohibition, not just of the tainted property but also of property of equivalent value. If I read that without knowing the background, I would say a lot of cases come up where you get TROs, where they're not precise because you don't know exactly what property you're talking about. So what do you think about reading this statute to avoid the constitutional question to say the TRO means TRO? And a TRO means where there's some property out there and it may be tainted, mixed up with the untainted, you can get a TRO on the whole thing. You have to have a speedy hearing. He has to be represented. And your purpose of that is to separate the two kinds of assets. That seems to me to work for the purpose, and it also avoids the constitutional question.",
  "Can you get back ­­ you had two responses to my reading of the statute. I heard the first, and I didn't hear the second.",
  "By the way, let me ­­ let me remind you ­­",
  "But I want to say it, because maybe you can focus on this. We're in before the judge on a TRO. Our object of the TRO is to separate the assets that are not this man's from the assets that are this man's. So we do that separation. Now we say $10,000 is not his, it's the bank's. $15,000 or $10,000 over here is totally his; he's never been convicted of the crime. What's the government's interest? And why can't he take this other, once we've had the TRO ­­",
  "­­ to separate it?",
  "I know. It says restraining order ­­",
  "­­ and my suggestion is we read those words \"restraining order\" as \"temporary restraining order,\" which (3)(b), it seems to me, clearly permits, but we can get into that argument. I'll worry about that later.",
  "I want to know what your second response was to that.",
  "So what they can do is this? If we read this literally under (B), that Mr. Smith is indicted for a banking law violation, he has $100,000 of other people's money. The government can say that the order ­­ the restraining order of the Court prohibits his wife, any other client, the milk man, anyone in the world, from taking, not the $100,000 that belongs to the bank, but any other $100,000 that he got for any other purpose, I guess including his retirement fund, including no matter what. I mean, that is ­­ goes ­­ it seems to me that's what it says ­­ any other person from taking property of equivalent value, and he hasn't been convicted of anything.",
  "Well, this is ­­ this is innocent money, the defendant's, not the money he obtained as a result of the violation. The money he didn't obtain, that's what this case is about.",
  "Have you seen ­­ have you seen the judgments in the fraud on the market cases? I mean, it isn't too tough in cases involving fraud on the market to find judgments of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, I mean, judgments in fines after convictions, and that's what, I think, the question is. The principle of constitutional law that you're advocating would, in fact, permit the freezing of what might be paid afterwards in a fine which could be a huge amount before the person is convicted. Am I right?",
  "That sounds like what you're saying ­­ I don't understand the point. What Justice Scalia said seems right. It's charged. You have to find A and B. Therefore, they must have found A. The indictment, superseding indictment charged A. The statute says A. Okay? So we know they found A. Now, what's the problem?",
  "The problem seems to have been that they were also charged that they had to find B. Fine. They made a mistake. Did you object? No. Was it harmless? It doesn't seem to me how it ­­ how could it have been harmful. I mean, I ­­ I think your problem is the problem with the extra B in the jury instruction. And so I would look to see what's your objection to B? Did you object? No. Then it must have been plain error. Well, it was ­­ it was erroneous, but was it harmful? Now, that I could understand, but you're arguing something else, and it is the something else that I don't understand.",
  "Is there anybody ­­ well ­­ well, I don't see the theory of it. The jury is instructed. You ­­ he is guilty of murder if he killed someone, da­da­da, and he had ­­ and he was looking at the ceiling. Okay? Doesn't make any sense. Okay. That was wrong. So now you're saying if the judge makes a mistake there, nobody objects, he says the wrong thing, and he was looking at the ceiling, you have to let the guy go because ­­ although he didn't hurt anybody, no harm, you still have to let him go. And I just need the \"why.\"",
  "It was not a case involving a jury instruction.",
  "To show that the charge met ­­ the charge ­­ the evidence proved the crime on either the statute or the indictment.",
  "Why formal? I mean, we've been through this many times. It comes up in all kinds of instances. People are always alleging ­­ not always but often allege that their counsel was inadequate. Sometimes it would be possible to know that on direct appeal, but in the mine­run of cases, you want to find out from the counsel why he did it.",
  "And therefore I think every circuit ­­ I don't know what this Court has said ­­ has said that you raise IAC claims in collateral proceedings. Now, if we start making exceptions from that, you're going to get a jurisprudence of when the exception comes up ­­",
  "­­ and when it doesn't and how clear does it have to be, and then we'll just add further delay because I guess if I were a court of appeals judge and I saw some obvious mistake, I would say, go file it tomorrow.",
  "Well, the matter complained of here is a constructive discharge. In a tort suit or many the matter complained of is negligent behavior leading to an injury. I take it in the tort suit the statute of limitations doesn't begin to run until there is harm.",
  "All right. If that's generally true in a tort suit, and my guess is in a contract suit for breach of contract, if the contracting party sent the ships out and you knew that it wouldn't be delivered, it's not actionable until it isn't delivered and I guess there are ways around that, but my point is generally in the law where the matter complained of is a certain kind of incident in the world, negligence leading to harm, action of a discriminatory, et cetera, nature that leads to a discharge, normally the statute of limitations begins to run when the harm occurs. Now why should it be any different here?",
  "Of course, he could have, but we're talking about only the constructive discharge part. I mean, sometimes defendants do seven bad things at once, or at least allegedly bad.",
  "And we're only talking about one of them, the one that we're talking about is the constructive­discharge claim. So I go back to my question about negligence, because that was the first course I took in law school so I remember that, but the ­­ the fact is why should we treat this any differently?",
  "Because you have to, as you said, in the a tort case it's not just that the person behaved negligently, but that negligence had to result in a harm.",
  "So I'm just ­­ that's the only simpleminded analogy I'm drawing and I wonder why it doesn't work.",
  "Wouldn't it run from the date of discharge because there would be an intent at ­­ as of that date?",
  "That's the ­­ now, I'm getting this more clearly because your response to my question, which is now relevant to this too, is, look, the plaintiff was hurt on the very day that last act was performed, indeed he suffered because he saw the act being performed, and that was one of the things that led him later to quit. So let's count that as the injury. And let's count the whole thing complete as of that time. That's basically the argument for your side, I think. And now the argument against you is that's going to be a nightmare. Because there will be in fact a whole range of acts, a whole series in many cases and will then, in order to run the statute of limitations, have to get into the question of which of those acts ­­ maybe there were some he didn't know about ­­ which of those acts actually did produce harm and which did not. And he just really won't know when to bring his lawsuit as compared with the comparatively simple thing: He quits.",
  "Yes, that's true.",
  "What is your response to her ­­ I think she's saying in most of these cases there is a hostile work environment. Where there is a hostile work environment you have 45 days from the last act, and so what we should do is look at this injury as simply one more injury caused by a hostile work environment. And just as you don't look at the date of injury there, you look to the environment, et cetera, we so do the same thing here. It's simpler, et cetera.",
  "Then they'll lose under ­­ they brought a claim ­­ look, is it a necessary ­­ as a Federal issue, Federal issue is whether what they've done violates Regulation SHO. They don't say that anywhere in the complaint, not even in paragraph 24, but you cite it, I read. This is background. They don't say anything about it, but is it necessary? Is it necessary for them to prevail that they prove a violation of Regulation SHO?",
  "What do they ­­",
  "I didn't ask you that. I asked what you thought.",
  "You think it is necessary.",
  "Fine. Fine. That's all I want to know.",
  "Now they presumably think it isn't necessary. Okay?",
  "So if it is necessary and you're right, then this case should have been brought under 1331.",
  "It wasn't, and we're not deciding that. So since we're not deciding it, we have to assume that it is not necessary.",
  "Okay? If we assume it is not necessary, if we assume that the conditions for 1331 are not met, and therefore it doesn't get into Federal court for that reason, why would anyone want a case like that in Federal court when the States want to adjudicate it?",
  "And what is the evidence that Congress wanted that?",
  "And all you're left with is, you say, read the language of the statute, don't look to the purpose, don't look to surrounding ­­ don't look to the surrounding rules of law which actually make very little necessity for this to be in Federal court, and don't look to anything else. You have your language.",
  "And I agree you have your language.",
  "You have the language. I'm not saying you're going to win on the language.",
  "Okay. Go ahead.",
  "So why ­­ why isn't the SEC here?",
  "Curious.",
  "That isn't what it's saying. It's saying they breached the duty of care that they owed to the plaintiffs to report suspicious transactions of naked short sales. That's the allegation under negligence. What duty of care? A duty of care imposed by New Jersey law? What New Jersey law?",
  "Or is it a duty of care imposed by SHO?",
  "Which State law?",
  "And so the exact words there that the duty of care is referring to are what?",
  "If you know.",
  "I see what you're saying.",
  "Okay. I ­­ I have a bigger ­­ a question that I can't get ­­ I can't figure out, and so I would like your help. Let's go through this. Let's suppose, for present purposes, that as I read through your complaint, I find words ­­ it's not the words we just said, but similar words somewhere, and I sink ­­ think, but there is nothing under New Jersey law unless New Jersey picks up SHO. All right? Why isn't that good enough on that matter to get them into Federal court in arising under cases?",
  "I'm doing it for argument because ­­",
  "­­ I'm really concerned about I can't clarify in my mind the difference between somebody being thrown out in an arising under case, and yet getting back in under Section 27. That's what doesn't make too much sense to me. If this is necessary ­­ the Federal issue is necessary for the plaintiffs to win, there's arising under jurisdiction. Then I don't know what to do with the word \"exclusive.\" But all that seems not to be in the case.",
  "So ­­ so then, if ­­ if it is not sufficient to get in under arising under, why in heaven's name should it be to get in under 27?",
  "You're not going to resist my conclusion, but you see, it's ­­ it's ­­ I ­­ I need clarification, because I'm not sure I've thought it through correctly.",
  "Right, something. And ­­ and don't tell me I'm right if you think it favors you, because maybe it does favor you, but I've got ­­ there will be other cases, you know, so sympathize a little with my problem.",
  "I'm looking for a way to see if we really have to answer all these difficult questions that have been raised, which are pretty tough. And so I was thinking, look, here's what you look to. Judge, see if it is a necessary thing, and if so, whether it falls under 1331. Okay? If it's an arising under claim under 1331, kick it out of State court and send it to Federal court. But if it isn't an arising under claim because it isn't necessary to winning for the plaintiff, forget about it. Keep it in State court. I don't care whether it's ­­ don't ­­ don't worry about whether the State passed it this way, or the State legislature referenced it by numbers or referenced it by ­­ don't worry about all that stuff. Just decide one question.",
  "Does it meet the four criteria for arising under? If so, kick it out. If not, keep it.",
  "That's true. I'm not looking in this case. I'm looking for the general rule.",
  "They benefitted, but the point is there is one court that says your Tribe can be a member. Your ­­ your Tribe didn't present its claim to the contracting officer. And so why can they be a member? The judge addresses that question, and he says, normally they couldn't be a member, but they can here because this is the kind of case that is attacking general practices of the administration. Then okay. Fine. You got that. Then shortly after that or maybe a few years after that, another case comes along. And the other case doesn't involve the situation of attacking the practices generally. It concerns the individual contracts between the Tribe and the Indian Bureau, what ­­ you know, in the government. And there they say, you can't have a class action. So you'd think ­­ and this kind of case you want to bring now is the second kind, not the first kind. So you'd say, why is it fair to let you bring this case? After all, if you'd read the opinion closely in the first one, you wouldn't have thought you should have waited. If you had any doubts about it, the second one would have told you you should have waited. And even beyond that, the administrator signs a piece of paper where they ask him: Do you have any claims under these contracts? And he says, none. So it doesn't seem to me you're talking about pure equities; you have very strong grounds. Now what's your reply to that?",
  "You probably wouldn't agree with any of them. But ­­ but ­­ but ­­",
  "You're not making that kind of claim here, are you? I mean, you're not challenging the general practices of the government. Rather, you're challenging the particular contracts and whether you got enough money under them. Is that right?",
  "If that's correct ­­",
  "Well, then the fact that the second case emphasized the general ­­ you know, the general attack, which lacks in your case, is more reason for thinking that we better file our claims quickly because what had ­­ they held in those two cases are not going to help us, who have an individual claim. We better do what the statute says or the rules, and we better file our presentment to the contracting officer and certainly not write the words \"none\" when they ask you if you have any claim; am I right?",
  "It is health care regulation. Vermont also has laws that govern fiduciaries. So could they have a statute which says all fiduciaries, including fiduciaries ­­ ERISA fiduciaries must report ­­ fill out the following forms about how they ­­ how they invest their money. Can they do that?",
  "No, no, no. Can they do just what I said? Is ­­ or is that preempted?",
  "Correct.",
  "Now, suppose, instead of that, what they say is, what we would like is that all fiduciaries of ERISA plans send us each month a report of all of the benefits under the retirement plan that they have paid to any member. Can they do that?",
  "So what they're doing is they have their ­­ their Secretary of Health and Human Services that would like to know how wealthy or poor the workers are. So that's why they do it.",
  "You think that's a close question?",
  "In other words, they can ­­ gee, I see case after case here that says that reporting requirements are a central function. You know, I ­­ you've read them just as well as I. And ­­ and it seems to me surprising that they can do that. Isn't that the job of the Labor Department.",
  "Because obviously, my question ­­ it's a good answer, because you're saying I'm not getting anywhere with this line of ­­ because you're ­­ because I'm going to say what about health care. That's the next question. My actual question I'm driving at is this: You should have the information. I have no doubt about that. But the question is whether you have to go to the Labor Department first or HHS and say, we want uniform rules here, or whether they have to come to you when the rules of 50 States turn out to be a mess. And you ­­ you ­­ you say you want to go first and let them come after me, and I think the other side says no. If you want to do what you want to do, go to the Labor Department, get a national rule that gives you large range to get what you want.",
  "And I don't know the answer to that question. That's why I ask it.",
  "But this is no problem for you. All you have to do is go to DOL or HHS. The State representative says, this is what we want to do, will you please promulgate a regulation. ­­ you can do it maybe in 90 days or 120 days ­­ which says that this and similar things are fine. And in our opinion, it is not ­­ it is not preempted. I think you could do that. That's my opinion. I may be the only one who thinks that. So I ­­ I think it's just a question of which forms you have to go through. But if we take you and say, I'm going to ask ­­ I'm really asking the government this question, because I don't see why they're on your side, and they'll have an answer to that. See, I want to find out. But what I want to find out is this: The factor I saw was 93 million people have these plans. And if 93 million people have these plans, there can be 50 States with 50 different sets of regulations imposing a huge financial burden upon health care. And were that to happen, suddenly all the people we're trying to help under this plan will find themselves much worse off, and purely for bureaucratic reasons. If I take their side of it, I can have some assurance that the purpose of Congress in these statutes will be fulfilled, because there will not be unnecessary, conflicting reporting requirements, which sound like nothing, but they're very expensive to ­­ to actually implement. Now, that's my basic problem. The same question for you, for the government, and for the other side, but the other side will agree with the way I put the question.",
  "You're not going to collect anything. All they're going to say is in our reg, you have permission to go and impose these requirements. But by having to go to them first, we prevent the conflicting requirements of 50 different systems.",
  "I'm only asking. My point ­­",
  "Why aren't you on the other side of the case? That is, I was fine with you until I read a few of these amicus briefs, and then suddenly I saw 93 million people. And there are associations all over the place that are worried about this problem. And they have a big chart where they show the possibilities of ­­ of conflict. You yourself are worried about conflict. Conflict among States in requirements means money. A lot of money. That's what they say, and that's plausible. So what I want to know is: What do you all propose to do about that in the U.S. government? One thing to do about it ­­ and I've looked up the regs, so maybe Justice Scalia disagrees, but I'm talking about what I think. All right? The ­­ the ­­ it seems like they would have authority to issue regs either way; blocking, or getting permission first. That's where I ended up, and that's what I wanted your view about. You see what I'm saying?",
  "But you have pages 26 and 27 of the Blue Cross Blue Shield brief. And there they have a big chart, and there are all these organizations out there that are trying, like the Uniform Law Commissioners, to create uniformity. That's why I say that's why I'm puzzled as to what to do. Am I supposed to write an opinion that says even though Blue Cross Blue Shield feels it's a big mess and trying to straighten it out, they didn't make the right record in the Vermont trial court? How do I write that opinion?",
  "I mean, I'm serious. How do I write the opinion? I suppose it could happen, but it hasn't happened yet. How do I write the opinion?",
  "What about the converse ­­",
  "What about the converse? What about the converse point for you that I was making before? The number that jumped out from the page is the 93 million people this affects. Now, that's a huge number, and therefore the risk of conflicting regulations is serious ­­",
  "­­ in raising costs. That's for you. But they say it hasn't been shown yet ­­",
  "­­ so I ask you: If it does come about, if it should come about and you lost this case, why can't your clients go right to the Department of Labor, whose regulations I've read, or possibly ACCA, and say, we want you to impose a uniform national data collection system or the equivalent, put limits, and then preempt the conflicting State limits? Now, it may be other members of the Court do not agree with this approach, but I've written a case, MetroMedia, where I think the agencies have a lot of power there, and I think they have more capacity to decide this kind of thing than a group of judges. So what about that for you?",
  "Why can't you do this?",
  "Why can't you ­­ why can't you simply go ­­ and the statute says, 1143(a)(1) ­­ the statute says that the Secretary of Labor and the authorities ­­ broad in these ­­ has authority to undertake surveys and collect, compile, analyze, publish data information and statistics on welfare plans. Okay? That's ERISA welfare plans. So you go to them.",
  "And you say, DOL, we want you to promulgate a reg that says you will collect some of this information, but even if you collect ­­ don't collect it all, you let the States collect the rest.",
  "Now, they can prevent it from being burdensome.",
  "But this ­­",
  "I don't see ­­ this is not ­­ go ahead.",
  "You might think this is not sane, but what I'm ­­ the way I'm seeing it here is there are two competing problems. One is they should be able to get information like this in the States. But two, there is a problem of burden. And I think there are probably 100 or 200 people in Department of Labor and HHS that could write regs that reconcile those problems and allow both. But I can't, because I'm a judge. So what I'm trying to figure out is how to interpret this statute in a way that achieves those objectives.",
  "What's wrong with the tribal courts?",
  "All right. Fine. So ­­ so we've seen lots of tribal courts, which I can't distinguish them in the fairness and procedure and so forth from every other court in the country, and maybe there's some where that isn't true.",
  "So what ­­ what you do is you go and complain, we didn't get due process of law.",
  "If you're in one of the ones that has some unusual thing about it. But if you're in a normal thing, you say, it's normal. So what's wrong with saying just that?",
  "Like a State court which has terrible procedures, terribly unfair, or a foreign court. You complain you didn't get proper process. But that has nothing to do with this case.",
  "Or little.",
  "You can do it both ways. And there are books, some of which I have at least looked through, and certainly articles that suggest that the tribal courts function perfectly well, certainly in many places. Now, I take it your argument is that there are some places they don't function well, and in respect to matters that are not matters of Federal law, there won't be review from those courts unless you collaterally attack them. Is that your point?",

  "Well, they are not totally bizarre. It flows from the principle in Nevada that the State maintained the sovereign power to define the jurisdiction of its own courts, which is also an important sovereign power. So if you look at that power, then you have to say, well, what is it in the Federal Constitution that limits or takes away that sovereign power? So that's, I think, where I'm left after Nevada. And now you have a whole set of arguments, but they require us, for the most part, to overrule several cases.",
  "Well, I'd like to get your response to the second part of this. Because your ­­ I mean, I ­­ I do ­­ that's ­­ I'm finding that rather hard, and it seems to me intuitively at some level correct that a State like Nevada should not be able to give less sovereign immunity to California than it gives its own officials. So I thought, well, where in heaven's name does that come from? And that's what's bothering me, and I'd like a theory. I have ­­ all I have so far is this: Full faith and credit, two statutes, sometimes exist. And there is also, when you're giving full faith and credit, the competing principle that, if you have a policy of your own State that cuts the other way and it's reasonable and so forth, you don't give full faith and credit. And here, if you're following that kind of principle, the same kind of principles in the Congress clause too, you would say, fine. Nevada, since it doesn't give its own people the sovereign immunity, doesn't have to recognize California's because of the public policy it's following. But as soon as they run out of sovereign immunity, which is at $50,000, I think, now they have no reason, and therefore they have to follow California's law. Now, I raise that because it's in the back of my mind. I've been thinking about it. And I don't find in the briefs either that theory or a competing theory about why you can't ­­ you ­­ you see where I'm going?",
  "I'd love your view on that.",
  "Right.",
  "If ­­ if ­­ I don't want ­­",
  "Well, I ­­ I ­­ I just want you at some point to give three minutes ­­ I mean, I will accept for argument's sake that the great issue in Philadelphia in 1787 was a division of power between the Federal government and the States, not questions of what States could do in respect to each other. And they wrote what they wrote, but that's what they're thinking of. And you're saying the second is what's at issue here.",
  "And therefore ­­ therefore ­­",
  "­­ we have two cases on it. We went through the whole thing. At the very least, don't open it. All right. I'll accept ­­ or don't go back because it's at least not that clear. And therefore, I'll accept that. Now, I would like just two minutes on what's bothering me. And what is bothering me is I really don't see how Nevada can say, we're going to give immunity to our own State but we won't accept California's similar immunity. Now, that doesn't seem intuitively right, but if I look at the Constitution, I see it says this. It says: \"Full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public acts of other States.\" California has a public act which gives immunity. Nevada is not giving full faith and credit to that. I think those acts can sometimes include statutes or common law rules or decisions of courts. So I say, how does Nevada get away with that? Answer: Because they have a strong public policy in not doing it; namely, the policy of they don't give anybody, including their own officials, that kind of immunity. If that's the answer, that answer runs out of steam at the very point that they try to give officials more immunity than California is giving. Now, you see how I've lined up that legal reasoning with what seems intuitive. But I have no idea, to tell you the truth, about whether there is precedent for that; about what that might, in fact, get us into trouble on; or et cetera. So I would ­­ you must have thought through this. If I look in the briefs, the answer to this question of equal treatment ­­ I can't find much.",

  "What it says, actually, in Brown v. Thomson, it says our decisions have established, as a general matter, that an apportionate plan with a maximum population deviation under 10 percent falls within this category of minor deviations.

So that's the holding of the Court. And this seems to be within the category of minor deviations where you have to make out ­­ you have to do something more than you would have to do if it were a ­­ larger than 10 percent.",

One is, I know there is this 10 percent rule, but it doesn't say we don't look at it at all. We institutionally can't review thousands of pages of record in every redistricting case. So what are the words there that describe the standard we should bring to this? And the second, which is a direct application of the first, is you're quite right. How can we say that partisanship can't be used at all when you're doing one­person, one­vote but the sky is the limit. Vieth.",
  "When in fact ­­ of course, I dissented there. I ­­ but the sky is the limit when you're drawing boundaries. Now, how do we reconcile ­­ how do we reconcile our institutional ability with the need to have some policing here? And how do we reconcile what we say in this case with what we've held in the line­drawing area?",
  "Now, those ­­ those are two questions in the back of my mind, and I'd like to have your position.",
  "Well, I didn't ask you what we shouldn't say. I asked you what we should say.",
  "Look at the finding to support what the ­­ the Chief Justice is drawing there. While partisanship played a role in the increased population deviation associated with changing District 8, so, too, did the preclearance goal play a role in motivating the change. It's the first half of the sentence which is raising the issue that I think people are trying to ­­ to get you to say how we write that. You see? Because it says it played a role. And so we're going to be asked here by the other side to expand on what that means, \"play a role,\" and we have to write an opinion. And if you win this case, there will have to be words that support you. And so how do we take this thing? What would you say about the words \"play a role\"?",
  "I took it that the position of the United States is at least, since many commissions are nonpartisan because they have two people who are more partisan on one side, two people on the other side and one neutral.

So I don't think the court really considered this. But if you step back from the Equal Protection Clause and say there are other parts of the Constitution that, in fact, are relevant here ­­ maybe it's the Republican Form of Government Clause. But the words that Justice Kagan read are words about what kind of democracy people wanted. And those words say if you look to other parts of the Constitution, such as those, or Republican Form of Government, that what we actually want is the kind of democracy where people, whether they choose to vote or whether they don't choose to vote, are going to receive a proportionate representation in Congress. And if you take that as a constitutional principle, that shows an objective of some of the clauses of the Constitution. Then you have to retreat from the idea that the Equal Protection Clause, as interpreted in Reynolds v. Sims, solves this case. And indeed, it argues against you.",

  "Yeah. Because the ­­ the necessity is not the necessity you're talking about. It's the ­­ as I read it. I mean, you use words like \"critical mass\" and so forth. It sounds like a cloud of sort of you don't know what they're talking, but as I read further into it, it becomes quite specific, that is, 75 percent of the students are at this university because they were in the top 10 percent of their class. And it doesn't take long before students and faculty in particular situations know who is who. 25 percent of the students in that class are admitted; they're good students, not in the top 10 percent on the basis of leadership, activities, awards, work experience, community service, family's economic status, school status, family responsibilities, single­parent home, languages other than English spoken at home, SAT score relative to school's average and race occasionally, too. Okay? We're talking about that 25 percent. And it won't take long before students in a class see that in that 25 percent, which means you aren't just in the top 10 percent of your class, in that 25 percent there is hardly anybody who is African­American or Hispanic. And the ­­ and seven years of experience with that kind of thing led the faculty at meetings, administrators, and others to say, we should do more to see that that 25 percent has occasionally somebody who is a minority.",
  "That's what their program is. It isn't something like critical mass, et cetera. And ­­ and ­­ and if you have to say, it seems to me, why is that not a diversity­related judgment of what is necessary?",

  "Every school is like that. Every school in the country that's a college that I've ever experienced is a combination of grades, class position, and a lot of other things.",

  "No, but that's exactly the question, I think. I would ­­ I can put the same question ­­ or suppose we do send it back to the district court and, put in more evidence, we tell them. Suppose we did that. And suppose they start with the basic plan where we want to use race is in the 25 percent of the holistic area. We want to do that. Now, they're using the chart ­­ and I've seen the chart ­­ of the factors that are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. You know, using that chart. I've seen the chart. And at the bottom of the chart in my list is the word \"race.\" It says \"race,\" r­a­c­e. Okay? What kind of evidence, in your opinion, could they or anyone else with any roughly similar plan put in that would show, in your view, that this is constitutional?",
  "All right. So we have one. But I'm looking ­­",
  "I have one. I have one.",
  "What you're saying is you should look at the two folders, and as a kind of tiebreaker, use race. That, to you, is okay. Now, is there ­­ you said there is several others? It would be helpful if you ­­ if you can summarize them in a sentence, so I get an idea of what the others are.",
  "That's not to use race. I'm saying r­a­c­e, race. I want to know which are the things they could do that, in your view, would be okay. Because I'm really trying to find out.

  "We know that ­­ can you ­­ can you say this? Let me read you two phrases from Fisher I. The first phrase says this: \"The decision to pursue\" ­­ and Fisher I, obviously, put together a court of people who don't agree necessarily on affirmative action. Generally we agreed on those words. Words 1: \"The decision to pursue the educational benefits that flow from student diversity is in substantial measure an academic judgment to which some, but not complete, judicial deference is proper.\" Okay? Now, words No. 2: The University must provide a, quote, \"reasoned, principled explanation for the academic decision to pursue diversity.\" Your plan is pursuing diversity among the 25 percent who are not admitted under the Top 10 Plan. Your principled, reasoned explanation for that academic decision is?",
  "That's right. But there's ­­",
  "Just before, you ­­ you said ­­ I agreed with you, of course, that is what the Court said, the reasoned explanation. And it also said that this is a matter to which this Court will give some, but not complete, deference to what the University decides. What you're talking about is the need for the program. In addition to that ­­ and this is what I'd like you to focus on, because there could be a question of whether to send it back for more evidence or not. So in looking through the record so far, on this specific point, I found an affidavit by a person named Walker, and that person named Walker described seven years of efforts to measure this stuff; described meetings of the faculties; described all kinds of discussions; described conclusions of the faculty members, and the admissions officers, and others, that you did need ­­ you did need affirmative action in the 25 percent of the not ­­ of ­­ of the holistic part. Now, given that that's there, and I found nothing to the contrary, is there a need for another ­­ I mean, this is a loaded question, but I am curious. If you say \"yes,\" because ­­ I mean, you know, there may be something that you should put in as well. You may think it would help to put something in. You may think it's not necessary. But just to be safe, what do you think?",
  "Is that affidavit the relevant one? Are there others?",
  "If ­­ if I can ask a question.",
  "No. I'm glad you said that. And ­­ and I ­­ this question will sound very nitpicky and detailed and ­­ compared to what you were talking about. And I agree. I notice that the briefs in this case are like the briefs in Grutter. And to me that does suggest that people in the universities and elsewhere are worried that we will, to use your colleague's expression, kill affirmative action through a death by a thousand cuts. We promised in Fisher I that we wouldn't. That opinion by seven people reflected no one's views perfectly. But that's what it says: Not fatal in fact. Okay. That's what I'm focusing on. It seems to me there are two parts to that, whether we have to send it back for another hearing or not. Part one you've dealt with. That's is there a need? A matter which Fisher I says we will give some but not complete deference to the University, and as you say, we have ­­ you went through that. There is a second part which I want you to address. The second part in Fisher, we said, there is no deference due the University. On this part it's called narrow tailoring. You heard your friend on the other side admit, he said, again. Maybe he believes it firmly. Why use the word \"admit\"? He said that, in the plans of Grutter and the plans of Bakke, those were okay in respect to narrow tailoring because they did compare the students one after another and use race as a plus factor. Now, what is there in this record that will support the view that what Texas has done in respect to narrow tailoring is no worse than, perhaps even better than, what happened in Grutter or Bakke?",
  "And you think all the Fourth Amendment cases, in your opinion, are correct. I mean, you know, the police can go search a car, the good faith rule in respect to admission of evidence that was seized unlawfully under the Fourth Amendment. I read a lot of criticism of those things in the paper. And it seems to me you could get people who are judges, who are up here, who thought that the Fourth Amendment should be really extended and, in fact, there should be no rule that gives police any special authority to search a car.",
  "There should be no rule that stops any incidents from coming in. I mean, there are dozens of cases where this Court has denied individual rights. And you're saying all those cases are now free of any stare decisis inhibition. Is that the point, or is it just labor unions?",
  "Well, wait. Well, what about the Eighth Amendment? That's a good one. There's an individual right, some think, perhaps, against capital punishment. The Court has consistently ruled against it. So I guess if that's ever considered again, under your view, the Court would give no weight to stare decisis.",

  "I have a different ­­ somewhat different subject, but it ­­ and I don't know how to get you to focus on this exactly. Because I ­­ I think there are good arguments on your side, and there are good arguments on the other side. When you go into this, it was, in my view, a kind of compromise 40 years ago. But it was 40 years ago. It was 40 years ago. I mean, maybe Marbury v. Madison was wrong. There are people who argue certain aspects were. And the concerns I ­­ I have in terms of workability are not so much the details. I guess something would work out in the labor area. It would certainly affect the bar. It would certainly affect the integrated bar. It would certainly affect at least student fees at universities. It would require overruling a host of other cases, I think, at least two or three that I can find, and that's quite a big deal.",
  "And so ­­ so what is it, in your mind, that you can say from the point of view of this Court's role in this society in that if, of course, we can overrule a compromise that was worked out over 40 years and has lasted reasonably well ­­ not perfectly. I guess people could overrule our decisions just as easily. I've had a few dissents. In those dissents I think I'm right and the others are wrong, and then think I'm wrong and they're right. All right? There are a lot of people who think that. Do you see where I'm going? I'd like you to talk for a minute, because it is a matter of considerable concern to me, even when I'm on the other side of something.",
  "And you ­­ you start overruling things, what happens to the country thinking of us as a kind of stability in ­­ in a world that is tough because it changes a lot.",
  "Well, I ­­ I ­­",
  "I'll accept that. Let me accept that what you can do is you can go through ­­ and you're good at it, and so is the other side. You know, you go through the cases and you draw the line here, there, and the other place. And I'm trying to abstract from that in a very basic way for this reason. I think Plessy v. Ferguson was a case that certainly should have been overruled. It certainly should have been overruled because it was basic, because it was a right to treat people equally, and there were millions of people who were not. Now, you see the level of abstraction I'm working at? Now, if I put that same level of abstraction here, I see the following: You will go out this door, and you will buy hundreds of things, if not thousands, where money will go from your pocket into the hands of people, including many government people, who will spend it on things you disagree with. I don't see anything too basic in the lines you're drawing there. The second thing is, what you said was ­­ and it's true ­­ employees can say what they want. We're talking about six people in a room bargaining about wages, hours, and working conditions. That's pretty far removed from the heart of the First Amendment, and pretty close to ordinary physical activity carried on through words. Regulation, if you like. So I can't find a basic principle that's there that's erroneous as in these major cases that we have overruled. And if you have a response to that, I'd like to hear it.",
  "There's something other than that. That would be the same as Justice Scalia's question which raised an issue, and we heard it before. Your ­­ your ­­ your last colleague mentioned this. California needs this rule that it has, because it wants, on the other side of the bargaining table, a coherent group of people to negotiate for the workers on wages, hours, working conditions, et cetera. Now, the Chief Justice said, I can understand that argument if the alternative is the union is destroyed, because then there's nobody. And you say that that argument's a good argument because they're going to buy fire trucks and some other things. Is there anything else that backs up that argument?",
  "I think it's important, and I'd like you to explain it.",
  "Do you think you can ­­ I mean, obviously one thing that's come up is ­­ I know that you're right on this ­­ the Thaler law was a mess. It was strike after strike. But what you would like to show is that that approach, compared to the assessment of wage­, hour­, and working­condition­related fees, that the latter makes an improvement in the coherence of the union's position, and therefore there will be of your strikes. That's something like that is what you're arguing, and I would guess that people would have written articles about that now, and ­­ and ­­ if that's so.",
  "All right. My argument to you was, do you want to put information in the record on that point?",
  "I guess ­­ isn't it ­­ is ­­ you may know ­­ the case in which government as employer is most likely to want to control what the employee says and where he has the right to do that is likely to be a case that involves the institution's job, i.e., the public interest.",
  "Well, no. It actually said ­­ so I've been looking at this because it puzzles me what standard we're supposed to use. He does say there's no evidence that the two eyewitnesses knew each other, had any reason to conspire and fabricate their testimony. Next sentence: \"Therefore, in light of these identifications, the trial court's speculation\" ­­ this is page 128 ­­ \"the trial court's speculation as to defendant's motive for assaulting Nelson will be construed as harmless error.\" Error. And the judge who's dissenting doesn't deny that it's error. He says it's error. He just doesn't think it's harmless. So now we have a case where it looks like the only words I can find on this in Illinois concede that it's error. Or they say it's error. Indeed, they say it's harmless error. Therefore, the issue is harmlessness. What am I supposed to do? What standard do I apply out of 2254 if in fact they think it's error? Or even if they didn't decide it and we ­­ it's debatable, obviously ­­ we think it's error; we don't have to give them any deference, I guess. How does it work?",
  "But that's not what the State says. The State says you read the relevant three sentences: The issue was you have a 17­year­old youth on a bike who is a drug dealer; who Larry Owens knew he was a drug dealer. Larry Owens wanted to knock him off. I think the State's evidence has proved that fact. You see? So two members of the Illinois Supreme Court say the words \"that fact\" refer to the sentence, Larry Owens wanted to knock him off. And the sentence preceding that is the judge's speculation as to why. One judge in the Supreme Court says what you said, that when you read that together, it means \"that fact\" referred to the motive. Now, there we are. And the question is what are we supposed to do? Is there enough here to say that they are clearly wrong, those two members?",

  "They skirt what they didn't talk about.",
  "So what was the rest of the trial about?",
  "What was the issue in the trial?",
  "And what is it about?",
  "No. I understand that. But I mean ­­ what ­­ what he says is the witnesses skirted the real issue. If you will tell me that all they talked about was: We identify him ­­ no, your identification is no good; yes, our identification is good; no, it isn't; yes, it is ­­ if that's what it was about, then that couldn't be the real issue, so they're ­­ that they skirted, because they didn't skirt it.",
  "So something else has to be; therefore, motive. But is that what happened?",
  "What happened?",
  "No. You don't understand my question, because it was favorable to you. My question was ­­ my question was what did those witnesses talk about. He says they skirted the real issue. I want to know what they talked about ­­",
  "­­ the rest of the trial.",
  "That's what you say, but what I want to put ­­ there's ­­ I'm trying to get the other side, so you have to answer that squarely. And ­­ and maybe I'll put it this way: There's ­­ well, the judge has been sitting there through this fairly short trial. He is annoyed at all these witnesses. They've been pussy­footing what's going on. They saw the murder. No problem about that. But they're not explaining it because they're frightened of saying what it's involved in. And he's fed up, so he's going to say, I'm going to say what's really happening here. What's really happening here is this is a drug deal that failed. Or something like that. So that's the explanation of what he said. If you could bring him back and say, judge, did you mean motive played a role here? He'd say, of course not. Of course not. It didn't play a role in my decision. All that played a role in my decision was what the witnesses said, which was, he's the guy. I was just saying what's going on. Now, what's ­­ I think they're saying something like that.",
  "Here's an example: Suppose a person ­­ everybody ­­ presentence report, government, defense lawyer, prosecutor, everybody ­­ thought he's in column 2. Okay? He's not a first­timer. And now it turns out they made a mistake. He is a first­timer. And so being a recidivist, the presentence report says put him at the top of the range. Now it's a lower range, but they know he's not a recidivist. Depending on the circumstance they might say, Hey, no, put him in the middle of the first­timers. I don't know. You don't know. They don't know. Nobody knows. And so the question is, we don't know, really, what the judge will do upon remand. Common sense suggests ask him. That's what it suggests. And so you're worried about whether you can work the language around to let you do that, what is common sense. I'll have some questions for the other side, which I suspect you can, but nonetheless, isn't that the issue?",
  "Yes.",
  "But anyway, we've got progress, because it does make sense. And if we've got progress, it is not a punishment to the lawyer for not having raised it. It is a set of circumstances where the result will make sense without unnecessary administrative problems.",
  "Yes, that's right.",
  "That is fact­specific. I mean, I have exactly the same question as Justice Kagan had. Forget all the jargon. You're a ­­ a lawyer. You want to prove that it rained at noon on the 5th of February. Your witness says, I heard pitter­patter on the roof. I looked outside. Water was going by the window. Anything else? No. Well, it might have been the window washer, but there is no jury that couldn't find that it was raining. Same thing here. Case after case, this Court has said: We assume, we presume ­­ or they don't even use those words ­­ the Guidelines influence the sentence. That's what they meant by the word \"anchor.\" If you look at the reality, whether they depart or don't ­­ whatever you call it now. There's some special word ­­ you can find evidence after ­­ of course, the Guidelines affect the sentence. Maybe there's an unusual case, and they don't. The reason the judge doesn't say anything is because in Rita we said that if you say nothing, Judge, then the appellate courts are to assume it was reasonable. And therefore, the judge now says nothing. He just applies the Guideline. So we'd have to overcome about five cases in terms of what we said if we are going to rebut the common sense notion that of course using the wrong Guideline had an effect on the sentence. If it's an unusual case, i.e. if it's the window washer, let the government show it was the window washer. But the normal case, pitter­patter means rain, and the normal case is that the judge, when he uses the Guidelines, or even when he uses them as a basis and says I'm departing, that that made a difference.",
  "There will be many. And there are many cases involving rain. Many. I mean, I don't know how many thousands, but there are many common facts in thousands of cases where the government itself uses very similar kinds of evidence in order to show that it was really raining. And here, what we're doing is we're using very similar kinds of evidence, namely, that he used the wrong Guideline in order to show that, in fact, better ­­ more probable than not, or pretty probable, or whatever reasonable probability, that it made a difference.",
  "Say ­­ I mean, it's ­­ I ­­ I don't see this as special.",
  "The range ­­",
  "We're not changing ­­ well, you've heard the argument. But I suspect ­­ and you ­­ you may know this empirical point better ­­ I think there probably are a lot of cases where the issue is the sentence. And the appeal will be ­­ include something like this. In some subset, there will be a plain­error question. And all you'll really have is what the judge did. Now, of course, if the government has more, all you would be saying is that this, in and of itself, shows a risk in this circumstance, the reasonable probability, whatever standard you're using. Of course the government's free to show that there is something different about this. It wasn't harmful. It might have been the window washer, you know? And the government is free to show that.",
  "So why is this so difficult?",
  "Well, you know, you ­­",
  "Well, you're saying it's a shift in the risk. The government has the burden of proving that it was raining. It's not a shift in the risk to say that the evidence that I've mentioned proves rain, and it's not a shift in the risk to say that the defendant can come in and show it was the window washer. The question is whether the burden, which lies with the defendant, is satisfied if all there is is that the judge applied the wrong Guideline. And given the continuous statement in case after case in this Court, that, of course, judges, whether they apply the Guideline or depart, the Guidelines play a significant part in the ­­ in the sentence that occurs. If all you have is that, you've satisfied the substantial ­­ whatever it is, you know. What is it called? The substantial ­­",
  "Of course it matters what it is.",
  "Well, it doesn't say that in Olano. It says ­­ it says in Olano ­­",
  "­­ in Rule 52(b) ­­",
  "It says \"a plain error that affects substantial rights.\" And if it is the case, factually, as this Court has said it is, that applying the Guideline that you apply makes a difference to the sentence, that does affect substantial rights. He's just borne the burden of proof by showing that. That ­­ I don't see why that's different than any other problem of proof.",
  "What you have not put in your brief, I don't think, is that they have, in several circuits, created a system where there is a limited remand for purposes of finding out just what the judge thought about it. That's not perfect, but it seems to be workable and not quite as expensive. But I think the real difference between us, in ­­ and you can ­­ I'm raising this because I haven't seen a reason you shouldn't address it squarely ­­ is I don't think this is a Rule 52(b) case. You see? It's not about how to interpret Rule 52(b), or 52(a), or Olano. It's a case about Guidelines. It is a case about what the Guidelines are and how they affect a sentence. And once we work that out, the answer will be obvious, because I'm not going to disagree with your interpretation of Olano or 52. But I am going to disagree about what you think the effect of failing to apply the right Guideline is in the mine run of cases. And once ­­ if you agreed with me about that, this case would be over; or if I agreed with you. Between us, we'd end it. But that ­­ that's ­­ so that's ­­ that ­­ that's where the ­­ I mean, the ­­ the others might have some views, too. But ­­ but do you see ­­ do ­­ do you see ­­ do you see why I'm ­­ do you see why I keep pushing you in that direction?",
  "What do we do about all of the ­­ what used to be when I worked in the Senate Judiciary Committee? Every year we would get dozens, maybe hundreds, past dozens of private bills. There were bills for one person, and moreover, at least some of them, to my recollection, involved that one person saying I tried to sue. Maybe the case is still there, but I was met with a statute of limitations defense, for example. I'd like the money. And we'd vote yes, give him the money, he deserves it, if he does.",
  "Well, considering the ones that do ­­",
  "­­ very often the person sued. He was met with some kind of defense, and he thought, and Congress might have thought maybe he should have the money. This is a technical defense.",
  "Yes ­­",
  "I understand you ­­",
  "Well, what ­­ now ­­ now, suppose it's a private person on the other side. I can easily imagine circumstances where to take the money from private B and give it to private A might ­­ for example, a property without due process. It might violate some other provision. But if it doesn't violate some other provision, what in the separation of powers, unsaid principles, distinguishes between taking $10 from the government and giving it to the private person, or taking $10 from Joe Smith and giving it to the private person, assuming there's nothing unfair about that?",
  "Because?",
  "Because I think ­­",
  "Oh, oh. The defense ­­ the defense happened to be ­­ that worked ­­ an obscure provision in a court of claims act, that the government through Congress had once put in, and they decided it would be unfair to apply it now to this person, and so they repeal it in respect to that person. And there's never going to be another like him. Okay? Now, don't play. What I don't want you to do is play on the potential unfairness, because there are other parts of the constitution there. Assume it's fair to do that. What stops it.",
  "The State law is what would apply, perhaps, in the absence of a congressional statute. So the President goes to Congress and says, what I would like is you to agree with me about this. We've frozen $14 billion worth of assets of a country with which we are not friendly. There are some people who would like some of that money. We would like to take the assets which are currently being held in the 14th floor of the Howard Building in Chicago and use that. Why? We want to use that because we've worked out that that's the best way to pay people we think should be deserving money, and we don't care about the foreign country in respect to those. But our foreign relations are such that we don't want to get the others involved. Now what's wrong with that?",
  "No. I'll ­­ the hypothetical is meant to say just what Justice Kennedy brought up, which is the President, particularly when he acts together with Congress, is given the foreign affairs power to a very great extent of the United States of America. And that foreign affairs power could often involve, for reasons of foreign policy, unfreezing a refrigerator and not unfreezing the stove. So I don't ­­ I don't know foreign affairs, but I do know that the President, together with Congress, certainly must have very broad power to decide what assets shall or shall not be kept frozen and not kept frozen.",
  "Is that the ground? I'd like you to perhaps repeat, but I think pursue what the chief justice was bringing up. The example that I thought of is imaginary. The SEC has a rule, and it says a winning plaintiff in a 10b­5 case cannot attach assets that are in a trust that the defendant has commingled the assets with his wife who's not a defendant. Can you imagine that rule? I'm just trying ­­ it's something like a Spendthrift trust or what I'm trying to do is get a Spendthrift trust in the Federal context. Now, Congress passes a law, and it says in case 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the petitioner can reach the mingled assets. Okay. Period. Constitutional? If not, why not?",
  "What?",
  "Well, I thought your answer to the hypothetical ­­ have you got the hypothetical in mind? All we have is a statute that says in case 1, 2, 3, you can, in effect, reach the assets, winning plaintiff in the two 10b­5s of the Spendthrift trust. And that's all it says. It doesn't work for the future. It doesn't work elsewhere for the past. It works for this case. Now, that might violate several things. But I want to know what, and does it violate something, and does it violate this principle that they are bringing up about not deciding for a particular case?",
  "Now, can I do this? Can I say perhaps, the case I just gave you, Spendthrift trust, legislation for this one plaintiff, maybe they can't do that. But if we're talking about Spendthrift trusts in Iran, they can, because that's the foreign affairs power and because the President and Congress both agree that that's an appropriate exercise of the foreign affairs power.",
  "If you want to be cute, Congress has 4,000 ways of being cute. And I can't quite see this Court trying to police those ways.",
  "And ­­ and indeed, I think I'm right in saying we had hundreds of private bills that were written in all kinds of ways and weren't ­­ to benefit individuals, and some of them might have been subject to cases and others not. The unusual thing about this case is it refers to a particular docket number.",
  "Can't anyone join? That is to say, if a person today, or if there is some person who has the appropriate judgment, an antiterrorism judgment against Iran, are they perfectly free to join into this case?",
  "I would ­­",
  "Can we ­­ would this resolve the case correctly, in your view on your side, were we to say whatever the general principle is, this is a case which is against you. It refers to a case by number, the statute. Before you is the fact that anyone can join, and there are hundreds or dozens of such plaintiffs. And moreover, on the other side, it ­­ it refers to $1.75 billion worth of assets in all kinds of different securities and obligations, and now perhaps in cash being held in New York. So whatever we're talking about, though the number suggests a particular case, the facts of the case suggest far more generality than is true of most cases.",
  "Is that true or not true?",
  "What's lacking in the integrity if you have an enemy country, let's say. We've had many wars. You freeze a lot of their assets. There are people who would like to get ahold of some. And Congress gives the executive authority or itself goes through and says, we think these people should have this. We think they should have that. They should ­­ others could have the other thing. I mean, maybe it violates equal protection; maybe it violates due process, depending on how they do it. But in principle, what's wrong with exercising the foreign affairs power in that way?",
  "A single defendant that represents a hundred million people?",
  "Well, what is it? That is, look. If we simply write an opinion and it says, Puerto Rico is sovereign, that has enormous implications.",
  "The insular cases are totally changed in their applications.",
  "The political implications I'll just stay away from. On the other hand, if we write an opinion that says it's just a territory, that has tremendous implications.",
  "How did we tell the UN it wasn't a colony? Why are we not reporting on this colony every year?",
  "So either way, between those two, the implications in law and in politics and everything else are overwhelming. Therefore, you argue a third and middle position. Your position pointing to four cases in this Court, so you have very good authority. It's for Double Jeopardy purposes. There is a different question. The question is what are the sources of the law? And then I find four cases that say just what you said. Okay? Now, you say the sources of the law, the sources of criminal law here are different. Okay. What I think Justice Sotomayor wanted you to say is explain that.",
  "Take a little time, if you like. In what way are they different?",
  "What kind of territory is it?",
  "There is. The ­­ the insular cases have at least two.",
  "Okay. So it's that kind.",
  "Now, what is Estado Libre Asociado?",
  "No, no. I just wonder as it appears in the Constitution of Puerto Rico.",
  "The alternative of the word Commonwealth.",
  "I just wonder what it is.",
  "Where does it say in the Constitution that Congress cannot? After all, Congress can admit a State. It says that specifically.",
  "Talks about territories. So you're saying Congress and the President too do not have the authority to associate with some other entity under the form of Estado Libre Asociado?",
  "Where does it say that in any of our cases?",
  "And what are the Indians?",
  "Because ­­ because we do not recognize explicitly in the Constitution \"Commonwealth,\" therefore there is no Commonwealth? Is that what you want us to say?",
  "With some purposes. But the ­­ the issue here, as I see it ­­ which maybe will take a second ­­ is there are four cases that say we don't have to reach these grand questions. All we have to do is decide what the source of power is. Now their argument is that even if you go back to the Foraker Act, which indeed did have the people of Puerto Rico making laws, and if you then add the Resolution 600 which delegated the authority to make the Constitution, the Constitution itself which speaks of \"We the People\" of Puerto Rico making a law, the fact that later Congress and the President said Puerto Rico has a Republican form of government, the fact that subsequent to that we went to the United Nations and had them withdraw the requirement to report on a colony because Puerto Rico is not a colony ­­ ­ and you know the words as well as I, and they sure sound like \"sovereign.\" And in Valle, which no one mentions, Trias Monge wrote that in fact all these laws ­­ and he was talking about civil, but I suppose it applies to Commonwealth too ­­ are to be interpreted in light of the civil code tradition of Europe, which was the tradition that applied prior to 1900, and not the common law. I don't see, when you put all those things together, if you're looking at the facts of what the law of Puerto Rico is in the area, it sounds to me like it's civil code coming out of a constitution which I grant you was given by authority of Congress. So there we are. Now five things they've listed there that make it different, not only from anything you can think of but from anything I can think of. So why don't you reply to those five things, if you want.",
  "The Indians. What about the Indians?",
  "We need to. I mean, we told the UN, this doesn't sound like we said it was a municipality.",
  "UN said that Puerto Rico has been invested with the attributes of political sovereignty, which clearly identify the status of self­government attained by the Puerto Rican people.",
  "This is what we told the UN. We told the UN that ­­",
  "And on the basis of that ­­",
  "It's ­­ what it says here ­­",
  "It consists of the President of the United States.",
  "Or his delegate. His delegate.",
  "I ­­ I have. You've read the same thing. There are about ten words such as \"republic,\" \"not a colony,\" \"attributes of political sovereignty,\" repeated in five or six key documents. I do ­­ not everyone does ­­ happen to think that what we tell the UN to get it removed from the colony status bears some consideration. I grant you not everyone agrees with that, but that's my view of it.",
  "All right. And I guess I ­­ all right. Forget it.",
  "You said it was like a municipality. I just think that having the attributes of political sovereignty, and being a republic, and saying that the Constitution of Puerto Rico is the basic document, whatever the language was there, don't sound like a municipality.",
  "Well, now, this is ­­",
  "This is ­­ it's very interesting what you're saying. Remember, though, one of the provisions of the Puerto Rico Constitution, which Congress approved and said it was a Republican form of government, is that criminal actions shall be conducted in the name and by the authority of the people of Puerto Rico. Now, that sounds like a delegation of authority as to source, to go back to the Spanish system if they want. Now, if I take your view, then I guess you have to say ­­ and it has considerable implication ­­ that that doesn't matter because Congress can take back what they gave. Now, is that the position of the government or the executive branch? Because that has tremendous implication.",
  "Because obviously, there is an argument as to whether what Congress and the President gave in Resolution 600, followed by the Constitution, followed by what happened at the UN, under the authority ­­ and looking to Felix Frankfurter for guidance, who said that the Constitution provides us with many forms of possible relationship. That's what his view was. And now, is the position of the executive branch ­­ I mean, you want to take a position on this? That ­­ that ­­ that Congress, if it wishes, can take all of that back and Puerto Rico has no more independence than ­­ in principle, than any of the other places that were territories? Now, that's ­­ that's a big question. But do ­­ do you ­­ do you see it's an important question? And I want to know if the government's position rests upon it, because that's ­­ that's an important statement for the executive, in my opinion.",
  "But there are some things ­­",
  "Let's go back to the insular cases right there. There are different kinds of territories. It's because of that that Frankfurter says that the Constitution has left the field of invention open. The decisions in the insular cases mean this, if they mean anything: That there's nothing in the Constitution to hamper the responsibility of Congress in working out arrangements. Now, if that's so, why couldn't Congress delegate, without the power to take it back, the authority to Puerto Rico to work out its own criminal code subject to the constraints of the Bill of Rights, et cetera? Why couldn't it? I mean, if Frankfurter is right. Or do you take the opposite position, that it couldn't?",
  "Can I just approach the same thing from a different perspective? Suppose can Congress pass a law or a legislature pass a law that attempts to abridge the freedom of speech. Is that a violation of the First Amendment? It's an attempt.",
  "Well, let's say there doesn't have to be a thousand examples.",
  "You say that's the law. No one can espouse in a public place the political philosophy of Ruritanianism, okay?",
  "Okay. I mean, I doubt that they'll pass such a law ­­",
  "­­ but I just ­­ substitute any one that you want for that. They pass it. And by the way, the six people who hold that philosophy all leave on a boat before the effective date, but ­­ or what's more likely, they bring a declaratory judgment action, and the law never takes effect. And therefore, it had no impact. And that happens every day of the week. I'm just wondering if such a law, which is an attempt ­­ it's right on the books as blatant as you want ­­ whether that violates the First Amendment. That's a serious question. I'm not taking a point of view. I want to know what you think.",
  "Well, I just want to know, is it yes or no? Does it ­­ in your opinion, does it attempt to ­­ a clear attempt to violate the First Amendment in a statute? It has general application. Does it violate the First Amendment? Does it abridge the freedom of speech?",
  "It is unconstitutional.",
  "It will have a lot of bad effects. It will have all kinds of chilling effects all over the place.",
  "No, no, by chance it happens not to succeed.",
  "It's my hypothetical.",
  "Of course. And I'm just asking you if, in fact, they think it will succeed, they want it to succeed, that's why they passed it, and through a fluke it fails, does the fact that it fails mean that it doesn't violate, it doesn't ­­ does it not ­­ does it or does it not violate the First Amendment?",
  "It does not.",
  "And he fails ­­ if it fails ­­",
  "But that is a First Amendment problem for the reason that lots of other people will have their speech chilled. And normally in the law there is a doctrine where the person who does the bad thing makes a mistake, he's held anyway. That's true of transferred intent. You shoot A, but you meant to shoot B. It's true of ­­ of attempts generally.",
  "Why not?",
  "That is to say I would think that a statute that has a chilling effect on the speech of millions of people but is directly aimed at A, B, and C, if because of some fluke A, B, and C are not themselves injured, nonetheless everybody else is, and it would violent the First Amendment.",
  "That, I think, is what you have here, which is why I raised my point.",
  "The problem, just from the point of view of the common sense of it, is you have an organization that has, A, the organization; B, the trustees; and C, the shareholders. So applying Carden, what you would say ­­ and Navarro: If you sue the trustees, you look to their citizenship. But if you sue the trust itself, you don't look to the citizenship of the trust; you don't look to the citizenship of the trustees. You go beyond that and look to the citizenship of the members. I mean, that seems odd. Why do you look to the members or the shareholders, or the ­­ or the beneficiaries where you sue the trust itself but you don't in the identical situation where the law of the State allows you to sue the trustees? I mean, that seems such a sport, such a ­­ a fluke.",
  "Look ­­ look at the other odd thing in writing this opinion your way. You say, well, this isn't really like a trust. I mean, it is sort of a trust, but there are important differences. They can sue and be sued. The trust itself can hold the property, and the beneficiaries do not have an equitable interest. And because they don't have an equitable interest, it's more like a private association or, et cetera, in Carden. But, of course, that means that we look to their interest. We look to their property. We're basically having them as part of the necessary parties because they have a property interest, the very people we just said that this is a different kind of organization because they lack an equitable interest in the property.",
  "His point really is that this is sort of like a trust but not very much. And indeed, the key point, to me, is that the shareholders here have no beneficial interest in the property.",
  "And then you say in the section shareholders shall have no interest in the property of the trust.",
  "I don't know. I didn't write ­­ I didn't write Section 6; your client did.",
  "That's what it says, so how are we supposed to take that?",
  "Yes. I do have one.",
  "Suppose I wanted a list. I ­­ I wanted a list, a synthesis of which Bogert or ­­ or Scott on trusts has as the characteristic of the traditional common law trusts. And then I'd like, over in the other column, the characteristics of your organization.",
  "And now what do I read? I ­­ I don't think you can list them now. Is there something I can read just to get an idea of that?",
  "Maybe they are identical. Are you going to say they're ­­",
  "But it says in the regulation ­­ look at the regulation. It says, \"The Hovercraft Regulation applies to waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\" This is water subject to the jurisdiction. \"Within the boundaries of the National Park Service\" ­­ that's the tougher part ­­ \"including navigable waters.\" That doesn't help us. So the question, I would think, would be is this portion of the river within the boundaries of the National Park Service? Am I right so far?",
  "Well, now, you look at what they say about that, and you get, when they're defining the Yukon­Charley River's National Preserve, it says that that national preserve ­­ which is the whole thing, which includes the section of the river that we're talking about ­­ contains public lands. It doesn't say it's identical with the public lands. And then in another place it says, \"Only those lands within the portion which are public lands shall be deemed to be included a portion of such unit,\" not that they make up the whole of such unit. At least we ­­",
  "I'm quoting from regulations which are 54 U.S.C. ­­ I don't know. I'll ­­ I'll have to show you later, because I'm quoting ­­",
  "We're going to get into numbers, and I ­­ I just thought this case is too complicated to ask anything, but you've tempted me.",
  "And so ­­ so you see ­­ have you got in your mind what I just quoted?",
  "And then once you have that, you have this regulation applying to this portion of the river. So now we look to the statute to see if anything there takes away what the regulations seem to give. And the only part of the statute ­­ though it's an important part ­­ that supports you is the second sentence. But as I read that second sentence, it says that, \"The regulations that apply solely to public lands within such units,\" you see, \"are the ones that don't apply to the private land up in Yukon­Charley. But I've just read you a regulation, which, on my reading of it, is the Hovercraft Regulation, and does not apply solely to public lands within National Park Service units, either in Alaska or anywhere else. And therefore, the statute doesn't stop it. Now, that's ­­ that's ­­ and I want to ­­ I don't know if I can do this orally; I just tried to, which is to put the argument against you as best I could, and I want to hear the reply.",
  "Yes.",
  "Uh­huh.",
  "Why? I mean ­­",
  "As I read it ­­ as I read it, it's complicated, but in a sense it's simple. Yosemite has some private land within it and a lot of public. You know, there's some houses in Yosemite owned by private people. There are interior regs that apply to all of Yosemite, such as certain fireplace regs. There are some that only apply to the park but not the private people. What this statute says is the latter. Doesn't deprive ­­ apply to that land that you gave to Alaska. That's what the statute says. And what the reg says is that our hovercraft reg applies to everything within Yosemite, if this were Yosemite. This navigable waters, whether the land around it is owned by James Jones, the private person, or whether it's owned ­­ whether it's part of Yosemite Park. That's what it seemed to say to me. Now, there are two problems with what I just read. One is the third sentence and the word \"unit.\" And the second problem is the NPS, the National Park Service, is it really all of Yosemite, you know, with that private thing or is it just the public part? Now, that's at least a sorry. I shouldn't have got into it. It's too complicated. Skip the question.",
  "Then ­­ then ­­ then I'm completely wrong. Then what the right ­­ then ­­ then I was totally wrong. I ­­ I thought that the argument was that ­­ just to go to my Yosemite analogy ­­",
  "­­ that the hovercraft rule was like a rule that applies to all of Yosemite, say a campfire rule that applies even to John Jones's house.",
  "I mean, it could be the navigable waters. It wouldn't be John Jones's fireplace. But if that ­­ if that's your argument, I was wrong.",
  "I thought the navigable waters are not. They're on John Jones's property. But you still have the authority to regulate them, because the regulation that does it is not a regulation that applies solely to public lands.",
  "Is that right? Because you just seemed to say the opposite a minute ago.",
  "Now, navigable waters that are within the boundaries of the National Park Service.",
  "That's like John Jones's house in Yosemite.",
  "The fireplace reg applies to him, even though his is a private house, because it's within the boundary of Yosemite.",
  "Am I right or not?",
  "Either way, you say you win. Either they are Federal lands and this is part of a reg that applies to Federal lands; or they are not Federal lands, in which case this reg applies to both nonfederal and ­­ I mean nonpublic lands and public lands. So it's not within the second sentence. Is that your argument?",
  "That's the whole ­­",
  "I read that first sentence. It's very interesting, because the tone of voice is the only way I can deal with this case. Watch. Imagine we have a valley that's a public land, and that valley traverses the boundary of the unit. Some of it's inside and some of it's outside. Now, only those lands within the boundaries of any conservation system which are public ­­ within the boundaries of any conservation system which are public lands shall be deemed to be included as a portion of the unit. So the only part of that valley that it's a portion of the unit is that part of the valley that's within the boundary of the unit. The part that's outside the boundary of the unit is not part of the unit.",
  "Is that what it ­­ I thought it must mean something like that. If it doesn't mean something like that, it means what Justice Scalia says. And then they're ­­ Joe Jones' house, the Indian reservation, none of it is part of the unit. But that can't be what it means, can it?",
  "Do you see what I ­­ are you following it?",
  "If it makes clear ­­ if it makes clear that private lands like Joe Jones' house are a part of the unit?",
  "Within the boundaries of it. Ah, so distinction between being part of the unit and being within the boundaries of the unit.",
  "What ­­",
  "The regulation itself says, it says water ­­ \"Hovercraft regulation applies to, quote, 'waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States within the boundaries of the National Park Service.'\"",
  "And then the National Park Service somewhere has a definition that equates it with the unit. The National Park Service is defined identically to system units. That's at 54 U.S.C. 100102 and 100501. So if we ­­ Justice Scalia's point is this seems to take the private land, the in­holdings, and say they're not part of the unit; only the public lands are part of the unit ­­",
  "­­ and then the Hovercraft Regulation applies only to the unit.",
  "And that's ­­ that ­­ isn't that the point? Yes. That's ­­",
  "­­ the point.",
  "What's the response to that?",
  "Yes.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Ah.",
  "So you're saying it applies within ­­ it is within the boundaries of the unit, although the unit consists of just the public land. Who drafted this? This is ­­",
  "Are you satisfied with this holding ­­ imaginary ­­ but the Ninth Circuit's wrong. Two, the second sentence does not bar this regulation. Three, there are other possible arguments; we send it back for reconsideration as to whether those arguments are good or bad.",
  "They ­­ they ­­ we're saying that the second sentence, which is what they're talking about primarily in the briefs, the second sentence of (c) ­­",
  "­­ \"no lands which,\" et cetera, you're right about that.",
  "You're right about ­­ I mean I imagine ­­",
  "Then as to this first sentence, which I ­­ I don't think I focused on, particularly, we say go back and argue that.",
  "Their point is, the government says, fine, make that argument. Make it under the rubric City of Sherrill. Maybe you make it when you go down on remand or something, but it is workable to divide the issue into two parts. The first issue is what's the reservation, and the second issue is what can you do on the reservation? When you get to question two, if the Tribe has made no assertion of jurisdiction, nobody even knows about it for 150 years. Maybe it's basically unfair to let them do what they want to do. And that depends on a lot of factors, such as what Congress says. So what do you think of that argument? Let's leave it for later. Nobody's argued it.",
  "Is this the case ­­",
  "That's why I wondered ­­ I'm not certain how this works ­­ that I read the statute. It says, \"The department shall award contracts on the basis of competition restricted to veterans. If, if, if. Okay? Well, what wouldn't be awarded according to veterans? I mean, what was surprising to me is that the goal was to have 3 percent awarded to veterans. But if I read this the way you read it, everything will be awarded to veterans. I mean, maybe not literally, but there are millions of veterans. There are probably hundreds of thousands or millions of veterans' businesses. So wouldn't everything be awarded to veterans? What wouldn't be?",
  "What wouldn't? That's what I want you to address.",
  "How many are there?",
  "It may be 15 percent of businesses, but the question is what does the Department of Veterans Affairs buy? And my guess is they buy lots of stuff. They buy household stuff, they buy paper towels, they buy buildings, they buy all kinds of things. And in respect to all the things they buy, if you read this, a contract supplies to everything. I guess they'll buy it all from veterans. Now, it's just ­­ or 90 percent, I don't know. It's very surprising to me that Congress would have wanted the Veterans Administration to buy everything from veterans. Now ­­ now, that's ­­ or nearly everything. Now you explain to me ­­ I must be missing something ­­ and ­­ and you explain to me what I'm missing.",
  "No, no, I understand that. I said they have certain qualifications, of course. Do you think the veterans ­­ things aren't ­­ they have reasonable prices. They ­­ they have ­­ they're qualified. They do a fine job. Let's say it's surprising that Congress would have wanted nearly everything to be bought from veterans, that's all. And where am I wrong?",
  "I'm not saying they can't perform.",
  "I want you to address what you're calling this natural cap. You're saying to me you're wrong, it doesn't mean everything, it means like 10 percent. Is that what you're saying? Or what ­­ what are you saying? Explain what it is. I read it. I thought it's everything. Now you explain why it isn't everything or nearly everything. I mean, if you're not a veteran, Congress wouldn't normally say you don't get a leg up, but to shut you out entirely? I mean, that's ­­ that's just my problem that I want you to explain.",
  "Are you saying Congress want ­­ just wanted everything that veterans can supply to be supplied by veterans? And if I say, is that everything, it's not 90 ­­ it's not a hundred percent, probably not 99 percent, but it might be 80 percent. I mean, I'm guessing. You tell me. You're the expert. What percent is it when you win?",
  "I see many good things. People would enlist in the Armed Forces. They would have careers assured after. It just still surprises me, but my question is not really aimed at you. It's aimed at the other side, and you would have a chance to answer this question. I can understand. I accept your argument, pretty much. I don't know why there would be any exception to the SS ­­ the FSS, or whatever it's called. But I was rather stopped by the lower court's argument which they have given up, which is that right in the statute, not in a preference, but right in the statute it says, \"For purposes of meeting the goals,\" under Section A. That, I understand. And then what you do is you'd have goals; they should be tough goals, and ­­ and if you're way ahead of the goals, then maybe you don't have to do it. That was their argument. The government's given that up. So ­­ so I don't know what to do. I mean, I'm going to ask them for help ­­",
  "­­ and then ­­ the same ­­",
  "Is this the case? Do I understand this? Am I ­­ there are three parts to this. Question one in my mind, is it the case that they lose because the agency does not have to apply veterans only where they way exceeded their goal? The answer to that in the opinion would say, we do not reach that question for there are no regulations that suggest that the agency has tried to take that approach. Am I right so far?",
  "All right. Then we reach question two, left one open. Question 2 is do they have to choose the Rule of Two in the FSS? And there are two parts to that. The first part is suppose two veterans qualified are already on the FSS list. And there we might say, yes, you do in respect to them. Or we might say, no, you don't. But if we say yes, you do, at least we don't, in your opinion, wreck the system. All right. Then we get to Step 3. There is no veteran on the FSS. Now what do we do? And there your argument is that, look, everyone on the FSS is a person who has entered into a contract, which contract says that when called upon for further supply, they will give it. Am I right?",
  "So, therefore, it is that contract, not the contract within the contract that they're talking about. And were we to say the contrary, we would have to take an architect who has 40,000 pages of things he's going to do, and we change the sentence on page 389 to read 300 rather than 400, and we say that's a new contract, or something like that. I'm trying to make an argument for you. It's not a contract within a contract, it is contract to which this refer. Am I way off base or is that what you're trying to say?",
  "And don't just say it is because you think I'd agree with it, please.",
  "All right. Well, if it isn't that, look, these people on the FSS list have already entered into a contract, this is just implementing the contract that they've already entered into. If you're not saying that, then how in heaven's name do you get out of his argument?",
  "That may be. But this is my question on this. The statute doesn't say anything. The statute just says: In either event, the Court may increase the damages up to three times the amount found or assessed. I don't get too much guidance from that. Let me assume against you, assume against you, that the history does not favor you. The history insists upon willful. Let me assume with you that there isn't good ground for clear and convincing. Nothing suggests that. But now, the hardest part for me ­­ and it is hard. I don't have a clear answer ­­ is there are, indeed, some preliminary in tests. If, for example, the patentee has a flaw in his patent ­­ not enough to kill it, but enough to make it pretty uncertain, a weak patent. There are all kinds of things wrong with it. No willfulness damages, irrespective, almost, of the state of mind of the infringer. So what could be said for that? You've read their excellent briefs on both sides, and you know perfectly well what can be said for that. And if I summarize it ­­ and that's what I want your answer to. Today's patent world is not a steam­engine world. We have decided to patent tens of thousands of software products and similar things where hardly anyone knows what the patent's really about. A company that's a start­up, a small company, once it gets a letter, cannot afford to pay 10,000 to $100,000 for a letter from Counsel, and may be willing to run its chances. You start saying, little company, you must pay 10,000 to $100,000 to get a letter, lest you get willful damages against you should your bet be wrong. We have one more path leading us to national monopoly by Google and Yahoo or their equivalence, and the patent statute is not designed to create monopolies throughout the United States. It's designed to help the small businessman, not to hurt him. So leave those words for interpretation to the expert court, and in this area it may well be the Federal Circuit.",
  "Have I stated the argument ­­",
  "­­ pretty much the way it is? All right. If I have, I would like your response to it.",
  "Not just their strategy.",
  "We have all kind of amicus briefs that say that's the truth. And indeed, thousands and thousands and thousands of small businessmen are trying to break into businesses that they just can't do without software. And when you have tens or hundreds of thousands of patents on software by other companies, that means we can't break in.",
  "It hasn't fallen. Go look at the market shares of the different companies that are seriously involved in software.",
  "Okay. Then are you satisfied ­­",
  "­­ with this? You've just used a word that might help: \"reasonable belief.\" We say that where a company is small, where it is small and wants to run the risk, follow the Fed Circuit rule, in order to show willfulness ­­ because it's reasonable ­­ in order to show willfulness, you have to show that that infringer not only didn't know it was faulty, but also was a big company that was pretty used to getting these lawyers' opinions, and also pretty used to asking their own experts whether it really was a good patent or not. And they didn't do it here. What about something like that?",
  "I didn't think they were doing that. I thought what they were doing was saying, we are not going to allow punitive damages in a case where the patent is so weak. And so we're really not looking at state of mind. And the reason that we're doing that is the reason I said previously. And the reason that we're not leaving it up to 475 trial judges is because those 475 trial judges don't see patent cases very much. And where they have a pretty good idea of how employment law, tort law, and all kinds of other law works, they don't have that, a good idea in respect to patent law. And we, the Federal Circuit, do. That's why we are created. And we are afraid that if we do not use this objective standard, what we will see is a major effect discouraging invention because of fear that if we try to invent, we'll get one of these letters and we can't afford $100,000 for an opinion. Now, I've just repeated the same argument. But we did create the government, that expert court to make such determinations in the face of language that seems to allow it, and so what is wrong with they're doing what they were paid to do?",
  "But I just gave you the reason. Now, you can say that you don't agree with that reason and give me a reason why it's wrong, but just to say it's no reason is disturbing.",
  "My empirical information ­­ I mean my empirical information ­­ ha, ha, ha, laughs slightly ­­ is ­­ is coming out of the briefs, which you do have to admit has an interest. The ­­ the ­­ I have ­­ I have assumed, and is there stuff that I could look at to back this up ­­ that in a world of patent and copyright protection, I think it's unfortunate that Congress hasn't passed a special regime for those kinds of patents, but they haven't. In that such ­­ in that a world like that, we're seeing more and more companies that have more and more, and continuously more patents. And if all that happens is you send a letter to somebody who has something that's trying to break into the industry, and they don't have enough money to hire many lawyers, that becomes a serious barrier, and that the government's rule in your view, and the opponent's rule in your view, will raise those barriers to entry. Now, that's a very elementary kind of assumption. And I do admit it's supported by the briefs on your side. And is there anything you would refer me to that would suggest that maybe I have a point, and your briefs have a point?",
  "Of course. I've looked through them, and I understand they're effective. I just feel a little bit more comfortable when I can read something that isn't participating in the litigation, and it, too, bears out this view.",
  "Lumley has also said quite a lot that he's worried about lawyers coming in and inventing various things that make the patent look weak after the event. You see? I mean, he ­­",
  "He is not totally with you on this.",
  "Is there a way of compromising this in this way? To say to the circuit, we see your point. Okay? And by and large, we accept it, but there can be very big companies that make a habit of getting those letters and giving the things to engineers, as we saw right now in this case. And where something like that goes on normally, then a refusal deliberately to do it for fear it comes back with the wrong answer. Or you do do it and you get the wrong answer and you go ahead anyway. That may be worth willful damages even though, in fact, there was a slight flaw with this patent.",
  "What about that? Giving them some leeway around the edges?",
  "Well, leave it to the circuit to decide.",
  "Well, I have ­­ they have that squarely facing them, where they had ­­ where they ­­ and they did? Did they have that issue that ­­",
  "And your other point. You were just about to make a second point. Do ­­ do you remember? See, for one thing it's easy ­­ it was a good point, too.",
  "How does it work in tort law?",
  "I mean, you can imagine situations where when the actor takes a risk, it looks tremendously great. But by the time trial is over, it was pretty small. It happened, but, you know, the eggshell skull. He thought almost certainly he had one. And he did, but the chances of his having one were a million to one against it. Punitives, how does the reckless ­­ do you have any idea?",
  "Yeah. But it turns out as you found it, it wasn't very bad. And what you thought you were going to find, then, was just terrible. This must come up.",
  "There are?",
  "There are not.",
  "Well, then we would have a ­­ an analogy on your side, because the other way, it would be an analogy on the other side.",
  "See, the question ­­ I know this is not exactly a question that we've seen in your briefs, but we see countering in your brief, is there was a company. And the company made, I think, cotton goods. And an individual thought that he could make a lot of money by taking those cotton goods and the machinery that they were used and selling it all over the United States. And so he did it. I think it was Alexander Hamilton.",
  "I'm not sure. And as a result, New England grew rich. Now, supposed he'd gotten a letter one day that said, we have a patent. We have a patent. And it would have cost him $10 million to look into it, and he didn't have all the money so he thought he'd run his chances. Suddenly I'm not so sure which way the equities would work out. That's your point. Both of you have a point.",
  "And that's why I'm looking for is there some way we can get the real worst ones without destroying what you don't want to have destroyed and yet, where he's really worried about the real worst ones?",
  "They just used the word \"willful.\" I'm not ­­",
  "I didn't ­­ I ­­ I didn't ­­ I have to admit for myself, in this kind of brief, it would have been much, much easier if people had used simplified examples with real numbers. I have a hard time thinking in terms of simply abstract words. But as far as I understand it, my law clerk says that this cost­based system of FERC is that the minimum­offer price has to be set, that is, they have to set a price at 90 percent of the cost of new entry for a combustion turbine generator or a combined cycle generator. That's as they calculated ­­ PJM, or if it's neither of those two kinds of generators, it's at 70 percent; is that correct?",
  "If that's correct, then if I have a generator up somewhere in the hills of ­­ of surrounding their hills in Maryland, and it's more expensive to get coal up into those hills or oil or natural gas, and so I have a generator that I can ­­ that's 500 megawatts, and it allows me, based on cost, to charge, if I were to charge the full cost, and that depends on the banks and loans and so forth, it allows me to charge $220 a megawatt­day. Okay?",
  "Does that? I can go to FERC, and I can say 70 percent of that is what I am going to put into the pool, 'cause I know that Maryland will give me the rest. And this is not one of those two kinds. And 70 percent of 220 is around ­­ I don't know, my math isn't too good ­­ 180. So they get awarded the contract 'cause it's 180, but there's some other firms that are more expensive over here, and those other firms don't get into it at all because we used up all the generating capacity that we needed for the next five years with your firm and a few others. And that changes rather dramatically who supplies the contract, and it also changes the price at which retailers across PJM will pay for the electricity they are getting from the pool. Now, is that right? That's either right or wrong.",
  "If it's right, it seems like the end of the matter. If it's wrong, then you explain to me why.",
  "Now, I'm assuming that the cost is higher than the 70 percent.",
  "So you're asking only for the case where it's below. You're not interested in the case where it's above. And this whole case has been argued only in the case where it's below.",
  "I'm not saying what happens. I'm saying we have to decide a legal issue. Is my legal issue to include my example or is it not?",
  "I don't want to use up all your time.",
  "Why? That's another problem I have here. I ­­ don't spend more than a minute on this, but I don't understand the procedural posture of this case. That is, it seemed to me it started out by saying that there was a ­­ a Supremacy Clause private right of action or something, which I think there isn't, in my opinion.",
  "And then ­­ and then it seemed to go we don't have FERC's opinion. We only have it through the SG. I thought there was a doctrine called primary jurisdiction where if the agency really ­­ their views is really relevant on that, you got their views directly, what happened to all that?",
  "Why? The ­­ the way that they've described it to me ­­ I'll try this once more. Because truer words were never spoke, than I am not quite on top of how this thing works. But the ­­ the ­­ the way he described is, what are they bidding into the PJM is their real cost. And when they are bidding their real cost, Maryland isn't going to pay them a dime. If they are an inframarginal unit, which I assume they would be, the cost for PJM is going to be higher, not lower. And there will be extra money. So what they are going to do is they are going to be paying Maryland. Now, what they said is, we're going to be paying you. Oh, he's shaking his head. So I haven't got that right, either.",
  "No? No, I have got it right? I don't know. I'm guessing at getting it right. Maybe not. Anyway, I ­­ well, you see my problem ­­",
  "­­ which is understanding this.",
  "Yes.",
  "But are they bidding their true cost into PJM?",
  "Well, that's another way of saying that the bid that ­­ that ­­ that FERC says that they have to make is not their actual costs ­­",
  "­­ because if in fact it's based on a cost of capital that is lower than what the cost of capital really is, that is a misstatement of their cost or a ­­ an ­­ a lower­than­actual cost, just as much as if the steel were in fact less expensive than what they actually have to pay.",
  "Let me try that with the example. Five thousand new megawatts of capacity is needed. Existing suppliers can't supply more than four. So FERC is trying to get an extra thousand. The people whom it will choose to give it and will allow to bid are those who are the new people who have the lowest cost. All of those people in a rising market will have higher costs than the existing people. So if in fact FERC looks to the existing people and says, which can bid? And says, you have to use your real costs. And if they really implement that, what you just said is going to have no effect on the market, because they will be in the market whether they are given a subsidy or whether they are not given a subsidy. And indeed, it won't affect the price because the price is affected only by the marginal units, who, by definition, have higher costs than anything that FERC will look to to see what these people's costs are. Therefore, it is without impact, and they add to that. We would like to make this argument to FERC where they have to focus on it and not just say in general to the SG, this is how we think, because by the time we're finished, we'll be able to modify present rules so that they will see that they are not hurt at all in the actual world by our costs. I did get something like that out of what they said. Maybe I'm wrong in what they think. Maybe they'll just agree because they think I'm agreeing with them at the moment, but I would like to know some response to that.",
  "No, no, I am agreeing with you. I am.",
  "I'm not shrugging my shoulders.",
  "I can see it. But what are the words of the field preemption thing that puts outside the preemption the thing that's worrying the Chief Justice? See, I ­­ I ­­ I mean, you ­­ you want to say the field is so defined ­­",
  "­­ as, and ­­ and now, look, billions of actions of States affect the cost of the generator and thereby affect the bid price into the PJM auction. Now, 99.99999 percent we want the State to do. They're perfectly free to do. But you want this 1 percent no. And ­­ and ­­ and I want the words that are going to define that field. That's what Justice Sotomayor was asking for before. It's something to do with the rule here in Maryland that forces them not just to have these artificial costs but to put it on the ­­ the auction.",
  "What are the words?",
  "I see targeting.",
  "Do it ­­ what is it we have ­­ they raised this in their brief.

Now, they say if this, in fact, triggers ­­ this is the question Justice Thomas asked ­­ if this, in fact, triggers a lifetime ban on the use of a gun, then do we not have to decide something we haven't decided? And I think it would be a major question. What constitutes a reasonable regulation of guns under the Second Amendment given Heller and the other cases with which I disagreed? But ­­",
  "­­ the point is, she's raised a question, and she wants us to answer that question. Is this a reasonable regulation given ­­ you just heard the argument, in part ­­ given the distance and so forth? So what am I supposed to say, in your opinion, in respect to that rather important question?",
  "Stop you at the first point. Your argument on the first point is that she did not raise the constitutional question. She said in order to avoid a constitutional question, we should decide it in thus such and such a way. So one answer would be, well, maybe so. We aren't facing the constitutional question. We are simply facing the question of what Congress intended. And if this does raise a constitutional question, so be it. And then there will, in a future case, come up with that question. So we ­­ or our point is, we don't have to decide that here.",
  "Thank you.",
  "What's awfully difficult in this case is not your case for me. It's not your case. It's the hundreds ­­ or not hundreds ­­ but look at all the briefs filed. There ­­ there are disqualification rules all over the law, and suddenly to turn this into a constitutional matter as we did in Caperton, which we did with our eyes open, we don't know what we're getting into. I mean, there are congressmen who can become judges who voted on statutes that come before them, as Justice Black did. There are executive branch officials who decide all kinds of things, and later on, something with their name signed on it comes up. When does the Constitution require it or not? So that's why I think you're getting these questions. My question is: Is there a way of avoiding this? And ­­ and the ­­ the thing that is suggested by ­­ by the other side is that you did ask for reconsideration. Reconsideration would have taken place without the chief justice because he had retired. Reconsideration can be pretty perfunctory, or it might be serious and thorough. Is there anything ­­ is there a way for us to send this back and say, you said you reconsidered it; we're not certain what that reconsideration consists of; reconsider it.",
  "I mean, is there a way to do that, and what do you think of that? That's what they're suggesting.",
  "Can we tell them to do that?",
  "Yes.",
  "So ­­ so we could say, given all the facts, of which there are quite a few, and the filing of a motion for reconsideration, and the fact that they may not have done it, go reconsider it, period. End of ­­ end of opinion. Can we do that?",
  "That's what I was hoping.",
  "Well, this is common in the situation where someone's appointed to this Court. There are a series of cases where he had sat, that judge. And very often they are decided by the two people who remain. They don't rehear the whole case.",
  "And in that case, there was nothing wrong with the participation at the time.",
  "The harder point is the judge from Guam, I think, who wasn't supposed to sit in the Ninth Circuit. And again, I think we ­­ the decisions went ahead. The same thing could come up with recess appointments, and there are many of those. And ­­ but I don't know where there's a disqualification of the judge because of bias. Now, in that kind of situation, is there any precedent that supports you, or maybe the other way?",
  "No, I'm not saying ­­ what I'm looking for is a disqualification because of bias, because in that circumstance there's something biased about that judge being in that panel. Now, in that situation ­­",
  "­­ I can think of a lot of others that I've just mentioned.",
  "In that situation, are there instances ­­ how does it cut? What does the ABA say about that one and ­­ and what have you found?",
  "Recuses because ­­ go ahead.",
  "Uh­huh.",
  "Uh­huh. Uh­huh.",
  "No, no, but there ­­ there's a difference, you see, where the judge recuses himself during the process. The remaining judges know that. And because they know that, they make an effort to decide it among the two. Where the judge didn't recuse himself during the process, the other judges take his point of view into account, just as they would if they're in any ordinary circumstance. Now, in practice, I think that's a big difference.",
  "Not ­­ not in an instance where you know that you shouldn't because that judge ­­",
  "­­ should not have participated.",
  "You can't know it at the moment.",
  "But ­­ but what you ­­ what you do know at the moment is that the two judges, or six, or whoever were there didn't think we must ignore his situation, what he thinks. They didn't think that, so of course, they didn't. In the situation that they're talking about in the ABA, I take it the remaining judges do know that they are not to take into account the opinion of the judge who is out of it.",
  "I ­­ I know. And I'm rather slightly self­regarding the statement. But, I mean, 20, 30 years ago, I had a case on fraudulent conveyance where my law clerk looked up every single case in sight, poor man. And we went back to Queen Elizabeth, and I wrote down what I thought it was. Well, obviously, that affects my ­­ my ­­ my thinking on this. And I don't have any way of knowing that it's still ­­ what I wrote was correct. It's called Burnazos, if you want to look at it. But not now. The ­­ but the point of the classical examples that we found ­­ let's take one of them ­­ is a person knowing that he's about ­­ has creditors. He has to know that he has creditors. Maybe he knows of the insolvency, and he transfers money to his wife rather than to the creditors. And she knows it too, and this is a way of getting the money away. That's a fraud classic, right?",
  "Okay. So now when I look at the statute, I see these words: To the extent that it's a debt, it's a debt obtained by actual fraud. Now, wait. Whose debt are we talking about? We're talking about Creditor C, who was a creditor of the transferor. And it's the transferee, the ­­ the wife who obtained ­­ she's the one who's got the money. And so it sounds like the bankruptcy statute is saying she's the one in her bankruptcy. Now, that can't be right. And so ­­ so how is this supposed to work? I mean, now you're ­­ the obvious question to ask you is the question, if it doesn't mean representation, give me one example of what it does mean. Well, I just gave you one, and as you can see, I'm ­­ I'm quite confused as to how that works. And I haven't seen another one.",
  "Uh­huh",
  "Yeah.",
  "So for the fee ­­ the problem with her is she is not trying to deceive a creditor of hers. She is not ­­ she is not trying to deceive her creditor, it's the transferor whose creditors are being fraudulently deceived.",
  "All right. So you're saying in a bankruptcy of the wife, this is money obtained by fraud, which it is. And the fact that she's helped him defraud his creditors is sufficient to bring us under the 1924 Massachusetts Statute. It's copied from the UCC, which ultimately is traced back to the Statute of Elizabeth. That's how it works?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you.",
  "All right. My question, so I better ask ­­ no. Go. You go. I'll ask ­­ I don't want to take your time.",
  "I'll ask. Ask.",
  "That's the part ­­ you see, it's still gnawing at me is I wish you had read this case. Because ­­ because when we went through it, this ­­ this sentence, fraudulent ­­ and I wouldn't raise this, except the only example other than the misrepresentation that you've come up with is the fraudulent conveyance. And what I said, after reading all ­­ \"fraudulent conveyance law permits creditors to recover money that a debtor has disposed of in a manner similar,\" and then I described three paradigm cases. All right. So what they're thinking of is a transferor has creditors. And what he did well before going into bankruptcy, but he knew he was likely to be insolvent, the transferor transfers money to his friends rather than the creditors, to a place that it's hard to get at, you know, to somebody who is going to ­­ all right. Now, looking at this statute, it seems to me that the person whose debt is going to survive bankruptcy is not the transferor, because normally, fraudulent conveyance law permitted his bankruptcy judge to claw back the money. But that's not what you're talking about. You're talking about the transferee, and you're saying here, the transferee's participation in the transferor's effort to defraud his creditor is something that also survives. And at that point I ask, of all the bad things that people can do that might survive, why in heaven's name do they pick on this one in respect to the transferee? I mean, after all, maybe the transferee robbed a bank. I mean, there are all kinds of bad things that might survive, and ­­ and don't. So was ­­ so am I ­­ something's wrong with my analysis, as you understand it, and that's what I've got to get into my head.",
  "Yeah. If I got what I'm talking about right, in terms of the debt.",
  "I see.",
  "Well, you have the 1924 Massachusetts statute copied from the Uniform Commercial Code, which, in referring to fraudulent conveyance in Section 7, uses these words: \"Each conveyance made with actual intent as distinguished from intent presumed in law to\" ­­ da, da, da ­­ \"hinder, delay, or defraud present or future creditors is fraudulent.\"",
  "I grant they did use the word \"actual intent,\" rather than \"actual intent to hinder delay, defraud,\" and then they said it is fraudulent. That sounds an awful lot like the words \"actual fraud.\"",
  "Well, a ­­",
  "The ­­ the friend who obtained the $40,000 which the friend knew was owed to the creditor of the transferor has obtained money, money through ­­ it is a debt. She owes the debt. She now owes the debt to the creditors of the transferor because she has the 40,000 knowing that it's wrongly conveyed. So she now owes the debt to the creditors, and her debt was obtained by actual fraud.",
  "Because?",
  "That's true.",
  "But it doesn't say ­­",
  "Sure.",
  "What about Mr. Ponzi's cousin who, in fact, had nothing to do with any of the misrepresentations, but knowing the entire truth says Ponzi, my friend, when you get those bags of cash, hide them under my bed, all right? Now, he himself has not, in fact, lied to anybody or made any misrepresentations, but he's part of the big scheme.",
  "And I take it we would say that that money under the bed has been obtained by actual fraud, hasn't it?",
  "Oh, so you're going to get him off, too.",
  "There was ­­ I mean, you know, there are dozens and dozens of cases where ­­ where people do have misrepresentations. There is no doubt there's a misrepresentation in this thing. But after all, not every participant in the great scheme himself lies.",
  "And those people, I would think, would ­­ you would expect to have fall within ­­ since they're part of the big Ponzi scheme, they would be right within this statute and their debts would not be forgiven ­­",
  "­­ because they weren't the ones who lied.",
  "That's your case.",
  "And I'm still ­­ as Justice Sotomayor said, seemed to me there is a ­­ look what you're saying here. The bankrupt or insolvent person transfers the jewels to his wife. Okay? And now what this would be saying under their reading is the jewels survive her bankruptcy, and quite right, that her husband's trustee could have clawed it back before, but he didn't. And so now it went through her bankruptcy, and if it survives, somebody can get it. And ­­ and maybe the fair thing to do is to do what you do with environmental cases or you have a bunch of people who are victims and they divide it up, because you're quite right, that all of the creditors who might have shared in the jewels are the victims, the creditors of the transferor. But so what? I mean, how does ­­ how does that help you with your basic argument? It just ­­ it's a different argument that says that this particular creditor shouldn't get all of it.",
  "It's also true in every misrepresentation case. If it survives bankruptcy ­­",
  "So he does, perhaps, to a thousand. He lied to a thousand people.",
  "There are a thousand victims. And here we have, let's say, a thousand victims, all those creditors who didn't get the money they should have gotten. I mean, it's the same problem, isn't it?",
  "I see.",
  "We ­­ we treat ­­ we treat in our veterinarian clinic domestic animals, your ­­ domestic animals or your household ­­ domestic animals, your dog ­­ your ­­ your favorite friends or your domestic pets, you see. Domestic pets is meant to say which domestic animals? Domestic animals, dogs, cats, or household pets? Domestic animals seems to cover the whole thing. They're saying, or it's like, i.e., household pets.",
  "Well, not for you. I mean, it's good for you, this word \"or.\"",
  "I grant you, I've had a horrible time trying to find an example. But ­­ but it could be it means i.e. She's saying it means i.e., household pets.",
  "In your interpretation. Let's look at this. It's the word \"involved.\" And you're saying it means ever involved; is that right?",
  "I see.",
  "In other words, it doesn't mean \"ever involved,\" and it doesn't mean \"now involved.\" It means involved during the three business days where da­da­da­da­da­da­da­da.",
  "And a person is supposed to understand that.",
  "In fact, you're supposed to read that into the silence.",
  "Now, that's, to me, a little farfetched, would you say?",
  "It's a jurisdiction ­­",
  "­­ that was involved.",
  "Ah.",
  "I see. And ­­",
  "All right. I'm trying to understand it. It is a jurisdiction that is involved in a special way. It is a jurisdiction that used to be a residence, and it is no longer a residence. And that creates an involvement even after they're no longer a residence. You know, the more I explain it, the less I understand it.",
  "That may be my fault, but ­­",
  "I'm firmly for purposes, but this one is a ­­ a little tough, because as I read it, literally, at all, I don't ­­ I don't get an interpretation ­­ and you could do the same thing. You're supposed to ­­ and you seem to be saying that. Look, you said you're supposed ­­ they're supposed to keep the registration current. Now, maybe there's a requirement somewhere that says when you're thinking of leaving, before you leave, you have to go tell the people before you leave of where you're thinking of going. So then I looked up what you have to have in here, and it says the attorney general can have regulations that would say something like I just said. But I take it there are no such regulations. And I take it when it ­­ it says, you know, the kinds of things you have to report, I guess. You know, you could get something like that out of it, but you're not arguing that.",
  "Yeah.",
  "So he's been living for 15 years in the Philippines where he is employed. He now changes his employment and he goes to work in Thailand. Now does he have to tell Kansas?",
  "Why is it? I mean, Kansas was once involved.",
  "Oh, what he's done is he's lived in the Philippines for 15 years, and now he's changed his residence to South Korea. Does he have to tell Kansas?",
  "But ­­",
  "They might have, but it's the language that's bothering people. And what ­­ I'm trying to see if there is support for this word \"involved\" which I hadn't really thought of. And ­­ and let's imagine he leaves Kansas. He left on Monday. It's now Tuesday. So he doesn't reside in Kansas anymore. He's now over residing ­­ he's not there anymore. So is Kansas still a jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a)?",
  "And your answer is \"yes,\" and I say ­­",
  "­­ okay. You mean any jurisdiction that he ever ­­ no, you said it's not ­­ it doesn't mean \"ever.\" I said, does it mean involved right now? No, you said it doesn't mean that, because if it's involved right now, it isn't. You mean it was involved two days ago? And now you have a general definition of that. And you mean it was involved because it was the last jurisdiction in which he actually resided. That's what you ­­ now, is that basically it?",
  "No, that can't be a reason to be involved, because he didn't ­­ I mean, there are a lot of people he didn't tell. I mean ­­",

  "Let's take what you mean. And now ­­ now I ­­ I have an idea of it. What support is there for that? Is there support in a regulation? Is there support in some previous case? Is there support ­­ and I'm thinking focusing narrowly on your interpretation of the word \"involved.\"",
  "Right.",
  "Tell me where it is.",
  "Yeah.",
  "What I think the Chief Justice asked ­­ I don't want to take words out of his mouth ­­ but I think the question was, one of the two lines that's been asked, is that in the district opinion at page 7, the district court has said that if the ASC regulation goes into effect, there will be one facility left in Austin, two in Dallas, one in Fort Worth, two in Houston, and either one or two in San Antonio. And before that, he said that the enforcement of the appointment privileges, the privileges of admission, would reduce the number from 20 down to about ­­ from 40 down to about 20. Now, I think the question was, what evidence did those findings rest upon? As you've heard, the other side, I think, say there is no such evidence, or the court of appeals said there is no such evidence. So can you give a brief account or page numbers that will show that those findings, the diminishment of the number from about 40 to about eight, which is what the district court found, rested upon some evidence? What was that evidence?",
  "What'd they say? Could you give us any record references later or on rebuttal?",
  "I thought that the Grossman affidavit, which I have ­­ I grant you, it's going on the briefs ­­ but it said at Table ­­ affidavit page 9, Table 2, says that the number of abortions that are, on average, performed annually at the remaining clinics is 2,000. So let's multiply by 2, and you get 16. Let's multiply by 3; you get 24. There were 70,000, approximately, women who needed these procedures. So I ­­ I had taken that. Is it that accurate?",
  "Okay.",
  "And you asked to put in this evidence, and then the court said no, we will not let you put in the evidence?",
  "I asked, did you ask to put in this evidence?",
  "No. Thank you very much. Okay. I'd like to go back to the ­­ the question that Justice Ginsburg was asking, which is about what is the benefit of this procedure. There are two laws. I am focusing on the first law. The first law says that a doctor at the abortion clinic must have admitting privileges in a hospital 30 miles within that ­­ nearby, right?",
  "Okay. Prior to that law, the law was that the clinic had to have a working arrangement to transfer such a patient, correct? I'm just reading it from this.",
  "Okay. So I want to know, go back in time to the period before the new law was passed, where in the record will I find evidence of women who had complications, who could not get to a hospital, even though there was a working arrangement for admission, but now they could get to a hospital because the doctor himself has to have admitting privileges? Which were the women? On what page does it tell me their names, what the complications were, and why that happened?",
  "But so ­­",
  "­­ Judge Posner then seems to be correct where he says he could find in the entire nation, in his opinion, only one arguable example of such a thing, and he's not certain that even that one is correct. So what is the benefit to the woman of a procedure that is going to cure a problem of which there is not one single instance in the nation, though perhaps there is one, but not in Texas.",
  "I didn't ask that. I'm sure there are people who had all kinds of reasons that would like to have this and so forth. And I'm not ­­ I'm just asking you, where we have a judicial duty to say whether this is an undue burden upon the woman who wants the abortion, there are two parts: Is she burdened and what is the benefit? And now on the first one, I've asked you to give a single example of an instance where there was a benefit, and you say, I think quite honestly, there is no such burden. So let's turn to the second. The second one, according to the amicus briefs here, which I guess I could validate, that even without the surgical center, leave it out, there are risks quite correct. Those risks are roughly the same as the risks that you have in a dentist office when you have some surgery, where you don't have an ambulatory surgical center. There are 28 times less than a risk of a colonoscopy, where you don't have ambulatory surgical center. There are like hundreds of times less ­­ you've seen these briefs. Okay. So I read them, and you read them. And so what is the benefit here to giving, I mean, the woman, her risk, I can't say it's zero here, this ambulatory surgical center when the risk is minuscule compared to common procedures that women run every day in other areas without ambulatory surgical centers?",
  "I don't see where this fits in, I mean, to the argument. I ­­ I don't question their purpose. I won't question their purpose.",
  "But the ­­ the ­­ what their purpose is, that they're worried about these complications and they want to make life safer for the women. All right? Let's take that as the purpose. You said there aren't very many complications. Now, would you say if you reduce the number of clinics, as has been argued ­­ maybe it isn't exactly that, but that ­­ and you ­­ you suddenly have at least 10,000 ­­ maybe a few less, and maybe a few more ­­ women who have to travel 150 miles to get their abortion ­­ maybe more, maybe stay overnight, maybe try to scrape together the money, you understand the argument ­­ are there going to be more women or fewer women who die of complications due to an effort to create an abortion? I mean, you read the briefs, and you've read the same articles I have. And of course the argument is if you lead to self­induced abortion, you will find many more women dying. So if the concern is this tiny risk of dying through a complication in a clinic, is this a remedy that will in fact achieve the legislature's health­saving purpose?",
  "I'd like to hear what he says.",
  "Normally, the defendant is the State in a voting rights case. They are the ones that have the plan until someone attacks the plan. These were Intervenors because they were affected. The Court said you could intervene. Now the State's gone. I'm looking for some kind of ­­ of rule or some kind of workable standard such that a new plan that the Court puts in would allow some people in other districts to remain to defend it, but not everybody. Or do you think everybody? I mean, after all, a plan in a smaller State that affects one district and makes changes likely affects people in every district, at least some of them. Some people will find it easier to get elected, some harder. I haven't found a case that supports you, but you'll tell me which one.",
  "Okay. Good.",
  "Meese ­­",
  "I'm ­­",
  "And the distinction between, let's say, the best one is the split district, you know, the one you were just talking about, Representative ­­",
  "­­ Forbes, right. If he has standing, who doesn't?",
  "But, I mean, in the voting context, the standard for saying that a person in another district is hurt enough to be able to maintain a standing here, and these people aren't, which ones are and which ones aren't? Meese used the formulation harm his chances for re­election.",
  "Harmed his chances for re­election.",
  "Here ­­ here is the basic problem. I ­­ I can't get the right analysis. Look, normally a plaintiff is suing because somebody did something to him. So the defendant is the person who did it. And normally we're looking for the standing of a plaintiff, and there are all kinds of rules there. The person who did this to the plaintiff is the State. They're not in it anymore. So what ­­ of course the ­­ the difficulty comes from the fact that the congressmen aren't the people who did it. I mean, these particular people aren't the ones who did it, but they're still in the case. It's rather like Smith sues Jones for a nuisance. There's an order entered. It is an injunction. Jones's neighbor Brown says, this injunction is hurting me. Now, does Brown have standing? And ­­ and at that point we're into a new kind of a case, and I'm sure there's law on it. And ­­ and I just haven't got the right things yet. And ­­ and these cases ­­ they have the ­­ they'll have the language, you say. I'm just not certain of the way to analyze it.",
  "Yeah. Yeah ­­",
  "Okay.",
  "Yeah.",
  "Meese was the case, wasn't it, about ­­ was that the case involving the ­­",
  "­­ supporting a lobbyist?",
  "Yeah, yeah. Political propaganda. Okay. So it's a harm to reputation. I see that. All right. If, in fact, this is a sufficient injury, the injury that now, the plan will make it harder for me to be elected, that should give rise to a claim by virtually every member of the State legislature. And indeed, if it gives rise to their claim in their hands, why not in the voters' hands?",
  "You have, in a State like Virginia, several million people who could attack any redistricting plan and any variation on any redistricting plan. That's quite a lot to read into Meese.",
  "Special because it's more severe in degree?",
  "There is no case that ­­ the closest you can come is the case of a lobbyist who is complaining about his reputation.",
  "He was a State Senator. That's fine.",
  "Is there anything better?",

  "That's the area District 5, District 5 in the State which is heavily African­American and so imagined racist legislatures changed the whole district so they couldn't possibly elect an African­American. Does the African­American member of Congress have standing to contest that?",
  "And as a congressman, not.",
  "No, I know it's different, but what I'm looking for throughout is the ­­ I understand that there has been no case which discusses this ­­ that I've been able to find. They have the Meese case, which is in a different context, but why is that different? And what's bothering me about it, which ­­ I don't want you to just say I'm right; I want you to explain why, if I a.m., or why I'm wrong ­­ is that there are potentially dozens of remedial plans and there are hundreds of possible plans for a State, and every plan will hurt someone. And if one district in a State is changed, suddenly you open the door to every legislature and every Congressman from every other district challenging the plan. That strikes me as a big shift in the direction of taking power from the legislature and turning it over to the judges as to what kind of districting plan you're going to have, and a mess to boot.",
  "That's what's worrying me.",
  "Well, I knew you thought I would be, given your comments.",
  "Excuse me.

Now, that ­­ I can understand why they would make that a crime.",
  "Why would they put it in RICO unless they wanted somebody who was hurt to be able to get damages?",
  "The injury is to somebody at the foreign airport.",
  "Look, business is hurt. They blew up an airport in ­­ in Tasmania. Okay? So ­­ so I guess that blowing up an airport there could hurt somebody. But my question is, what was it doing in RICO, if in fact Congress doesn't intend a foreign person hurt to be able to get damages? It's already a crime.",
  "That's my ­­ and maybe this is the wrong example. Think of ­­ they have a list of about 50.",
  "Okay. So some of them, I can ask this question to: What's it doing in RICO unless they want somebody to get damages?",

  "Why is it in RICO if they don't want damages?",
  "Well, I thought this was the same question, but I'm elaborating a bit because it's both for you and Mr. Frederick's reading. I thought the answer to my first question would be that the government just wanted the forfeiture provisions ­­ that's why it put them in ­­ or the criminal provisions ­­ that's why it put these other things in ­­ and you say, that's right. You say, but they didn't want the damages to extend abroad. That's your position.",

  "And you're the State Department for this purpose, and you ought to know.

Is it that no one actually spoke to anybody except the lawyer at the EU, and then the EU never spoke to anybody in any of the relevant Ministries of Justice or Embassy?

Do I have enough here to deal with it? What do I do?",
  "Did you consult with the embassies? Did the State Department go out and ask them to have their legal departments over in Germany look up what the actual effect would be of the damages?

And there were cases called Tamburlaine and others which, you know, led ­­ led to the kind of thing that the SG has described in his brief. So the Clayton Act is helpful in one respect, but not helpful in the other respect.",
  "Okay. Go ahead.",
  "Why? I thought ­­ I don't understand that. I thought the question in Smith, it was a suit against something happened abroad; isn't that right?",
  "All right. And ­­ and they said that the employee ­­ did they hold ­­ end up holding that the employee could not bring the suit?",
  "The employee could not bring the suit. And one of the reasons is because the Bivens action, which that was, is excepted from the Westfall Act, or is excepted ­­ there's an exception from the ­­ there's a preface of some kind.",
  "Why would it have had to come out the other way? If the Act didn't apply, if the whole thing didn't apply, if the Chapter didn't apply, if the FTCA didn't apply, including the exceptions from the FTCA, then how could the employee have ­­ why would it have come out the other way?",
  "What I'll do is I'll read that five times. I mean, this is a very complicated ­­ it's like Abbott and Costello and so forth ­­",
  "­­ but by the time you get through these statutes ­­ okay. I read it. I'll read it several times. I will absolutely take it in. Suppose I come to the conclusion that Smith, like so many of our cases, deals with a certain number of issues, and maybe there were alternative grounds and we didn't get to them, and I conclude that Smith, in fact, is not a bar to the argument that the other side is making. On that assumption ­­",
  "Because?",
  "I understand you think Smith is the end of it, and all I am saying is one of the things I'm paid to do it is read those cases, and then I have to reach a conclusion of whether Smith is the end of it. If it's the end of it, you win.",
  "Now, if it's not the end of it, do you lose?",
  "This is the language that's sort of hanging me up. \"The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to cases that are based on the exercise of performance of the failure to exercise and perform a discretionary function.\" \"Shall not apply to.\" Okay. Looks pretty good for you. But over here it says, \"The judgment bar shall constitute a complete bar.\" That's very good for you, but just said it didn't apply. It says this ­­ this chapter does not apply.",
  "That's in the chapter.",
  "Why is that bad? So ­­ I mean, look, as I read it simply, if I can, you look at the top of 2680, \"The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to.\" And then we have a long list. One of them is an action rising a claim based on a foreign country. So I bring a lawsuit. I was hurt in Mexico. This says the FTCA doesn't apply. And so you say, you know, if it doesn't apply, that means the definitions don't apply. So I say fine. It doesn't apply.",
  "And if I say ­­ you say the Rules of Civil Procedure don't apply. Fine. Nothing applies.",
  "You don't have an action.",
  "Can you say the other two before you ­­ I'm sorry.",
  "Because I broke into what you were saying before.",
  "What about ­­",
  "I can see that, but ­­ that is, imagine a plaintiff and the plaintiff brings a lawsuit against the Post Office for negligence. The government's defense is that this is a discretionary function, a particular thing. And the plaintiff says, you're right, it's a discretionary function. And now it's dismissed. All right. Now, if that last thing he read doesn't apply because it was discretionary function and fell within 2680, they then could see the Post Office on the basis that the Post Office has independent authority to sue or be sued. And it's hard to believe, he says, that Congress somehow, when they passed these words, \"does not apply\", suddenly wanted to revive all kinds of suits against, for example, the Post Office, which otherwise would have been barred by that last provision that he read.",
  "So we don't have to worry about the Post Office, the example that he gave. But there may be others. Sue and be sued is a fairly ­­ I mean, do we know what we're talking about? I like to try to know what I'm talking about. And do we know here what the reach of exempting that last provision from ­­ just erasing it in a discretionary action suit will be?",
  "So ­­ so you're ­­ can I ­­ are you saying this, in essence? Even if there are other provisions that aren't erased, even if there aren't, this particular erasure means that in an action that is dismissed ­­ an action against the government ­­ for the reasons listed in those exceptions ­­ for example, a foreign country, a discretionary exception ­­ in such an action, you can sue the employee where ordinary principals of res judicata wouldn't bar you from suing the employee after all. It's a different party.",
  "But you're saying any claim, if it falls within ­­ if the reason for the bar, if the reason for the dismissal falls within the exception, and if they wanted to change that, they should have said so.",
  "But then it has two other clauses which are the key clauses.",
  "And the trouble that I have is where it says ­­ the same problem that Justice Kagan raised. I mean, you have a statute that prohibits importing a vegetable that isn't a fish, and we can't read \"vegetable\" as \"fish.\" I mean, it just isn't. And what I'm having is the problem of the language.",
  "Let ­­ let me show you. The term \"State,\" just as she said it, includes the District of ­­ of Columbia and Puerto Rico.",
  "Where do we find that? In the first part of Title 11, which has to do with bankruptcy. So what it seems to be doing is it's the whole Bankruptcy Code. It's 11. So when I see the word \"State,\" that includes Puerto Rico. And then it says, \"except for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under Chapter 9.\" So I go back, I look at it, and it says ­­ one of the things, it says, well, a State law prescribing a method of composition of indebtedness. That is not for the purpose of defining who is a debtor under ­­ under Chapter 9. So what am I supposed to do about that?",
  "What the first part of the tree says is, State, nothing we say really stops you from controlling your municipality, except in one important respect.",
  "And the important respect is that you cannot have your own bankruptcy law.",
  "Yeah.",
  "But I read it as a decision tree. What am I supposed to say?",
  "I know that.",
  "They can't be a debtor.",
  "So ­­ so then where ­­ where ­­ where in the Code, except for this provision ­­ are there dozens of places? 20? A thousand? ­­ where the word \"State\" is used outside of Chapter 9's debtor provisions where then it makes sense to read Puerto Rico into it?",
  "About 40?",
  "And you have them in your brief?",
  "No, no, but I ­­ is there some reference? I can get them?",
  "All I have to do is to get myself to do the following thing: I could dress it up so people couldn't understand it. But what I would be doing is saying the following: It says a State law, and it says the chapter does not limit or impair the power of a State, okay, et cetera, et cetera.",
  "Now, all I have to say is that word \"State\" right there does not include Puerto Rico.",
  "My only problem with writing those words is somebody is going to direct me to the provision a little bit later where it says the word \"State\" in Title 11, of which this is part, means Puerto Rico. Okay?",
  "Now, that ­­ that's hard for me to do because of that language.",
  "That may be, but I can't say that an \"airplane\" means a horse.",
  "But it doesn't have to be just that. He has some ­­ an additional string to the bow; that is, what he wants us to do is to take the words \"a State\" ­­ \"this chapter does not limit or impair the power of a State,\" which is in 903. Now, he wants us to read that as if there were then a parentheses, \"a State that is a debtor under Chapter 9.\" You see? And that a State ­­ what States? The States that can be debtors under Chapter 9. Now, that's how he wants us to read it, and that means that that provision does not apply to Puerto Rico or D.C. But it isn't just that no part of Chapter 9 could apply to them. It is that if you look at the first sentence of 903, is that what it says is that those States that are referred to in that first sentence maintain all the power to control by legislation or otherwise a municipality. And he says, what could that apply to? Those entities that are not in Chapter 9 obviously have all the powers they normally had, but the ones that are in Chapter 9 might not. And so what this Section 903 is addressed to are those States that are in Chapter 9, because there's no need to apply that first sentence to anyone else, and therefore it doesn't apply to Puerto Rico, that first sentence. But since the key sentences, one and two, are subparts of the first sentence, they don't apply, either. I think that's the whole argument. And it isn't requiring us to really play that much ­­ you don't play games with the words. All you do is say, this is one of those parts of Chapter 9 ­­ not all, but one of those parts ­­ that even though it doesn't use the word \"debtor\" under Chapter 9, applies only to debtors under Chapter 9. I think that's the argument I got, and is that ­­ that's, I think, probably consistent with what Justice Kagan was saying.",
  "You got it? Do you see what I'm saying?",
  "Good. All right.",
  "But not ­­ no. In ­­ my guess is, if we go through Chapter 9, and the parts that will ­­ do apply to debtors under Chapter 9 ­­",
  "­­ whoa, whoa, whoa ­­ municipalities. State municipalities. If we go through Chapter 9 and look at those portions of Chapter 9 that do apply to municipalities who are there legitimately as debtors, we will find some sentences that clearly apply only to those who are in there as debtors and clearly do not apply to anyone else in the world. And he is saying this is one of those.",
  "All right. So you're saying is ­­ I take it you're ­­ that you say ­­ you say ­­ you're just used to this. So you don't understand that I'm not used to it. And the ­­ the ­­ you ­­ you go look at 903. There ­­ there are three separate sentences. And you're saying that the ­­ the first sentence and second and third are really separate things. That number 2 and 3, which are numbered 1 and 2, have a big objective. If I read the cases you cite, I will say Congress intended something very clear. They didn't want those States who weren't in Chapter 9. They didn't want those States who were not in Chapter 9. They didn't want them to make rules for bankruptcy of municipalities, not binding rules, anyway. That was their purpose. And there's just no reason to think that when they had the specific thing before, they wanted somehow to let Puerto Rico and District of Columbia do it, do what the States couldn't do.",
  "And you say, well, there is a good reason. They said the good reason is the States can come in to 9, and they can't. And you say, well, that isn't a good enough reason. Is that where ­­ have I got this?",
  "Referencing that, can you give me one more thing? Give me your best either Law Review article, treatise, legislative history, whatever it is, that will ­­ that will show me that, in your view, look, these are separate things. This ­­ the first sentence was not meant to be just a gateway into ­­ into 1 and 2, that ­­ that it was designed to do what you say. What do I ­­",
  "Are you finished?",
  "All right. I have ­­ You must have thought about this question, I suspect. I'll assume, I want to assume for purposes of the question, that this isn't just a matter of signing a form with an objection. Your ­­ your clients are involved in the health care plan in major ways. They probably figure ­­ sign papers every five months or every day, and they choose insurers. They do all kinds of things. And it's the topping, the icing on the cake, that pushes it over the edge, which is that you have to fill out the form saying, I object, this is my insurer, you then can contact my employees, da, da, da, da, da. It's a whole bunch of things. All right. So the question is, putting that all together now, are they protected by RFRA? I think the reason that the Court went from Sherbert and Verner over to Smith was they couldn't figure out how to apply Sherbert and Verner. And it's Sherbert and Verner that RFRA picks up. And this is at least one difficulty with it, which is where I'm going. And I've even read St. Benedict. You know, not ­­ not for religious purposes, I'm trying to find out something about being a member of society. Sometimes when a religious person who's not a hermit or a monk is a member of society, he does have to accept all kinds of things that are just terrible for him. Think of the Quakers, the Quakers who object to Vietnam. Think of the people who object to laws protecting blasphemy. Think of the people who object to shoveling the snow in front of the walk that will lead to the abortion clinic. Think of the Christian Scientists who know when they report the accident, the child will go to the hospital or the adult and receive medical care that is against their religion. So there are loads of things. I've just given you four. Think of the taxes. Well, there's no question that doesn't violate the religious clause. But plenty of other things do. So what's the line? Why do the Quakers have to pay the taxes for Vietnam, but you don't find the religious Jew or Muslim getting an extra day off during the week when the law says nobody can work on Sunday because their sabbath is on Saturday? What is the line? And I've been reading and reading to try to find a fairly clear simple statement of what that line is and how it works. And to repeat the difficulty of Sherbert and Verner, which is what RFRA does, quite honestly, doesn't help me. But you might.",
  "Did ­­ did they tell me that it worked?",
  "No, the Quaker, the Quaker. You think that wasn't a substantial burden?",
  "I see your point is that ­­ let's imagine a widespread government program filled with exemptions. There are a smaller group of people who need an exemption for religious reasons. We look at those other exemptions. Some seem to have good reasons; some seem to have terrible reasons. We ­­ really, under the RFRA or the First Amendment should exempt the religious too, right?",
  "Okay. I've just described to you the United States Tax Code where we know that you do not have to have an exemption for those who are religiously objecting, for example, to paying taxes because it would support a war.",
  "Okay. So what ­­ that's what I'm looking for. Same question. And I'm not asking it to refute you; I'm asking it because I'm looking for what the distinction actually is. And for the reason I just said, I don't think the distinction can be, well, you've exempted some people, so you have to exempt the religious people too. But that would run throughout the government of the United States. So what ­­ we know there is a distinction, or at least you ­­ I believe you when you tell me there's a ­­ I want to know what you think it is.",
  "No, they're not. All right, well, go ahead. You want to say that.",
  "I got where you're going with your exemptions, but that's not the thrust of my question. The thrust is I haven't found it yet. I want to find what the real distinction is, whether you call it RFRA or call it Smith, I don't care what you call it. I'm trying to find the basis for the distinction between those things that we do require people to do despite their religious objection and those things that we don't. And if you want to think there's no such difference, just read ­­ as you've read, Neuborne's brief. Lists them all in two pages. Some go one way; some go the other way. He says it's because of other people being involved. That might be the answer, but what's your answer?",
  "What ­­ what is the right line?",
  "Give me a hint what the direction is.",
  "So that's why ­­ you see, that's exactly what I have found difficult, exact. And I ­­ I read the briefs. Neuborne said that. Your brief said that. We'll look to see ­­ it's not the kind of burden that counts for purposes of RFRA or the ­­ or the First Amendment. Where the burden is of a certain kind. Now what kind? And would you say, well, a kind where it arises out of the fact that we have a program that affects third parties in a big way? Okay? Well, we have the Vietnamese church of the escapees in Los Angeles who are so poor they have to meet in the basement of a house, and the parking regulations stop their congregation from coming even if they want to meet only on Sunday. Think about that one. We can put that easily into the context of third parties being hurt. So they can't practice their religion. So ­­ so that one. I can think of a lot of counter examples. But maybe you couple that with what we have in the tax cases. Administrate. Widespread administrative rules the government has ­­ has leeway where third parties, widespread, administrative. You see? So I'm ­­ I'm trying to get the thinking of the people who have thought about this, which are you and ­­ and the others here on what's the best way to treat that burden. It's not hard to find in religious writing. And the people when they go into society assume some burdens that they are going to find totally obnoxious.",
  "Well, then what do I do?",
  "Is this right? Is it that the reason I get that you don't want to have the women to have to ask for the coverage is because vast numbers of women will, quite a few who have religious objections won't, and then there will be that middle set of people who are inertia bound. And since they are inertia bound, we can't say so what, because poor people who don't object religiously, if they get the contraceptives, that lowers the cost of health coverage later on. So the government has an interest in that. And therefore, there is an interest of some kind in not allowing a system ­­ in not having a system where the inertia bound have to take initiative. Have I got that right?",
  "All right. Do I have the other part right, which is this is not hijacking because there is a Federal regulation that says the infrastructure of the insurers' contraceptive­related plan belongs to the insurer, not to the person who buys the insurance? Am I correct about that?",
  "You have a discovery be problem. I don't see that it's a standing problem. And two things it reminds me of are, one very common, a financer takes an interest in receivables and he's going to have to collect them as receivables and there may be 50,000. That could have the same kind of practical problems. Or we had cases in the First Circuit you may or may not be aware of where somebody went around and had assignments for 50,000 cabbages that were delivered a day late in 50,000 box cars and each one was worth about $10. Nobody figured a way out of that. They had to pass a special statute. There was -- and so it seems to me you're better off than the cabbage people because have you two possible remedies: One on discovery; you could ask the judge, Judge, see what the Communications Commission thinks. It's called primary jurisdiction of the kind.",
  "Or you could go to the FCC and you say, FCC, you got us into this. Now, you have some rules here that make some sense in terms of collection. You have both those agency avenues open to you, not open to the cabbage people, and this doesn't seem a standing problem. Now, what's your response to that?",
  "How is that different?",
  "Just on that very point -- I need clarification on this. How is that different than the case of the financer who takes accounts receivable, which is very common? You finance the accounts. You take a secured interest in accounts receivable.",
  "And there you might foreclose on the secured interests. Then you as the financer have to collect from everybody. How is your case different from that?",
  "In the respect you were just talking about.",
  "I know, but I mean, there may be many reasons for that. I'm just saying it's a normal, practical problem, I believe, in the banking community. I don't know.",
  "Go back to my question, I'd like to get an answer to it.",
  "In respect to the problem you were just mentioning, the discovery problem of counterclaims or those problems, is this case any different than the financing case I just mentioned?",
  "No.",
  "Well I guess it could be that you're asking them to go back into records that are somewhat old. What you're asking to find out is -- is every call made out of a payphone that was long distance call, and we don't even know who actually turned out to be the carrier. It's like asking them, tell us exactly on the payphone at that corner over there who was called at 9:15 a.m. to some number in 1987, and maybe they should have records of that but they don't. They have estimates --",
  "They say maybe the time necessary to go through those records, to figure out whether you should give 12 cents to the person who ran that payphone, is really not worth it.",
  "And therefore, if they are right in some claim like that, is there a way to get this worked out at the FCC? I mean, it -- it -- I don't think it was the purpose of this statute to have 12 cent claims, even aggravated, brought back years later under some set of procedural rule that will be so expensive to get the discovery that this just won't be worth it. Now that might be right. And if it is right or whether it's right, can the FCC work this out?",
  "I'm aware of that system. I'm aware of that.",
  "Right. But my question is to get to that figure there may be billions of calls, for all I know.",
  "And it could be quite expensive to track down each of those calls individually. I don't know if it is or not; but if it is, is there a way to get this problem worked out at the FCC or do we have the cabbage case grown large?",
  "In settlement they may work out. But if it is -- for example costs a dollar to fight a claim that's worth 12 cents, individually, before you get to billions, they don't want to be in that situation where they are really paying money for nothing; because in their opinion they already paid. I mean we understand this kind of problem. So I go back to my question. They have one view of it; you have another of what's going on here. And their view is very unfavorable to your clients and your clients' view is very unfavorable to their clients. So I would like to know is there a way to get this worked out at the FCC? Maybe that will turn out not to be relevant in this case but I'd still like to know your opinion.",
  "Do you -- this is giving me a thought here. Just a total imaginary case, nothing to do with your clients. Put yourself in the opposite position. Suppose you were representing a defendant and that defendant were asked by this imaginary plaintiff to dig up records on the computer. To dig up each individual record costs $1, there were billions of such records, and the value to you, to the other side, the plaintiff, imaginary in this case, was 12 cents a call. Okay? So you say look, those people are asking us to dig up billions of records, it's going to cost us a dollar each to do it, and all they are going to get out of it is 12 cents a call. But of course we are the ones who have to pay the dollar, and they get the 12 cents. Now, is there a way for the legal system to solve that problem?",
  "Other than standing.",
  "Well, the defendant says -- now your client, I am not going to settle; there are no such claims. This is ridiculous but it's going to cost me a dollar to prove it."
