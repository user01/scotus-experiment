  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think I would want to note at the outset that the alleged due process violation which keeps puffing up and then disappearing and has as far as I can tell not appeared at the state supreme court, did make one appearance in the reply brief here, is really not before the Court, and for understandable reasons, because although it is part of the popular culture to talk about how unfair it is to change the rules of the game, I think that misses the point when the game is over, and when it's over in a kind of photo finish that leaves people unsure who won, and then the question is, how do you develop great, sort of greater certainty, and a rather common technique is a recount, sometimes a manual recount, sometimes taking more time would be rather like looking more closely at the film of a photo finish. It's nothing extraordinary. It's not like suddenly moving Heartbreak Hill or adding a mile or subtracting a mile --",
  "No, no.",
  "Certainly not, Justice Kennedy, but I read U.S.C. Section 5 -- that is 3 U.S.C. Section 5 not as a requirement that, for example, one never add resources to checking how a particular ballot was cast. If you look at the language, I think it's really much too casual to say of it that all of the laws must stay fixed in order to have the safe harbor apply. As I'll try to argue in a few minutes, that's not really a question for this Court, but for the Congress, but the language of Section 5 is that -- and I'll just read what I think are the key words, \"if a state --\"",
  "Actually, I'm just reading from a copy of the U.S. Code, 3 U.S.C. Section 5, not from any -- the page I can identify --",
  "Yes, although I'm afraid I don't have it in front of me.",
  "Thank you, Justice Souter. Page 3A of the blue brief, I am reliably informed. So if any state --",
  "Well, I tried. I tried. If any state shall have provided, and then it says by laws enacted prior to the day fixed for the appointment of the electors, a fancy way of saying election day, for the final determination of any controversy or contest about the appointment of electors -- and here's the key phrase, I think -- by judicial or other methods or procedures at least six days before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors, that means in our situation, December 12, then the final determination shall be conclusive and govern the counting in Congress. Now, the question for Congress, I suppose, would be, although I don't see how this Court could get into that question at this stage, but the question would be, is a particular change extending a deadline for exigent circumstances because a recount has been authorized, a change in the judicial or methods of procedures for resolving the contest.",
  "No, I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, it's just that I don't trust my own imagination to have exhausted all possibilities. For example, in the case in, I think it was 1890, in Fitzgerald v. Green when this Court held that only states can punish fraudulent voting for presidential electors, it got into the act sort of obliquely and at an angle, and that had a bearing on the question of how the presidential electoral slate might be composed, but it certainly didn't get into this.",
  "Very.",
  "That's certainly right.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, first of all I do want to be clear that in our view the question of whether and when and how the Florida legislature can enter the picture is in no way presented here. That paragraph was intended to suggest that it's not obvious that the views of some that there's no problem is right. Secondly, if it were the case that the Florida legislature could not simply decide, well, we're tired of all this counting, we're moving in, and that this Court cannot decide whether the conditions of 3 U.S.C. Section 5 are met, it would then remain only for Congress to make a determination and adding the Florida legislature would not, after all, have added an adjudication.",
  "Well, perhaps, Justice Kennedy, but I frankly can't see how it would affect the decision in this case. After all, you have before you a judgment of the highest court of the state. As Justice Ginsburg and others have suggested, it would ordinarily be the case, surely, that one would not go out of one's way to read the judgment as a breach of faith with the duties of trying to reconcile provisions that are --",
  "Well, Justice O'Connor, I certainly agree that if the Florida Supreme Court adverted to 3 U.S.C. Section 5, and as Justice Kennedy asked earlier, got it wrong, then there would be a Federal issue for this Court. Would it be, I wonder, a Federal issue --",
  "No. The answer is no.",
  "It would be nice. But remember it is --",
  "But, Justice O'Connor, under Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, the authority to regulate the manner of the choice of electors is vested in the state legislature. If the state legislature decides from the beginning to exercise that authority by instructing the various institutions, certainly not just the courts, the attorney general, the secretary of state, in very particular ways to exercise their roles in the process, with a specific view of --",
  "Well, I suppose it could be a violation of Florida law if the enactment of that date is construed as a direction to a particular authority like the secretary of state or the state's highest court to take certain actions in order to get the benefit of this bonus, but only a violation of Federal law. I don't see how you got a --",
  "Of state law. I'm sorry.",
  "Well, it might have been a violation --",
  "But it seems to me that the Federal question, which is really what brings us here, can only arise if 3 U.S.C. Section 5 is something other than what Mr. Olson called the indemnification of the state.",
  "That's right, if one concluded that Florida had violated its duty to empower the legislature to take these regulatory steps.",
  "I think that's possible, Mr. Chief Justice, but the judgment before you doesn't provide even an inkling, I think of proof about those matters. All we have --",
  "Well, I think we have been arguing several interrelated things. One of the things we have been arguing is whether one could in good faith reach the conclusion, novel as it was in some respects, as Justice O'Connor points out, that the Florida Supreme Court reached. Now, if the answer to that question was no, perhaps if there were a due process issue in this case, and if someone had a protectable interest that was injured, that would be relevant. But the Federal question that makes that relevant here would arise only if one forgot that 3 U.S.C. Section 5 is all carrot and no stick.",
  "Well, that they can never avert to their own constitution?",
  "Well, what would it be, I wonder, about the circumstances here that would say that in reconciling these provisions which at first we were told were mandatory, then we were told they are not mandatory, they give discretion, and now we are told that the real issue is simply did the court in putting a boundary on that discretion, do something federally impermissible. What would it be about that sequence that would implicate --",
  "It seems to me that as a tiebreaker, as a way of shedding light on the provisions that are in conflict, so long as it's not done in a way that conflicts with a Federal mandate, they are not violating any --",
  "It seems to me that it's already been conceded that the legislature can delegate that function to the judiciary. And when Justice Kennedy asked if it can delegate the function to the judiciary, and that is what McPherson seems to suggest, then can it not delegate something less, that is, can it not give the judiciary a role of the sort that it's exercising here? After all, the legislature, and this is important -- it's not true in every state -- the legislature itself repromulgates the Constitution every several years and then it's ratified by the people.",
  "Right.",
  "I fully accept that, Justice Souter. I'd supplement it with one important point. We are not dealing here with a decision in which within the gray area where a court could reasonably go either way, this court simply said we don't care about these Federal considerations. It in particular exercised its equitable powers in favor of the Petitioner in order to facilitate meeting the December 12 deadline while still being able to have electoral contests. That December 12 deadline comes purely from Federal law.",
  "That's right.",
  "I think that makes sense.",
  "It might be different.",
  "I certainly don't think they have done the third. They did not say -- I think when they underscored the presence of language that Justice Scalia read about what's mandatory, they were simply being candid about the fact that they were acting in conflict with one part of the statute, but the adjacent --",
  "Justice Scalia --",
  "Justice Scalia, both you and I think at one point Justice O'Connor, in pointing to the particular dates that came out differently under the approach that this Court used from what would have emerged if they had looked only at 102.111 are making a mistake, with all respect. It's not as though this Court promulgated a rule for the future about December 7th in commemoration of Pearl Harbor, we say December 7 is the day. No. What they did was say we have to find a date which will accommodate these conflicting statutory provisions and policies in light of what our constitution tells us, and we surely -- it would amaze, I would think amaze this Court to see anyone saying that because an opinion was organized under Roman numeral headings --",
  "-- in such a way that --",
  "Absolutely.",
  "That's right, and surely --",
  "Exactly. And I guess to take a broad --",
  "Especially, I think, Justice Ginsburg, when the odds that these conceivable Federal problems are indispensable to this result, are overwhelmingly negative. It's not as though one cannot explain the result this Court reached in the most conventional standard ways, and the fact that --",
  "Justice Scalia, I can do a little better than find a sentence. The entire structure of that part of the opinion, as Justice Stevens points out, would be incoherent if the constitution was decisive. That is the highest law in Florida. Why bother with all the rest if that is anything more than an interpretive guide.",
  "But, Justice Scalia --",
  "They also say that the provision that reaches the result that conflicts with the authorized recounts was written in 1951, that in 1989 they wrote a provision that unmistakably created discretion, and we haven't yet discussed this provision, also created the provision that when the returns are filed late, it doesn't say throw them away, it doesn't say give them back, it says fine every member of the canvassing board $200 a day. That would be a totally crazy provision. As this opinion understands, if you were not to reach a reconciliation of this sort, this result was overdetermined under Florida law. It might be true that they said the constitution also points this way, but there isn't a sentence in the opinion that suggests that without that constitutional argument the result would have to be different.",
  "Well, it looks to me like an exercise of the chancellor's foot, as it were, in this particular case. When I saw the date, November 26th, I couldn't come up with an algorithm or a formula that would generate it, but the court was confronted with the task of drawing, as this Court has recognized, what are sometimes inevitably arbitrary lines; that is, it said it was not consistent with the overall scheme of the statute to require these recounts, which had just begun, to terminate. That truly would be a promise to the ear to be broken to the hope, like a munificent bequest, Justice Jackson said --",
  "-- in the pauper's will. Why tell people the count if you won't count it?",
  "I -- honestly, Justice Kennedy, I'm not sure because the language that I quoted from 3 U.S.C. Section 5 focuses on the institutional dispute resolution arrangement that is in place, and if you look at the legislative history in the decade of hearings in the period after the Hayes-Tilden debacle, that history focused on the importance of having a fixed tribunal which you could look to rather than one cooked up at the last moment, and indeed what they seem to be most afraid of was the political entry of legislators and executives at the 11th hour. There was no focus at all.",
  "Well, there are certainly no cases on the subject. The language gives me very little guidance. Since the section is addressed to Congress, neither my opinion about it nor the Court's opinion is necessarily --",
  "I think I would advise the Congress that it is not a new enactment, that it is an entirely reasonable construction of an existing enactment as to which the only alternative construction is to make it self-destruct, and to make it internally contradictory, and I honestly don't think if I were advising Congress that I would say it's a new construction. I do think, also, that some people reasonably could argue the contrary, and I guess I think that this language should be interpreted whether by a court or by Congress in a way that gives some deference to the state government and its organs, and I think any degree of deference here is inconsistent with saying that there's been a Federal violation, especially when -- I want to remind us all about the context. Are we going to say that this paragraph in this opinion says that Florida is in breach of Article II of the Constitution in general? Hard to say. I don't think so.",
  "Yes, but if the legislature is entirely happy not to completely delegate this power to the courts, which Article II would permit, but rather to allow the courts to exercise a somewhat more flexible role than the one that the critic of this opinion would be embracing. That's within the power of the legislature of Florida.",
  "Anyone. If you just read the statute in 1989 and it says may. It says she may reject the late returns.",
  "No, the date is the one from which the may is measured. That is, you're supposed to get it in by seven days later. What if you don't? Well, if you don't, she may or she may not reject them. Now, anybody reading that would realize that's a deadline only in a kind of Pickwickian sense. It's not a real deadline. She's got discretion. Certainly if there's an act of God of the sort Justice -- was it Justice Stevens? -- asked about --",
  "And it's an entirely normal exercise of judicial interpretation to say that this statute is not limited to God and machines.",
  "Well, I have to say my experience parallels that --",
  "The odd thing is that the system in Florida involves their own repromulgation of the constitution, and their scheme with respect to the resolution of disputes over elections draws a sharp distinction between elections to their own House and Senate, which they won't trust the courts with as far as they can throw them. Those are to be resolved exclusively in the House and Senate, and all others are to be resolved in the courts under a standard that they understandably preferred.",
  "Well, I suppose if they were at all far-sighted, if they looked at their own work and saw how self-contradictory it was, they might say we would want someone with the authority to reconcile these provisions to do so in the light not only of the literal language but of the fact that they are dealing with something very important, the franchise, that disenfranchising people, which is what this is all about, disenfranchising people isn't very nice.",
  "And it violates the Federal as well as the state Constitution.",
  "Well, it's not uncommon, given the convenience of having similar regulations apply on election day not to bifurcate. Oregon v. Mitchell, after all, confronted the nation with a problem --",
  "And they would recognize that when the Federal election involved the presidency of the United States with the special problems of the Electoral College deadline, they might emerge with rather different deadlines and to some extent a different approach for the -- to elections.",
  "Yes. That's -- that's entirely true.",
  "And there is an administrative order --",
  "Well, there is a consent decree arising out of Federal law. There was the Federal general statute --",
  "That's right. In 1986, there was a congressional statute that already created that difference.",
  "No. No, I certainly don't think so. They cut out judicial review -- even this may not be entirely consistent with the Florida Constitution. They cut out judicial review for the election of their own members in the House and Senate. I certainly don't think they would have the authority to expel the Federal judiciary from the election of senators and representatives.",
  "I'm not actually clear about that, Justice Ginsburg. I have thought about it a lot. It seems to me that under Smiley v. Holm and similar cases, the general principle is that the Constitution takes the state government and its arrangement as it finds it, and that when the legislature is identified, that really does not mean the legislature in some specialized capacity, as with Article V. Now, if that's the case and if it's therefore assumed that the legislature is surrounded with both executive and judicial authority, then a decision by the legislature to completely exclude the judiciary from any possible role, the state judiciary, might be inconsistent with the underlying meaning of Article II itself.",
  "I'm not sure. That's very much like my inability to answer because I honestly have not reached a conclusion that it's not presented by this case. I don't know whether the legislature could do the further thing of naming electors, and if it doesn't do that --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The parties on both courts below agree on at least two things, first, that section 201(c) represents a compromise that assures freelance authors that they may control and exploit their individual contributions to collective works like newspapers and magazines in new anthologies and serializations and screenplays and other derivative works unless they've expressly transferred that right. The parties are also agreed as are both courts below that 201(c) assures the publication of collective works that the publisher of such collective works has the aggregate right to publish any article in the collective work both in publishing the collective work itself of course, but also in publishing that article, quote, as part of any revision of that collective work, again unless there has been an express transfer of the right. Now the principal impetus for this measure was a rather strong wish to undo several quite notorious rulings like that of the Southern District of New York in the Geisel case in 1968 which of course involved the legendary Dr. Seuss and denied him the right to stop the unauthorized distribution of toy dolls that were derived from cartoons that he had published decades earlier. There is no hint at all in the history of this measure and I think no hint in the way it's written that microfilm, for example, which had been in use for some 40 years at the time this measure was passed and which people used to make copies of individual articles more often than to make copies of entire cumbersome periodicals was seen by anyone as a problem to be addressed or solved by 201(c).",
  "The ultimate end user.",
  "As do we, Justice Scalia, in Nexis and in the CD-ROMs, the entire text with the exception of certain graphics that cannot be handled by ASCII is put in.",
  "That's right and in this case you basically conduct a search under the algorithms that are used by Nexis, conduct a search of the entire periodical whether you call for a particular topic --",
  "Well it's in virtual -- it's in -- it's certainly not -- it's not a newspaper that we're used to. You can't drink your coffee to it or wrap your fish, in it but that really is a red herring, if I may say so.",
  "At any one time, but with a very simple prompt of about 15 characters you can get the entire periodical.",
  "You certainly can. That's why we're --",
  "Yes, and for decades --",
  "Sometimes. What's happened, Justice O'Connor, it appears that for at least 20 years people have assumed because no one complained of this practice that the standard contract was not limited to the print medium. Now as of 1995, for example, the New York times made clear they would not make contracts with people for print only.",
  "That's right. On the basis of a display argument that is disclaimed by the Tasini respondents that wasn't made below and that doesn't make sense under the statute, because quite clearly if we are involved in reproduction and distribution display is covered in the intersection of those. It's not, I think, a serious argument. You notice the solicitor general did not decide to come into this case. But you're right about the register of copyright. However that --",
  "It's an interesting theory, Justice Ginsberg, but I've tried to imagine how by carving this pie into two pieces one could give the older, the other, more muscle.",
  "Well, in 1995, I was saying a minute ago, the New York Times said we're not going to run articles print only. It would be kind of pointless now when almost everything has to go onto the Internet or be preserved in some other way other than print and they said that our contract will automatically cover print and electronic rights. And what's interesting is that the royalties didn't change a cent after that. I think it's a kind of belief in magic that leads some people to think that if there's an inequity of bargaining power it will be solved by creating two estates rather than one. In fact, in the mid 1980s it's interesting that the respondents went to Congress, the National Writers Union went to Congress and tried to get a measure much more modest than this one, a measure that would say that when there is a demonstrable inequity in bargaining power, an unconscionable arrangement, and when that's shown by individualized proof there could be a transfer of rights. Here they want a wholesale, global transfer which I don't think is necessarily going to change anything for the future but could have very serious impact on existing writings whose authors and heirs and assigns are going to be extremely difficult to locate.",
  "That's right and all I'm saying is there is not any particular reason to think the deals will come out very differently.",
  "Well, I think, Justice Scalia, that they think quite rightly that they can get a lot of money to settle a case in which, if we were to lose, we and many other publishers around the country would have no choice but to engage in defensive deletions of a lot of material that could otherwise expose us to massive statutory damages under the copyright laws. That's why a number of Pulitzer Prize winning historians have said they're afraid of what it will do to their research. That's why the American Library Association which is an amicus on their side has conceded that it's awfully difficult to find these people and there may be an adverse impact. Even the register of copyright in the letter to which you referred, Justice O'Connor said there may be an impact on scholarship and research. And I think that's an understatement.",
  "I don't know that that will help a lot, Justice Ginsburg and the reason is that keeping something on Nexis or in CD-ROMs that you have in circulation after it has been determined to be infringing and letting people potentially have access to it, which the download might be an infringement, would be a new act. So I don't think the statute of limitations will solve the problem.",
  "I think that's the irony, Justice Ginsberg. I think the erasures of a lot of these things will not be in the interest of the people whose work may be erased but someone who wrote an article in 1980 and maybe was 60 years old at the time and maybe isn't around at the moment, there are a lot of people like that. We don't know how many. We don't know how many articles, but the U.S. News and World Report has already decided in anticipation because there's no -- they think no analytic difference between microfilm and some of these products, certainly the GPO CD-ROM which is a photographic copy is not different, they've stopped putting their work on microfilm. The line drawing problem here, if I may say, is one of several reasons why recalibrating the balance that Congress struck is a particularly inappropriate job for the Court.",
  "No, certainly.",
  "Well under --",
  "You would think that, but under 504 damages are not measured by the harm to the person who sues. There is a provision that says that they can take the -- get the benefit of the presumption that all of our gross income was attributable to their contribution and the theory of that would I suppose be that they don't need a theory because the statute says it, but the theory would be that all of the work we put in electronic form would not have been worth anything if it looked like Swiss cheese with stuff missing.",
  "It's rebuttable. But they can also elect statutory damages which can go up to $30,000 a violation and some courts accept the Nimmer theory of multiple violations per infringement. It would be more even, if not, it could be --",
  "No, it's more if it's willful. But there is a statutory provision in any event and it would become willful.",
  "I think it's a sliding scale, Justice Scalia, and I think there is discretion to set it. And it can be very low, I think as low as $250 and as high as over 10,000, but I have to say I don't remember for sure. But the point is there are something like 100,000 freelance articles just on Nexis. There are 18,000 journals on Nexis. You don't have to multiply 100,000 or 50,000 or 20,000 by a very large number to know that a good business judgment for a lot of these companies is going to be who wants the litigation, and you couldn't put together class actions to solve the problem easily, given Amchem and Ortiz because of the incredible variability of the contracts of the -- some of them, for example, will have registered the copyright in the article within three years of its publication and then be eligible for statutory damages, others won't. They'll be plaintiff-specific defenses, statutes of limitations and laches. You mentioned the statute of limitations, Justice Ginsberg. It seems to me that of course that is not a reason to read the statute incorrectly but I think --",
  "That moves beyond revision.",
  "I assure you, Justice Breyer, I'd love to know at least as much as you would and I hope Mr. Gold will enlighten us, because --",
  "Justice Breyer, the record is completely unambiguous that nothing like that happens. What happens is that the computer text itself, the very same computer text that goes to the printing office so that the New York Times then arrives at your front desk.",
  "Well the Post, that's fine. I'll take the Washington Post, Washington Post, Washington Star, we can pick our paper. The Washington Post, they all follow the same protocol. There is a computer text and that text is ASCII readable. That means it can be put in computer form and one version -- one copy, it's not even a version, the identical thing goes to the printing facility and --",
  "Yes absolute -- the identification code --",
  "If you ask for the Washington Post.",
  "I wanted to first describe what happens when it gets there and then I'll try to say what happens at the other end when someone --",
  "What is sent is computer data, whole Washington Post and it's put before it goes there they add advertisements and some other graphics. And then it goes to the assembly room and then it's delivered and put on newsstands. That edition of the ads and the graphics which are not ASCII --",
  "That edition is not made in the version that goes to Nexis. Nexis processes that unitary computer data. It goes instantaneously, not in driblets, and it doesn't go article by article.",
  "There's not a shred of evidence, not a whisper that suggest that they're first disassembling the paper into articles and then whisking it over. It is true that the computer text registers each article and identifies it just as it identifies pages and there is a file for each article. But a file is really a conceptual thing here. It's not that they have a little file and they have the article stuffed in it. And the result of all this is that the technology shouldn't obscure what's happening. What's happening is that something that is as close to the Washington Post for that day as it could be given this medium appears in the Nexis computer.",
  "No, Justice O'Connor. What happens is --",
  "No, of course not. Although some people want the whole newspaper and you can get it by saying date, paren, 3/28/2001. But let me answer your question --",
  "Nexis doesn't strip out the ads.",
  "The ads are just not added.",
  "First of all, you get the whole thing in the GPO CD-ROM. Secondly, Nexis doesn't subtract the ads, they're just not added by the Washington Post, although I'm not sure that that matters. Third --",
  "That's right. That's why this is a revision. We're not claiming it's the same thing but it is awfully close and if this isn't a revision, it's hard to know what would be. The point I want to make is that with -- once the computer has all of the digital information, it indexes it according to key words and among those words are the date and an author and the data is sort of scattered to the magnetic --",
  "There are several important differences, Justice Souter. One, the search inside Nexis is always of whole periodicals, and that's undisputed, two --",
  "I understand Justice Souter but it is undisputed that the way they do it, it's more efficient, is that they will take the intersection of all of the indices you want and they will search the entire periodical by periodical to find the article. They don't -- it's not after all a thinking machine. It's a dumb operation, but more important, you're not charged for the article the way you would be at a copy service. You're charged for search time and that's the time for searching entire periodicals. Also --",
  "When you get it, you get it as part of the revision and that's --",
  "I understand Justice Souter, but if you'll permit me, let me say why I nonetheless think you're getting it as part of the revised periodical, and the reason is this, it's very important, so please let me stress it. If it were the case that the only way you could comply with 201(c) was that when you asked for an article you get, whether you want it or not, the whole periodical in which the article appears, that would satisfy the concern you're expressing. But if that was the only way you could do it, the statute would be incoherent because it says that you may reproduce and distribute the contribution as part of a revision or you may distribute the revision itself or a later element in the series, and if it were the case that you have to get the whole thing, then we would have erased from the statute the key compromised words --",
  "Well, but wouldn't that be for Congress, Justice Souter? That is, Congress said --",
  "But Justice Souter, to say that it reads that protection out of the statute is hard to square with the fact that these authors in undisputed testimony themselves said that when they tried to syndicate their work or serialize it or sell it in some way there was never any evidence that its appearance in this archival context on Nexis or the CD-ROMs ever made the slightest difference. They can fully exploit their individual work, the argument is that we should be able since Congress said so to reproduce and distribute not just a revision of the composite work, but the article as part of that revision, and that cannot mean --",
  "No. No, Justice Ginsberg, it's when you bind the book and put it on a library shelf you could say it's part of a huge book. The fact is that this is a huge database and the Second Circuit's suggestion that we are treating that whole database as the revision is completely wrong. We've said all along that the revision is simply the digitized version of the periodical. That digitized version is one that contains --",
  "That's the nature of the medium. Nothing exist separately.",
  "But Justice Scalia, Congress was well aware -- they talked about disks, they talked about any medium, they talked about machines having to read the stuff, they knew about the computer, 1978 wasn't that long ago. This law was written to make sense in the computer context.",
  "But the statute allows --",
  "No. The problem in the world we'd have, Justice Scalia, is the world doesn't want only -- and Congress --",
  "I think we're paying for the existing royalty and secondly, Congress said that we could publish as part of that compromise that we could publish the individual article as part of the revision. I'm saying that carries this implication and it doesn't destroy their copyright.",
  "Probably not. Probably not, because I think --",
  "It differs in a lot of ways. We are sending over the entire periodical and people can find --",
  "Would they be charged for the articles or charged for the time it takes to search the whole library.",
  "I think it makes an important difference. These things are also -- if you look at the promotional materials they're promoted as complete periodicals, hundreds of volumes of the most widely-read periodicals. I think I should reserve the balance of --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me first say very clearly it is not the case that these newspapers disaggregate something and break it down to facilitate copyright violation. It is disaggregated from the word go, that is, when they put together the computer text file that's going to go to the printer they do it article by article because as it happens, that's what goes into a newspaper. That exact text, and you'll see it unmistakably in the record, is exactly what is sent.",
  "Well, sometimes indexing codes, but not only for articles. You've got to be able to find this stuff. You can't just wander around inside a computer. And it is the readers guide to periodicals. That's what we've got here. Whether it is in written form or in index form, it's the same thing. So point one, they don't deliberately disaggregate. Point two, if you look at 349 A of the joint appendix, that's one of many places, I just happened to find this one, where they say they're not claiming any contributory or vicarious liability with respect to infringements by end users. Their whole theory was putting this stuff in the way that the 20th and 21st centuries has to do it is an infringement. It's really a quite Luddite theory. Their distinction with microfilm is that microfilm is a piece of something, you can see it. Well, what about the CD-ROM, then? You can't see it except with a machine. It just looks like it might be Joan Baez singing, but it turns out it's got volume upon volume of material. There's nothing fancy that's done here to facilitate violation. What they're doing is making entire bunch of material available and I didn't hear an answer to Justice Breyer's question. If we read the law the way they propose to read it and I still don't know the exact moment they think is an infringement and how analytically it differs from Justice Stevens' library example, we're going to have a serious problem with our kids doing homework and with professors of history finding out what happened in the middle of the 20th century. It seems to me that before this Court takes a step like that it should pause.",
  "Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Because something in this case does appear to turn on whether merely rationality review is appropriate or whether one needs something more important, we would suggest very much more important since we do think this is a free speech case, I wanted to begin with Justice Scalia's question, is there anything that Congress does that is not important. I think it's a question, however couched, that one really has to address in the context of these programs because, as the Solicitor General mentioned, there are a dozen programs in which Congress has essentially provided for the Government to mandate that growers and producers pay for advertisement and then although there is some other informational stuff, that's the core of it, and in this case, as we point out in footnote 7 of our brief, it's 98 percent of it. These other programs are really quite haphazard. They cover blueberries but not raspberries. They don't cover strawberries. They cover avocados, not artichokes. They cover popcorn. At 1996 Congress found specifically that popcorn has all of the characteristics of mushrooms vital to the economy, and indeed it was in 1996 determined by Congress that canola is even more important to the survival of the economy and yet no canola program was put in place, and maybe that explains why problems are occurring.",
  "Not at all, but in Wileman you had an economic regulation essentially, and as the Chief Justice pointed out in his concurring opinion in the Greater New Orleans case, the various haphazard features of the commercial regulation there, of commercial speech might have been constitutionally tolerable if Congress had undertaken substantively to regulate the gambling industry. That's a very fundamental difference. Of course, one finds a crazy quilt pattern and one doesn't inspect Congress' findings when merely rationality is involved, but if we are to accept the Government's theory, and I want to turn to Government speech in a moment, if we're to accept the Government's theory that whenever there is an interest, not a program, not a regulatory regime, nothing like collective bargaining or a labor union with an integrated set of obligations or an integrated bar, as in the Keller case, but just an interest, like the interest in not having kids waste too much money on designer clothes. Whenever you can posit an interest in the air and then you can find speech that would advance that interest, that's all you need. Now, that would be an astonishing principle.",
  "Sure.",
  "Right.",
  "I'm not. I'm not. I do believe that the Court would have to break new ground, perhaps along the line Justice Kennedy has suggested if there were Government speech. In your questions, Justice Breyer, you said we, we.",
  "Well, who is the we in your question?",
  "Well, it seems to me that I really should turn to whether this is speech for which the Government bears responsibility because it seems to me that in all of your cases, whether the ultimate vehicle for the speech is the tobacco council or the Government, it's the Government's message. It's quite different to say that we're going to take money from private enterprise, private individuals, we're going to give it to other private individuals so that they can compose a message, like a message that brands don't make any difference, if you've seen one mushroom, you've seen them all, a message which is very much opposed to the interest of those who are forced to pay. Now, if this were Government speech, where Government is accountable to the people, a principle like Justice Kennedy, saying that as long as the beneficiaries are the ones who are taxed might suffice, but let me turn to whether it's Government speech because I think when we get back to the question of whether it can survive on any other theory, it will be fairly clear that it cannot. Now, I'm not going to spend time on whether this issue is properly before the court, except to say that it's not just a technicality, it's not simply that the matter was not raised or addressed below, and --",
  "Oh, I understand their reasons for doing it. I just wanted to say what reasons the Court might have for not letting them do it. And that is that if you look at the face of this law, as I'll explain in a moment, it's not Government speech. To show that it was, they would have to adduce some facts, as in Brentwood.",
  "I'm not saying the Court lacks jurisdiction, but I'm saying in order to establish that the Government is really responsible for these messages, despite the fact that under the regulations and the statute, the secretary cannot, in fact, reject a message for any reason other than that the program established by the Mushroom Council, it violates the statute, or that the message derogates another individual's product. The message is composed by these private individuals in the Mushroom Council. The members of the Mushroom Council are selected by nomination from the private industry. The Government is simply saying, promote mushrooms. Now, if that is Government speech, it seems to me that in a case like, oh, for example, it seems to me that in the Amtrak case where they rely heavily on Lebron, in Amtrak where this Court did hold that for purposes of making first amendment arguments against Amtrak, it is an instrumentality of the Government, but the artist who wanted to put something on that huge billboard in Amtrak's Penn Station was not going to be propagating a Government message simply because the Government was providing the facility. The question of whether you can make a First Amendment argument against an entity whether it's sufficiently the Government for that purpose, has nothing to do with the question of whether it is Government speech when that entity, as in the case of the Mushroom Council, uses its private capacity to propagate messages in its private interests.",
  "He could under the statute, only if the message is not consistent with the statute. If he does not have general sensorial powers, he's not an editor under this statute. So that --",
  "He has the ultimate power to approve the whole program. The program is approved by him. But he does not have authority to disapprove a campaign of advertising under the program on the ground that he doesn't like what it says. He has never exercised such authority, the regulations don't --",
  "Well, in the guidelines of the Department of Agriculture itself for oversight of commodity research, on page 49 of our brief, the description is that the agricultural marketing service only reviews materials to ensure that they are in compliance with the applicable legislative authority. I don't know if one could construe this statute to make the Secretary of Agriculture assume a purely editorial capacity, I rather doubt it, but clearly no such construction has been suggested by the agency that administers the statute. I think the idea that the Mushroom Council is somehow the voice of America is not plausible. It's not plausible because this is not a message that the Government has in any way organized or composed, and if one did take that view --",
  "The fact that it is permitted by Government does not mean that it is Government's voice. A great deal is permitted by the Government. If it is required, if the exact words are required, the words on a cigarette package, the surgeon general has determined that this is detrimental to your health. That's Government speech. But if we say this is Government speech, then much of what this Court was struggling with, in cases like Keller and Lehnert, the speech of a State bar association, an integrated bar, which the Chief Justice in his opinion for a unanimous Court pointed out the integrated bar for some purposes might be the Government, but the expressive activities in which it engages, even if they are germane to the purposes of collective bargaining, that is, even if they are related to the process of exclusive representation and therefore squarely within the ambit of what the Government has authorized the entity to do in the case of a labor union, and even if they are part of the process of regulating the legal profession or improving legal service, it doesn't make it Government speech. In fact, the magic wand of Government speech would obliterate a great deal of the doctrine this Court has carefully built. I do think it's worth looking at the reasons.",
  "Well, if you had a comparable.",
  "Well, taxing the consumer of a product --",
  "I don't care if it's a tax.",
  "Okay.",
  "To make it the same -- I'm sorry.",
  "I didn't mean to interrupt. To make it the same, Justice Breyer, you would have to have a group of museums, some of them believing that all museums are the same, and you don't have to have anything fancy in the museum, it doesn't really matter if you have any Jackson Pollack, you just put stuff up, and other museums that specialize, and they have brands. And now the Government comes along and says, all of you are free to say what you want about whether you will have Picasso there or Jackson Pollack.",
  "I see the problem, but the quicksand that you're describing, I think, one can avoid to some extent by saying that the Government does not have the power without complying with a very stringent First Amendment requirement to make people speak, either speak directly or contribute to someone else who then propagates a message in effect in their name. It's true that when I buy a product, the price may include the advertising costs. I buy Pictsweet mushrooms and it -- but if we say the Government can make the people who sell clothes say that it's not very good to buy designer clothes, then we are lost.",
  "I think general, what I would like to see, but the Court has really not struggled with problems in this precise area, I would like to see a principle that says that Government speech, when the Government takes responsibility for it, and assumes the shield from First Amendment scrutiny must be funded from general revenue.",
  "That's right.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think the principle that sometimes what you don't say is as important as what you do explains why in cases like Zouderer and DeBonyez the Court has stopped short of saying that the Government may never fill in the gaps in someone's commercial. That is, if one is selling cigarettes and not mentioning that, by the way, they may kill you, perhaps the Government has the power, it's been assumed that it does, to say you better add that to your message, but this is not a case where there is a gap in speech that's being filled by the Government to protect consumers. Here the Government says we want essentially to manipulate consumer preference. It's exactly like Liquormart except a mirror image. In Liquormart this Court essentially said, if you, I think, combine the opinions I think this Court said, that if your purpose is to affect consumption, in that case of liquor, by affecting price, and to affect price by, in that case, wording competition because competition might drive price down and drive consumption up. Then you at least have to satisfy Central Hudson, you would at least --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, in Riley and in Hurley, this Court said it's not very different. Forcing you to say X is not different from preventing you from saying Y, and that's why the example I just --",
  "A corporation never can say anything, all it can ever do is pay money.",
  "I understand, Justice Stevens, and I think technically -- well, that's why I gave the example of go and hire an ad agency. If the only thing that Riley and Hurley prevent is having the Government actually say to you, you must use your own employees to get out the following message, then it would follow that they could require us, just as they can require us to put money in the kitty of the Mushroom Council so that they can speak for us, they could require to us go out and hire an ad agency and put out a certain kind of message and spend a hundred thousand a year because they wouldn't be buttoning our lip. And by the way, the message better be, all mushrooms are great. It seems to me if we've had to hire an ad agency, no one here would doubt that that violated the First Amendment, to require us to do it, and yet that would be better for us than having to rely on the Mushroom Council.",
  "I believe it can. The Government can --",
  "It can be selective. The Government can -- viewpoint based in its speech.",
  "I think the moment you start targeting people to pay for speech, a certain subgroup, there is a First Amendment problem.",
  "To protect consumers.",
  "Justice Breyer, I think there is a common theme that's very important, and that is, regulation designed to eliminate impediments to fair bargaining may sometimes involve an informational component. Certain kinds of deception interfere with the ability of people to operate in the marketplace of ideas and goods and services. It's on that theory that the commercial speech doctrine can make some sense, and as suggested in a number of this Court's opinions that I think may converge to that view, whenever you try to manipulate preferences rather than enabling people to express them, you are essentially playing a big brother role with information. That's why there's a fundamental difference in principle between saying, in this case you better add a certain warning or you will be fundamentally fooling the person on the other side of the bargaining table --",
  "-- and saying you better say the following kind of thing because it's important to us that you say it.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I wouldn't minimize the importance of the slippery slope, but I'm not sure that the advertisement of the fact, the mere fact that you've been inspected by the Government is anything more than requiring you to be a vehicle for Government speech, and cases like Wooley v. Maynard supposedly limit that. They limit it on the ground that if the message is ideological, you shouldn't be forced to do it. But there's the slippery slope. Where does ideology end? Ethical treatment of mushrooms. It seems to me that it's far safer in terms of protecting people from either having the Government button their lip or having the Government force them to speak, to limit the Government's power with respect to mandating speech or mandating the funding of speech to cases where the Government can show not just any old general important interest because that's unlimited, but show that the transactions involved are going to be significantly distorted by either misinformation or by overbearing unless a certain message is included. The moment you go beyond that, it seems to me, the moment you take advantage of that branch of the Central Hudson test which allows the Government effectively to control speech in order to manipulate preferences because it's in the public interest, you've abandoned the premise of Virginia Board of Pharmacy and of the whole line of cases that follow it.",
  "I think so, but I do want to remind the Court that the issue here is principally whether this program can escape scrutiny under the First Amendment, not whether it is bad under the First Amendment.",
  "Right, I have no problem with the thing on the package --",
  "-- but making the industry fund a campaign.",
  "No problem at all.",
  "Look out for the blue mushroom, that's right. No problem whatever. Whether this program should be subject to First Amendment scrutiny other than on the Government speech theory, which as I tried to explain, I think, does not work, depends, I think, on whether it is ancillary to something, that is, it's not a question of exactly what all the bells and whistles look like in the regulatory program for nectarines and peaches. It was clear, as this Court repeatedly emphasized, including in the section of the opinion explaining why the Central Hudson framework didn't fit, it was clear that the fundamental structure of the program was to replace individual choice and competition with collectivization, and when you do that, the premises of Central Hudson don't work, and when you collectivize, among other things, people don't necessarily have much incentive to say things that will have positive spillover effects for other people's products. There's a kind of advertisement gap which perhaps the Government could fill the way it did in Wileman. It's a close question.",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "Well, I must say I read the in any event phrase, which is pivotal here.",
  "From the -- right.",
  "I know. I read it less literally.",
  "Right. But it seems to me that all one really has to ask is whether it would be conceivable to have a rule that says as long as it's not ideological, it doesn't matter whether it's germane to anything, you can make people speak about it, so we could make the mushroom people distribute copies of weather reports to everyone in the country. You might come up with a rationalization for that. If on the other hand --",
  "Well, but for one thing you can have a serious antitrust conspiracy simply because of minimum quality agreements.",
  "But it really went beyond that. Also, there were size restrictions on the fruit.",
  "The nectarine.",
  "Exactly, exactly.",
  "But clearly they were immune, for example, from the antitrust laws. This was now collectivized, and so all the talk about the free market of information which underlies and undergirds Virginia Board didn't apply.",
  "But that's always present. That is, if you want to -- germane in Liquormart to having people consume less liquor, I mean, that will never do. It seems to me the moment you kick the prop out from under this it's simply a free floating mandate to fund speech, and it seems to me as such it can't possibly be sustained. And I do think that even the word germane is awfully slippery, as is the word ideology. It seems to me that when you look at, for example, what Keller said about the Ellis case, it's really required in the whole Abood line of cases that something be reasonably necessary as an expense incurred to make the nonspeech program of collective bargaining or of professional regulation work. This is not reasonably necessary to make anything work except itself, and indeed one of their amici representing beef and milk and eggs I think said it quite bluntly I think on page 6 of the amicus brief. They said this speech is germane to itself.",
  "It seems to me that tautology is everybody's friend except the friend of the First Amendment, and I think with that I would close.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Clearly, we're dealing in 525 with something that is an exercise of regulatory power, and as several members of the Court have noted, it's always possible to say, even though we are revoking or canceling this license automatically because you didn't make the payment, we have other motives in mind, responsible, financially responsible drivers on the road. We are not simply out to get you because of the dollars. That's, of course, not what this statute is about. The whole point of the Perez decision was to get rid of Kesler and Reitz, which required peering into the mind of the bureaucrats, not always a wonderful vision to behold, and not clear. This is a causation provision, and let me turn to Justice Ginsburg's question from the perspective of creditors who need to be able to rely on a bright line test of whether something was done solely because of nonpayment of a dischargeable debt, or solely because of insolvency, or solely because of an invocation of Chapter 11. The word solely, I think, does serve a function there, and that is, in its absence I suppose it would be possible for a licensee in regulatory default, a licensee who hadn't built out, to hide behind the existence of a fiscal default and say, you see, it's because of the fact that I didn't make a payment, not because I didn't build out. Then one has a complicated mess, and from the point of view of creditors who need to know whether an agency is going to pull out the lifeline without which this entire edifice collapses and is just a bunch of hardware, not worth anything more than the separate parts, from the point of view of creditors who need to know, it seems to me a very clear test is needed, and that is, was this the sole trigger? Have they come up with some other substantive, independent basis which either was the necessary cause or a sufficient cause? That's what the D.C. Circuit said, and it makes sense.",
  "Well, I -- in a way, I think that that makes our point all the stronger, that is, even when the agency has no conflict of interest, it might not be in it for the money, and one wonders here why, for example, why they don't yank the license when the debt is owed to private creditors? Doesn't that show in just the same way that they're not reliable? That is, in this very case --",
  "Well, money --",
  "Well --",
  "-- the license on my interpretation --",
  "-- does not cancel and at confirmation the license is one of the assets of the estate, and at that point --",
  "No, they don't take it back. That is, when -- there are a number of things in the estate at confirmation.",
  "I'm sorry, Justice Breyer. The bankruptcy court is filled with elaborate rules about when you can and cannot foreclose. That is, an asset is part of the estate at confirmation, and whether you're going to be able to get your money back is a function of whether you are under or oversecured. There are provisions in 1111(b) for dealing with both situations. Your situation is no worse when you are a regulator than the Bank of America, or one of the clients in our case, Citicorp, and no better.",
  "What I'm saying, Justice Breyer, is that after bankruptcy, if NextWave, for example, were to emerge from bankruptcy they would still have the license, but only on conditions in which you as the FCC, like other creditors, in light of your secured interest, had taken an appropriate piece of the pie. You don't get it all, that's the point. Nor does a private creditor get to grab the license and all the value from all the other creditors and, in fact, when you are an agency that is wearing really two sets of shoes, the ordinary regulator's running shoes but also the wing tips of the creditor agency, it makes the situation worse, not better. That is, this law is designed to assure that even the agency, which does not have a monetary interest, can't simply yank all the value for itself because it has the power over this license. If the agency, on top of all that, is a creditor and has that additional set of incentives, then it's all the worse. You wonder, for example, why it is that in the MMDS licenses, in which there are licenses that are held by a number of bankrupt licensees who did not make the payments they promised to make, why it is that the FCC does not regard them as not having been what they looked like at the time of the bid. The reason is that it's been paid in full. So it really is a situation in which the FCC's position as a creditor should not redound to its credit. If anything, that makes this statute all the more vital. The capital formation that is necessary to make 309(j) work, to make it possible, Justice Scalia, sometimes not to demand all the money up front, but to have something more creative, maybe demand letters of credit, guarantees, none of that can work if creditors who put in over half a billion dollars, not in a gamble but on a very careful business plan that was completely carried out, they're not providing service, but Catch-22, it's because their attempt to emerge and fully cure any default was frustrated by the agency that saw pie in the sky, large numbers. In that situation, for the agency to be able to collapse the capital formation here tells us something rather unpleasant about the future. How likely is it that Citicorp and the California and Kansas pension funds and all of the other organizations that have put money in on reliance on the way section 525 works will do this again next time around? The formation of capital, the market on which the FCC chose to rely, choosing to rely in the capacity of a first lender, with no more or less secured protection than others, that whole system depends on, in the most literal sense, the rule of law. It does not depend on the question whether we can attribute to the regulator some motive that does not relate solely to the money. So if the system is to work the way the FCC claims, 525 is a dead letter. Now, if you were right, Justice Breyer, if there really was a problem that couldn't be solved in the way the confirmation rules work, in the way the pie is divided up, then maybe, as with perishable commodities, there would be a problem for Congress to solve. Congress has in section 523 enumerated 18 categories of debts that are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, and sometimes it does it in another statute, not always in the Bankruptcy Code. These are policy judgments about whether something is unique about the situation that requires treating the Government in some different way, the way the Department of Agriculture is treated.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I think I might begin by saying that I barely recognize the case that, though I didn't try, I read the transcript in, from hearing Ms. Birnbaum's description. She says that the conduct involved in this case was simply the failure to settle. It wasn't, she says, even an intentional tort. Well, the Court's --",
  "The sole ground of original liability was objectively unreasonable failure to settle, but phase 2, which was held at the insistence of plaintiffs, who wanted -- of the defendants who wanted to bifurcate, phase 2 focused on the question of whether there was an intentional tort, and there was found to be fraud; and the court, the trial court affirmed the judgment partly on the ground of intentional fraud; and the fraud, and it's not a surprise really to the lawyers for the defendants, because they made it clear in their opening statement that they understood the whole theory of this case to be that the insurance policies that were being sold by State Farm, which led people to think that in first and in third party cases the claims adjuster would try to do a reasonably objective job of satisfying the claim if possible, in fact weren't bad at all. There was a clandestine cap that was imposed by this innocuous-looking bureaucratic PP&R program that was thoroughly documented and that was imposed from headquarters, documented elaborately by hundreds of examples; and it's true, some of them came from other States, and I will get to that; but they were all just illustrative, because it came from headquarters in Bloomington, and it was a directive --",
  "And, in fact, it was necessary here. That is, they made up things. They doctored the file.",
  "They made up the fact that -- they defamed this dead person and said that he was speeding to meet a pregnant girlfriend, who didn't exist. There were findings that they systematically shredded, and destroyed, and fabricated documents for two decades in order to cover up the fact that they were not selling what they were pretending to sell. And it was found in this case clearly, and then again de novo by the Utah Supreme Court, that this policy, which was clandestine and then covered up, was a policy that had persisted for two decades, which they even now seem unwilling to acknowledge.",
  "Sure.",
  "Oh, I don't think so, Justice Stevens. I do plan to get to that.",
  "No, Justice Stevens, what they said was this. They referred among other things to the Utah Unfair Claims Practices Act, which said $10,000 fine per violation; and there were in their view thousands of individual instances of wrongfully denied benefits.",
  "In Utah, yes, because they didn't draw this fancy distinction between first and third party claims that is being drawn for the convenience of State Farm. The wrong is not --",
  "That was the example --",
  "-- Justice Kennedy. That was the tip of the iceberg. Justice Kennedy, this is very important. In this particular case, it was the failure to settle a case, and it was a fraudulent failure to settle a case, not just a random accident, but it was pursuant to exactly the same policy, capping the average amount that a given claims agents puts out in terms of State Farm money, that is used in these other instances. It was exactly the same policy. In this case, it was because this fellow named Bill Brown wanted to move to Colorado, and because he did, and because he was close to his quota, and this is all in the record, and it is found -- and it's not disputed any longer. Because he wanted to move to Colorado, he puts pressure on somebody underneath him to make sure that that year's numbers look better.",
  "It's not just making as much money --",
  "-- it's stealing.",
  "But Justice Breyer --",
  "Right --",
  "-- and if the policy is sell him a ticket and then turn him away at the door --",
  "-- pretending to sell him a place --",
  "Justice Breyer --",
  "Justice Breyer, please -- I believe in the Magna Carta as much as you do. It was not arbitrary. There were criteria. The criteria were pursuant to an instruction proposed by State Farm, and in this case it was not every bad thing. All of the specifics, including these seemingly trivial things like appearance allowances, were all introduced in particular cases to show how they were being used by someone who was up against his monthly quota, and because he was up against the monthly quota -- you read the testimony of Gary Fye at page 1375 and 1387 of the joint appendix. Because they were up against the monthly quota, the people at the receiving end who thought they had a claims agent who was, as they call him, a good neighbor, in fact had someone who was selling them a place in the airline, and it wasn't there, deliberately.",
  "Because of the --",
  "Well, first of all, as to the harm suffered, proposed instruction 40 by State Farm would have told the jury, I think consistent with this Court's jurisprudence and with the history of punitive damages, that they could consider the effect of State Farm's behavior, quote, \"on the lives of plaintiffs and of other policyholders,\" and it's because, Justice Breyer, of what you said in BMW that a lot of other people who are harmed by these practices are not likely to be able to sue. That is, they're not going to make it. Mr. Fye testified at 30 and 44, for everyone like Campbell, who will take on a company this size and with the resources of State Farm, there are hundreds, if not thousands, who will simply go away, because State Farm --",
  "Well, that's the hope. That --",
  "One of the advantages -- there may be down sides, but if we prevail, Justice Ginsburg, we're prevailing on a theory that the practice we've identified, which is quite specific, for 20 years of putting these invisible caps that cheat the insured in all kinds of cases throughout the State of Utah, there will no longer be anyone who can recover for those harms, beyond compensatory damages, because the penalty will have been extracted.",
  "I think if they've done this in every State, then they should be exposed to the possibility of punitive damages in other States.",
  "Well, you know, it seems to me, if you look at the opinion that was delivered from the bench by the district court after 2 months, in his own words -- they accuse us of writing his opinion. In his own words, what he said was that absent a punitive award, the problem of recurrence of their misconduct is extremely high, the probability of recurrence; because he saw the evidence that they never stopped; and he said that even the $25-million award that he felt constrained by State law, mistakenly, to give, he thought would not suffice because -- and I'm now reading from his December 19 opinion -- because the $25 million may not be enough to offset the profit that they're likely to have earned. That is, every time they cheat the insured by --",
  "Yes.",
  "I think the overwhelming majority related to Utah, and every time it came in dealing with another State, contrary to what we heard, it was because the door had been opened, and it was specifically found by the trial court that they waived any objection to the testimony in question, despite what we heard about --",
  "Yes, but let me tell you, Justice Stevens, it was so uniform that the particular examples were picked because they so nicely illustrated the way a particular device like the use of non-OPM parts would interact with the cap that was imposed. It was nothing about --",
  "We have no way of knowing, Justice Stevens, because they have erected -- the record also shows that since the 1970s, part of their policy of destroying records has included --",
  "-- getting rid of all those records.",
  "Well, it's because -- part of what was said by the trial court was that it took the persistence of a David to bring this particular Goliath to his knees. Much of the evidence certainly wasn't produced through discovery. The key evidence, including the May 1979 PP&R report, was obtained indirectly through other cases, not with any cooperation on the part of State Farm. State Farm kept saying, we don't have a PP&R policy. Oh, and then we got rid of it in 1992; and we got rid of it again in 1994; and yes, there's a PP&R policy, but it doesn't actually set the cap on any particular claim. Well, that's a nicely and artfully put point. It doesn't. What it does is, it imposes a ceiling which averages things out and forces whoever is unlucky enough to come in when somebody is about to hit his ceiling to get cheated. It seems to me that we -- it's true that it all began by looking at this, as it happened, failure to settle. That's a happenstance. It could have begun in some other way. Because it happened to a couple that was rather vulnerable, and yet tenacious: this fellow had had one wife who had been murdered in his home, another wife who had died of cancer. He himself had Parkinson's disease. They were part of the weakest of the herd, as State Farm's policies put it, that they're picked on, because they're less likely to fight back. But it happened that these people did fight back, and it seems to me it's not a matter of rewarding them. They get a relatively small piece of this. The family of the dead young man gets part of it. The State may get part of it. The key point is that it is a critical disincentive, and Justice Kennedy, any notion --",
  "Some lawyers will certainly get part of it. I don't --",
  "What made me think you might have been? No, but it seems --",
  "That could be, but --",
  "Right.",
  "Justice Breyer, first, it's not fair to say that was the only standard.",
  "Second -- second --",
  "I thought this Court did a rather good job in BMW. Reprehensibility could hardly be higher when one has a repeat offender who even now mischaracterizes its intentional tort, when one has a repeat offender that obstructs justice --",
  "Well --",
  "No, but Justice Kennedy, in TXO this Court talked about the ratio not just of the harm that actually befell the particular plaintiff, but of the punitive damages to the harm that might have befallen that plaintiff if the tortious plan had been carried to completion. Here, if it had been carried to completion the home would have been taken, because a deal would not have been struck in December of '84 -- of '84, and also in TXO, and in other cases, you've spoken of the harm to the larger community. You've also spoken of the importance of extracting the profit from tortious behavior.",
  "Justice Kennedy, I certainly agree in principle; but to pick a case in which a corporation has defied the legal system, has shredded documents, has covered up its deliberate wrongdoing, has not even bothered to pay attention to a $100 million award -- yes, of course it wasn't reduced to a judgment, but the evidence in this case is that that's not relevant. What was critical is that they had built a wall of deniability so that no one in a decisionmaking capacity is informed of punitive judgments. Mr. Muskowski testified in this case that he would not let anyone know, in a position of authority, even of the punitive judgment in this case; and in their reply brief they say, well, Mr. Mendoza had decisionmaking authority, but if you look at the relevant pages in the joint appendix, you'll see that that's not true. In the colloquy it's clear that he did not. What that means is that a company can surround itself with an impregnable wall and in effect spit at the legal system. How good is that for its image? Now, it may be that an ideal legal system might not use juries for this purpose, but is it the mission of this Court to redesign the legal systems of the 50 States? 15 States have signed an amicus brief here saying it's important to them to be able to use punitive damages when the regulatory and criminal justice systems haven't quite caught up with whatever latest axis of evil is afoot in the corporate world. Is it really helpful to any of us to have a corporation be able to defraud all of the people who rely on it, who depend on it, and get away with paying simply what harm they happened to cause in the one case when they get caught? It seems to me especially bizarre, especially bizarre for State Farm to speak here proudly of the fact that this is the worst case in history.",
  "Yes.",
  "There was a cross-appeal by State Farm.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's right. State Farm appealed because it thought there should be no punitives. It seems even now they think it did nothing wrong.",
  "And there was a cross-appeal by the Campbells on the grounds that they thought it was a mistake of State law to have reduced the punitives.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, well --",
  "Yes, that's correct.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think in a sense that looks ironic. It looks as though Cooper v. Leatherman came back in a boomerang, but I think really the way I read the opinion of the Utah Supreme Court, they applied Cooper in an even more vigorous way in general. That is, they didn't just engage in de novo review of the question of excessiveness. They engaged in de novo review of all the facts, so you have not just a jury, but a jury and a trial court and a full appellate court. The only fact on which they said they weren't going to defer was a technical issue about the wealth of State Farm, and the real reason they actually gave for increasing the 25 to 145 was their conviction that the trial court believed that 25 would not stop State Farm from persisting in its practices, and that it was only their own earlier suggestion that the ratio should matter a great deal that had misled the trial court.",
  "Well, in this case, sending them to jail was an option that the Supreme Court of Utah mentioned, and that State Farm doesn't seem to take very seriously. They think the State Supreme Court of Utah doesn't understand its own law. There are provisions of Utah law that make deliberate fraud of the sort they committed an imprisonable offense, and maybe that's an option, but that suggests --",
  "Well, I haven't -- I have no contact with the Attorney General of Utah, but they --",
  "Well, of course you -- yes. Yes, but the comparability standard asks, how serious an offense is this, and I submit it's extremely serious. But to your question, Justice Scalia, on ratio, I think that instead of trying to come up with a number -- because I think suggesting any number would be so arbitrary that it would do more damage to this Court than good to the legal system. It's not like 6 months for the idea of a serious crime. I mean, it would just be a number plucked from the air, and it would backfire, because as the law and economics people are fond of pointing out, any number you pick will then lead people to sort of modify their behavior accordingly, and just internalize the costs on a kind of bad man theory, and what you really are trying to do is stop the behavior. We're not talking about negligence here. We're talking about something of which the optimal level is zero. The optimal level of deliberate fraud and deception covered up in this way is zero. The relevance of the ratio, I think, is simply as one thing to look at. If the ratio looks very high, you ask why is it so high? In this case, the answer comes back, it's so high because the ratio of the number of people they hurt to the number who are going to be motivated to sue and able to sue is very low. I mean, is very -- you know, a number -- a huge number will be hurt. A very small number are going to be able to make it through that filter.",
  "Well, I suppose. I suppose, but there are ways of getting rid of frivolous lawsuits. The point also is, it's hard -- if you see an increase, Justice O'Connor, and if it is an increase that gets anywhere, it might be because they stopped destroying the evidence, because they stopped fabricating -- they've so doctored the files, like the file in this case, to make it look in any given case as though the report that they give corresponds to the history of the case, and it's awfully hard to sue successfully when the file has been massaged and doctored. The result in a case like this is of course it looks like a very large award, but --",
  "No. If it was for any activity that occurred during the period from May 1979 to the time of this trial --",
  "No. I think that it's a penalty that is like -- there ought to be some double jeopardy like doctrine that if they can show that they've already been punished for this course of conduct, they ought not to have to pay the penalty a second time. Now, the Double Jeopardy Clause --",
  "I would -- I just made it up.",
  "I just made it up. I said there ought to be such a doctrine.",
  "Yes, a second --",
  "Well, if they commit 50 big offenses, it's part of our jurisprudence of 50 States that they might be subject to 50 penalties. That --",
  "That's right. That's --",
  "Well, that's right.",
  "Ultimately, you are.",
  "Justice Scalia, there's no pretense that this is compensatory damages. The compensatory damage compensates them for the harm done to them.",
  "Then the reprehensibility of what was done to them is affected by, as this Court has said, whether it was an isolated event, as they claimed, or whether it was done as part of a schematic, systematic form of predation. Now, it was of that sort. That was shown. The fact that it was predation that was launched from Bloomington and therefore spread throughout the country is State Farm's problem. It shouldn't be the problem of the plaintiff who collects punitive damages in a given case.",
  "There was no request here, as there was, for example, in the recent Ninth Circuit case against Ford, no request whatsoever by State Farm for such an instruction. What they did request, and were not entitled to, was that under BMW they preserved an objection that the out-of-State evidence be completely disregarded, even though it came in in response to the doors that they had opened, but they did not --",
  "Not at all.",
  "No, and they were fully aware -- I mean, the day after BMW came down, there was a bench conference. There was an extended colloquy. It was fully --",
  "No. The -- May 21, 1996 was before the full-blown 2-month period of the phase 2 trial.",
  "And it was known very clearly the day after BMW that a good bit of the evidence in this case, because many of the examples of how this policy worked, would come from other places, would not be Utah- based. The $100-million verdict which would illustrate the wall they built would come from Texas. They never once asked for an instruction limiting matters to Utah, and I don't fault them for it. It would have been rather bizarre to do so, because they knew full well that we were not asking the Utah jury or the Utah courts to punish them for what they did elsewhere. We were simply using what was done elsewhere first to rebut their commissioners -- they brought in commissioners from various States to testify that State Farm never did anything wrong. The trial court said, now you know, if you do that, you're going to open the door -- Justice Stevens, I wanted to just -- if you do that, you're going to open the door to proof of what happened elsewhere. They didn't mind, and they insisted that the sequence of proof be rebuttal first, actually, through depositions, and then the principal arguments, which made it look as though it was part of the direct case. I think that --",
  "-- this judgment should be affirmed. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the mid-1990s there was, of course, an intense debate on the pros and cons of globalization, and of the impact of companies like Nike on workers in the Third World, where Nike contracted out much of its production to some 900 factories in 51 countries with over 600,000 employees. Now, the critics, many from pro-labor groups, denounced Nike as the chief exemplar of the evils of globalization, arguing that Nike was simply shifting production to places where it could exploit the workforce and act in ways that were illegal and immoral, and the critics took much of their documentation from the media. Of course, Nike disagreed, using the same media venues as the critics had used to document what it thought were the connections between its presence and activities in countries like South Korea and Vietnam and the development of technological expertise in those countries, as well as the expansion of job opportunities there, and also arguing that it had put in place significant safeguards against abuse. Products were mentioned only in response to people who said, well, look, this product is made in such-and-such country and it's exploitative, and Nike would have a press release, or it -- sometimes it would be an op ed saying no, you've got the wrong country, this product is made in such-and-such other place. These were letters to the editor, pamphlets. It was on the Internet, correspondence. As you might expect, the critics talked back. There was a lively political dialogue about the realities of the Third World and Nike's role in it, a little hard to separate the two, when, as the dissenter below, one of the dissenters below said Nike had become the poster child for the evils, supposedly, of globalization, so not surprisingly the debate was inconclusive. The surprise came when the story took an unusual turn, unusual at least in our system of Government. One of the Nike critics, Marc Kasky, asked the California courts to endorse his view and to hold that the statements that Nike was putting out were false or were misleading. He invoked California's unfair competition law and the false advertising law that it included, which gives anyone standing, so Mr. Kasky certainly qualified, to sue another person or corporation, here Nike and its officers, for making any statement in a newspaper or other publication such, it goes on to say, or any advertising device, including over the Internet, concerning any circumstance or matter of fact connected with anything the speaker intends to sell if the statement is untrue or misleading, and the California Supreme Court has read that to cover anything that might mislead the public. The plaintiff, empowered to sue by the Business and Professions Code 17204 on behalf of, quote, the general public, unquote, did not, under California decisional law, have to allege or prove falsity -- it could be an omission that made something misleading -- he didn't have to allege or prove reliance by or injury to anyone, or any particular level of fault. An inadvertent omission will suffice under the Day decision.",
  "Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, and, in fact, one of the suggestions made by the California Supreme Court for how a company could engage in this debate without any problem is simply omit all the facts that might connect it to the situation, and that kind of omission, it would be certainly alleged, would be misleading, so the only solution that Nike is given is, talk in vague generalities. I don't deny, Mr. Chief Justice, that there can be cases and there can even be fraud cases, though it's hard, given the pleading requirements of the fraud tort, that do rest on omissions, but I'm just suggesting how -- how capacious -- how capacious this is. The relief that is available and was requested by Mr. Kasky includes, and I don't think we should forget the importance of this, an adjudication that the defendant is guilty of an unlawful business practice, and in Nike's case that would be no small matter. I mean, it would be said you're guilty of exploiting women and children in the Third World, guilty as charged, and not being honest about it, a scarlet letter more damning than the label of National Labor Relations Act violator that this Court a year ago in B&K versus NLRB treated as so grave a blot on the reputation of a company that it mustn't be imposed for activity within the First Amendment zone without giving the defendant significant leeway. Secondly, there is available a court-ordered injunction both prohibitory and mandatory in one case involving the Alta-Dena Dairy in California under this statute. The Consumers Union of the United States brought the suit as a Private Attorney General against a dairy that had been putting out its products of raw milk saying they were just as nutritious and healthy as pasteurized milk, and the remedy was a 10-year mandate of corrective speech, as it were, corrective education.",
  "Well, I guess to make some people -- this -- that's what the statute says, that some people might have been misled. Needless to say, the kind of show trial that would be involved in this case is a lot more expensive than that one. That case, by the way, took 54 days to try, 44 witnesses, there were 40,000 pages of exhibits, at the end a restitutionary order of $100,000 was given, and in that case the Attorney General joined the suit, he collected the restitution --",
  "Well, I suppose Bantam Books --",
  "I think Bantam Books comes to mind.",
  "And there it was less than this, it was simply you were on a list of books. It seems to me that the Court in the National Labor Relations Act context itself took the position in B&K that chilling effect was important, and what about defamation? I mean, the central meaning of New York Times v. Sullivan and Gertz and, you know, and Time v. Hill is that even when you have someone who is harmed, reputational harm, concrete harm, so that the regulation of speech is simply ancillary to vindicating tangible interest, even there the chilling effect is so great that even though there's no positive value in false statements you have to put a burden -- it's a matter of public interest.",
  "Well, essentially that's right, that --",
  "-- this trial itself is illegitimate.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, Justice O'Connor.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, let me say two things, Justice O'Connor. First of all the Court has never said that the Constitution and its First Amendment are wholly invisible to commercial speech, that is, if you're going after commercial harms, then there's a lower standard for commercial speech, the four-part Central Hudson test. Discovery Network made clear that if you're coming at it from a different angle, commercial speech is just as good as anything else. R.A.V., I think, dispelled the notion that the Constitution has these blind spots and, indeed, the whole approach of the Court below and of Mr. Kasky was, we don't even have to deal with your First Amendment arguments --",
  "-- because it's misleading commercial speech.",
  "Actually, we --",
  "That's right, Justice O'Connor, we don't think any of them do, but even if they did, this scheme --",
  "Well, actually, they don't come close in general, and I think the best way to illustrate that is to look not at the various verbal formulas that have been used by this Court in terms of whether it's advertising format, whether it's -- in one case I think Justice Stevens talked about something being transaction-driven, but look at the example that this court gave in Central Hudson when it was addressing the question, when we allow greater regulation of speech that is closely connected with the Government's power to regulate commercial transactions we're not in any way limiting your ability directly to comment. The example that was given was the pamphlet from the Con Ed case. That was an example of direct comment, and you look at the pamphlet which was in the joint appendix in -- in that case, and it turns out the pamphlet is a detailed set of statements about why nuclear power is safer, better, cheaper, better for our independence, and you know what, Con Ed had a nuclear power plant, Indian Point, they clearly had an economic interest in promoting that view, and that's the closest any of these statements by Nike come --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes.",
  "Is that the letter to the university presidents and to the athletic departments of these universities, which is Exhibit R at page 190 of the lodging, is an extended argument about why the claims against Nike are unfounded. It is not in any of its -- it doesn't have Air Jordans on it --",
  "-- the way Trojan condoms were -- condoms were at the end of that --",
  "-- submission, and in the Bolger case again, I think if I were writing such an opinion I would say, in Bolger we again reiterated the formula that had been used in Central Hudson and gave as an example of something that was not commercial speech the promotional pamphlet. That -- that was sent to some -- you know who it was sent to? It was sent only to the customers of Con Ed. It was an insert in the bills, so there's no doubt that that was speech that had as its audience only those people who purchased from Con Ed, whereas in this case, these guys are not direct purchasers, and moreover, and I think decisively, that's the closest that anything in this case comes to commercial speech.",
  "Yes. I think --",
  "Well --",
  "I'm sorry. I was only going to add that Mr. Kasky, even though he has standing to do a great deal --",
  "-- does not have standing to sue on behalf of the athletic directors, it turns out, because the California courts in the Rosenbluth case in 2002 said that this is a law where you're supposed to represent the public, not sophisticated organizations, because they might have their own interests, so to the closest this case comes --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Yes, it's --",
  "No, Justice Ginsburg, I think that's not right, because what the court of appeals said in this case -- and its opinion I think merits reading. It's at least as good as the dissents in the California Supreme Court. What it said was, not that we can't pick and choose somewhere in this pile of scattered material, as it described it, something that under a different scheme might be permissible. What we hold is impermissible is making the courts pawns in a public debate and having what amounts to -- they didn't use the phrase, show trial, but essentially they were saying a trial in which you, in effect, put on trial such a large and massive question and hopeless mix of fact and opinion as the impact on the Third World of this large company. Now --",
  "Yes.",
  "That --",
  "That's probably the single strongest point, and let me connect it with a broader theme, because in Discovery Network, when this Court talked about the fact that commercial speech is a category that's relevant when you're going after commercial harm, in a sense to protect consumers from fraud of one kind or another, in the reputation area it is again not speech alone you're going after. You're trying to vindicate certain interests in not being harmed. You have to have someone whose reputation is harmed.",
  "Well, I think simply adding a name wouldn't necessarily solve the problem. The Attorney General of California put his arm around the Consumer's Union in the Alta-Dena case, but in this case you need a --",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "That's right, but it does have to show, the statutes are written to require it to show that there is an area of legitimate regulatory concern. Consumers might be fooled into believing, by the Egg Nutrition Council, that cholesterol is good for your heart, and they're trying to protect them.",
  "Well, first of all, if they're very interested they can do a number of things. They can pass something like -- Congress passed the Dolphin Protection Act saying, if you really care about dolphins, then whenever a can of tuna is sold, it can't use the phrase, dolphin-friendly, unless certain things are met. California did this with ozone at one point and then it repealed the ozone-friendly law. But giving a company an idea of what it has to disclose and what the issues are going to be is very different from saying, well, here we are, we're sitting here and waiting until somebody --",
  "Well, I -- no, I think the defamation line of cases is even better, because at a minimum they show that you have to have someone who's harmed, and you have to have deliberate or reckless falsehood. Imagine a law --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, it seems to me, Justice Souter, that's a line enough to reverse this decision, but let me just imagine --",
  "It was. It was, Justice Ginsburg. On pages 12 to 14 of our reply brief we detailed the sequence, and if you look back at the briefs in the California Supreme Court the arguments, all of the First Amendment arguments were made, but they didn't get to first base in that court because it said, hey, misleading commercial speech gets no protection.",
  "I was going to give an example --",
  "It was only as applied, Justice Ginsburg. That is, it does not suggest -- these laws have been on the books since the '30s, and we're not suggesting that they have to be scrapped. It's the innovative --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's an as-applied challenge, because these laws, if applied only in cases where harm is alleged and where a court says, to solve the problem we're going to require that it be proved, that is, it would be the California courts that would have to redesign the system to fix it, wouldn't be unconstitutional. I wanted to get --",
  "Who alleges no harm, and --",
  "Well, I think it has to be -- I -- I think it probably is, but I think that the reason that it's not cured, although I agree very much with the position the Solicitor General takes that that's the deepest disease, even if it's taken out, imagine a law that said, if you utter a defamatory statement that is knowingly false, we're going to impose a gag order. Even if the Attorney General administered it, you'd need to have a possible victim. I mean, if someone says bad things about William Shakespeare, and the State of California decides that it is going to have a general, floating power to correct speech not connected with the regulatory responsibilities of any agency like the FTC or the -- or the SEC, but a free-floating power to correct speech, we think that would be constitutionally infirm, but in this case, in any event, it doesn't come close to commercial speech.",
  "In -- in this forum, where the public agency didn't need to allege, was not administering a regulatory program to protect people, I -- I think --",
  "To have an investigation, no. I think that the freedom of speech includes the freedom to have public as well as private debate. That's what this is about.",
  "Well, of course, in this case discovery is the name of the game, it would become a massive thing.",
  "I think that if we are right that this action dies aborning, if it's like the statute in Cox v. Cohn itself, where it was simply an impermissible thing, and where no trial would cure the problem, then you don't get to that difficulty, but if it's a legitimate trial, if the law were redesigned, very broad discovery might be permissible. I'm a little worried about reserving some time, but I -- I don't want to leave you in mid-air --",
  "I will do just that, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me just deal with a couple of technical things first. The Attorney General of California was notified below. He filed a brief. It's not required in California that all of the arguments be rehearsed before him, and most importantly the California Supreme Court passed on the fundamental claim that this scheme, applied to public debate, violates the First Amendment, and under Yee v. Escondido in any event we can make a different argument. But if you look at the brief below, the most telling part of it, I think -- and it gets to the pivot of this case -- this is at pages 30 to 31 of the California Supreme Court brief. It there recites that if the shoe, as it were, were on the other foot, under California law this case would go away in an instant. The case decided unanimously by the Supreme Court of California in 1984 is Epic v. Superior Court. In that case there was an ideological boycott of companies that were doing business with the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not thought to be environmentally friendly enough. The plaintiff sued for trade libel, they wanted damages, they wanted an injunction, they said it was interference with contract. The trial court was about to hold the trial and the Supreme Court of California, citing Article 1, section 2 of its constitution, said, hey, public debate, there are interests on both sides, but the courts of California can't resolve it. It seems to me that what we have here, and this goes to the question of the Private Attorney General action, is that if there is a debate between interests of labor and interests of management, the California Supreme Court has transmogrified this old statute, which was pretty strange to begin with but had never been used to stifle and silence the public debate, it's transformed it into a conversation-stopper, and the power to do that is, I think, extraordinary. They say, maybe there will be a chill. If you look at the media brief, the media are now saying that businesses around the world are already afraid to communicate with us because California may get them, and the European brief, filed by a consortium that controls about $2 trillion of investment, says that the efforts of the European Union to encourage transparency are being frustrated by California saying that if you come out and answer these charges, as they did in the letter to the athletic directors, you can be trapped, because you're a business, so you're trying to make money, so it's commercial speech.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: As I was listening to some of the questions about whether it would solve the problem to be more candid and say, \"This is your government speaking,\" I thought I would begin with that question, rather than with an overview of government speech. You'll recall Wooley v. Maynard, of course, in which the State of New Hampshire, without sensing the irony of its position, said, \"We'll put you in jail if you do not say, 'Live Free or Die' on\" -­",
  "-- \"your license plates.\"",
  "Yes.",
  "Well -­",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, my -­",
  "-- my point -- my point was going to be that a footnote on the license plate saying, \"This is New Hampshire speaking,\" would not have helped. But one of the central holdings, as I understood it, of United Foods, independent of government speech, was that although there is a difference between having to say something yourself, having to put it on your car, and having to pay for it, that difference does not go to the existence of a First Amendment speech objection -- not an association objection, but a speech objection.",
  "Yes, I don't -­",
  "Justice Scalia, I think, although it's an interesting digression about whether the government is being candid, the objection here has nothing to do with that.",

  "Let me -­",
  "Well, but -­",
  "-- but let me ask you whether -­",
  "It depends on the purpose for which you are acting whether it's government speech. In Rust v. Sullivan, even though I think you're certainly right, Justice Scalia, that in that opinion it wasn't called government speech, in order to rationalize it, in Rosenberger and Velazquez, it was so described. But the question there wasn't, \"Can people be made to support it?\" The question, rather, was, \"Can the government insist on staying within the terms of its grants and saying you can't talk about abortion?\" When the question is, \"Can the government force you to support it,\" the \"it,\" if it's government speech, doesn't help. The First Amendment makes it a harder case for them, not easier.",
  "Well -­",
  "Of course.",
  "But the Court has said there is a fundamental difference between being singled out, as in Wooley, to have a license plate, as in Pruneyard, to have someone on your premises. In Pruneyard, the Court said that one of the reasons it's okay to require someone to allow a private speaker onto the premises is that he was not required to support a government slogan. When it is --",

  "We would object, fundamentally, if they did not emphasize American beef. That was our first objection. They said that they don't want to emphasize American beef, because, in cross-examination, the officer of the Beef Board said, \"Consumers might actually have a preference for American beef. That would be irrational. We don't want that.\" And so all of those cattle ranchers can say that, \"We're proud of it being American.\" They can't get that in there. And the other principal thing is that they don't think of themselves as selling sides of beef. Some of them are selling dairy cattle, some of them are selling -­ even if it's going to, in the end, be in the slaughterhouse -- we all die someday -- their fundamental belief is that these are animals, and they're to be cared for. And the reason that that makes a difference -- the reason that it makes a difference that they can't even advertise -- try to make live cattle more attractive to buy -- is that the collective-action problem, if that were relevant here -- I think that was really resolved by United Foods -- but the collective-action problem is really created, not solved, by what they're doing.

They have the bargaining power. And in the record, their support for the findings of the District Court, that when the demand for beef goes up through these generic ads saying, \"Eat beef\" -- although they certainly don't say, \"Your government says you should eat beef, beef, beef\" -- but when the demand for beef goes up, the profit is pocketed by the meat processor, the meat packer, the restaurant, the supermarket.

At least the spirit of the program is not that. But the road to hell is often paved with good intentions, and the means, in this case, that was chosen, was not to have the government spend some more money telling people, \"Beef isn't all as bad for you as you think.\" The remedy that they are choosing is to pick a group of ranchers and say to them, \"You are the ones who are going to pay, and you are going to pay for\" -­",

It remains unconstitutional because these individuals are forced in a way that taxpayers are not -- forced to be part of a system in which, even if you have footnotes saying, \"This is pursuant to the government,\" a system in which they will be generally understood in just the way Justice Breyer said, \"Well, you know, we assume\" -­",

One. Two, this Court doesn't have before it the possibility of rewriting all of this. Three, there was a severability provision in an earlier version of the law suggesting that maybe if you could lop something off, it would be okay. But that was eliminated in the current law. And, finally, any attempts to analogize this to the cases like Lehnert and Keller, in terms of remedy, that maybe we can create some scheme where only the objectionable part is returned, is fundamentally incoherent, because what is objectionable here is homogenizing all of these people into some one message, and putting it out through this elaborate structure that purports to represent them.",
  "I think that there's a point beyond which, for institutional reasons, it would be very problematic for a courts to say that you could trace the dollars into the treasury and those institutional reasons would be, I think, an instance of under-enforcement of a constitutional norm, because the underlying constitutional principle that you ought not to be able, by some gimmick, to get some people to support speech they don't believe in, that would be there. But the difficulty of having this Court enforce that principle, I think, would be very real. But no such difficulty, I think, is presented in a case like this one, because if this case came out their way because of government speech, of course, United Foods would be obliterated, but a good deal more would be obliterated, because the theory would have to be that because it's not on your license plate, because you don't have to carry it, you're only supporting it, then that's all the difference in the world. Because, otherwise, its being government speech would make it worse. But if it's all the difference in the world whether you have to carry or utter it, or merely support it, then all of the decisions of this Court carefully protecting the rights of dissenters in every imaginable kind of organization, from the powerful overriding theory that collective-action problems mean that we've really got to get more speech over here than you are willing, yourselves, to engage in --",

But no such problem is presented in cases like this.",

  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is a dramatic contrast between the instantaneous judgments a school principal might have to make in the face of complicated decisions like Tinker, and a deliberate decision over a course of almost a dozen years made by officials of the Bureau of Land Management that the greater retaliate against someone for refusing to relinquish his property to the government without any compensation.

  "They didn't have the authority to cancel it simply because of the transfer of the land. They allege that he had made various technical violations on account of which they canceled it. But the key point is, that was supposed to be the quid pro quo, that is, they have maintained all along that this case is about that right-of-way and what an ingrate the respondent is that he wants to continue enjoying it and not give the easement. Well, he didn't enjoy it after July of 1995 when it was canceled. They wouldn't have had to cancel it for alleged violations.",

  "Justice Breyer, that -- that floodgates concern was addressed by this Court not long enough in Hartman v. Moore when the remedy in that case for a prosecution that was brought to retaliate against someone for the exercise of her First Amendment right was a Bivens action against the postal inspectors who made this all up. Now the Court there addressed the possibility that this would unleash a flood of lawsuits, and it said that over the past quarter century, there had been only 12 Bivens or 1983 actions against this kind of retaliation. I suppose that is because not that many postal inspectors or BLM guys think they can get away with deliberately retaliating against people for exercising their rights.",
  "I see, but it was present in Davis, Davis v. Passman, to which Justice Kennedy referred, already recognized a Bivens action for violating something even more capacious, due process, equal protection. When this Court said in Village of Willowbrook against Oleck that there is a cause of action even for the naked assertion that you're treating me differently, did that open huge floodgates? Have we been flooded? It seems to me that the Court has developed its own filters against the floodgate of retaliation claims. It's been - -",

  "And Hartman v. Moore, different. What we were answering there was not the point about a freestanding cause of action.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, that was a response to their claim, that only with respect to the Fifth Amendment is there a right. This was not the Bivens question. Only with respect to the Fifth - - First Amendment is there a right not to be retaliated against for the exercise of your rights.",
  "We can look at it.",
  "In the sense that there has never been a case just like it under Hope v. Pelzer, there doesn't have to have been one like it. But we do think that there is a compelling case, because there's no other way to enforce the just compensation right against a group of government agents who are determined to pile punishment upon punishment until someone caves in.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, it is the retaliatory pattern that there is no remedy for. When going - -",
  "Well, the action of falsely prosecuting him in retaliation - -",
  "No, we did not bring a malicious prosecution claim for that felony charge.",
  "It would have been against Federal officials and that would have been then transformed unless we brought it under Bivens, which is what we are trying to do, transformed into an action against the United States by the Westfall Act. That is all of these attempts - -",
  "For that one event from the United States, but the BLM agents would not have been deterred. In any event, Carlson v. Green - -",
  "I think the most important point that I'm trying to make, Justice Souter and Mr. Chief Justice, that when someone says, I do not want to give you my property, you have to take it from me and give me just compensation, the position of the Government here is that there is no constitutional limit on the kind of retaliation they can engage in.",
  "Well, Bivens as a constitutional tort is not a new remedy. The question really is whether there is any conceivable basis when they trash his lodge, when they do all of the other things, for treating this differently from another kind of constitutional violation. I mean, they argue that it's very important, even though we could have lots of people bringing unjustified suits, to have a Bivens remedy for retaliation against free speech. The reason that they give is that free speech is easily chilled. But with property rights the Just Compensation Clause is kind of its own antifreeze.",
  "But Justice Breyer, the Court has established in the area of retaliation against people for the exercise of their rights, Title VII rights in Burlington, First Amendment rights - -",
  "Hartman is not statutory. Some of the -- Hartman is the First Amendment, and it's the Bivens case. The point I was trying to make about that is that the Court has a body of law trying to filter out through requiring proof of causation, requiring proof of substantial injury, filter out these trivial cases where someone is simply making a nuisance.",
  "Certainly.",
  "In the common law history, Justice Alito, we cited two cases from New York, the Whaley case in 1827 and Willett in 1915. And it was that body of New York law from which the Hobbs Act largely drew. Those were cases in which the courts said that the fact that the government agent is extorting property for his own employer the government doesn't make any difference; it is still extortion.",
  "There are plenty of cases, Justice Alito, that involve extortion for one's employer where the employer might be a union or a corporation or a charitable body. But it's true the Hobbs Act has not been applied, in my research anyway I have not seen it applied, to this kind of extortion. But the language clearly covers it and the language of RICO clearly covers it.",
  "If the librarian thinks that, the legislature is not giving us enough money, so I'm going to deliberately use my authority to get an extra five cents from everybody, I suppose if you could prove willfulness, which is an important element of Hobbs, and if there were several librarians and there was a pattern and you could establish the other prerequisites of RICO, it could be a RICO violation.",
  "That's right.",
  "The second case - -",
  "I don't, I don't think there is, Justice Breyer, and it's very short.",
  "Well, Willett versus Devoy, it involved a clerk demanding more money than the law allowed, and the court said: \"No distinction is made on the ground that the official keeps the fee or turns it over to the government. Such a judge-made restriction on the general statute requiring that the money be kept by the individual might itself bring about uncertainty, confuse and possibly great injustice.\"",
  "I don't remember.",
  "No.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, first of all, when you keep calling it a reciprocal agreement it does trouble me. They weren't giving him anything for this easement which they had already extracted from his predecessor.",
  "It makes all the difference in the world. They were trying to get the easement for nothing. I mean, it's very much - -",
  "Well, most of what they did would not have been an okay method of getting a reciprocal easement, anyway. But the attempt to get it would be fine. It's not that they are not entitled to a reciprocal easement. That might have been a problem under Nollan and Dolan to figure out whether there was enough connection, but I think there would have been enough. The problem was that they were using the right-of-way, which was long gone, as an excuse to get an invaluable piece of property that they had no right to get. They were then trying to -- they were basically saying, and they made it explicit, give us this easement for nothing or we'll bury you.",
  "Nor would Nollan have come out the same way if they weren't trying to get an easement in return for something which wasn't -- which you called extortion.",
  "I guess the straightforward answer that I would give to your question I think is that the Constitution does guarantee that the Government cannot take your property for public use without just compensation.",
  "You've certainly done it with respect to the Eighth Amendment. You've done it with respect to speech. You've done it with respect to - -",
  "Justice Kennedy, if it's an extension, it's I think implicit in Bivens' logic. Bivens deals with the cases - -",
  "The Fifth Amendment is different from the First, but is it different in a relevant way? The Just Compensation Clause does give the government an incentive, if they can avoid having to use eminent domain and tax the public, gives them an incentive to try to squeeze property out of somebody. If it has any incentive effect, it's one that points to the need for a Bivens remedy. Why is a Bivens remedy - -",
  "No, Mr. Chief Justice. Working together is what this guy tried to do at the beginning. He said, I'm happy to negotiate.",
  "They said: We don't negotiate.",
  "The record in the case shows that on those very instances where he was cited with trespass others who were doing the identical thing were not. And the IBLA has said - -",
  "The IBLA rejected them because it said it has no jurisdiction. This was at -- in its decision at 170 IBLA in 2006. No jurisdiction to consider whether the motive was retaliatory, whether it was unconstitutional, whether it was part of a pattern. And this Court has said that one can't use the APA in that way either. Nor could an injunction be used to get a pattern like this because of Rule 65D and International Longshoremen, try to frame an injunction saying: Don't keep trashing this guy and ruining his business and harassing and surveilling his guests and whatever else you can come up with in order to squeeze his property out of him. No other remedy will work.",
  "He could have taken that one item and under a decision like Hartman vindicated it. But as is clear from the way he tried to challenge these individual things and then concluded, as we explained in our brief, that it was taking years and costing hundreds of thousands of dollars more than was involved in each individual one, that was hopeless.",
  "Well, he wouldn't have had - - because he would have had no record. That is, the review under the APA by the district court would have been based on the evidentiary record he made. And the IBLA specifically ruled that it would not entertain evidence about the reasons that the BLM officials had for going after him. There would be no evidence to support his claim.",
  "I believe the district court's jurisdiction in reviewing a final agency action is limited to the agency record.",
  "So a challenge to the IBLA's assertion - -",
  "Well, he did write to the Secretary of the Interior.",
  "He was not given an answer. So what can one say? The district court decided -- lest you assume that because he wasn't given an answer he doesn't have a case, the district court said, as hard as it is to prove these things, he has substantial evidence that they were picking on him solely to get the property, not because they didn't like him, not for some other reason; they were trying to get property for which they were unwilling to pay. It's doubtful that they could have taken it by eminent domain because the laws limiting the ability of the BLM require proving necessity and there is nothing in the record suggesting that they needed this easement. There is plenty in the record suggesting that he couldn't access his own property as long as the roadway wasn't maintained in a passable condition, and one of the ways they retaliated against him was to refuse to maintain the roadway. The record is also clear that his business suffered greatly. So that if the result is that someone who is trying to insist that if you want my property, you have to take it by eminent domain and give me just compensation, can't get help in those other ways, this is crucial. What would have happened in Kaiser Aetna, if when the Government said we think we have an easement to the Laguna pond, instead of going to court, which they did and they lost, if they had said well we are going to ram our motor boats or invite people to ram their motor boats into your sailboat? We are going to ruin your business in the Kuapa pond until you give the public an easement. Only a Bivens cause of action which the Court has recognized in other areas, in other constitutional claims -- due process, free speech, Eighth Amendment -- only a Bivens cause of action is directly responsive to that.",
  "The Westfall Act makes an exception when you are making a constitutional claim. That is, in 1988 when the Court passed the Westfall Act, there were two exceptions 2679B(2)(a) and (b) were constitutional claims and statutory claims.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice - -",
  "It seems to me that state tort law does not get at the harm that he has suffered. It gets at each individual piece. But the main harm he suffered is that they are circumventing the Just Compensation Clause as the one way that the Fifth Amendment was designed to permit the Government to get property for public use. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
