  "Mr. Burke, if we could stay with this. The $471 is derived by looking at the average loan or lease payments nationwide. Then, in addition to that, we know that the IRS has a separate category for operating costs that is meant to reflect costs of having a car that are not your loan and lease payments. So, between those two things, why wouldn't we say that ownership costs means your loan and lease payments, but operating costs means your other costs of having a car, and that you get the operating costs if you have a car but don't make loan and lease payments, and you get the ownership costs if you do make loan and lease payments?",
  "For example, Mr. Burke, what would happen if you didn't actually have any out-of-pocket medical costs? Could you still claim a deduction for out-of-pocket medical costs?",
  "But, Mr. Burke, even you would say -- is this correct -- that if you don't own a car at all, you can't claim the car costs?",
  "But, Mr. Burke, if the table said loan and lease costs, you wouldn't have a case? If it said -- instead of ownership costs, if it said loan and lease costs, then you would sit down and you would say I'm not entitled to that deduction?",
  "Even if it's called loan and lease costs?",
  "Ms. Maynard, what would happen if the debtor had a car that was 200,000 miles old -- 200,000 miles, and it was going to break down, you know, within the next 5 years? Would the debtor then be able to take the deduction?",
  "Even though if you look ahead, if you project forward, it's pretty clear that the debtor is going to have to incur those expenses?",
  "Well, the modification works for chapter 13, but it doesn't work for chapter 7; is that right?",
  "Ms. Saharsky, could you explain to me the government's position on when a debtor with loan and lease payments gets to deduct them under Romanette ii? In other words, this goes back to Justice Kennedy's question, the notwithstanding clause and whether the notwithstanding clause effectively excludes all loan and lease payments from Romanette ii?",
  "But, in other words, the loan and lease payments don't count as debt for purposes of the notwithstanding clause; they count as expense amounts?",
  "Mr. Duncan, could I give you a hypothetical -- -",
  "-- just to test how strong your position is here. So let's say that there is a new DA comes to town, and he says, there's going to be one attorney per case from now on, and it will be a random assignment system. So sometimes important cases will be tried by experienced attorneys, but sometimes they'll be tried by people right out of law school. And there will be no Brady supervision at all, no Brady training. And there is a closed file system, that we only turn over what we're required to turn over and not anything else. And in addition to that, if I, the DA, find that you have turned over things that you're not required to turn over, that will be taken into account in your yearly review for promotion purposes, for salary purposes, et cetera. That will be very severely frowned upon. So he, the new DA - -",
  "If you turn over anything that you didn't have to. Okay?",
  "If you give any material that you're not required to do by law. And so he puts into place this whole system and -- and says, okay, go to it. And what happens is that there are Brady violations. And there's a Brady violation in a capital case and the person sits on death row, or the person is executed, whichever, and there's a claim brought. Is that claim not a good claim?",
  "There's not a pattern, because he just came to town and he just, you know, instituted all these policies, and this is the first Brady violation.",
  "But the failure to train or supervise in any way and the setting up a structural system that's pretty much guaranteed to produce Brady violations, that would not be enough? In other words, even if the jury said yes, you are liable under that second theory -- not the policy theory, but the failure to train and supervise theory -- that -- that would have to be rejected?",
  "Could I add to my hypothetical, then?",
  "Suppose that this new district attorney said -- you know, every day he came into the office and he said: I think Brady is just crazy, and I think it's just the worst decision that the Supreme Court has ever issued; and as long as you don't get caught, anything you do is okay by me.",
  "It's not a policy. He's just, you know, making his views known around the office.",
  "Then the policy is just that you -- you have to turn over what you have to turn over, nothing else, and if you turn over anything else you'll get penalized for doing so. That's the policy.",
  "So what would have been enough? I mean, is an hour a year enough? Is an hour a month enough?",
  "Mr. Cooney, I'm still confused as to sort of how much is enough by way of training and how you would ask a court or a jury to decide that. You suggested to the Chief Justice formal training wasn't -- isn't necessary if there's some supervision, if there's some mentoring. But, you know, this seems to give cities no sense of what they have to do. No safe harbors. Is that your position?",
  "Mr. Duncan, that I think you can't say, because that's just overturning what the jury found.",
  "The jury found that there was inadequate training.",
  "In fact, the jury found -- I think, if you look at the record -- the jury could have found, a reasonable jury could have found, that there was no training here.",
  "Mr. Summers - -",
  "Mr. Summers, Hustler seems to me to have one sentence that's key to the whole decision, and it goes like this. It says: \"'Outrageousness' in the area of political and social discourse has an inherent subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to impose liability on the basis of the jurors' tastes or views, or perhaps on the basis of their dislike of a particular expression.\" How does that sentence -- how is that sentence less implicated, in a case about a private figure than in a case about a public figure?",
  "But that goes back to the question that was asked previously about -- suppose you had a general statute that just said there will be no disruptions of any kind at private funerals. You know, pick your distance, 500 feet, 1,000 feet, but something that didn't refer to content, that didn't refer to ideas, that just made it absolutely clear that people could not disrupt private funerals. What harm would that statute not address in your case?",
  "Ms. Phelps, suppose - - suppose your group or another group or -- picks a wounded soldier and follows him around, demonstrates at his home, demonstrates at his workplace, demonstrates at his church, basically saying a lot of the things that were on these signs or -- or other offensive and outrageous things, and just follows this person around, day-to-day. Does that person not have a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress?",
  "Demonstrations outside the person's home, outside the person's workplace, outside the person's church -- demonstrations, not disruptions, but saying these kinds of things: You are a war criminal -- what -- what would -- whatever these signs say or worse.",
  "Well, Ms. Phelps, let's say that we disagree with you as to whether Mr. Snyder had at all injected himself into this controversy. Or let's take a case where it's clear that the father of the fallen soldier had not injected himself, had not called any newspapers, had not said anything to anybody, but a group knew that this funeral was taking place and was there with the same signs, with the same -- are you - - are you saying that that makes the difference? That there, there would be a claim?",
  "So it's not a difference that matters.",
  "Mr. Summers, could I ask you to go back to an answer that you gave to one of my colleagues when you were last up there? You said that a -- a more standard antiwar demonstration -- \"get out of Iraq,\" \"war is immoral\" at this funeral, same distance, same-sized signs -- that a more standard antiwar demonstration would be protected by the First Amendment from an intentional infliction of emotional distress suit. And I'm wondering why that is. If you think that what is -- what causes the lack of protection here is the kind of glomming on to a private funeral, the exploitation of a private person's grief, the -- the appearance for no other reason than to gain publicity at a private event -- if that's the problem, why doesn't it also apply to a standard, you know, \"get out of Iraq,\" \"war is wrong\" kind of demonstration?",
  "Well, suppose it's not disrupted and suppose -- and I know that this is -- that you contest these facts -- that yours wasn't disrupted, that they stopped when you started, that they were a sufficient number of feet away from the funeral and so forth. So we're just talking the fact that there are people who have -- who are appropriating and taking advantage of a private funeral in order to express their views, and they are in compliance with all the content-neutral rules.",
  "But why is it a closer call?",
  "So does that mean that now we have to start reading each sign and saying \"war is wrong\" falls on one side of the line, but \"you are a war criminal\" falls on another side of the line? Is that what we would have to do?",
  "Well, that's true, but I was assuming a situation in which the -- a jury found that the \"war is wrong\" -- that a jury did find that outrageous, and the question was: Were we going to reverse the jury verdict because we -- the First Amendment prohibited it?",
  "Mr. Owen, as I -- as I read -- I'm sorry.",
  "Mr. Owen, could I take you back to Rooker-Feldman with that as the premise? You said that what you are attacking is the judgment. I read your complaint as having an important strand where you were not attacking the judicial judgment, but instead were attacking actions of the prosecutor's office, independent of any judgment of the State courts. Are you abandoning that part of your complaint, or are you continuing to maintain it? Because certainly, if you talk about the judgment alone, it at least gets you into Rooker-Feldman territory, whereas if you talk about the prosecutor, it does not.",
  "Mr. Coleman, if you could answer Justice Breyer's question, because there are two phrases, \"necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction\" and \"necessarily spell speedier release\"; and either you think that your case fits one of those or both of those standards, or you are asking us to abandon that standard.",
  "But how could this be brought in habeas? If Mr. Skinner wants this evidence and -- and we say you file a habeas petition, what would that habeas petition look like?",
  "Well, take the case, Mr. Coleman -- I think there was one recently in the Fifth Circuit where a prisoner asked for appellate slip opinions. And the prisoner said I want these slip opinions so I can write a better habeas petition. Does that also have to be brought as part of a habeas case, or can that be brought in 1983?",
  "No, he said he didn't have enough access to slip opinions, and he needed more slip opinions in order to be able to obtain a quicker release from prison via habeas.",
  "No what? No what?",
  "Why is that different?",
  "Why -- why is that different? Both the -- the prisoner is seeking a tool that he hopes will lead to a quicker release, although it has no certainty at all of doing so.",
  "So, Mr. Owen, if I understand you correctly in how this understanding of the claim relates to the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, what you are saying is that the statute as construed was unconstitutional?",
  "And that that falls outside the bounds of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine?",
  "Whereas, if you were saying that the statute -- that the application of the statute in this particular case was wrongful, that would not fall outside of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine; is that right?",
  "Now, Mr. Mills, if I could just understand your answer to Justice Alito. You concede that the Sixth Circuit opinion is using the record built on the whole trial and that that's a different record from the record that existed at summary judgment; is that correct?",
  "So they have that first paragraph where they suggest that they're ruling on a summary judgment motion. Then they go through an entire opinion that talks about the facts and the record. And there are very few citations, but your understanding is that when they talk about the facts in the records, they're talking about the post-trial -- I mean the record that has been built up as a result of the trial?",
  "Mr. Mills, when -- when Unitherm talks about the district court feeling the case and having a feel for the case, it's talking about having the feel for the evidence and for the facts. The whole rationale of Unitherm is based on the evidence, the facts, not on purely legal questions. So suppose we disagree with you about the reach of Unitherm. Suppose we say Unitherm doesn't have any application to purely legal questions. What would that mean for your case? Which part of your claims were purely legal and which part were instead founded on the facts, in which case you would have a better Unitherm argument?",
  "And, Mr. Mills, if that were the basic hornbook rule, your claims are all matters of fact or mixed questions of fact and law?",
  "There are no purely legal issues?",
  "Well, that's what I'm asking. I'm asking is -- is -- are the questions that you have those sorts of questions, or are they factual inquiries that would fall on the other side of Justice Breyer's line?",
  "Well, Mr. Mizer, you asked for an appeal of the summary judgment motion, so they might have chosen their words based on your request.",
  "Well, Mr. Mizer, just -­",
  "Well, is it this case, Mr. Mizer? Take the deliberate indifference claim. The question is whether the conduct amounted to deliberate indifference. Why is that any different from asking whether a particular kind of conduct amounted to negligence, which in a previous case this Court said you had did have to make 50(b), a 50(b) motion in order to preserve? That was in the Johnson v. New York case.",
  "Well, Mr. Mizer, suppose that they were. Suppose they committed an error in that respect and that they thought they were reviewing the summary judgment order, and not the final judgment. If that's what they thought, would you agree that they had no jurisdiction at that point to take that appeal because the 30 days had run?",
  "So your position is -­ rests, is dependent, on our finding that the Sixth Circuit was reviewing a final judgment order, which was not what the Sixth Circuit in fact said it was doing.",
  "Well, do you actually have studies that show that video games are more harmful to minors than movies are?",
  "And suppose -- suppose a new study suggested that movies were just as violent. Then, presumably, California could regulate movies just as it could regulate video games.",
  "Mr. Morazzini, could I take you back to Justice Scalia's original question, which was what counts as deviant violence or morbid violence? Because I read your briefs all the way through, and the only thing that I found was -- you said was clearly covered by this statute was Postal 2. But presumably the statute applies to more than one video game. So what else does it apply to? How many video games? What kind of video games? I mean, how would you describe in plain English what -- what morbid violence is, what you have to see in a video game for it to be covered?",
  "So anything that has those kinds of violence counts?",
  "Well, so how do we separate violent games that are covered from violent games just as violent that are not covered?",
  "So is what's covered here the -- the mature category in the ratings? Is that what this statute covers? Is that what it's meant to cover?",
  "Some, but not all.",
  "So could I just make -- make sure I understand that, Mr. Morazzini, because, as I understand, the State has given up its argument that the interest protected by this law is an interest in preventing minors who see these games from going out and committing violent acts themselves; that the State is not saying that that's the interest in the law; is that correct? That instead the State is saying that the interest in the law is in protecting children's moral development generally?",
  "Well, Mr. Smith, is there any showing that the State could make that would satisfy you, that would say, yes, that's a sufficient showing for this law to go forward? You know, I understand that you think that the current studies don't suggest much of anything about harm.",
  "But -- but are there studies that would be enough?",
  "Mr. Smith, do you think all video games are speech in the first instance? Because you could look at these games and say they're the modern-day equivalent of Monopoly sets. They're games. They're things that people use to compete. You know, when you think about some of them -- the first video game was Pong. It was playing tennis on your TV. How is that speech at all?",
  "So are we going to separate video games into narrative video games and non-narrative video games?",
  "Do you think Mortal Kombat is prohibited by this statute?",
  "It's a candidate, meaning, you know, yes, a reasonable jury could find that Mortal Kombat -- which is, you know, an iconic game, which I'm sure half of the clerks who work for us spent considerable amounts of time in their adolescence playing.",
  "So if you are right, General Katyal, the Court was without authority to decide Walz, Nyquist, Hunt, Mueller, Hibbs, this -- this very case, just a few years ago? That the Court was without authority to decide any of those cases, but that somehow nobody on the Court recognized that fact, nor did the SG recognize that fact. The SG participated, I believe, in each of those cases.",
  "Ms. Bickett, could you explain something to me just -- I have been puzzling and puzzling over this scheme. Could you tell me why Arizona adopted this sort of scheme rather than the more typical tuition voucher scheme? In other tuition voucher schemes, the State just gives the -- the voucher or scholarship or what have you. This is so much more complicated and complex and unusual. And it just left me wondering why it was chosen, or what the State thinks the advantages are of it now?",
  "Could I try Justice Kennedy's question in a slightly different way? I'm assuming that you would agree that if this was just a straight tuition voucher program, the State could not give tuition vouchers on the basis of religion, could not say, if you are a Catholic, you don't get these tuition vouchers. But what the State has done here, apparently, is to set up a scheme that uses intermediaries that can make exactly that distinction, that can say, sorry, if you are a Catholic you don't get scholarships out of our STO. And the question is, why should the State be able to do that? If the State can't do it itself in providing tuition vouchers, why should the State be able to set up a system using intermediaries that exist for no other reason than to administer this program that can make those distinctions?",
  "But the plaintiffs contend -­",
  "The plaintiffs contend -­ and this is a motion to dismiss, so we have to accept their contentions as settled -- that there are STOs that make these distinctions that clearly would be impermissible if the State administered the program. These are not pre-existing charitable organizations. They are not pre-existing schools. They're entities that are set up solely for the purpose of administering this program, and yet the State is saying it can make distinctions that the State itself cannot.",
  "But you're saying -- you are saying both, is that right, Mr. Bender? You're saying both of those things?",
  "Yes. Could I ask you: Is there -- do you understand the beneficiaries of this program? Has the State said who the beneficiaries of this program are? Are the beneficiaries of this program the parents, or are the beneficiaries of this program the general taxpayers?",
  "So I would assume, then, if the beneficiaries of the program are the parents, then it's the parents who have to be treated equally -­",
  "-- without regard to religion.",
  "General Katyal, Flast could not have meant that it's your particular dollar. There would be no way to know it's your particular dollar, and that would be a silly and fictional thing to say as the plurality opinion in Hein makes clear. What Flast said was that taxpayer dollars, not your dollar, but taxpayer dollars are going to this activity in the same way that it's going to the activity here.",
  "Flast talked about a nexus in the way that Justice Breyer said. And here, there's a taxpayer challenging a provision of the tax code, enacted pursuant to the tax and spending power, that -­ that grants a tax benefit. That's as close a nexus as you are going to get using the language of Flast.",
  "Mr. Bilderback, I know that that's the principal fact that you rely upon, that there's a difference, but could you give us a full catalogue of the facts that are different in the Federal court record from the facts that are different in the State court record? Was there anything other than the medical testimony and the billing sheets, or is that the extent of it?",
  "Have you thought about -­",
  "Well, Mr. Bilderback, going back to your question of what's a claim. So the claim here could be ineffective assistance at the penalty stage. Or you could be saying, no, the claim is ineffective -- ineffective assistance for failing to present evidence of organic brain damage. That would be a narrower understanding of the claim. Or still narrower, it might be ineffective assistance for failing to present evidence of a particular kind of brain damage, frontal lobe brain damage, which is what the new doctor said, as opposed to what the old doctor said, which was bipolar disorder. So how do we choose the level of generality, if you will, when we try to figure out what the claim is?",
  "Mr. Kennedy -­",
  "But, Mr. Kennedy, do you agree with the State that there are two things at issue here? There's the new medical testimony, and there's also the billing sheets?",
  "Oh, but that's not -- that was not presented as evidence in the State court, the billing sheets?",
  "I think what's important is that they are not -- I mean, tell me if I am wrong, but they were not part of the State court record on which the State court made the 2254(d)(1) determination; is that right?",
  "I'm sorry, I don't know -­",
  "I was under the impression --",
  "I was under the impression, Mr. Pincus, that Discover Bank specifically cites a case which arose not in the arbitration context, but instead in the general litigation context, which is this America Online case, and thereby made clear that its rule, however different it may seem to you from normal contract provisions, its rule applied both in the arbitration sphere and in the litigation sphere.",
  "Well, this -­",
  "But Mr. Pincus -­",
  "But, Mr. Pincus, I'm not understanding what test you are asking us to formulate. Justice Scalia started this by saying, how about a provision prohibiting certain kinds of attorney's fees? How about a provision prohibiting certain kinds of -- a law prohibiting certain kinds of discovery provisions? And you said that would be fine, for the State courts to hold those things unconscionable, but it's not fine for the State court to hold a class arbitration prohibition unconscionable. So what separates the two? How do we know when something is on one side of the line and something is on the other? Both procedures, but you say some are fine, to say that those procedures are unconscionable, but other procedures if you held them unconscionable that would not be sufficient.",
  "The State says yes.",
  "The State says it absolutely is. Now, who are we to say that the State is wrong about that.",
  "But, Mr. Pincus, the State says, well, our unconscionability doctrine may not have done that in the past, but now in the year 2010 it actually applies to more things than it did in the past, and we do take into account third parties and that's our new unconscionability doctrine. Now, it may be a good unconscionability doctrine or it may be a bad unconscionability doctrine, but it's the State's unconscionability doctrine.",
  "Mr. Gupta, AT&T says that nobody would ever choose class arbitration; it's the worst of both worlds. You get all the procedures, you get broad liability, but at the same time you have no judicial review, so that this will effectively kill off arbitration in the consumer context.",
  "Is your test a purpose test or an effects test? Is it a test that says the State is doing this in order to kill arbitration, or is it a test that says the State is doing something that will kill arbitration?",
  "But what's the -- what's the possible rationale for that distinction? Why would that distinction make any sense?",
  "Ms. Sherry, there seems to be a question as to what remedy somebody would be entitled to under subsection (c) in the challenge brought against a tax exemption. So what's the government's position on that?",
  "But isn't that true regardless of whether the Rule 35 motion seeks legal relief or discretionary relief alone? That both can be made prior to the finality of the judgment?",
  "And -- and if I understand your argument, your argument is that Rule 35 motions that seek legal review do fall within the 2244(d)(2) language. It's just that Rule 35 motions that seek discretionary relief do not.",
  "Mr. Weisman, I think that that's not right, that the -- as you say, that the Rule 35 motion that Rhode Island has is based on the Federal Rule 35 motion that existed prior to 1987, and that on a couple of occasions this Court talked about that prior Federal Rule 35 as collateral review. Am I wrong about that?",
  "U.S. v. Robinson, Bartone v. United States. And I might be wrong about it.",
  "Mr. Weisman, I'm sorry. Before you talk about policy, so this motion to reduce sentence is very short. It just says that the man \"prays that the sentence imposed with respect to the above matter be reduced in accordance with the provisions of Rule 35.\" Would it make a difference to you if it said he prays that the sentence imposed -- he prays that the illegal sentence imposed with respect to the above matter be reduced in accordance with provisions of Rule 35?",
  "If he had put in that word, \"illegal,\" would that have made the difference?",
  "So -- but that does suggest the difficulty that Justice Scalia raises, is that we're going to have to look at the particular rule of the State, we're going to have to look at the particular motion, we're going to look at any -- we're going to have to look at any State law regarding how motions are construed.",
  "And this is going to be a very difficult determination.",
  "But, Mr. Weisman, that's true also of State habeas claims that are based only on State law. But six circuits have said that 2244(d)(2) applies to those claims. Are you contesting that?",
  "Where the exhaustion policy does not come into effect.",
  "I think, Ms. Mizner, the amicus brief in this case asserted that, in Rhode Island or in other States with a rule like this, many judges sit on these Rule 35 motions. They just let them stay pending for a considerable period of time, in order to retain some ability to modify the sentence if and when they feel like doing so. Is that your understanding of what happens to these motions, that they just sit, that they are not denied?",
  "Do you -­",
  "Do you think that a petition for clemency that's presented to the governor would toll the limitations period?",
  "Why -- why is that different?",
  "When does the State think that Mr. Martin's claim became untimely?",
  "So you think it -­",
  "But if we can take out the second and successive aspect of this and just focus on the timeliness, when does the State think that this -­ that these claims were -- became untimely?",
  "Well, you have the circumstances here, so -- so under those circumstances, when did the claims become untimely?",
  "The 5 months would be reasonable. So is a year unreasonable? Is 5 months the outer bounds, you know, assuming you don't have a good reason? I understand that if you have a good reason, that can lengthen it. But suppose you don't have a good reason. When does the State think, okay, that's too late?",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm trying to get to even around, not -- not exact. My standard is not exact. It's just around. Around what? Around 6 months, around 3 years, around someplace in the middle?",
  "What happens if a -- a person in this position is trying to investigate multiple claims at once, and some of them are ready to be put before the court and others are not? How does he know, look, I really better get in there right now and put whatever I have before the court? Or, look, I have a little bit more time in order to investigate some of my claims further? How does he make that determination?",
  "Why is it, Mr. Marshall, that the -- the California courts have not been a little bit more transparent about what the presumptive time limits are? You know, look, it's around a year unless have you a good reason. You know, at least we're taking 3 years off the table. I mean, why don't we have decisions like that from the California courts that would -- would help folks here?",
  "Well, Mr. Bigelow, is that right? I take your point that nobody can say exactly when Mr. Martin's claims became untimely, but 5 years is untimely, isn't it?",
  "I mean, if there's a very good reason, but 5 years without an explanation is -­ why is that a hard question?",
  "Why was this petition not filed for 5 years?",
  "Why -- why was this petition not filed for 5 years?",
  "Mr. Bigelow, isn't this similar to the rule that governed Federal habeas review prior to AEDPA?",
  "A similar kind of delay standard, whatever \"delay\" means.",
  "How much time do you think the receiver needed? I mean, how much time did -­ should the court have given the receiver to develop his plan and to try to implement his plan?",
  "Mr. Phillips, my trouble listening to you is that it seems as though you're asking us to re-find facts. You know, you have these judges who have been involved in these cases since the beginning, for 20 years in the Plata case, who thought: We've done everything we can, the receiver has done everything he can; this just isn't going anywhere and it won't go anywhere until we can address this root cause of the problem. And that was the view of the judges who had been closest to the cases from the beginning and the view of the three-judge court generally. So how can we reach a result essentially without, you know, re-finding the facts that they've been dealing with for 20 years?",
  "Why wouldn't it have been the better course, for the State -- excuse me -- for the court to say, you know, the State said it can do this in 5 years -­",
  "-- without any public safety problem? So why don't we let them take those 5 years?",
  "Mr. Phillips, sorry, but on a -- on a different subject. Does the State stand by its representation that it can do this without any public safety impact in 5 years?",
  "That remains true -­",
  "-- notwithstanding budget -­",
  "-- economic differences, budget differences?",
  "But if there were 5 years, you think you could do it without any public safety impact in the way that you told the court you could?",
  "Well, Mr. Olson, we have several times referred to the plan as having a range of documents associated with it, not as having just a single written instrument, but we referred to documents and instruments governing the plan. We did that in Curtiss-Wright, which is the case that you pin so much on. We did that in Kennedy. And the statute itself talks about that on numerous occasions, that there are documents and instruments, in the plural. And one would think that the SPD is -- is one of those documents and instruments that govern the plan.",
  "Well, I was struck by something else, Mr. Olson. I was struck by the fact that the -- that the statute saying what is in the summary plan description is packed with information that needs to be in the summary plan description. By contrast, the written instrument, which you equate to the plan, the written instrument says barely anything about what has to be in it. It just says the name of the fiduciaries has to be in the written instrument. So it seems clear that this statute is set up so that everything that is important, everything that the employee needs to know and needs to rely upon, is supposed to be in the SPD, not necessarily in the written instrument.",
  "But can't the SPD -­",
  "But, Mr. Olson, what about the opposite? Because the statute seems to be written so that things are in the SPD which don't need to be in the written instrument. And together, they all somehow constitute the plan.",
  "But the SPD can't negate the force of ERISA, and if ERISA says that the summary has to be consistent with the plan documents, nothing in the SPD can negate that requirement.",
  "But the very question here is if there is an SPD that is inconsistent in some way with the written instrument, what happens? Is the written instrument modified or, instead, is the provision in the SPD given operative effect? And that question is one about your benefits under the plan.",
  "I do think you're over-reading Curtiss-Wright. Curtiss-Wright talked about whether a particular provision satisfied the requirement that a plan have an amendment provision. It didn't say anything at all about whether there are provisions that can have operative effect regardless of whether they pass through a formal amendment procedure.",
  "Well, Mr. Kneedler, do you view this as essentially a contract case, as that just suggested, or instead a trust case?",
  "Mr. Kneedler, I -- I think it's a hard question here as to whether to think of this as more like a contract dispute or more like a -- a trust issue. If we were to look at it as a trust issue, what would be the result of that? What kind of test would we use?",
  "Mr. Olson, on your view of showing detrimental reliance, I take it you would require each employee to come forward and say yes, I read this SPD; is that correct?",
  "And doesn't that really misunderstand the realities of the workplace? Very few people read their SPDs, but you only need one person to read the SPD to come in and say, by the way, folks, 21,000 of us are not getting our retirement benefits for the next few years. And within a day, every employee in the workplace is going to know about that. So doesn't this give an incredible windfall to your client, Cigna, or to other companies that commit this kind of intentional misconduct if you hold them to this detrimental reliance standard?",
  "So can we talk about that reading, Mr. Yang? Let's talk about the meaning of the statute.",
  "The key word is -- the key term is \"personnel rules and practices.\" If I said to you what's a personnel file, what would you say?",
  "It could be referring to Exemption 6, or it could be referring to just generally, just in a conversation? Your personnel file -- what does it mean?",
  "Can you think of another context in which it means something other than that?",
  "It's a kind of H.R. file, right?",
  "So why should there be any difference if you look at the term \"personnel files and practices,\" that these are H.R. files and practices?",
  "Mr. Yang, if -- if we assume that a majority of this Court finds this statutory interpretation untenable and that you lose, but that the Court is also concerned about the government's reliance interests here and about this set of documents that have been exempted under Exemption 2 that would become unexempt, is there anything that the Court can do about that? Is there anything that the government would need to -- to advance -- to deal with those reliance interests?",
  "I am assuming, yes. That's just an assumption.",
  "Well, Mr. Perry, who wrote the relevant statements?",
  "I understand that they were in the fund's prospectus, but who wrote them?",
  "Who paid those lawyers?",
  "So JCM paid the lawyers?",
  "And so it was JCM's lawyers who wrote the prospectus, including the relevant statements here, the asserted misrepresentations?",
  "Well, suppose the complaint had alleged that. Suppose the complaint had simply said: JCM's lawyers authored the relevant statements in the prospectus.",
  "Would that be enough to survive a motion to dismiss?",
  "They're paid by JCM.",
  "These are in-house counsel for the investment adviser.",
  "Mr. Perry, does the fund have employees?",
  "Who are the fund's employees?",
  "And are all of those people also employees of JCM?",
  "And could you just run through a little bit how one of these prospectuses gets -- gets issued eventually? The JCM lawyers start the process by drafting, and then what happens?",
  "Well, here, I believe that there was a statement in your interrogatories that it's JCM's lawyers, in-house lawyers, who drafted the relevant statement.",
  "And then what happens?",
  "And was there any change to these statements made by the board of trustees?",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Frederick, a substantial part of the power of your argument comes from this notion, as Justice Ginsburg said, that JCM was in the driver's seat, that JCM had control, that they were -- Janus was at most an alter ego of JCM and maybe something more, that it was just a creature of JCM. But the securities legislation seems to deal with that in section 20. And your case is not brought under section 20 and, because of the relationship between mutual funds and their investment advisers, presumably could not be brought under section 20. So, why should we think relevant the kind of controlled relationship that you're talking about?",
  "Mr. Gannon, suppose that we think that this test that the SEC is using and that you recite on page 13 is really pretty broad and that it might apply to a range of factual situations that are not before us. Is there a way to confine our holding just to the mutual fund situation, and if there is, how would you do that?",
  "Mr. Perry, on the allegations of this complaint, these plaintiffs were harmed by the misrepresentations, the alleged misrepresentations from JCM to the fund. So if the fund was duped, would these shareholders, JCM's shareholders, have any relief?",
  "Mr. Waxman?",
  "Can I ask you about the deference that we should give to the briefs that have been filed in the First Circuit and the invitation brief in this case? Auer deference seems pretty four-square with this. It's a brief that was filed to interpret an agency regulation. But I'm wondering whether Auer continues to remain good law after Christensen and Mead. In Christensen, the Court held -- and I quote -­ \"Interpretations such as those in opinion letters -­ like interpretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the force of law -- do not warrant Chevron-style deference.\" And Mead said pretty much the same thing. So it seems to me that there are three possibilities for why Auer remains good law. One is that briefs are somehow different from all those other things that we talked about in Christensen. Another is that an agency gets more deference when interpreting regulations than when interpreting its own statutes -- something that I think I just don't quite understand, but maybe you could convince me of it. And a third is, well, look, they're just basically inconsistent, but Auer was Auer, and we don't feel like overruling cases, and we're not so sure we got it right in Christensen and Mead anyway. So, which is it?",
  "Absolutely right, Mr. Waxman, but in each of those cases it was basically a sentence or two. We never really addressed the possible conflict between Auer and Christensen and Mead.",
  "But Mead did put a lot of emphasis on procedural formality. So, you know, Justice Scalia sort of snidely, but I think accurately, described Mead as saying: \"Only when agencies act through 'adjudication[,] notice-and-comment rulemaking, or...some other [procedure] indicat[ing] comparable congressional intent [whatever that means]' is Chevron deference applicable.\" So, you know -­",
  "This is -- this is not an adjudication. It's not a notice-and-comment rulemaking, and it's hard to see why there is some procedure here indicating comparable congressional intent, as Mead was -- would require.",
  "Mr. Palmore, what would the Board's position be on the following hypothetical: That a card issuer says when any of 50 different things happen, so 50 different triggering events, the -- the issuer can raise the rate anywhere up to 300 percent, so has complete discretion if any of a quite large number of triggering events occurs. And then one of those 50 triggering events occurs, and the card issuer says, okay, we'll raise the interest rate to 42 percent. Would there need to be notice for that?",
  "Under the old rule?",
  "Mr. Beck, just to clarify your position, if the initial agreement said your rate is 10 percent, but if you're delinquent, your rate will be 20 percent, so not up to 20 percent, just 20 percent, it's an automatic increase in your rate -- in that case, would notice -- would subsequent notice be required?",
  "So if you don't need to disclose this -- and I think that this is the import of Justice Ginsburg's question -­",
  "-- what's the difference between going, okay, we'll do the initial agreement, 10 percent to 20 percent; then we can always lower the rate without providing notice; we'll go back down to 12 percent, and now you have a 12 percent rate. What's the difference between doing that and, on the other hand, doing what the card issuer said here, which is if you're delinquent, we have the discretion to go up to 20 percent, but, you know, we could also go to 12?",
  "Mr. Bauer, if -- most of your argument seems to rely on the official staff commentary, but the official staff commentary itself seems to me to cut against you. It says no notice may be -- need be given if the specific change is set forth initially. And then it gives examples of what that means. And it says such as an increase that occurs when the consumer has been under an agreement to maintain a certain balance in a savings account in order to keep a particular rate and the account balance falls below the specified minimum. So the example that they give is an example where there's a triggering event and there's a penalty rate that comes into effect as a result of the triggering event. And that's exactly what is true here.",
  "Well, on the triggering event first, it's true that you might know your account balance, but it's also true that you might know whether you paid your bills on time. What's the difference?",
  "Well, I don't see that in the example that's given. I don't see that it limits it to a situation in which there is an automatic increase in your rate rather than a discretionary increase in your rate. MR. Beck: Well, for that, I would look to section 226.6(a)(2), which says that each periodic rate and the range of balances to which it is applicable must be set forth initially. And so you know from the very beginning which balances on your account will trigger a certain interest rate. And so there's no -- in that case, there's no uncertainty. But the other difference is that in the bank account situation, your balance is either above the maximum or below the maximum. But when you're talking about universal default, it's not always going to be obvious to you, first of all, whether anyone has reported anything to the credit agency. Oftentimes, certain creditors will overlook a certain late payment, for example, and maybe they reported one and it might not show up on your Experian credit report for months or years later, and then you will not know at what point it comes into play. So you would -- the only way to know for sure in that circumstance is to subscribe to the Experian credit reporting service just like Chase does so that you would know when there's any negative events that are reported to the credit agency that would possibly trigger Chase's discretion, but even in that case you wouldn't know for sure whether Chase had implemented its discretion or not. And I wanted to say that the -- that the government -- its own interpretation of the regulation is, especially when considering the amendment, is itself inconsistent, because the government says that the new regulation fixed the problem. But the new regulation uses the same language as the old regulation when it comes to what's required for a -- for a later change. It does carve out the default rate situation as a special case. But for every other kind of rate increase that has happened subsequent to the initial disclosure, it still uses as a triggering event any change in terms required to be disclosed by section 226.6. And if it were true that -- that what the Board wanted to do was fix this ambiguity and this problem that was set forth in -- that was in the original regulations, then it would be very, very unlikely that the government would then implement the same language in the amended regulation and leave that same ambiguity in place rather than clarifying exactly when subsequent notice would be required.",
  "Well, Mr. Hacker, you're saying that the question of whether there is support is reducible to the question of whether there are statistically significant findings. Now, as I understand it, the FDA takes action all the time as to drugs -- they force the withdrawal of a drug from the market, they force relabeling of a drug -- on the basis of findings that are not statistically significant. Now, clearly in those cases the market has a right to know the very things that are going to make the FDA take action against a product and that are going to severely affect the product's value to the company. Not statistical significance there.",
  "Well, it could, and eventually it did.",
  "And you are suggesting a test for what -- what counts as material, which is statistically significant, a test that the FDA itself doesn't use when it thinks about what it should -- what it should regulate.",
  "Well, Mr. Hacker -­",
  "In most cases we don't know whether the claim is false or not. So let me give you a hypothetical: There's a pharmaceutical company and it comes out with its first and only product. It's 100 percent of the sales, and it's a new contact lens solution. And it sells this product to many, many, many hundreds of thousands of people. And most of them use this product with no adverse effect whatsoever, but there are 10 cases where somebody uses this product and they go blind. Three of those 10 cases -- the person had to borrow a contact lens from a friend, only used it in the one eye; they go blind only in that one eye. This is not statistically significant. There is no way that anybody would tell that you these 10 cases are statistically significant. Would you stop using that product, and would a reasonable investor want to know about those 10 cases?",
  "There are a lot of contact lens solutions in the world. So if I heard that, 10 people went blind, 3 used it in one eye, 3 went blind in that eye, I'd stop using the product; and if I were holding stock in that company, I'd sell the stock.",
  "But, Mr. Frederick, suppose you were the CEO of a pharmaceutical company with a new drug, you've just put it out on the market, and you get a report back, this drug has caused a death, right? This is your first adverse effect report. Do you have to disclose it?",
  "Mr. Shah, what deference do you think that the SEC's understanding of materiality is entitled to and why?",
  "Mr. Fergenson, in your question presented to this Court, you ask whether there's personal jurisdiction -- and I'm quoting here -­ \"solely because the manufacturer targets the United States market for the sale of its product.\" So I'm taking from that, that you acknowledge that this manufacturer, McIntyre, a British manufacturer, targeted the United States market for the sale of its product. That's correct, yes?",
  "That's your question presented.",
  "Did this -- well, I'll just ask you, then: Did this manufacturer target the United States market? Did it want to sell its products in the United States?",
  "Okay. So what does that mean, exactly, Mr. Fergenson? Because the United States is the United States. It's made up of 50 States. So I assume that what that means is the manufacturer wanted to sell its products in each of the 50 States. Is that right?",
  "It only wanted to sell its product in a few States?",
  "Right. Anywhere. So if the distributor came up with California, that was great. If the distributor came up with a customer in New Jersey, that was great. As many as possible, more the better, all over the United States. Is that right?",
  "Exactly. So you targeted New Jersey no less than you targeted California or New York or Illinois or Massachusetts or anything else.",
  "You targeted the entire United States. Why shouldn't there be jurisdiction in each of the States you targeted?",
  "Well, suable in any State where the incident arises. This is not general jurisdiction. This is specific jurisdiction. So the question is, when you target the entire United States and each of the 50 States within that and an accident occurs within one of those States, are you subject to jurisdiction in that State for that accident, for a claim based on that accident? Not generally, but just for a claim based on that accident. Didn't even Justice O'Connor -- you referenced the Asahi opinions, but Justice O'Connor said as long as there's purposeful availment, there is specific jurisdiction, and there is purposeful availment when there's an active effort to target a market.",
  "Yes, but, Mr. Fergenson, just picking up where Justice Ginsburg left off, Ohio is a perfectly good place for jurisdiction over a claim between the British manufacturer and its distributor in Ohio. Any kind of contract claim, a claim based on the agreement between the two -- Ohio is the appropriate place for jurisdiction. But Ohio does not seem the appropriate place for jurisdiction -- and again, we're talking about specific jurisdiction, not general -- as to a claim based on an accident that occurred in New Jersey. The entire idea of specific jurisdiction is that you need a relationship between the defendant and the forum and the claim. And here the claim arose in New Jersey and was in fact not related to Ohio.",
  "Mr. Fergenson, could I try another hypothetical?",
  "But, Mr. Fergenson, the question is whether seeking to serve a market -- and here you're seeking to serve a market in each of the 50 States -- is purposeful availment. So let me -- let me just try a different hypothetical. Suppose you had the same arrangement with your distributor in Ohio, but the arrangement was not to serve the entire United States market. Instead, the arrangement was to serve only five States in the Midwest. That's what you wanted, your client wanted, the market to be. So it was going to be Ohio and Indiana and Illinois and Michigan and Iowa, all right? So now a machine blows up in Illinois. Is there jurisdiction in Illinois?",
  "There is jurisdiction in Illinois, even though your relationship with your distributor was in Ohio. But there's jurisdiction in Illinois because the machine blew up there and you were seeking to serve the market; that's right?",
  "Okay. Now we have -- now we say this is working very well. Let's get another nine distributors on board. We'll give each of them five States, all right? Now, if I understand you correctly, now you're liable all over the United States because you've had this relationship with 10 different distributors, each of whom are going to serve 5 States. So there's personal jurisdiction in any State where a machine blows up.",
  "And now I say: Let's forget these 10 distributors. Who needs 10 distributors? I'll just have one distributor. Why is there any difference?",
  "Mr. Fergenson, with respect, this distributor was told to sell as many products as it could in as many States as it could.",
  "Mr. Ross, do you think if there's a small business in the United States that sells a product and that actively seeks to serve a foreign market -- maybe it's Great Britain, maybe it's China -­ and that product blows up in that foreign country -- Great Britain, China -- do you think that the manufacturer, the American manufacturer, is subject to jurisdiction there?",
  "All -- all over the world this is true; is that right?",
  "Mr. Ross, we do that now; isn't that right?",
  "Mr. Ross -­",
  "And, Mr. Ross, isn't -­",
  "And, Mr. Ross, isn't the point that he was selling by using large convention sites in the United States, expecting that people from other States would show up to those large convention sites? I know that Justice Alito doesn't want to hear this, but New Jersey doesn't have all that many large convention sites like Las Vegas does. Newark -­",
  "Newark is not such a hot place, but they're expecting people from Newark to go and look at these machines and buy these machines. That's the marketing system that's used for these massive machines that they're trying to sell nationwide.",
  "And, Mr. Fergenson, isn't that what Justice O'Connor said in Asahi, that the component manufacturer may have all the knowledge in the world -- for Justice Brennan, that was enough; for Justice O'Connor, it was not enough, that knowledge was insufficient, that there had to be purposeful availment, that there had to be an active decision, a choice to seek the market. And -- and I understand that, on your view, McIntyre made that choice.",
  "Mr. Fergenson --",
  "-- could I ask you a question?",
  "Mr. Fergenson, Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen -- pick your car company -- sells many millions of cars to the United States. They start blowing up here. They operate through independent distributors only. Can they be subject to jurisdiction in any of the States?",
  "Do you think there is general jurisdiction over the parent? If the consent were not in the picture, is there? Does general jurisdiction go beyond State of incorporation, principal place of business?",
  "Mr. Horwich -­",
  "Could I ask you a different kind of question? And I apologize in advance for taking you a little bit far afield. But -- but I wanted to ask you about a particular sentence in your brief that seems to have some relevance to -- not the general jurisdiction question but some relevance to specific jurisdiction. So this is on page 20. You say: \"If mere 'purposeful availment' of commercial opportunities in a particular State\" -- which is, of course, the test for specific jurisdiction -- if that purposeful availment \"were sufficient to subject an enterprise to the general jurisdiction of that State's courts, a corporation that sold its goods to an independent distributor, intending that they be resold in all 50 States, could potentially be brought to judgment in any State, on any claim against it.\" So I -- I take that -- I understand that to read that you think that it is purposeful availment that subjects a company to specific jurisdiction -- not to general jurisdiction, but to specific jurisdiction -- if a corporation sold its goods to an independent distributor intending that they be resold in all 50 States. Am I reading that correctly?",
  "No, I was hoping that the answer would be \"yes,\" actually.",
  "But -­",
  "Ms. Peddie, this is just a -- this is an I'm-just-curious question: Why do you care? You have Goodyear USA, which has consented to jurisdiction. Why does it make a difference to get these other companies in the North Carolina courts? Does North Carolina not make Goodyear USA substantively liable for this accident?",
  "So -- but what you're saying, then, is that North Carolina treats the parent and the subs very differently as a matter of substantive law, but you would want identical treatment as a matter of jurisdiction?",
  "Mr. Marsh, I take it that you would agree that (b)(1)(B) is a violent felony under -- under ACCA; is that right?",
  "Well, if we think that (b)(1)(B) is a violent felony under ACCA, and we know that (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) can receive the same punishment, that they're both classed as a class D felony, why should we make the distinction between the two under ACCA?",
  "But these are not nested offenses. These are not -­",
  "These are not lesser included offenses. Each has an element that the other lacks, and both are classed with -- apparently that the -- that the State thinks of them as equally severe. And if one is a violent felony under ACCA, there's an argument that the other should be treated in the exact same way.",
  "Well, Mr. Wall, wouldn't that suggest that if I just ran from a police officer, it would be a violent felony under ACCA?",
  "Mr. Wall, do you think that speeding or drag racing qualifies under your understanding of the test?",
  "But, Mr. Wall, suppose they were. I understand your point that they're not, and you might be right about that. But let's suppose that they were. Let's suppose you had a three-tier set-up. One was simple flight; one was flight that causes risk of injury; one that is a flight that causes injury. And let's even say that the simple flight -- no, let's -­ let's call them all felonies but different classes of felonies. What would happen in that case? Would you still be here saying that the simple flight felony is a violent crime?",
  "I -- I asked my clerk to just do a survey of the States, and he came up with -­ and I'm sure that this is rough -- but that 46 of the States have these tiered systems. Now, there may be some questions as to some of them, like you've raised some questions about Indiana's, but that 46 States essentially conceive of this as two different kinds of conduct, one which is the violent kind and the other which is the not violent crime.",
  "Well, on this question of whether this statute is greater or lesser, it's greater or lesser if you just understand (b)(1)(A) as confined to vehicular flight. In other words, if one looks only at vehicular flight, then (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) are indeed greater or lesser offenses.",
  "Well, do you think that if I flee in a vehicle, I could be prosecuted under both and receive sentences under both?",
  "But as a vehicular flight only, it would be greater or lesser.",
  "But I don't understand why the smell of marijuana is necessary. This goes back to what Justice Sotomayor was saying, you don't need probable cause to knock on a door. Knocking on a door is perfectly lawful. So, if there's just a lawfulness test, the knock is fine. And then when you hear whatever it is that you hear that you think creates exigent circumstances, whether it's a toilet flushing or whether it's just noise, that, too, gives you the ability to go right in. So -- so if it's just lawfulness, you don't need the marijuana smell even, do you?",
  "Probable cause beyond thinking that the evidence -­",
  "-- is being destroyed?",
  "Okay.",
  "Ms. O'Connell, if I could ask you about the government's proposed standard: You say that as long as each step in the police conduct is lawful, that's sufficient. And each step would -- the way the Fourth Amendment works, each step -- we're asking, essentially, whether each step is reasonable. What some courts have done, in addition to that -- and this was not the approach of the court below -- but what some courts have done is to say we also ask a more holistic reasonableness question. We say: Is the whole process by which the police operated with respect to this person reasonable? So, for example, we might say, you know, was there time to get a warrant, or did it look like the police were just -­ they preferred not to have to deal with a magistrate? So what's wrong with that sort of standard? In addition to asking whether each step is reasonable, to say, look, is the whole pattern here of what the police did to come up with this evidence reasonable?",
  "Well, Ms. Drake if that's the case, in some way you're agreeing with the Government. You, too, are saying that -- that there's a lawfulness test. You're just disagreeing about what's lawful.",
  "Mr. Farley, one of the points of the Fourth Amendment is to ensure that when people search your home, they have a warrant. And, of course, there are exceptions to that. But if there is one place where the warrant requirement has real force, it's in the home. And I think that the concern here -- and you have some strong arguments on your side, but the concern here is that your test is going to enable the police to penetrate the home, to search the home, without a warrant, without going to see a magistrate, in a very wide variety of cases, that all the police really have to say is: We saw pot, we heard noise. Or: We think there was some criminal activity going on for whatever reason, and we heard noise. How do you prevent that from happening? How do you prevent your test from essentially eviscerating the warrant requirement in the context of the one place that the Fourth Amendment was most concerned about?",
  "Well, Mr. Monahan, do you mean by that that you would have a blanket rule that a decision on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 can never be preclusive as to a State Rule of Civil Procedure 23?",
  "Well, suppose the State says: We will not consider ourselves bound; we do have our own law with respect to Rule 23, but sometimes we'll go along with the Federal rule and sometimes we won't. Is it then up to the courts to actually try to determine whether the -- the West Virginia court in this case would have gone along, would have interpreted its own rule of civil procedure the same way that the Federal court interpreted the Federal rule?",
  "When -- when Congress enacted CAFA, did Congress think about this precise issue, the issue that Justice Ginsburg is raising about a lawyer going from State to State with a different named plaintiff? Was that -- was that part of what Congress was reacting to?",
  "When you say \"on that issue,\" Mr. Beck, on what issue? Because I think that there is an argument in this case that the West Virginia approach to class certification is different from the Eighth Circuit's approach, that Rezulin would not have been the way that the Eighth Circuit would have approached the class certification question.",
  "Mr. Beck, I'm -- I'm not sure that White answers the question that I asked, because White decided a matter of substantive liability, and the question I asked was whether the approach to class certification was different in the Eighth Circuit and in West Virginia.",
  "If you look at Rezulin, if you compare to it some Eighth Circuit cases, there seems to be a difference in at least tone, shall we say, about the extent to which a finding is required that common issues predominate.",
  "Mr. Beck, the re-litigation exception of the Anti-Injunction Act speaks in terms of judgments. Why is the denial of class certification a judgment?",
  "But the judgment, if I understood it correctly -- there was just a contemporaneous summary judgment motion, and the court granted summary judgment as well. But the denial of class certification isn't responsible for the judge's dismissal of the suit.",
  "So that sounds like a very contingent answer to my question. If that were not the case, if it -- if it was the denial of a class certification, but then the action proceeds as a non-class litigation, you think that there would be no judgment, and so the Anti-Injunction Act would not apply?",
  "Oh, but why isn't it really, because here what happened was that there was a denial of class certification and there was a granting of a summary judgment motion at one and the same time? But the thing that was responsible for getting the case out of court was the granting of the summary judgment motion, not the denial of class certification. That was extraneous to the judgment that the case was dismissed.",
  "Mr. Phillips -­",
  "Mr. Phillips, could I ask you whether that principle makes any sense in this contracting situation, because both parties have argued it as though the question of who is the moving party is determinative of this case, but in a contract situation the question of who's the moving party is very often arbitrary or fortuitous. If you think about it in a private setting, you have one contract -- one contractor who fails to perform or -- or provides some deficient product, another who decides it's not going to pay, and the question of who the plaintiff is, is often just a matter of fortuity, who gets to the courthouse first -­",
  "-- what the payment schedule has been like, so whether somebody is demanding their money back or simply refusing to pay it at all. So, why in this contract situation is the question of who's the plaintiff or who's the moving party -- why does -- why does that make such a difference?",
  "But it can't possibly be the case that the question is what the payment schedule is. If I've paid you already and then I find your product deficient, then I'm going to go to court and demand my money back. If I find your product deficient before I pay you, then you're going to go to court and say you have to pay me. So why should that difference make a difference with respect to the constitutional question before us?",
  "Both party has a claim here. One says you provided deficient performance; the other says you were obligated to pay me. The question of who has the claim and who has the affirmative defense -- it can be structured in either way.",
  "General, what would happen -­",
  "General, what would -­",
  "So just to make sure I understand your argument, suppose that state secrets had prevented you from being able to prove your default claim, that you were unable to make that showing because of state secrets. What would happen then?",
  "That the -- that the -­",
  "That's right, that the secrets that you were -- that you wanted to protect were actually the -- the key to your proving that there was a default.",
  "Let me make sure I understand, because that really does sound like a tails you win, heads you win, whatever.",
  "You're saying that if the state secrets prevented you from making your affirmative case, you should win that one, too?",
  "Mr. Phillips, I understood your papers as making only a constitutional claim.",
  "Are there any limits, Mr. Richland? Suppose that Congress had authorized bankruptcy courts to decide contract disputes between two creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding. Would that be all right?",
  "But, Mr. Stewart, do -- do you think that we should resolve the constitutional question if there's some significant possibility that it wouldn't be necessary because the claims would be found to fit into (b)(5)?",
  "Mr. Englert, one real difference between Marathon and this case is that Congress passed legislation in between which brought the bankruptcy judges under the control of the district courts and made them entirely Article III entities. So you can look at a case like Marathon -- I mean, not -­ supervised by Article III entities, not by the President, not by Congress. So one can look at a case like Marathon and say the problem there was that the President appointed the bankruptcy judges in a way that the President no longer does and that the district courts did not have the supervisory control over the bankruptcy judges in the way that they do now, and that that makes a constitutional difference.",
  "Mr. Clement, in the case before us, are you making any claims other than that Congress was acting outside its enumerated powers in enacting this statute? Are there any peculiarly Tenth Amendment claims that you're making? In other words, you admit that Congress is acting within its enumerated powers and yet the action violates the Tenth Amendment. Are you making any claims of that sort, or are all your claims that the statute here goes beyond Congress's ability to enact it under Article I?",
  "Well, let's just use the Printz case and say, even though Congress might have the ability to enact a statute under Article I, there's an independent Tenth Amendment limitation. Do you have any claims of that kind in this case?",
  "Well, let's assume, Mr. Clement, that there is such a thing as a claim in which you're saying, I can see that this is within Congress's Article I powers, but there is an independent Tenth Amendment limitation on this. Do you have any claims like that?",
  "Mr. Clement, if you are not making a commandeering claim, then we would be going out of our way to decide that question. And so, you know, are you making a commandeering claim?",
  "Well, Mr. Dreeben, why shouldn't the defendant be able to raise that argument? If the defendant prevails on that argument, presumably the statute is invalidated and the conviction is overthrown. So why doesn't the defendant have the appropriate interest to raise that argument?",
  "But that's a merits question. That's not a standing question. Why don't we just say the defendant has standing to raise it, and then he'll lose?",
  "Mr. McAllister, I guess I don't understand why that makes a difference. The Necessary and Proper Clause says \"foregoing powers\" and it says \"other powers.\" This happens to be a case where Congress is acting under the other powers part of the Necessary and Proper Clause, but the question in either event is the extent of the Necessary and Proper Clause and what it allows Congress to do. So in -- in that sense, whether it's a treaty power case or not a treaty power case just doesn't matter. It's all a question of what Congress's scope of authority is under the Necessary and Proper Clause.",
  "Mr. Heft, would you require those kinds of statements in the agreement or in the colloquy in order to satisfy the standard? Suppose those statements just didn't exist.",
  "Mr. Heft, that seems very complicated. You have to look at everything and you're not giving us a lot of guidance as to what you do when you -- when you see these things. I mean, this sort of case-by-case, all-things-considered approach just seems as though you're going to get a lot of inconsistent decisions.",
  "Well, I suppose -­",
  "Defining \"legal consequence\" is your test, Mr. Gannon -­",
  "It's not a binding legal consequence post-Booker.",
  "So that's not your test. What is your test instead?",
  "Yes, but is -- is there some other instances in which you would say that something is based on, even though it's not of binding legal consequence?",
  "Well, then I'm back with Justice Scalia, because if it's only of legal consequence, not of binding legal consequence, if it's something that somebody considers rather than something that is determinative, it seems to me the same in the non-plea context and in the plea context.",
  "But I thought you just told me that -- binding -- was not a part of the test anymore.",
  "Mr. Dunnegan, suppose I disagree with you on that, and suppose I think that actual knowledge of a patent or willful blindness as to whether a patent exists is the right standard. Could a reasonable jury have found that in this case?",
  "A reasonable jury couldn't have looked at the facts that Justice Ginsburg suggested -- you know, you do not tell the lawyer that you, in fact, have copied the product and say that's -­ a reasonable jury -- that's willful blindness.",
  "Mr. Dunnegan, could I take you to the standard? Because in Aro II we said that the appropriate standard in subsection (c) was actual knowledge. Why shouldn't we just say it's the same? Whether it is (b) or (c), these are just two means of -­ of doing a contributory infringement, and the knowledge/willful blindness standard, once we've said it applies to (c), it applies to (b) as well?",
  "No, (b) and (c) have different standards as to -- not the knowledge of the patent but -- but what the person is -- the acts that constitute infringement. But that's a different thing from whether they should have different standards as to the knowledge of the patent.",
  "But, Mr. Dunnegan, in Grokster, there was no question as to whether they knew that the -- that the things were copyrighted.",
  "So why is Grokster relevant here? They conceded the ve ry thing that we're arguing over.",
  "So would you have any objection to an actual knowledge willful blindness standard? Would that be all right with you?",
  "I take it that we would do that on the basis of Aro II? We would just say that's the standard for (c) and that should be the statement for (b)?",
  "Well, 271(c) includes the word knowing, you have to know that an item has no noninfringing uses. That is a different kind of knowledge than the knowledge that we are talking about here.",
  "And because of the infringement, but not necessarily that there was a patent, not necessarily the legal effect as opposed to the act.",
  "Why aren't you both wrong, that Grokster didn't deal with the question that we are dealing with, which was knowledge of a patent or knowledge of a copyright, that Grokster dealt with whether there was specific intent or whether there needed to be specific intent to encourage infringing acts. That is what Grokster was about, an entirely separate question.",
  "Do those policies ever distinguish between Federally funded projects and Non-Federally funded projects?",
  "Mr. Stewart, could I ask you just a factual question? When the Federal Government contracts with universities or other nonprofits, does it require those universities to get assignments from their employees? And if so, how?",
  "So why doesn't the Federal Government just require assignments from employees to the university?",
  "Mr. Stewart, do you know, is this a Stanford-specific problem or is it a more general problem? In other words, are there many universities that have agreements like Stanford's that would be subject to the Federal Circuit's ruling? Or is this just an example of one university that unfortunately has a bad agreement?",
  "Do you have an explanation, Mr. Fleming, of why it is that Congress left such a big problem off the table?",
  "In other words, clearly Congress was thinking about how to protect the government's interests with respect to these patents, and to say, well, we have these interests with respect to patents that the university owns, but we don't have those same interests with respect to patents that the individual researcher owns, just seems bizarre.",
  "Mr. Pincus, if -- if I understand your interpretation correctly, it would exclude freebase. How is that a sensible interpretation of the statute, one that would exclude freebase, a commonly known substance? Congress was aware of it. The Richard Pryor incident had occurred. Everybody knew it was dangerous. Wasn't it at least true that Congress meant to incorporate that substance as well?",
  "That means prepared from the powder, in theory -­",
  "-- is that right?",
  "Would it be enough for you if it had the right chemical definition and it was a rock-like substance, just those two things? Would that be enough? If the government could show it has the right chemical definition, it's rock-like, it's solid, does it have to show anything else?",
  "I'm asking the same kind of question that Justice Alito is asking, whether the government has to show anything particular to demonstrate that it was prepared from powder cocaine.",
  "It's a bizarre term, Ms. Saharsky. It's -- I mean, cocaine base means the same exact same thing as cocaine, because cocaine is a base. It's like referring to an apple by saying \"apple fruit\" or referring to a poodle by saying \"poodle dog.\" I mean, it's a strange way to speak about it.",
  "It's a strange way to be extra clear, to -- to use a different phrase that's meant to mean the same thing as another phrase. To use two different phrases that are meant to mean the same thing is not a very good way of being clear.",
  "But they don't need to do that, Ms. Saharsky. Suppose we just said it needs the right chemical definition, and it's rock-like, rock-like, crystalline, whatever you want to call it. So it's rock-like. It's not a paste; it's not a leaf; it's a rock.",
  "But this is -- but this is, Ms. Saharsky, just a strange statute, where you are -­ your definition creates all kinds of issues about why it is that Congress used two different phrases to mean the same thing, and then how it is that if they did use two different phrases to mean the same thing, you're effectively reading cocaine out of the statute in Romanette (ii), right?",
  "Well, but no, cocaine is the same as cocaine base. So it's like saying -- it's like saying apples, oranges, and bananas cost one dollar; aforesaid apples cost three dollars. That's a strange way to write a statute.",
  "But why would it say apples cost one dollar in Romanette (ii) if it was going to say apples cost three dollars in Romanette (iii)?",
  "General Kroger, I don't think that the question here is really a standing question; it's really whether there is a controversy between this particular plaintiff and this particular defendant such that a judgment in this case would actually affect the legal relationship between the two, between the particular plaintiff and the particular defendant. So how would it do that? How would a legal judgment in this case affect the legal relationship between this plaintiff and this defendant?",
  "Ms. Kruger, how does this -­ this situation, the qualified immunity situation, differ from a wide variety of other situations in which we might not be able to get to the underlying constitutional ruling? For example, in any case where there's a constitutional ruling but also a harmless error ruling, or in a Sixth Amendment case where there are standards about ineffective assistance of counsel but then a finding that there's no prejudice. In all of those kinds of cases, the underlying substantive ruling might be insulated from our review. How would you say that the qualified immunity situation is different and how would you be able to cabin this rule?",
  "But, presumably, in every case -­",
  "Excuse me. Presumably, in every case in which a court does these paired rulings, if you will -- it doesn't just say that the error was harmless, but says that there was an error -- there's a purpose to clarify the law. How is this different, once again?",
  "But then we wouldn't have a case.",
  "Is that against a different party, Ms. Kubitschek?",
  "But, General, I take it that that problem disappears -- tell me if I'm wrong -- if we find there's no jurisdiction. If we Munsingwear this case, the decision is wiped off the case, you return to status quo ante, and you tell all your people that they can do what they would have done beforehand; is that right?",
  "Well, what are the other -­",
  "Mr. Kerr, let's say I'm concerned about the kinds of issues that you're raise, the incentives on defense counsel and also the oddity of the Court deciding a case in which it's absolutely not possible to grant a remedy. Wouldn't the solution to that be not the rule that you are advocating, but instead a much more limited rule which said that in that case the exclusionary rule applied, but not in any other case, not in any case on direct appeal?",
  "I guess, Mr. Kerr, I'm not sure that that's right. Justice Harlan was talking about constitutional rights at a period where, as the Chief Justice said, the exclusionary rule was viewed as part of the constitutional right. But if this Court doesn't view the exclusionary rule that way any more, if it views the exclusionary rule as simply a prophylactic rule which gives a particular defendant a windfall in order to gain systemic effects, systemic benefits, why would we do it any more broadly than we would need to do it? And we would just say: Look, we understand your point that this would very much change the incentives for defense counsel. We understand your point that it's kind of, I don't know, maybe inconsistent with Article III to take a case in which there was absolutely no chance of relief being granted, but we can deal with those issues simply by saying that in your case you get relief, but not in any other.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, do you think that if a lawyer did that, if a lawyer filed a cert petition and said you should overturn the following Fourth Amendment precedent, and that was all that was in the cert petition, would we be able to grant that cert petition knowing that there was no possibility of relief for that petitioner?",
  "But you think that we would have appropriate Article III authority to decide that question without any hope of relief?",
  "Ms. Schwarz, suppose -­",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Ms. Schwarz, suppose the police arrest the guy, find out who he is, don't -- stop the guy, find out who he is, don't arrest him, but then now they know that this is the kind of guy who drives without a license. And so they go to his house the next day and they see him getting back in the car. Could they arrest him then?",
  "So the re-offense -- the re-offense just cuts off the original taint?",
  "Because you could say that if he got back in the car right after the stop, if the police for some reason did not impound the car and he got back in the car, that's another offense, and so by your theory, then they could properly arrest him and use all of this knowledge in a prosecution?",
  "So, Ms. Halligan, suppose -­ you're suggesting there should be an exception for knowledge of identity. Suppose there were a clearly illegal search and the government is looking for a head of some kind of criminal syndicate and knows this only by an alias, all right; and -- and finds out as a result of this illegal search -- pick your -- pick your alias, you know, John Smith -- finds out, you know -- finds out that this person whose house they're searching is John Smith, is the head of this criminal syndicate. Can the government then use that knowledge of identity, knowledge that this person goes under this alias, in order to build a case around this guy?",
  "No, they find out this person's alias as the result of the illegal search, and that allows them to build a substantial criminal case.",
  "So there's a diary, and it says: I am John Smith. That's Keyser Soze.",
  "I am Keyser Soze. That would not be suppressible?",
  "I think that that's not right, Ms. Halligan, because the search is the poisonous tree. Now, it might be that the name can't be suppressed, but it still might be that everything that's discovered as a result of knowing the name, which would never be discovered unless the search had taken place, could be suppressible.",
  "Why does it -­",
  "Your government records argument, is it limited to New York City records or does it also apply to FBI records, to records of other cities and states which, presumably, would be available on a reciprocal basis?",
  "How about private databases that are going to be available to the government upon request?",
  "Mr. Shah, how would you think about this problem? Suppose the police start stopping people and rather than asking for your name, they take a blood sample, they prick your finger, and then they take that blood and they look in their very extensive DNA databases, and they discover, oh, this is a guy who, you know, did these various terrible things, and start building cases. Would that be all right?",
  "Mr. Ortiz, can I try a hypothetical on you? Suppose that there is a city employee and unrelated to the fact that he is a city employee the government takes some part of his property without just compensation. And he sues the government, and the government says, somebody says, his employer, that his supervisor said: Do you know what he's just done? He's just sued the city; I think we should fire him. And he brings a retaliation claim. Is that protected under the Petition Clause?",
  "Really? What has he done that's protected under the Free Speech Clause? He has brought a suit saying: I'm entitled to just compensation. It seems to me -- the reason I ask is because this seems to me a purely private matter which would not get protection under your test.",
  "I see, so that goes back to Justice Scala's difference test, which is it's not a matter of public concern versus private concern, but it's a matter of employment-related versus not employment-related, correct? Is that correct?",
  "Mr. Palmore -- I'm sorry.",
  "Suppose a State legislature passes a law depriving all State employees of collective bargaining rights, and a State employee files a lawsuit saying that this law violates the State constitution, and the State employee is thereupon fired. Is that a matter of public concern or not?",
  "And suppose -- now going back to Justice Sotomayor's example, suppose that there were a -- a class action alleging systemic discrimination in some governmental workplace. Would that be a matter of public concern?",
  "Mr. Palmore, on that matter, one last hypothetical. Suppose the New York City council passed a resolution that said a precinct house would be closed all night long from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., and the chief of -- of that precinct filed suit saying that this was micromanagement and it was going to affect the public safety of the citizenry, and then that chief of police was fired. Is that a matter of public concern?",
  "Well, Mr. Schnapper, can I ask Justice Kennedy's question in maybe a little bit of a different way? In -- in the Connick inquiry, you have a threshold inquiry and then you have a balancing test. Now, you're suggesting that the threshold inquiry, the public concern inquiry, is kind of apples and oranges here; it's just not appropriate for the Petition Clause. But the question that then follows is, should there be a replacement threshold inquiry before you get to the balancing that Connick suggests is the second stage of the process?",
  "Mr. Schnapper, isn't the real question in these cases whether the employee is acting as a citizen or instead whether the employee is acting as an employee? And in the speech cases, that distinction suggests a public concern threshold inquiry. Maybe in the petition cases it suggests something else, but that that's really the question we should be asking is, is this employee acting as an employee or as a citizen?",
  "And Mr. Rosenkranz, in this case what's your understanding of the approximate percentage of time that was spent on the Federal issues that Justice Ginsburg was talking about?",
  "So there was no significant motions practice on these issues? There was no particular discovery on issues of State action and so forth?",
  "Mr. Stancil, can I get you to just think about a hypothetical with me? There's a plaintiff and he files a suit and it has a State claim and a Federal claim; and the Federal claim is a really bad claim, it's frivolous; and it eventually gets tossed out, and it's -- it's labeled frivolous. But the State claim is a really good claim and it wins, all right? The plaintiff has requested $100,000 and the plaintiff gets $100,000 because he's won on the State claim. Now, here are the legal fees. The legal fees are 20 percent was incurred solely for the State claim, 20 percent was incurred solely for the Federal claim, and 60 percent was incurred in both because there were overlapping issues and it's just impossible to tear them apart.",
  "What are the fees in that case according to you?",
  "Okay. So -- but -- so in other words, you're saying he gets all the work, the defendant gets the work done on the Federal claim notwithstanding that the plaintiff has gotten his entire relief; is that right?",
  "All the work that is -­",
  "Even though the plaintiff has, from the plaintiff's view has completely won the lawsuit.",
  "Go -­",
  "No. Go ahead.",
  "And -- and -- okay, go ahead, I'm sorry.",
  "So but on that theory, the -- the plaintiff would be paying the defendant's fees for work done where the plaintiff won.",
  "Well, what percentage of the work done has actually been useful to you in defending the State court claims, approximate?",
  "Do we need either imaginative powers or empirical data to know that when a 13-year-old is brought into a room in his school, taken out of class, four people are there, two are police officers, one is assistant principal, threatened with custody, that that person is not going to feel free to take off and leave?",
  "General Cooper, I'm not sure how I understand or that I understand how this would be turning Miranda upside down. Miranda is already an incredibly complicated test about when those warnings need to be given, all right. So there are all manner of circumstances which go into the determination of whether a person would feel free to learn -- leave, whether a person would feel as though he were in custody, a thousand things, how many people are in the room, how long the interrogation is, where the interrogation is, the particular circumstances of the interrogation. So, this is not a bright line test, and all that we would be doing here would be adding an additional objective factor to an already multifaceted inquiry.",
  "Counsel, do you agree with the solicitor general's view that a blind person should be treated as a blind person for -- for these purposes?",
  "And a deaf person should be treated as a deaf person for these purposes?",
  "As is youth. As is youth, an obvious external circumstance that this boy was 13 years old.",
  "You know, I don't agree with that. You are trying to understand this situation as the blind person would have seen it or as the deaf person would have seen it or as the 13-year-old would have seen it, and I don't understand why it's different.",
  "But that's all we're doing with the young person. And in fact, most of us, many of us, have a great deal more experience understanding the world through the eyes of a young person or children, perhaps, than understanding the eyes -- the world through the eyes of a severely sensory deprived person. We're asking the exact same thing in both contexts: What is this person -- what is this -- what do the objective circumstances appear to a person in this situation?",
  "Mr. Feigin -­",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Do you think that a 00 a person with Down's syndrome, that that should be taken into account in this inquiry?",
  "Mr. Waxman -­",
  "-- suppose the Court thinks that -- suppose the Court looks at this record and thinks this is a broken system and a violation of due process, but requiring a counsel in every case may go too far, and there may, in fact, be alternate procedures that a State could adopt that would comply with due process. And I know that this is not your submission; it's, instead, the solicitor general's submission. But if pressed on that point, what procedures do you think would be capable of giving a person in this situation a fair shake at this?",
  "Ms. Kruger, you say that the procedures here were inadequate but that counsel in every case is not necessarily required. You say alternate procedures can provide people in this situation with a fair shake. But then, when you look at the procedures that you actually say would comply with due process, they are remarkably anemic. Basically, you say that a form has to be provided. You don't require that there be anybody attached to the court, the kind of person that Justice Powell might have been talking about in Vitek, some kind of caseworker to assist the person with whatever questions he might have about the form or about how to fill it out. You don't require that the court make any findings. You don't require that the court even ask any questions. Apparently, your idea of the procedure is just to give a person a form. Am I reading you right?",
  "Ms. Kruger, could you say a bit more about the question that Mr. Waxman and Justice Scalia were talking about: how often these proceedings have the State on one side, how often they have the custodial parent on one side, you know, whether there is counsel for the opposite side in many of these cases?",
  "Well, we couldn't really tell, could we, Mr. Bibas? Because he completely ignored the question. The entire transcript is less than two pages long. Mr. Turner talked about how he had no money and he was disabled. The court completely ignored him. The court also ignored the questions on the form for the order of contempt about whether he had any money. The court ignored that as well.",
  "But, Mr. Bibas, practically when those forms are used, the person fills out a form, and mostly they're just accepted, aren't they?",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, could you explain to me how it would have made a difference in this case, that instruction?",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, are there any cases like that in the FELA world? You know, I take it that this basic instruction that was given in this case is the instruction that's given in most cases. If you look across the range of cases, do you find jurors awarding damages in the kind of situation that you're talking about? In other words, is this a real-world problem?",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, your instruction actually used the term \"probable cause.\" Are you -- \"proximate cause.\" Are you saying now that that's not necessary, that as long as you say \"reasonable and foreseeable,\" you would be satisfied?",
  "So why use it at all? If you think that \"reasonable\" or \"foreseeable\" are less confusing words, why shouldn't we just tell the jury to use those words instead?",
  "But wasn't the theory different, Mr. Rothfeld? Wasn't the theory that the configuration of the train made the braking and the switching much more difficult for the person in this position?",
  "I'm sorry, Mr. Rothfeld, I didn't understand what you just said, because the requested jury instruction that -- that you gave was any cause which in natural or probable sequence produced the injury. Is that right?",
  "So that's essentially saying that the jury has to say it's 51 percent likely to produce the injury, isn't that right?",
  "Well, it says natural or probable, and probable means more likely than not, which is 51 percent.",
  "Could I try to understand that argument a little bit better, Mr. Maurer? Suppose -- and I know that you think this is not the case, but just bear with the hypothetical. Suppose that there were, in fact, no deterrent effect on your speech or on the speech of any candidate; in other words, that people thought, well, you know, I would rather be -­ have me be the only person who talks, but -- but I would rather talk than be silent, even if it means my opponent can talk, too, so that there's no deterrent effect from this law whatsoever. Would there still be a constitutional objection?",
  "Well, it constitutes a substantial burden, so even if every single person makes a choice, yes, I want to continue to speak, it does not chill any speak -- any speech. I suppose I'm not sure what it means to constitute a substantial burden if, in fact, the law does not chill speech.",
  "But, in fact, there's no such restriction here, is there, Mr. Maurer? There's no restriction at all here; it's more speech all the way around?",
  "Well, doesn't the government actually just give a selective subsidy? It's not a penalty, it's just saying, in order to -- to run an effective public financing system, when you speak, we're going to give a subsidy over a certain amount. So the trigger does not trigger a penalty; it triggers a subsidy.",
  "There is, though, a significant difference between Davis and this case. What the expenditure triggered in Davis was a discriminatory restriction that would never be allowed in and of itself. What the law triggers here is something that, as Justice Ginsburg said, the government could do from the get-go, which is subsidize the speech of a candidate who decides to participate in a public financing system.",
  "But there's no particular as-applied challenge from independent speakers in this lawsuit, is there?",
  "My -- my understanding was that the suit was brought as a facial challenge to the entire law.",
  "But that's interesting, Mr. Maurer, because I don't see all that much of a difference between Justice Alito's hypothetical and the facts here. In other words, you said that Justice Alito's hypothetical would be constitutional, even though under Justice Alito's hypothetical the State is trying to figure out how much money it takes to run a competitive race and giving people who enter the public financing system that amount of money. That's exactly what the State is doing here, but it's doing it in actually a more accurate way. So if Justice Alito's hypothetical is constitutional, why isn't this? They're both trying to do the same thing, which is to put sufficient money in the hands of people who enter the public financing system in order to run a competitive race.",
  "Well, I think, to the contrary, in Justice Alito's hypothetical, just the State is estimating how much a person will spend. Here the State is measuring how much a person will spend. The only difference is that one is more accurate than the other.",
  "I think the purpose of this law is to prevent corruption. That's what the purpose of all public financing systems are.",
  "Well, Mr. Maurer, some people may use certain buzz words and other people don't use those buzz words, but isn't it true that for 40 years what public financing systems have been based upon is the idea that when there is a lot of private money floating around the political system, that candidates and then public office holders get beholden to various people who are giving that money and make actions based on how much they receive from those people, and that's the idea of a public financing system is to try to prevent that?",
  "Mr. Maurer, Davis starts off by saying that if what had been triggered was not an inequitable contribution limit raised but instead both a contribution raised for both candidates, that would have been perfectly appropriate, notwithstanding that that would have put many independent funders to a real choice. The independent funder says, well, I'm not taking any contributions, so that's only going to help my opponent. What's the difference in that case?",
  "Well, as I said, the Davis system that was -- the system that was specifically approved in Davis would disincentivize many people, many independent funders from speaking, would put that person to a choice of the kind that you say that your clients are being put to a choice, the exact same kind of choice.",
  "I don't think that's quite fair, Mr. Boutrous. I think their argument was that the common policy was one of complete subjectivity, was one of using factors that allowed gender discrimination to come into all employment decisions. And in Watson, we suggested that that was a policy, a policy of using subjective factors only, when making employment decisions. That's exactly the policy that was alleged here.",
  "I -- I guess I'm just a little -- a little bit confused as to why excessive subjectivity is not a policy that can be alleged in a Title VII pattern and practice suit or in a Title VII disparate impact suit.",
  "Mr. Boutrous, I think that that suggests that the plaintiffs would have to demonstrate discrimination in every individual case, and that's never been the law. All that the plaintiffs have to demonstrate and, especially at this stage in the proceedings, is that there is a practice, a policy of subjectivity that on the whole results in discrimination against women, not that each one of these women in the class were themselves discriminated against.",
  "I thought your position was that this could not be certified under Rule 23(b)(3), either; is that correct?",
  "But you're not suggesting that they would be precluded on individual discrimination claims, are you?",
  "Mr. Sellers, could I take you back to the remedial question here -­",
  "-- and when you think it is that individualized hearings are required? You've described a kind of formula that you would use. When -­ when -- when is the formula approach right and when is the individual hearings approach right?",
  "Mr. Crawford, what's your standard? Sometimes you say \"certain\"; sometimes you say \"likely\"; sometimes you say \"plausible.\" Which -­ which is your standard?",
  "Mr. Crawford, do you think this is right, that the statute says that the person has to prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer? The statute also says that the law enforcement officer, in fact, has to be a Federal law enforcement officer, but because of subsection (g), the statute does not require that the person intend the communication to be to a Federal law enforcement officer, and that's what we're struggling over, correct?",
  "And -- and in doing that -­ I mean, I guess my question to you is the same as my question to the Government, which is where any of these standards come from. And I agree that the statute does not provide a lot of guidance, but how does one pick between a realistic likelihood or a possibility or a theoretical possibility or any of those things?",
  "Mr. Crawford, what would happen if you were dealing with a Federal offense that was a distinctly Federal offense, that really didn't have a State counterpart, like hijacking an airplane? Would that itself be sufficient to support a prosecution under this statute?",
  "Is that actually similar to this case? These guys were going to rob a bank, which I take it is mostly prosecuted by Federal officials.",
  "Well, where does that reasonable possibility standard come from, Ms. Harrington?",
  "Ms. Harrington, what would be -- what would happen if instead of Officer Horner, the custodian of the cemetery had come across these people and the exact same thing had happened, would you then say that there would be -- that there would be a prosecution -- there could be a prosecution under this statute?",
  "So is that the difference, that Officer Horner was on his cell phone?",
  "So Ms. Harrington, suppose Officer Horner had come to the scene and instead of seeing evidence that there was a robbery about to occur, had seen evidence only of drug use. Now that might be a Federal offense, but typically it wouldn't be prosecuted in -- in a Federal court. Would you say then that the statute is not satisfied?",
  "Because?",
  "Oh, but that's 4 years later. That was way past the time when this incident occurred.",
  "You're saying the fact that they got this information 4 years later, shared it with law enforcement officers after they knew that a murder had occurred as a result of an incident would be the same kind of inquiry that they would make at that time?",
  "Before the murder?",
  "Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, why should -­",
  "Do you contest, Mr. Lefkowitz, your ability to make that request? I know that you contest your obligation to make that request, but do you think you could go to the FDA and make that request and set a process in motion?",
  "Well, if you could go to the FDA, why shouldn't we look at this suit in this way: That the plaintiffs are bringing a standard failure to warn claim; that you then have a preemption defense, that you'll say it's impossible; and then in order to litigate that preemption defense, the question will be, well, if you had gone to the FDA, what would the FDA have done? Would it in fact have required both brand names and generics to change the label? And if it would have, you would not have had -- been put in an impossible position.",
  "But Mr. Lefkowitz, I think what the Respondents would say is that you are mischaracterizing their complaint and making it into something that it's not. Their complaint is a standard state failure to warn claim. Now, you have a preemption defense to that claim, and in that preemption defense there's going to be questions about your disclosure obligations and whether the FDA would have responded in a certain way to your disclosure obligations, but it's in a fundamentally different posture than the one that you're suggesting.",
  "Well, I agree that you don't have any ability yourself to change the warning, but here's what the FDA has said. The FDA has said if an ANDA applicant -- and that's you; you're an ANDA applicant -- believes new safety information should be added to a product's labeling, presumably because they've gotten information that suggests that the product's labeling is wrong, then it should contact the FDA, and the FDA will determine whether the labeling for the generic and listed drugs should be revised.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, suppose that I'm not sure I agree with you that there is an obligation of the kind that you say for a generic drug manufacturer to come forward and request a label, but I do think that there's an opportunity for that manufacturer to come forward and ask the FDA to revise a label. If that's the way I read the law, does your result follow? Do you think, then, that State law claims should be able to go forward?",
  "Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, if you had asked, you would be in a different situation. If you had asked and the FDA had sat on it or was negotiating, then you could say, look, we've done all we can right now. But you're not in that situation. You, in fact, have not done all you can right now to change the label because you never wrote that letter.",
  "But Justice Cardozo certainly didn't limit his holding in the way you suggest. The language of that opinion is extremely broad. And if you read that opinion, no one would gather from that opinion the kinds of limits that you're suggesting on it.",
  "Well, Mr. Hungar, it seems to me that RCA would matter, even under your view of the world, because if you think that Congress did not codify the existing state of the law as to the standard of proof and you think that Congress -- that -- that section 282 was essentially silent as to the standard of proof, then the question is, what do we do? And one answer to that question is we go with our prior precedent, which is RCA.",
  "Mr. Waxman -­",
  "Isn't there a limited amount of reliance that any patent holder can have, given the re-exam system?",
  "Mr. Roberts, could I take you back to Justice Kennedy's question at the start about the one-way ratchet? What's the government's theory about what Congress might have been thinking when it said you can't think about rehabilitation to sentence or to lengthen a sentence, but you can think about rehabilitation to make a decision not to sentence or to shorten a sentence? What would -- what would have been in Congress's mind?",
  "Counsel, assume -­",
  "Mr. Bibas, I -- I -- I have to say I don't really understand the whole premise of your argument. You're basically saying the judge cannot consider rehabilitation, but the judge can consider educational programs, vocational programs, treatment programs, and so forth. I think most people would think that all of those things are rehabilitation, that there's nothing left over when you say that the judge can consider all of those things.",
  "Yes. Well, I'll ask the same question.",
  "You're saying they can consider rehabilitation in imposing a sentence, they cannot consider rehabilitation in imposing a sentence, but they can consider all these programs in imposing a sentence. And I'm saying what's the difference between all these programs and rehabilitation? Once you say they -- they can consider all these programs, what's left over that they can't consider?",
  "Mr. Bibas, just practically speaking what does this clause instruct a court not to do in your view?",
  "Well, really who thought that? This was 1984. When people talked about rehabilitation, they were talking about drug programs, they were talking about education programs, they were talking about vocation programs. They were not talking about some idea that had passed away long since, that just locking you in a cell was going to rehabilitate you.",
  "Mr. Keisler, the Court did say that, but it's cut off from the Court's actual analysis in the case. When the Court goes through injury and causation and redressability, the Court never refers to the statutory cause of action.",
  "But the Court clearly understood that in Massachusetts v. EPA and said that it was enough, and I would think under traditional standing principles the standing there was actually harder to find because one had to go through the EPA first. One had to say the EPA should regulate, and then the EPA would regulate, and then the question was would that reduce emissions levels? Here the EPA is out of the picture. The action is much more direct.",
  "Is the consequence of that argument, Mr. Keisler, that there in fact is no Federal common law of interstate pollution claims?",
  "But it seems, General Katyal, that there also is no case where we've ever used this language of generalized grievance as a prudential matter rather than as an Article III matter. So am I wrong about that?",
  "But Newdow -- Newdow quoted the language of generalized grievance that came from Warth, but it didn't specifically pin anything on that language.",
  "Well, General Katyal, how about the Aiken case, because in the Aiken case I think the government came in and made the same argument, that even though the injury was concrete, it was too generalized and therefore there should be no standing, the Court specifically rejected that argument both as to Article III and as to prudential standing.",
  "But, General Katyal, suppose that the EPA had decided not to issue the endangerment finding. Would your argument still apply?",
  "But if I insisted you answer the hypothetical I gave you, what would the answer be? No endangerment finding. Is there displacement?",
  "Do you have a position on whether there's anything to be displaced here? Do you have a position on whether there is, in fact, a Federal cause of action?",
  "But I'm sorry, General, because I was understanding your answer differently, and maybe I misheard you, as saying that if there were no legislation here, you doubted that there was a Federal law cause of action. Is that correct?",
  "No, but as to whether the cause of action exists under Federal common law in a case like this, where you said it was so different from the other Federal common law cases that the Court has seen.",
  "General, could I take you back on that last point to another threshold question, which is the political question doctrine? Because a lot of your arguments really sound like prongs two and three from Baker v. Carr, but you say that we shouldn't go there, that we should instead address this matter on prudential standing grounds. But the political question doctrine actually seems more natural, given the kinds of arguments you're making. So why not?",
  "But, General, they're usually facts that are determined by an administrative agency. I mean, even just reading that part of your complaint, it sounds like the paradigmatic thing that administrative agencies do rather than courts.",
  "But if there were no and if there were no, we would be living in a different world. There is an administrative agency and there is a Clean Air Act.",
  "What if the EPA made a judgment, but it just was not the judgment that you liked? Suppose that the EPA said: We've looked at stationary sources; we're not going to regulate. Would that displace?",
  "General, do you think that you have a Federal common law cause of action against anybody in the world? Your briefs talk a lot about how these are the five largest emissions producers, but I saw nothing in your theory to limit it to those five. Is there something that you think limits it to large emissions producers rather than anybody in the world?",
  "But, General, much of your argument depends on this notion that this suit is really like any other pollution suit, but all those other pollution suits that you've been talking about are much more localized affairs. One factory emitting discharge into one stream. They don't involve these kinds of national/international policy issues of the kind that this case does. I mean, there's a huge gap, a chasm between the precedents you have and this case, isn't there?",
  "Mr. Boies, what's the difference then? Why could that be disputed at the certification stage, but not the question of price impact?",
  "Well, how about materiality? Could you rebut materiality at the certification stage?",
  "Well, now I'm a little confused, because the efficient market and materiality are all part of the prima facie case triggering the Basic presumption. So, why couldn't you rebut one part of that case but not another part of that case?",
  "Well, whether there's an efficient market is also common to all members of the class, so why would you make an exception for that?",
  "But, Mr. Sterling, if I think -- if I disagree with you and I think that Oscar said that loss causation needs to be shown at the certification stage, you agree that that is not a correct statement of the law; is that correct?",
  "Mr. Sterling, I wasn't sure what argument you were making in your brief. One possible argument you could be making is that the plaintiffs have to show a price impact. Another possible argument you could be making is that you have to have the opportunity to rebut the plaintiff's use of the Basic presumption by yourself showing that there was no price impact. And you seemed often to be saying the first, even though I would think that the second is the most you can make as a -- as a plausible argument.",
  "Mr. Sterling, maybe this is just to repeat Justice Ginsburg's question, but what else is there? I mean, what would not be proper to introduce in the way that you're talking about at the certification stage?",
  "The Fifth Circuit suggested that scienter could come in at the -- at the certification stage. You're disclaiming that?",
  "On your rebuttal proof point, you said just now that all you had to do was come forward with some evidence, but that the burden remains on the plaintiff. Is that -- what kind of evidence do you think you have to come forward with in order to flip the burden back to the plaintiff?",
  "So you're saying you can put an expert on the stand and the expert will say there was no price impact, and then the plaintiffs have to make the case that there, in fact, was a -- a price impact at the certification stage, that the plaintiffs have to prove that by a preponderance?",
  "Once you put a expert on the -- on the stand.",
  "Well, that does suggest that the Basic presumption isn't worth much in your world. That you put an expert on the stand, and the Basic presumption falls away, and the plaintiffs have to actually prove their case at that very early stage that there was no price impact.",
  "Mr. Gordon, there are other provisions in ACCA which seem to use the present tense in circumstances where it doesn't seem as though the statute truly means the present tense. So, a violent felony is one that \"has as an element the use of physical force, is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives;\" and so on and so forth. But we would not look as to -- in interpreting that provision to the present day, would we?",
  "And could you explain how you're going to interpret your statute going forward and apply your statute going forward?",
  "But if this was a general sale provision, then that would include those sales that you're talking about?",
  "How about the pharmacy can't sell it to anybody?",
  "I'm not sure why you should concede even that, Mr. Elwood. If this is just conduct, if this is not proscribable speech of the kind that R.A.V. was talking about, why should we care about the viewpoint based doctrine that's arisen in First Amendment law?",
  "And -- and Mr. Rosenkranz, what about officials in the Executive Branch? When the Secretary of Defense gives a speech and the President doesn't like it and the President fires the Secretary of Defense, does the Secretary of Defense have a First Amendment action?",
  "So all the official acts in the legislature, in the Executive Branch, you're somehow saying courts are different, so I guess we don't have to worry about that, but official acts across the government are now subject to First Amendment analysis?",
  "Well, I don't understand that. I mean, this rule applies to everyone, too. It might apply to one person on one vote and to another person on another vote, but everybody at every vote has to look at these ethical rules and decide whether they have to recuse themselves as a result.",
  "Well, do you think that if there were a statute -- let's take out the vagueness aspect of this. If there were a statute that said you can't vote on anything where you have yourself some monetary gain attached to it or if a very close family member or if a close business associate or campaign manager of your campaign, do you think that would be unconstitutional?",
  "Because the -- the State -­ what the State thinks is that a campaign manager is just like a business partner.",
  "But why do they have to know ex ante? There was an advisory process that was set up by the Nevada commission here.",
  "Mr. Carrigan chose not to use it. But he could have gone to the commission, said: What do you think about this relationship? Does it fit or does it not fit?",
  "I'm not sure I understand that, Mr. Rosenkranz. There are many laws out there that say people who serve in certain government capacities, when they leave those jobs, can't lobby for a certain number of years. How is that any different?",
  "Well, Ms. Schwartz, isn't it the exception because in fact you end-run -- end-ran the administrative process, that you put your regulations, your new rate schedules, into effect even before you submitted them to HHS, and continued them in effect while HHS was considering them, and continued them in effect to the extent that you were allowed to do so by injunction, even after HHS disapproved them?",
  "Well, Ms. Schwartz, the agency --",
  "So, can I go back to the question that Justice Alito asked you about why there's no cause of action? You are asking us to treat the Supremacy Clause differently from every other constitutional provision. Why should we?",
  "The Supremacy Clause is part of the Constitution.",
  "And the Petitioners here -- excuse me. The -- the plaintiffs here essentially said that the Supremacy Clause as part of the Constitution had been violated and sought, not damages, but only a prospective injunction. And the question is, why the court shouldn't do what the court has done many, many, many times before, tens and tens and tens of times before, and say, yes, that's our prerogative and we'll proceed to the merits?",
  "In a -- in a cause of -- in a suit that's brought under a statute directly, a person could be claiming damages. Here that is not the case. A person is only claiming injunctive relief. And that should -- there should be a difference between those two in terms of when the cause of action is available.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, why should this even matter so much whether there's a defense available in a regulation that's brought against a person or not? In your brief, you admit that there are numerous cases that don't fit within that category, where the -- but where the -- where the State has acted in some sense to change the behavior of the person, to regulate the person, even if that person doesn't have a proceeding in which to mount a defense. And we -- this Court has treated those cases in exactly the same way, haven't they?",
  "But, Mr. Kneedler --",
  "Mr. Kneedler, this is what you said in your cert stage brief: You said, \"Those programs in which the drastic measure of withholding all or a major portion of the Federal funding is the only available remedy\" -- and you are talking here about Spending Clause programs, obviously -- \"would be generally less effective than a system that also permits awards of injunctive relief in private actions.\"",
  "Well, can that really be the difference? I mean, do you think if 30(A) were written -- were drafted as a formula, a rate schedule formula, that there would be a cause of action, but because 30(A) is more general in nature, that there is no cause of action? I mean, surely that's a question for the merits of whether there is pre-emption or not.",
  "Is that necessary to your position, Mr. Phillips?",
  "Because you could take the view, right, that if Congress speaks to cut off a claim, that's one thing, and a very different thing, than if Congress has not spoken at all.",
  "So, could I ask --",
  "Mr. Phillips --",
  "Mr. Phillips, could I ask you a little bit more about how this interacts with the agency process? Now, suppose that California had done what, the way I read the statute, it was supposed to do, which is to go to the agency and say: We want to change our rates. We can't afford these rates anymore, and we think these lower rates would do just as well. All right? And then the agency and California sit down and discuss the matter. Would this suit have ever come into being?",
  "You know, they did not impose them unilaterally. They go to the -- to HHS and they wait for HHS to approve what they want to do. If HHS approves --",
  "Well, if -- if HHS approved, maybe somebody does sue. And then there's great deference to the agency --",
  "-- isn't that right?",
  "And if HHS doesn't approve, then what's there to talk about? There's no suit.",
  "So, either way, the agency wins, right?",
  "Well, if the -- I was just saying if the agency didn't approve, your clients don't have anything to complain about.",
  "Correct.",
  "I'm sorry --",
  "-- Ms. Schwartz. Are you saying -- this is the way I understood you, and tell me if I'm right: Are you saying that the test for determining whether there's a 1983 suit is the same as the test for determining whether there is an Ex parte Young action? Because you talked about, you know, whether somebody has a right, which is usually the language we use in the 1983 context.",
  "Ms. Cain, why do you think Congress would have written the statute in this way? I mean, in your brief, you say it was all very complicated and Congress was worried about certain problems, the way different registrations overlapped on each other. But exactly what was so complicated? Why couldn't Congress just have applied the statute to people in Mr. Reynolds's situation itself?",
  "I was going to ask the Government the same question. What are the complications -­",
  "-- that Congress was so worried about?",
  "Well, why is -­",
  "Why is it easier for the Attorney General to do that by regulation than for Congress simply to do it by the statute itself? What did they expect to happen in the regulatory process that would solve these problems for them?",
  "Could you tell me, Ms. Cain -- you may have said this, and I may just have missed it. But under the new regulations, a man who's in the position of your client and who cannot initially register under (b) -- (b) just doesn't fit his circumstances -- does he now have to initially register again, or does his initial registration stick and he just has to update it when he moves?",
  "But then, as I indicated, why would Congress have given you the authority to exempt people? It seems to me that the -- the burden is on you in the exact same way it's on Ms. Cain.",
  "But does that mean, Ms. Sherry, that -- that the Attorney General could, if he wanted to, for whatever reason, could exempt all pre-enactment offenders from SORNA?",
  "And would allow that. So, when you say it gave the Attorney General the ability to confirm or modify the requirement in section (a), you mean he could, if he wanted to, exempt all pre-enactment offenders.",
  "But to confirm -­",
  "But you're suggesting, Ms. Sherry, that (b) and (c) have nothing to do with each other. And, in fact, one can read (a), (b), and (c) as all integrally linked and referring only to post-enactment offenders. So, (a) is the umbrella provision. It says \"a sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current\"; (b) says how you shall register initially; and (c) says how you shall keep that registration current. So, all three of these refer only to post-enactment offenders. And then (d) comes along and says, by the way, the Attorney General can apply all of this to pre-enactment offenders as well and can specify how to do that.",
  "But the question -­",
  "But it would also work against your own interpretation, because your own interpretation allows you to exempt anybody that you want from the statute; isn't that right?",
  "But, Mr. Bartels, before you do that, I mean, I understood you to be saying that you would draw a line after the first postconviction proceeding.",
  "Is that correct?",
  "And the briefs go back and forth as to whether that line -- you know, what lies behind that line. But you would draw the line there?",
  "But I - -",
  "I wonder what you would say -- some of these statistics suggest that these claims succeed very, very rarely. So, by the analysis that you just used, this kind of balancing analysis, why we should even go so far as you would have us go?",
  "Mr. Cattani, could I ask about your interests here? Because your State is one that does appoint counsel; so, you already have the cost there. I'm just wondering -- in your brief, you talk a lot about the excessive costs that this would impose on you. And I'm just wondering where those costs come from if you appoint counsel already. And I know some other States are in a different situation, but as to you, where do the costs come from?",
  "Well, if we just said there is -- you know, we can only draw a line in this context, and we're going to draw the line here, and this is where it sticks. What are the additional costs to you?",
  "Mr. Cattani, have you - -",
  "Mr. Cattani, if you handled this through the regular appeals process, the person would receive the benefit of counsel. Is that correct? Rather than shuttle this over to the postconviction review process?",
  "Yes, exactly right.",
  "Try it this way. Try - -",
  "Well, Massaro, indeed, said that there are good reasons for withdrawing this issue and putting it in a different kind of process. So, suppose the State does this, and some States do it: They say, on -- in the direct appeal process, we're going to remand this issue back to the trial court because the trial court is good with the facts and can make an evaluation. But it is part of the direct appeal process, this -- this remand. Would the person then be entitled to effective assistance of counsel?",
  "Even though now it's part of the regular appeals process? It's just the way the - - because of the issues that we recognized in Massaro, the State has decided to structure things in this way?",
  "So, now you're creating a different rule. You're saying anything which somebody determines is appropriately raised as a collateral attack, even if there's been no first review of that question, there's no entitlement to counsel?",
  "Well, I don't think, as Justice Kennedy said, that we ever really considered that question in Finley and Giarratano because we were assuming there that all the things had been through the appeals process.",
  "Well, the reason I think it's relevant is that if you were to say that there needed to be effective assistance of counsel there, then I would have asked you, what is the difference between this case and that case? So, that's the reason it's relevant to this case, because the difference is really just one of just labels.",
  "Well, but it is the first look - -",
  "-- only look at the effective assistance claims. So, what would you say, Mr. Wall, if a State did the following: If it said we're going to take out all Fourth Amendment exclusion claims, and we're going to put that in a postconviction review system, and, you know what, there you're not entitled to an effective lawyer -- would that be all right?",
  "Well, I'm sure the State would not say it was acting arbitrarily in my example. The State would say there's a good reason for it: Fourth Amendment exclusion claims are disfavored; they have nothing to do with innocence; they involve a kind of fact-intensive inquiry that is better done in a different proceeding. So, I think that the State would have many good reasons, but, you know, it's also true that there you don't get a lawyer.",
  "Well, who says that, Mr. Garre? I mean, is there anything in the record on that point, on the Alabama system generally?",
  "Well, what do we know about Mr. De Leeuw's role, Mr. Garre?",
  "Mr. Garre --",
  "Could we go back to the state of the record? You've said a few times, and your brief does, that the record is skimpy on various important matters. Would you go further and say that the record is irretrievably corrupted, tainted by conflicts of interest?",
  "The notice inquiry is supposed to be a pragmatic one. As far back as Mullane, we've said that the question that we're supposed to ask ourselves is: Is this what somebody would do if they actually wanted to accomplish notice, if they actually wanted the person to get that letter? So, I'm just going to ask you, General, if you were a lawyer in an important litigation and you send off an important letter to two lawyers, your principal adversaries, as well as to a local counsel who you think may not be involved in the substance of the litigation, you don't know for a fact, but you think that there is some substantial likelihood that he's not particularly involved, as local counsel often aren't -- so, you send off this letter and you get it back from the principal attorneys, and you ask yourself: Huh, should I do anything now? What would you say?",
  "But the --",
  "Justice Scalia is right. I'm assuming that a letter disposing of a -- of a ruling in a capital case issued after 18 months when nobody knew that that letter was coming, that that's an important letter for a death row person to get. So, Justice Scalia is right to that effect. So, you get this, and you say, well, you would have. But that's the question that we have to ask about the clerk as well. The clerk -- the question for the clerk is, if he had really wanted the person to get notice, what would he have done?",
  "Mr. Garre, how do we distinguish between abandonment and simply a botched, a very botched, transfer of responsibility within a law firm?",
  "General, when you say that, I took sometimes your brief and the U.S. Government's brief to be saying something more, which is that it's not all the circumstances; it's all the circumstances minus circumstances that are attendant upon normal prison living. So, are you still arguing that, or are you really arguing an all-the-circumstances test?",
  "So, a court can still think -- when it's doing an all-the-circumstances inquiry, it can still factor in something like, you know, it just -- it was going to take him an hour to get back to his cell. That's still something that the court can consider along with everything else. Is that right?",
  "Could I ask you a different sort of question, Ms. Anders? Putting aside what the Sixth Circuit did here, if you look back at the initial State court opinion, do you read the State court -- do you think the State court is fairly read, could the Sixth Circuit have fairly read it, as establishing its own per se rule, which was the per se rule we rejected in Mathis? In other words, that the State supreme court required some kind of nexus between the prison custody and the interrogation?",
  "Well, how is that consistent with the totality of the circumstances test that we've always insisted upon in Miranda cases?",
  "And where do you get this focus on isolation from? I mean, it's never mentioned in Mathis. You said let's go back to Mathis, but that's not a part of Mathis, is it?",
  "Well, do you agree --",
  "Ms. Jacobs, wouldn't it be fair to say -- it seems to be me that Shatzer -- excuse me. Mathis must have found that Mr. Mathis -- the Court in Mathis must have found that Mr. Mathis was in custody. That would be a fair inference for Mathis.",
  "But we have no idea why the Court thought that Mr. Mathis was in custody. That wasn't at issue in the case. The Court doesn't talk about any of the surrounding factual circumstances. There might have been a thousand things we don't know about that led everybody to assume that was -- led everybody to assume that Mr. Mathis was in custody, not the particular things that the Sixth Circuit mentioned.",
  "But we don't know why they thought Mathis was in custody. It just wasn't an issue in the case. Everybody had assumed it.",
  "Is that correct?",
  "Well, does that mean that any religious teacher is a minister under your theory? So, you know, there may be teachers in religious schools who teach religious subjects, not mathematics, but are not ordained or commissioned in any way as ministers. Are they ministers?",
  "Ms. Kruger, if I could just clarify for a second there, because you're now sounding as though you want to draw a sharp line between retaliation claims and substantive discrimination claims, and I didn't get that from your brief. So, is that, in fact, what you're saying?",
  "So, are you willing to accept the ministerial exception for substantive discrimination claims, just not for retaliation claims?",
  "Do you believe, Ms. Kruger, that a church has a right that's grounded in the Free Exercise Clause and/or the Establishment Clause to institutional autonomy with respect to its employees?",
  "So, this is to go back to Justice Scalia's question, because I too find that amazing, that you think that the Free -- neither the Free Exercise Clause nor the Establishment Clause has anything to say about a church's relationship with its own employees.",
  "Mr. Dellinger?",
  "Could you assume for - -",
  "I'm sorry. Could you assume for me that -- is it - -",
  "I feel like I missed something.",
  "Mr. Dellinger, could you assume for me that there is a ministerial exception that's founded in the Religion Clauses, and tell me who counts as a minister, and why this commissioned minister does not count as a minister?",
  "I'm just asking you to assume with me for a moment that there is a categorical exception and to tell me who you think counts as a minister, and why the woman in this case does not.",
  "Mr. Laycock, Mr. Dellinger has some -- some points here about the way in which the ministerial exception relates or doesn't relate to Employment Division v. Smith. And it seems to me that in order to make an argument for the ministerial exception, you in some sense have to say that institutional autonomy is different from individual conscience, that we've said in Smith that state interests can trump individual conscience. And you want us to say that they can't trump institutional autonomy. So, why is that?",
  "Mr. Clement, just to follow up on the Chief Justice's question, if there's a helicopter crash in the water, let's say it occurs 2.5 miles from the shore, is that covered? And, similarly, would it be covered if it occurred 3.5 miles from the shore?",
  "But Mr. - -",
  "But, Mr. Clement, you are asking us to just ignore six words in this statute, right? You read the statute as any injury occurring on the outer continental shelf, when in fact the statute says \"any injury occurring as the result of operations conducted on the outer continental shelf.\" And you give a variety of arguments in your brief about what those six words are supposed to do. They're supposed to cover latent injuries. They're supposed to make sure that the statute only covers things that happen in the scope of your employment. But your friends come back and say the statute did all those things anyway. These six words would serve no function under your theory.",
  "But this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question. She asked you how many accountants are there on the shelf? One can't really imagine that Congress is writing this -- this statute, and drafting those six words in order to make sure that an accountant who goes out to the outer continental shelf isn't covered.",
  "Mr. Palmore - -",
  "Mr. Palmore, you're asking us to look at the relationship between the employment and the shelf activities, and the statute asks us to look at the relationship between the injury and the shelf activities. And those may be two different things and seemingly are two different things in the hypothetical that Justice Alito gave you.",
  "The backup positions may be better than the primary positions in this case, you know?",
  "So, suppose, Mr. Frederick, that we find that we can't find your status test in the language of the statute and that what this statute seems to give us is, instead, a causal test and that the cause is whether operations on the outer continental shelf caused the injury in question. So, what's your best argument for how operations on the shelf caused the injury in this case?",
  "Well, he doesn't --",
  "Well, how do you square your argument with Pinholster? Because I thought that what we said in Pinholster just last year is no Monday morning quarterback. We put ourselves in the position of the court at the time. We look at what the court looked at. We know what the court knew, and we make a decision on that ground. And it seems to me that your argument just runs smack into that holding.",
  "Well, I understand how there can be a distinction between facts and law for many purposes, but Pinholster rested on a view of the statute, which was basically the view that Justice Alito gave you, which said everything in this statute is framed in the past tense. What the statute is getting at is -- is the decision at the time the State court made it.",
  "I don't understand --",
  "-- that, Mr. Fisher, because you want to do this in Federal habeas, where there's no right to counsel either. So, what difference does it make?",
  "And if it was the case that Congress supplanted Teague to the extent that you said it did, why is it, as Mr. Fisher says, that it took States upwards of 10 years to figure this out?",
  "Suppose it said something different, Mr. McConnell. Suppose the disclosure provision didn't exist at all, but that instead of that liability provision, you had a provision that simply said: Any person injured by a violation of this Act will have a right of action or will have a right to sue under this statute. And then you had the waiver provision that you have in this statute. Is that enough?",
  "Mr. McConnell, the cases that you cite in support of your position rest on a distinction between procedural rights and substantive rights, which you invoke here. But where does that distinction itself come from? Because it seems very atextual in nature, that distinction, which does appear in the cases. But when Congress talks about rights, why should we think of rights as limited to substantive rights rather than also procedural rights?",
  "You know, except if Congress indicates otherwise and - -",
  "And I guess that the problem here is that there is this language in this disclosure provision which is meant, you know, truly to inform consumers about -- about their rights and about where they're going to end up resolving their disputes, and it says \"you have a right to sue.\" And you're asking us essentially to read that language as: You have a right to bring a claim in court, but it's probably going to end up in arbitration because of the nature of your form contract. And that seems a very different kind of statement to consumers.",
  "Well, Mr. Nelson, but your friend Mr. McConnell says quite rightly that the rules in this area have been fairly clear, that Congress knew it had to make especially clear that it wanted to void arbitration agreements. So, if that's the case, why didn't Congress do what it has done in a thousand other statutes -- or maybe that's an overstatement -- but a number of other statutes, which is to say so?",
  "Do you know, Mr. Nelson, whether this statute is unique in this sense: Do you know of any other statute that arguably voids arbitration agreements without saying that they're voiding -- that it's voiding an arbitration agreement?",
  "Mr. Nelson, you just said if the liability section said you have a right to sue, that's okay, but if it says you have a cause of action, that's not okay. But the right to sue is really just a colloquial way of expressing the first. So, why should we draw the line between those two things?",
  "Mr. -­",
  "Please finish.",
  "You cite some cases. You say there was a dramatic change in the law. The Government cites some cases, and it says there was no change in the law. What if the truth lies someplace in the middle? What if, in fact, when you look before Blake, what you see is some amount of confusion? That the board sometimes was following the Blake rule, but that at other times individual judges or maybe the board itself were doing something different, because the individual circumstances suggested that they should, or just because they weren't so clear on the difference between these two approaches. And then Blake comes along, and what Blake does is neither to change something dramatically nor to just reaffirm what was there, but in some sense to create a little bit of order out of chaos. What would that do to your argument if that's the way one understood Blake?",
  "Mr. Fleming, the Government says that it has an interest in treating people in deportation proceedings less favorably, if you will, than people in exclusion proceedings. Do you dispute that broad premise that the government could develop a system which treated those two groups differently?",
  "The Government says that's not the case. The Government says that it does not treat those two groups differently.",
  "Do you have evidence to the contrary?",
  "But, Mr. Gannon, suppose this: Suppose that on the exclusion side, you have this category of crimes of moral turpitude, and suppose on the deportation side, which I think is right, you have a category called crimes of violence, and you also have a category called crimes of moral turpitude. There's a time limit on that.",
  "That's right. Suppose that you -- the government could have slotted manslaughter into either of those categories on the deportation side. And I understand that there's a dispute about whether it could have, but let's suppose it could have. So, if manslaughter is categorized on the deportation side as a crime of violence, you say it doesn't match with the category on the exclusion side. But if the same crime is categorized in a different way by the government, then it does match on the exclusion side. So, what sense does that make? The government's decision about how to categorize a given offense on the deportation side is going to determine whether a person gets relief.",
  "The Petitioner just says -­",
  "The Petitioner just says we look to manslaughter, and we ask whether that qualifies a person for relief on the exclusion side -­",
  "But you're saying, no, first, we have to put manslaughter in a category on the deportation side, and then we have to match that to the category on the exclusion side. And what I'm asking you is kind of what sense does that make? Doesn't everything depend on which category you put manslaughter into?",
  "You are so far from the statute, Mr. Gannon, you can't even tell what's closer to the statute. I mean, you are miles away from the statute.",
  "But this isn't a question about the history, Mr. Gannon. Even if we assume that you are right about the history, this is a question about whether this is an arbitrary system, and where you're devising it from and what lies behind it.",
  "You said, Mr. Gannon, the government no longer treats people differently depending on whether they've left the country and returned or haven't left at all. Mr. Fleming points out that you said the opposite in your brief opposing cert. He said that -­",
  "Mr. Goldstein, there, of course, were guards there who were watching the visits. And, as I understand that case, there was really no empirical evidence that smuggling came about as a result of these visits.",
  "Mr. Phillips, if I could understand your position, you think that there's no reasonable suspicion even for that more intrusive body cavity search; is that right?",
  "And does it matter to you whether the person is being introduced into the general prison population, or would you also say that if the person is not being introduced into the general prison population? Do you still think that there's no reasonable suspicion requirement?",
  "And, Mr. Phillips -­",
  "The one significant difference between Bell and this case is that in Bell, there was a real opportunity for people to plan, to conspire together to bring in contraband. Here, you're talking about somebody who's arrested on the spot, there's no opportunity for planning, for conspiracy with respect to contraband, is there?",
  "Could I -- can I stop you on the first? You say mere outcome is not enough, reliability of the proceedings. How does that fit with Kimmelman, where we said it, the right to effective assistance, does attach to suppression hearings, obviously where evidence would not make the proceedings more reliable?",
  "Well, I thought that the second part of the test asked about harm. And here the person is sitting in prison for three times as long as he would have been sitting in prison had he had effective assistance of counsel at the plea bargaining stage. So, why doesn't that just meet the requirements of Strickland, both deficiency and prejudice?",
  "Sounds like a good argument.",
  "And outcome -- there is a different outcome here. He's sitting in prison for three times as long. That's a different outcome.",
  "Well, take the sentencing cases. The sentencing cases, the determination of guilt is over, and the question is, is this person sitting in jail for 1 day longer because his counsel was ineffective? And if he is, we would find prejudice there. So, why isn't the same thing true here?",
  "Well, I guess I don't understand that answer, because that answer seems to suggest that the -- that the assistance being provided was not ineffective. But here, as Justice Ginsburg notes, you've conceded that the assistance is ineffective. That assistance has led to a much, much, much longer sentence. You know, as opposed to some of the sentencing cases suggest that 24 hours is enough, this is 10 years or something. And, you know, that should be the end of the game, no?",
  "I take it, then, Mr. Bursch, you would have the same answer if the State had never provided counsel at all. So long as -- if the plea negotiations were all done between the prosecutor and the individual defendant, and the -- and the State refused to provide the individual defendant with counsel, but so long as the person in the end decided, oh, I don't like this plea, I'll go to trial, then it's all fine and dandy under the Sixth Amendment?",
  "Mr. Jay, you don't contest that plea bargaining is a critical phase, entitling somebody to a lawyer and to an effective lawyer, do you?",
  "Yes, because we've said that many times; isn't that right?",
  "What we have recognized, right, is that plea bargaining is a critical phase because about 98 percent of the action of the criminal justice system occurs in plea bargaining. And to deprive somebody of a lawyer at that stage of the process, where 98 percent of the action occurs, is inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment. That's what we've said. Isn't that right?",
  "So, it's not a critical phase. It's only a critical phase depending on the outcome of what happens at that phase?",
  "Has -- have you ever seen a critical phase before in our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence where the right to a lawyer depends upon what has -- what happens during that critical phase, where if one outcome results, there is no Sixth Amendment right, but if another outcome results there is?",
  "And most of the circuits follow your rule; isn't that right?",
  "And the floodgates have not opened.",
  "Go ahead.",
  "And perhaps the lack of unanimity on the remedy question is appropriate. I mean, people have been trying to suggest different remedies. But perhaps one way to deal with the remedy question is to recognize that these cases present very different factual circumstances, that there are a lot of variation in them, and to give a substantial amount of discretion to the lower courts to work out what the best remedy is, consistent with that factual variation.",
  "So, Mr. Koster - -",
  "So, I think, Mr. Yang, what Justice Sotomayor was suggesting is that your position does in fact require you to say that if there were no counsel at all in the proceedings, that would be perfectly -- you know, there would not be a constitutional problem with that. Once he pleads guilty, it just wipes away the fact that no counsel has been appointed for him.",
  "So, does that mean, Mr. Yang, a State could set up a system where it says we're going to do all our negotiating with the defendant with no counsel present in the room, but we're going to keep a lawyer on board just in the courtroom to advise him whether he should plead -- you know, what -- you know, to advise him about the plea that he has struck, even though he struck this plea with no counsel in the room, and that would be perfectly okay?",
  "All the negotiations could be uncounseled.",
  "Well, I don't understand how you can say that. It seems - -",
  "You are saying that, because you're saying that in the end, the guilty plea wipes all constitutional error away.",
  "Well, Mr. Yang, there are different kinds of unfairness. One kind of unfairness is when you're badly advised and you, therefore, waive your right to trial when you would have gone. But there's another kind of prejudice, which is, you know, you and 10 other guys are all in the same situation, and those 10 other guys come up with a favorable plea deal because their lawyers are paying attention, and you come up with an unfavorable plea deal because your lawyer has fallen asleep. And to the extent that we have an effective assistance right that means something, that unfairness needs to be addressed by it, doesn't it?",
  "Well, I guess that's the question. Why isn't that the question?",
  "Well, suppose, Mr. Franklin, that there weren't. I mean, I think you have a good case about California law here. But suppose we were in a State where the law was very different from what California's law appears to be, where there was no special duty recognized for jailors and, indeed, where the basic negligence tort was unavailable to inmates because there was a finding of -- a holding of the State supreme court that there was no duty on the part of jailors to inmates. What would happen then?",
  "But is your answer - -",
  "Mr. Franklin - -",
  "-- do you have a theory about why these are brought as Bivens claims? It seems mysterious to me. If you bring it as a negligence claim, you get a lower standard of liability, negligence versus deliberate indifference.",
  "You get vicarious liability. So, I've been trying to puzzle out, why aren't these brought as negligence claims rather than as Bivens claims?",
  "To go back to what I asked before when I hypothesized a State that didn't have adequate remedies, and you said -- well, just to pin down what you said, if there were no adequate remedies, there would be a Bivens action available?",
  "Well, how is a prisoner supposed to satisfy that requirement?",
  "But I think the question, Mr. Franklin, is really just a practical one - -",
  "-- which is how a pro se person sitting in prison is supposed to have access to a doctor who will provide this certificate. And, I mean, maybe there would be means, but I guess I'm asking whether there would be.",
  "What is the theory behind that, Mr. Shah? I mean it's an obvious theory when Congress has provided an alternative remedial system, which is a separation of powers theory. But what's the theory about looking to State law for these kinds of alternative remedies?",
  "Can I ask you the same question that I asked Mr. Franklin? Because it just doesn't make any sense to me. The gravamen of this claim is a medical malpractice claim. Why aren't your State law remedies better? You have vicarious liability, and all you have to prove is negligence. Why wasn't this brought as a State law claim?",
  "Well, that would be false consciousness that we can correct, right?",
  "I mean, if the -- if the true appropriate remedy, and the better remedy from your client's point of view, is a State law action, we should just say bring a State law action.",
  "Could you give me your best example of a State tort rule that would prevent a prisoner from bringing an Eighth Amendment claim?",
  "Your best example of a tort rule from any State that would preclude a -- a valid Eighth Amendment claim.",
  "You have 50 States' worth of tort law to -- as your playground, and I want to know what tort rule would keep a prisoner with a valid Eighth Amendment claim -- would prevent him from recovering?",
  "But do you - -",
  "In a case where the prosecutor is the prime mover, can there ever be a complaining witness? Where the prosecutor is making the decisions, can there ever be a complaining witness?",
  "Could I make sure I understand what you just said, Mr. Pincus? When you said it can't be the testimony alone, is that right, that there have to be other acts exclusive of the testimony that make somebody a complaining witness?",
  "Rely on testimony, but rely on testimony exclusively; do you have any cases that do that?",
  "But, Mr. Jones, you - -",
  "Well, Mr. Jones, could I understand your responses to these questions? Because you said to Justice Scalia the fact that there's been testimony at the grand jury does not, if you will, immunize the person from suit based on other acts. Can you go further? In a suit based on other acts, could the grand jury testimony come in as evidence?",
  "So, all you're saying is that there's absolute immunity for a suit based exclusively on grand jury testimony, and if the suit is based on something else, the grand jury testimony can come in.",
  "But, Mr. Jones, I feel as though now we're just arguing about facts. It seems to me that you have accepted a good deal of Mr. Pincus's case. You've said that you can bring an action against somebody based on acts outside of court, that the grand jury testimony can come in as evidence in that action, and all you're saying is that there's -- there's no way to bring this action in this case because your client didn't in fact do anything.",
  "To me, Mr. Pincus, the oddest thing about your case is the notion of being able to sue the investigator when you can't sue the prosecutor for whom he works. So that even if there is -- are some set of people that you -- that you could sue for actions in the grand jury context, the notion that you can sue an employee of a prosecutor when you can't sue the prosecutor seems an odd rule.",
  "Just to take a kind of nutty example, Ms. Millett, suppose that a judge took a blank piece of paper and typed the words \"certificate of appealability\" on top and issued it. Still jurisdiction to take the appeal?",
  "So, what counts as a certificate of appealability is I guess the question. All you need is those three words, and then you have a certificate of appealability --",
  "-- such that jurisdiction attaches?",
  "Well, Ms. Millett, let's take a look at the text of 2244(d)(1). It says the limitation shall run from the latest of. And then it gives four dates essentially, four sections, each of which produces a date, (A), (B), (C), and (D). And (A) is the one that's concerned here. And (A) says the date on which the judgment becomes final, and then it gives two ways by which a judgment can become final. And the two ways are basically you lose or you quit, right? You lose or you abandon your process. So, I just don't understand your argument, quite honestly, because it seems to me that (A) says the date, a single date, on which the judgment becomes final. When is that going to happen? Well, for some people it's going to happen when they lose, and for other people it's going to happen when they quit.",
  "Right. Two ways for it to become final: They lose or they quit.",
  "There's no suggestion in section (A) that there's ever going to be a conflict between these two ways of a judgment becoming final. There is no suggestion that one is going to have to pick between them. Subsection (A) is most naturally read -- again, it says \"the date\" -- as there's just going to be one date. And some people, the date of finality is going -- you know, it becomes final because they lose. Other people, it becomes final because they quit. But subsection (A) suggests a single date, not two dates which you then have to choose between.",
  "General Mitchell, but you say that (c)(2) is not jurisdictional; is that correct? You say (c)(1) and (c)(3) are, but (c)(2) is not?",
  "And if that's right, why?",
  "But (c)(3) says \"shall indicate\" which specific issues satisfy the showing required by (c)(2). It just seems as if all of these are a little bit of a piece, and, you know, you can stop it at (1) or you can go on to (2) and (3). But it seems to me sort of hard to make the jump here and leave (2) out of it.",
  "Right, but presume, General Mitchell, that he thinks that it does, but he just forgot to write down \"speedy trial.\" And the question is: Why that forgetting to write down \"speedy trial\" should make a difference here given that, as Justice Ginsburg said, in any event the court of appeals couldn't reach it because of the procedural issue that it had to reach first?",
  "Put that to one side.",
  "General, it seems to me that Ms. Millett's best argument is an argument just about the oddity of what would happen if we adopt your construction of the statute, which is that the time begins to run before a habeas petitioner actually can file a State habeas petition, and whether that's so odd as to make this a -- a wrong way to construe the statute.",
  "Ms. - -",
  "Ms. O'Connell, could I just clarify your argument? You disagree with the State of Texas, isn't that right, because you think (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) are all jurisdictional; is that correct?",
  "So, I mean, (c)(2) is -- it appears to make a substantive inquiry jurisdictional, that in any case a court is going to have to make this -- is going to have to ask itself whether a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right has been made, and that would seem to be a very odd thing to do for jurisdictional purposes.",
  "But, in most cases, the Federal question inquiry is just: Look, I'm looking at your complaint. Do you cite a Federal statute? Do you cite a Federal constitutional provision? If so, there's a Federal question in the case. What (c)(2) says is, have you made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right? That's a very different inquiry.",
  "Well, is it a jurisdictional rule that we're -- rule that we're going to presume that it's been satisfied? That's a sort of odd thing to do for jurisdictional rules, right? Jurisdictional rules, we sua sponte have to look at them, and we have to be serious about them.",
  "Then let's go on to (c)(3), because (c)(3) seems to be just a documentation requirement. In other words, let's presume that (c)(2) has been satisfied; there was a substantial showing made; and there is a documentation error and (c) -- under (c)(3). Why should that be jurisdictional? A sort of -- you know, there has been a substantial showing made. There's a documentation error. It's an error that the habeas petitioner has absolutely no control over. Why should we view that as a jurisdictional bar?",
  "I don't understand that, Ms. Millett. I mean, the situation in this case is presented because the Petitioner here didn't seek review in the highest State court. The situation is not presented because the Petitioner did not file a cert petition.",
  "I’m sorry. Let me make sure I understand you. You're saying 99 percent don't file petitions in Texas's highest court?",
  "Because under Federal habeas review, these petitioners are not going to be in good shape, right? They're going to have their claims unexhausted or defaulted.",
  "But just to repeat Justice Scalia's question, once you're not talking about police suggestiveness, once you're talking about suggestiveness that arises from non-State conduct, why should we be focused on suggestiveness as opposed to any other cause of unreliability?",
  "Well, the Court was focusing on police suggestiveness. That's the context of all our cases. Now, you might say, well, look, there's a bigger problem, and the bigger problem is the unreliability of identifications generally, but that doesn't relate to suggestiveness per se.",
  "Suppose that there were some other category of testimony which proved even more unreliable than the category that you're talking about. Let's say that it turned out, study after study after study, that jailhouse informants lie. And so, the testimony of jailhouse informants is likely to be just completely unreliable, to, you know, double as much as eyewitness testimony. Same rule for that?",
  "Okay. Well, now we're talking about -- now we are setting up a standard that applies outside eyewitness testimony. It's just testimony that we find to be -- categories of testimony that we find to be extremely unreliable will be subject to this new due process red flag. Is that right?",
  "No, I understand you have very good empirical evidence which should lead us all to wonder about the reliability of eyewitness testimony. I'm just suggesting that eyewitness testimony is not the only kind of testimony which people can do studies on and find that it's more unreliable than you would think.",
  "Well, it's both, right, General Delaney? I mean, the Court has certainly talked about deterrence, but the Court also has very substantial discussions in all of these opinions about reliability. And from the criminal defendant's point of view, it doesn't really much matter whether the unreliability is caused by police conduct or by something else. So -- so, tell me a little bit why you think the police conduct here -- you know, that has to be there in every case?",
  "I think that that's not right. I mean, the reason we want to deter this conduct is because the conduct results in misidentifications, in unreliable testimony. That's the reason that deterrence is an important goal, is because this conduct leads to unreliable testimony.",
  "Well, I'm not sure you answered Justice Alito's questions about why there should be this difference between these two cases. Now, you might want to say that where police conduct is involved, the chances of an unreliable identification are greater. Or you may want to say something else. But the question is: If we're focused on reliability, why are those two cases any different?",
  "So, do you mean to say, Ms. Saharsky, that there can never be a due process violation from the admission of unreliable evidence? Assuming that the State has not created that evidence, has not produced that evidence, but the State knows that the evidence is unreliable or has a very substantial chance of being so, that that can never be a due process violation?",
  "I'll give you an extreme example. The extreme example is where an identification has been produced by torture, but the torture has been by a non-State actor. Same answer?",
  "Mr. Gannon, do you think that you can commit tax evasion without committing either fraud or deceit, and are there cases that show that?",
  "I mean, I suppose what confuses me is that when somebody is convicted of 7201, they can't -- they're estopped from contesting a civil fraud suit; isn't that right? And it also counts as a crime of moral turpitude, which involves fraud. And all of those things suggest, and I think kind of the cases as a whole suggest, that tax evasion involves fraud.",
  "But Scharton was a very old case which had been distinguished away by many courts. It really has no power in the -- in the -- I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, but - -",
  "I mean, the paradoxical thing about your argument is that, one, it makes us think that Congress was just being hypervigilant about this problem of making sure that tax evasion offenses were covered, even though tax evasion offenses almost always do involve fraud or deceit, but Congress was thinking about these hypothetical possibilities that maybe there was going to be some conviction out there that would not involve fraud or deceit, and so Congress is being super-careful about this; and yet, at the same time, that Congress is being utterly careless, utterly clueless about the basic rule of statutory construction which is that one does not write superfluous language.",
  "So, our rule of statutory construction when it comes to this aggravated felony statute is that superfluity doesn't matter?",
  "Could I make sure, Mr. Gannon, that I understand your argument about superfluity? Because when I asked whether (M) -- the second provision was superfluous, you pointed me to these evasion-of-payment cases. And you cite two of them. But then you say even those cases will almost invariably involve some affirmative acts of fraud. So, are there, in fact, any cases, evasion of payment or otherwise, which do not involve some affirmative acts of fraud?",
  "As a factual matter, are there any?",
  "And that's what I'm asking. As a factual matter, can you point me to any cases that do not involve affirmative acts of fraud?",
  "I know, but we have a very active IRS, which prosecutes lots of tax cases, and you're saying that it just never prosecutes tax cases under this section that don't involve affirmative acts of fraud.",
  "And that makes me wonder why Congress was so worried about this problem that it ignored normal rules of statutory interpretation.",
  "But it would have been perfectly easy for Congress to write a provision which said just in case that you -- you know, just in case this decision called Scharton has any effect, we mean tax evasion, too, without writing it in this way that appears to exclude all other tax offenses.",
  "Well, that's just arguing against our application of the normal rule of avoiding superfluity where we can.",
  "Well, Mr. Lewin, what power is Congress exercising here?",
  "Mr. Lewin, this gets back to the question of exactly what congressional power you're basing your argument on. You started by saying you were basing it on Congress's passport power, which is a function of its control over immigration issues. Now you're saying Congress has a co-equal recognition power. Which is it, or is it both?",
  "But it's a passport statute that -­",
  "I'm sorry. It's a passport statute that seems to have nothing to do with the immigration functions that passport statutes usually serve. It seems to have everything to do with Congress's declaration of a foreign policy, as opposed to Congress's exercise of power relating to immigration control. So, convince me that I am wrong on that.",
  "That might be true, Mr. Lewin. I think you would have a better argument if this statute said if you were born in Jerusalem, you can pick anything you want in your passport; you can pick Jerusalem, you can pick Israel, or you can pick Palestine. But the statute in fact doesn't say that. It says you can pick Israel. So, why isn't that a statement of foreign policy as to recognition that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, as opposed to what you're characterizing it as, which is a freedom of -- you know, a sort of choice provision?",
  "Well, you have to be very old to say \"Palestine.\"",
  "Well, suppose this, General Verrilli: Suppose that this statute -- there was the section that's there now, and then there was another section, and the section said: The recording of Israel as a place of birth on a passport shall not constitute recognition of Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem. Would that be constitutional?",
  "No, my statute has a title which says \"Identification of Persons Born in Jerusalem.\"",
  "General Verrilli, is the textual basis for your argument that the President has exclusive power here? Is it the Receipt of Ambassadors Clause alone, or is it something else? Because I was frankly a little bit surprised that your brief put so much weight on that Receipt of Ambassadors Clause, which arguably was meant to give the President a purely ministerial function and so little weight on any other power that the President has.",
  "So, if that provision were not in the Constitution, would you be making the same argument you are now?",
  "Mr. Leckar, I guess I'm not sure I quite understand the argument, because a trespass is accomplished no matter what you put on somebody's car or somebody's overcoat or what have you. You could put a nonworking device in somebody's car, and it would still be a trespass, but surely the same constitutional problem is not raised. So, how do you get from the trespass to the constitutional problem?",
  "But what is the difference really? I'm told -- maybe this is wrong, but I'm told that if somebody goes to London, almost every place that person goes there's a camera taking pictures, so that the police can put together snapshots of where everybody is all the time. So, why is this different from that?",
  "But to ask Justice Alito's question in a different way, suppose that the police could do this without ever committing the trespass. Suppose that in the future all cars are going to have GPS tracking systems, and the police could essentially hack into such a system without committing the trespass. Would the constitutional issue we face be any different?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, that -- that seems too much to me. I mean, if you think about this, and you think about a little robotic device following you around 24 hours a day anyplace you go that's not your home, reporting in all your movements to the police, to investigative authorities, the notion that we don't have an expectation of privacy in that, the notion that we don't think that our privacy interests would be violated by this robotic device, I'm -- I'm not sure how one can say that.",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, just a quick one. Was -- is all the evidence that you're discussing here today -- was that presented to the State postconviction court?",
  "Well, I - -",
  "Ms. Andrieu, if I could go back to Justice Alito's question, was the problem here that the prosecutors never received these statements from the police officers, or did the prosecutors make a determination similar to the kind of argument that you're making today -- make a determination that these statements simply should not be turned over because they are not material?",
  "And is it the view of the prosecutor's office that because those materials were turned over to the judge, assuming that they were turned over to the judge, that that obviates the Brady obligation?",
  "Is that the view of the prosecutor's office?",
  "Ms. Andrieu, did your office ever consider just confessing error in this case?",
  "Did your office ever consider just confessing error in this case? You've had a bunch of time to think about it. You know? We took cert a while ago. I'm just wondering whether you've ever considered confessing error.",
  "What if it weren't? What if it took place at an auction site apart from the slaughterhouse?",
  "Mr. Young, you suggested that even if the Seventh Circuit was correct, there would still be a difference because of ease of identification. You can tell a horse is a horse and keep the horse away from the slaughterhouse. Would it be possible to say the same thing about nonambulatory swine? And I guess my question is, do nonambulatory swine usually become nonambulatory in transit or at the slaughterhouse, or could you identify such swine earlier?",
  "Would it be possible - -",
  "Does that mean that a State could actually pass a law and create a facility, let's say, that says -- the law says the trucks have to stop at the State facility before it gets to the slaughterhouse, and at the State facility, we'll check to see whether there are nonambulatory animals and make sure that those animals don't go on to the slaughterhouse? Would a State be within its rights to do that?",
  "Well, is that true, Ms. Smith? I thought that under the Federal program some of these animals could become meat, that under the Federal program, you take a nonambulatory animal and you say, well, some of them might be condemned, but some of them are suspect, and if they're only suspect, it may be that eventually they'll be turned into meat.",
  "But that's exactly where the California system diverges from the Federal system because under the Federal system you separate the animal out, and then you take a look at it, and then you decide whether that animal can continue to go through the process and eventually become meat, or whether you euthanize it. So, the California system commands an action that the Federal system say may be necessary but may not be.",
  "Where the Federal system has said maybe they should be part of the meat supply system.",
  "So, I suppose what you're saying, Ms. Smith, is that California or any State is entitled to take certain categories of animals outside of the whole process, to exclude certain categories of animals from the whole process and so to exclude them, if you will, from of the scope of this chapter. And much as the Seventh Circuit said a State can simply exclude horses from the scope of this statute, you're saying a State can exclude nonambulatory swine from the scope of this statute. But then you have to, you know, ask yourself the question: Are nonambulatory swine so easily excludable as horses? Why couldn't the State then exclude swine with various kinds of diseases? And then it would be clear that the State was doing something that the Federal statute is supposed to be doing.",
  "But suppose, Ms. Smith, you decided that the Secretary was not doing a good job in terms of inspecting for disease. So, I guess that there's some disease called diamond skin disease which affects a lot of pigs. And you just thought that the inspection standards were far too lenient, and you said, okay, we're not going to allow pigs with diamond skin disease to be slaughtered. Under your theory you could do that, too; isn't that right?",
  "But in fact it requires a parallel inspection system. It's trying to do the exact same thing that the Secretary is trying to do, which is trying to remove animals with a certain kind of disease, and it requires an inspection system of its own.",
  "In my hypothetical case.",
  "And then I think that the cases seem similar to make.",
  "Let me make sure I understand you. Is -- if the Secretary tomorrow decided to issue a regulation saying railroads should no longer use these asbestos-containing brakes because of the hazards in the repair shop, do you think the Secretary could not do that under the statute?",
  "But the Secretary cannot do that under LIA? Is that the idea?",
  "Okay, then I'm a little bit lost. If the Secretary can issue such a regulation under LIA, L-I-A, then isn't it in the scope of regulation, and then isn't it also in the scope of what's pre-empted?",
  "So, on that question, Ms. Harrington, I'm still confused about the scope of your regulatory authority and whether you think you have the capacity to issue rules that are meant to protect repair workers on railway equipment. So, can you issue a rule under the LIA that says no asbestos-containing brakes because we're afraid that these brakes injure the -- the guys in the roundhouse.",
  "But this does seem a very limiting construction. Napier seems to have a broader construction, and if I read some of your history right, you've taken a broader understanding of your regulatory authority in the past. So, why this narrow view?",
  "Well, Mr. Hacker, could you explain to me -- I wasn't sure reading your brief whether you agree or disagree with the Government's point that the agency cannot, under the LIA, issue the kind of rule that I suggested just, you know, saying no asbestos-containing brakes because of the danger that those brakes pose to the repairmen.",
  "Well, how is that? If they are right as to the scope of their authority -- and maybe they're not right, but if they are right about the scope of their authority, why doesn't it follow that these claims would not be field pre-empted; might be conflict pre-empted but would not be field pre-empted because we're no longer in the field?",
  "Mr. Hacker, do you think we would decide Napier the same way if it came to us today?",
  "Mr. Nelson, do you think that there is a clear statement rule that applies when Congress attempts to divest a Federal court of jurisdiction over claims of this kind?",
  "Mr. Nelson, it's an odd provision, this little clause, \"if otherwise permitted by the laws or a court of a State.\" What -- what is your account of that provision and what it's doing here?",
  "And why did Congress want to do that? I mean, you would think -- and this goes back to Justice Breyer's point -- you know, most of these claims, they're small claims, they typically are better situated in a State's small claims court, and yet here Congress says, well, the State doesn't have to entertain these, in which case they could only be brought in Federal court.",
  "Mr. Garre, you don't contest the background rule, do you, which is that when Congress creates a cause of action, there is Federal question jurisdiction unless Congress does something to divest the Federal courts of that jurisdiction?",
  "But if you say, if you don't contest the background principle, then the question is whether Congress has clearly enough divested the Federal courts of jurisdiction over this case essentially by giving jurisdiction to the State courts. And we've had a number of cases going the other way that suggest that you don't divest one court of jurisdiction by giving jurisdiction explicitly to another court. And the question here is why is this any different, and has Congress by granting jurisdiction to one court spoken with the kind of clarity needed to divest the Federal courts of their pre-existing jurisdiction?",
  "But nobody has ever said that Federal question jurisdiction as granted by 1331 is some kind of junior sister when it comes to jurisdiction, is some kind of weaker jurisdictional default provision. I mean, once Congress has granted Federal question jurisdiction by 1331, that's the background rule. The Federal courts have jurisdiction in the same way that the background rule is that the State courts have jurisdiction.",
  "I think, Mr. Garre, what Justice Ginsburg and Justice Alito were suggesting, is that this is a momentous thing for Congress to do to, to deprive the Federal courts of jurisdiction over a cause of action that has been created by Congress and a cause of action that has Federal law as the rule of decision. The usual presumption is that, of course, Federal courts have jurisdiction over those matters under section 1331. And this is one peculiar way of divesting those Federal courts of jurisdiction. Obviously, Congress knew how to write an exclusive jurisdiction statute. It didn't here. So, why should we give Congress the benefit of the doubt and sort of say, well, Congress must have had something else in mind, even though Congress didn't articulate that?",
  "No, I don't think that's right because this is not superfluous, because of the that provision that, you know, the Testa provision which says that State courts don't have to entertain this cause of action. So, in the usual case, State courts would have to entertain this cause of action. Here, Congress is saying, no, if they feel as though that would deluge State courts, they have an out.",
  "But that is not this case.",
  "Nobody thinks that that's this case.",
  "Mr. Garre, do you have any examples of that, places where we've said Congress has divested the court of Federal question jurisdiction and by what means?",
  "And how specific does it have to be? I mean, how vague are we willing to go here and say, okay, Congress has done a good enough job because somehow we have some idea that they wanted these cases to end up in small claims court?",
  "But I guess that's the question, Mr. Garre. If both sides agree it's odd, and all nine Justices agree it's odd, I mean, I think we can say this statute is odd. And the question is, where do we go from there? And where -- you know, what's the default position? If it's odd and we can't figure it out, the default position seems to be Federal courts have jurisdiction over Federal questions.",
  "But, Mr. Panner, I thought --",
  "Mr. Panner --",
  "-- suppose that there were a contract between Mrs. Edwards and Tower and the contract had a no-kickback clause, not one that suggested that Ms. Edwards had to show any kind of injury, greater cost or lesser service, but just you can't have any kickbacks. Can she sue on that contract?",
  "And now suppose that Congress passes a law and says every contract of this kind has to have such a provision in it.",
  "Would she now have standing?",
  "But, Mr. Panner, in response to Justice Scalia's questions and my questions, you are suggesting that there's a difference depending on what the source of the law is. If the source of the right is -- is a contract, there's one result. If the source of the right is a statute, there's another result. And I thought that that was very much -- that is -- that's very much inconsistent with our case law, and specifically with Lujan.",
  "I'm not sure that that's the right understanding of her complaint. She's saying: I don't have to prove those things because there's been a judgment made that -- that these kinds of practices tend to decrease service and tend to increase price, and therefore I don't have to prove those matters. And that's the exact same judgment that's made in the trust cases, for example.",
  "But what takes you out of that background rule in this case? You don't have the two-pronged structure, which really did, as Justice Ginsburg said, drive the analysis when we -- when we talked about those provisions. So, that's not there. So, what takes you out of the default position, which is equitable tolling applies?",
  "On the statute of limitations --",
  "Right. But I guess I'm still not understanding why, if you look at this provision, you would think of this as anything other than an ordinary statute of limitations. What is it about this provision -- or, I don't mean to -- to -- I mean, you can -- you can make structural arguments. But -- but, you know, what factors do you think in this provision makes it a statute of repose?",
  "Well, I could turn the argument around on you. Congress surely knew how to write a statute of repose because it did it in this statute, but it didn't do it with respect to these kinds of violations. This statute of limitations, I'm going to call it, reads very differently from the two-pronged positions that we've interpreted in the past.",
  "Judge Posner, Mr. Landau, has a theory for why it is that fraud is treated differently from the 16(b) offenses, and it's that it's much more important to prevent strategic behavior involving timing in fraud suits -- the stock price goes up, the stock price goes down -- whereas, in these suits, damages are fixed. It doesn't really matter where you bring them. So, it's not nearly as important to set a clear limit.",
  "Well, you have one theory, which -- which deals with culpability; and he has another theory, which deals with strategic behavior. And I don't know how to pick between those two theories, to tell you the truth. The text doesn't suggest which one Congress was thinking about. And that puts me back, and let's look at this provision, and this provision looks like an ordinary vanilla statute of limitations.",
  "Mr. Landau, if we were to agree with you on one or both of those two things, wouldn't the normal course be to remand? And what's your best argument for why we should decide it?",
  "But is that right, Mr. Wall? I mean, don't we usually look when we're thinking about equitable doctrines as whether the defendant has clean hands? You know, whether the defendant is culpable or not seems to matter a good deal when we're thinking about considerations of equity.",
  "But I think Mr. Landau's point -- it was a strong part of his brief, I think -- was that there was no reason why his clients would have thought that they had a disclosure obligation in the first place. So, it wasn't like they were looking at this disclosure obligation and saying we don't feel like it. They were saying we're not covered by it.",
  "But I think you're arguing against the most extreme position. Another position is just, regardless whether there's been a filing, if the person knew or should have known, if a reasonable person would have known, even if there were no filing, that's enough.",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Tilden, is there any other context in which we would extend the statute -- or we have extended or any court has extended a statute of limitations without requiring that the plaintiff be reasonably diligent? Can you point to any other example of that?",
  "But, Ms. Freeman, wouldn't it be fair to say then that the taxes are incurred by the debtor and payable out of the estate? Why would it say \"incurred by the estate\"?",
  "But there's every reason to think, Mr. Shah, that what Congress was worried about here was cases in which the bankruptcy plan would not be approved at all because there were very high capital gains taxes that would result from a sale and that that was the problem that everybody was focused on, was making sure that farmers could take advantage of section 12. So, it's a little bit odd -- it's actually more than a little bit odd. It's a lot odd to read the statute to apply not in that context but only as to people who have somehow managed to sell their property, you know, 18 months before going into bankruptcy.",
  "How does that work, Mr. Shah? Because this was a part of your argument that I have to say sort of tripped me up --",
  "-- because you define \"incurred by the estate\" by reference to those provisions, but those provisions were enacted 2 years and 4 years after the phrase that you are trying to define.",
  "So, it must have been a very prescient Congress.",
  "But you're saying that as of 1978, there was kind of an idea in people's heads about this separate tax entity or at least in some people's heads, but that idea had never been converted into any statutory language. And you're suggesting that we should take this phrase \"incurred by the estate\" and read it as if they were referring to something real that was in a statute.",
  "Can I ask another question --",
  "-- while we are on this? Because the 1398, 1399 would suggest that we're looking to this separate taxable entity, but if I understand correctly, in the corporate context, the IRS actually does not look to that. It looks to just the question of who's filing the tax return. So, if that's the case, aren't you, in that very large bankruptcy context, losing your textual anchor entirely?",
  "But why would that be a problem? You said that there would be a significant ripple effect and practical difficulties. And I understand your argument about 13 shows that you have to do this and why would 13 be necessary if Petitioner were right, but you started out, I thought --",
  "-- by trying to show us that it would be a significant practical problem --",
  "So, it just does automatically for the government what is now done by -- by some kind of government filing?",
  "Mr. Jay?",
  "Can I -- can I take you back to 3584? So, 3584 talks about these two situations, simultaneously imposed terms and undischarged terms, and let's assume that all three sentences talk about only those two situations. The premise of your argument is that, in talking about those two situations, Congress rejected judicial authority when it came to a third situation. And I guess I want to find out from you why that is. I mean, I want to stipulate, I guess, that nobody had this third situation in mind. The third situation is a very uncommon situation. And so, just assume with me that Congress simply just wasn't thinking about this third situation. That's an assumption of the question. What should we do, then? Why would we treat this as exclusive?",
  "Well, let's just say Congress just didn't know. It was not on Congress's radar screen. Why would we treat this as exclusive as to this third situation?",
  "Well, now you're battling my assumption. You're suggesting that Congress must have had this third situation in mind. But I'm saying, no, the third situation is peculiar, and Congress didn't have it in mind. Then what?",
  "Mr. Young --",
  "Mr. Young, the Government says that there are three situations in which this consecutive/concurrent problem comes up. This statute deals with two of them. And the Government wants -- argues that in dealing with two of them, it impliedly stated a rule on the third. What's the best argument -- what's your best argument against that?",
  "Well, I think that that's not right. It seems to me that the first sentence of this statute grants authority to the courts in these two situations. And the second and third say what happens when that authority isn't exercised. The question I'm struggling with -- and it's the same question I put to Mr. Jay -- is why we should think that the grant of authority over situation A and situation B is a denial of authority over situation C? So, what's your best argument?",
  "So, is there evidence one way or the other on that question, whether this situation was in any meaningful sense before the Congress?",
  "But -- but if one had -- you know, what I take as the view of Justice Alito's question is that there was no -- no practice supporting courts sentencing in this way. It -- it just wasn't done. Mostly, it wasn't on anybody's radar screen that this was a significant issue. What would we do then, if we thought Congress didn't speak to it, but we also didn't see a past practice inconsistent with what the Government is suggesting?",
  "Mr. Coates -- I'm sorry.",
  "Mr. Srinivasan, there are two categories of materials here. One is the search for other guns. The other is the search for anything relating to gang membership. If we think that those two categories present different questions, if we think that one is more beyond the bounds than another, that the officer might have qualified immunity for, let's say, the guns but not the evidence of gang membership, what would happen in this case at that point?",
  "Mr. Srinivasan --",
  "I guess the question, Mr. Srinivasan, is, do you think that the current test, that the test as currently formulated, is sufficiently protective of police officers? Or do you think that we need to change the test in order to give police officers the protection they need?",
  "Mr. Wolfson, it seems that many of the arguments on both sides are very fact-dependent in nature, that you're asking what inferences can be drawn reasonably from certain facts, from a particularly violent incident, from the use of a sawed-off shotgun, from the fact that this was not his home, from the fact that he was a gang member. And yet, the cases that you cite to us as suggesting what a reasonable police officer should know really are not cases that involve these facts at all. They're cases that state very broad general propositions about Fourth Amendment law. So, how can you get from those cases to what you're saying a particular police officer in a particular set of circumstances ought to know?",
  "No. But there seems to be a very large gap between what this police officer has to think about and the cases that you cite.",
  "Mr. Hurst, would you agree that Congress did not contemplate this situation? As I understand it, it wasn't until 2003 that the FDA allowed companies to write their own use codes, and that's what creates this problem. So, would you agree that the Congress that passed this Act really couldn't have had this situation in mind?",
  "So, you're suggesting the --",
  "Well, Mr. Horwich, what does that mean exactly, that you represent? I mean, this might be a case where we would give the agency deference, except the agency's name doesn't appear on the brief. So, should we give you any deference?",
  "And it's your understanding that you require companies to state the scope of the patent in the use code, or might you think it's perfectly permissible for a company to write its use code in terms of indications?",
  "So, that -- I'm sorry.",
  "Go ahead.",
  "Was not the regulation issued under this statutory section?",
  "Mr. Perry, so, in your view, patent information is just the patent number and the expiration date, and that's all?",
  "Is that just the patent number and the expiration date?",
  "Well, why would anybody have created this counterclaim to fix the patent number and the expiration date when that can be done by way of a defense to a patent claim?",
  "And so, your argument, Mr. Perry, is not just that the word \"correct\" does no work. Your argument is that the entire provision no long does any work?",
  "But, Mr. Perry, there are also horribles on the other side, of course. I mean, here's -- there's -- there's the statute, and it has three provisions, and two of them are vague, and one of them works against you. One is \"an approved method.\" I think, you know, you both go back and forth about it; it depends on context. One is \"patent information,\" which, you know, maybe you're right, and maybe Mr. Hurst is right. It's not really quite clear what it means to be under subsection (b) or (c). The third is \"correct.\" You basically read \"correct\" out of the statute. So, at best, this is an unclear statute from your point of view. And then there's the question of what it allows you to do. The statute read your way essentially allows you to unilaterally expand your patent in areas in which it's quite clear that your patent ought not to go -- does not go -- but allows you to do that. So, why should we read the statute so that it effects a purpose that's entirely antagonistic to the purpose that Congress had in passing this statute, given that the statute is at best from your perspective ambiguous?",
  "But --",
  "But here's what we know about Congress's intent, and it goes back to the Mylan suit: What we know about Congress's intent is that Congress wanted to give a generic manufacturer in this situation a remedy when there was a completely irrelevant patent. And the question is why we should consider this to be any different. In some respects, this makes -- this is worse from the generic manufacturer's point of view because the generic manufacturer doesn't even have a defense in an infringement suit.",
  "So, why should we think that the Congress that really cared about the result in Mylan does not care about this?",
  "If I understand your answers to some of these questions, you are not at all relying on the fact that the district court had made this decision 2 months earlier. You think that the answer would be the same had the district court not made an inquiry 2 months earlier; is that correct?",
  "So, when is a district court required to engage in some kind of inquiry?",
  "Well, I -- I was again assuming, as Justice Sotomayor was, that if we're in an interest of justice world, if that's the appropriate standard, when is the district -- when does the district court have to make an inquiry, and what kind of inquiry does he have to make?",
  "Well, you're -- I thought that that test was an alternative to the interest of justice standard. I'm positing that the interest of justice standard applies, and you're giving me back those same three factors. Do you think that that's all the interest of justice standard is about?",
  "Is inquiry always --",
  "Mr. Waxman, what --",
  "Mr. Waxman --",
  "And you suggest, Mr. Waxman, that he did not have to make an inquiry in every case; is that right? You're not saying that.",
  "So, what -- when does a person have to make an inquiry?",
  "What in this case required an inquiry on the judge's part?",
  "Well, I guess this goes back to Justice Alito's question, but suppose the judge says to himself, even if the response comes in, yes, relations are terrible because the client wants the lawyers to -- to investigate a particular thing and the lawyers don't want to investigate that thing. The judge knows it doesn't make a difference either way, because he is ready to issue his opinion, and further investigation of this evidence is not going to change his mind as to any material issue. Why should the judge not reject the motion?",
  "Does your argument depend on a notion that the evidence against the defendant was weak? In other words, if there were a great deal of evidence against the defendant, would you be making the same argument, that the judge still had a duty to inquire? Or are you asking us essentially to make a determination that this was an iffy case to begin with?",
  "Mr. Carroll, I -- I'm just trying to figure out -- this out, and I'm -- here's my question: Suppose you had two witnesses, one from -- one who had done the lab analysis on Mr. Williams and one who had done the lab analysis from the victim. And they both testify. And now an expert comes in, and the expert says, I've looked at both reports, and there's a match. Now, there would be no problem at all with that; is that right?",
  "Okay. So, now we only have one of the lab technicians, and we take away the other lab technician. And what you are saying is, well, now we have this expert, and she's saying she could do a match, but the question is a match of what? That's the question, right?",
  "So, why is that a Confrontation Clause issue? Why isn't it just that the prosecutor has failed to prove an element of his case?",
  "Well, is that right? I mean, I thought that the judge here said: No, I'm not taking this for the truth of the matter asserted; I'm only taking your statements about the lab tests as an indication, as -- as the basis for your opinion. So, I'm listening to your opinion. The problem is in this whole case, there has been no factual testimony about what the results were from the swab on the victim. Isn't that right?",
  "Or am I missing something?",
  "How do we know that, Ms. Alvarez? Is there a statement from the finder of fact, who's the trial judge here, that he's understanding her testimony to be not for the truth of the matter asserted? What's the best evidence that that's what the court was thinking?",
  "Suppose the State had not presented evidence of the shipments, so that you didn't even have that. Would -- at that point, should the judge have just thrown out the case?",
  "But I guess what I'm trying to suggest is that if there's no evidence in the case that the -- that the match is to the victim, where is your case?",
  "I suppose the problem is, Mr. Dreeben, that if the -- if the State put up Ms. Lambatos and Ms. Lambatos had to say I did a match -- I was given two reports; there was a match, but I have no idea where this other report came from; you know, it might have been from the victim, but it might not have been; I don't have a clue -- the State would never have put that prosecution on, because the State would have understood that there was no case there. The State is relying on the fact that people will take what Ms. Lambatos says about what she knows about where the report came from as a fact, as the truth of the matter, that in fact this report did come from the victim. And so, the jury can be given instructions saying you can't consider this except for the truth of the matter asserted. But it's a bit of a cheat, no?",
  "Mr. Shapiro --",
  "Is there -- Mr. Shapiro, is there a patent that Prometheus could have written that you think would have met the 101 test?",
  "So, if they had added a treatment protocol, that would have been a completely different case?",
  "And what makes it a completely different case?",
  "Well, I guess I'm not sure I understand that. You said a specific number. But suppose it uses ranges, but it also attaches treatment decisions to those ranges.",
  "So, if the idea --",
  "I guess the question -- the question I'm asking is, in your response to me, is the difference the -- the extent of the ranges, or is the difference that there would be clear treatment decisions attached to those ranges?",
  "But, General, I read you in part as saying don't worry, because if something strikes you as wrong with this patent, we're going to catch it under 102. And I guess I'm not sure why that's true. There was novelty here. There were some doctors who figured out some new things, which was new ranges of effective drug treatment. And so, why do you think you're going to catch this as a 102 matter? If there is a problem here, it seems to me not the fact that there was something new. There was something new. It's that -- it's something else.",
  "But, Mr. Bress, here's what you have not done. What you haven't done is say at a certain number, you should use a certain treatment; at another number, you should use another treatment. So, I guess the first question is, why didn't you file a patent like that? Because that clearly would have been patentable. Everybody agrees with that.",
  "And I think that the difference people are noting or some people are noting is that this is not a treatment protocol. It's not a treatment regimen. All you have done is pointed out a set of facts that exist in the world, that exist in the world, and are claiming protection for something that anybody can try to make use of in any way. And you're saying you have to pay us.",
  "I thought you might not.",
  "And why does that make a difference, Mr. Kneedler? Why do you think that there are separate tests for title than for regulatory authority?",
  "And what about other landowners on the riverbeds? If Montana wins this case, will they be paying rent as well?",
  "Just if I could understand then, you think that this is a one of a kind landowner; there are no other landowners in Montana who are in the situation of PPL?",
  "Does PPL pay rent to the United States?",
  "So, Mr. Schiff, your understanding is that each day your clients are subject to $37,500 of fines for the violation of the statute, and an additional 37.5 for violation of the compliance order. Is that the way you understand the penalties scheme to work?",
  "Is that what -- is that what's critical, Mr. Schiff? If that were not true, if you could go in, even with the compliance order on your property, and get an adjudication of whether you had wetlands in the context of an after-the-fact permit proceeding, would that be sufficient?",
  "Well, why does that matter? You're getting review of the question that you care about, which is the question whether you have wetlands on your property. And if they said you don't have wetlands on your property, here's a permit, your problems are finished.",
  "And, Mr. Schiff, is the way you see this operating that you bring an action contesting on the basis of the arbitrary and capricious clause or -- or otherwise not in accordance with law? If -- if then the court rules against you but you continue to fail to comply, does the EPA then have to bring a separate enforcement action?",
  "But to go back to the Chief Justice's - -",
  "So, the Chief Justice's suggestion that there would be preclusion you do not agree with?",
  "But, Mr. Stewart - -",
  "Could I ask you - -",
  "But I'm - -",
  "Well, you are arguing - -",
  "You are arguing that the presumption of reviewability does not apply.",
  "And that seems a very strange position. Why would the presumption of reviewability not apply?",
  "And doesn't most of - -",
  "But, Mr. Stewart, you - -",
  "Mr. Stewart, you suggested that -- that some communication occurs before this compliance order. And my guess would be that most of the back and forth between the agency and the person does happen before the compliance order rather than after. And the notion that the person can come in after the compliance order and say you were wrong - - well, they can, but they can do that with respect to any administrative action. So, am I wrong about that? That really the back and forth here takes place before the compliance order issues rather than after?",
  "Mr. Schiff, I take it -- the Government agrees that there's not much of a chance that you could get an after-the-fact permit, but its view is you should have gotten a before-the-fact permit. And putting aside the weirdness which Justice Alito points out of making you go get a permit for something you don't think you need a permit for -- putting that aside, couldn't you have gotten the legal determination that you wanted through that process?",
  "Well, I think what EPA is saying is, as long as you knew that your lands were potentially wetlands, you could have gone in from the get-go and -- and sought a determination that they were not wetlands through the permit process.",
  "But what kind of evidence is that, Ms. Anders?",
  "So, in the 145, an applicant can take all his written affidavits and say: I want to present oral testimony, on these exact matters, but live.",
  "But to the extent the substance of that testimony was something that he could have brought to the PTO, that testimony, in your view, would be out of bounds.",
  "But then you really do go back to Justice Ginsburg's question because your understanding of what they wouldn't have a reasonable opportunity to present -- I mean, it's very, very narrow. It's a bunch of cumulative testimony that nobody would want to present and no judge would want to hear. And other than that, you're basically saying in all circumstances, well, they could have done that in the PTO. So, then you have Justice Ginsburg's problem, which is these are two channels that are exactly the same.",
  "But I thought that your brief suggested that even with respect to that kind of evidence, a person can go back to the PTO. Is that right?",
  "But Morgan only talked about the standard of review; isn't that right? Morgan has very little to say about what types of evidence ought to be admitted in this proceeding. And one thing we could do is to separate out these two things and say, you know, we think that there's a basis for one, for, let's say, giving the government a fairly deferential standard of review -- call it clear and convincing, call it thorough conviction -- but go the other way, rule against you, on the evidentiary point, which Morgan says nothing about.",
  "Well, but I guess the compelling reason is the statutory language and especially with respect to the admissibility of evidence question. I mean, it -- the standard that you suggest just can't be derived from the statutory language; isn't that right?",
  "But we've said over and over, Mr. Clement, that it's the Attorney General and the district court in D.C. that have exclusive jurisdiction over this set of questions and that we don't want courts in other part of the country to try to mimic what those -- what that court and the Attorney General are supposed to do. And you're essentially asking for the district court in the State of Texas to try to predict what they're going to do and to mimic what they're going to do. And that's why Justice Alito suggests, well, look, if we've said that only the district court in D.C. and the Attorney General should do this, let's wait until they do it and go from there.",
  "But you're not taking into account the fact that, as Justice Sotomayor said, section 5 itself operates as an injunction. And it's an injunction against the use of an un-precleared plan.",
  "But haven't we also said that, with respect to section 2 and constitutional violations, that those allegations would be unripe in the -- prior to the district court or the Attorney General clearing a plan?",
  "Well, just because section 5 says that there's no presumption of regularity attached to that plan and, indeed, that it's unlawful to put that plan into effect without the proper approvals.",
  "Section 5 says somebody has to clear it before it can go into effect.",
  "Nobody said the opposite. The question just is, does somebody have to clear it? Here, it wasn't cleared.",
  "No, I don't think that that's - -",
  "Well, would it be okay if we just said, well, Texas has to make the showing?",
  "So, do you contest the view that this district court did essentially accept the challenges, did sort of say, well, look, there are these challenges; so, we have to make sure that we don't do anything that cuts against them?",
  "But you know what I don't understand about your briefs, Mr. Garza, is if the State can't -- if the plan has not been precleared, you should be saying the State can't look at the plan. But on the one hand, you're saying, well, isn't it great because the court did look at the plan, and on the one hand - - on the other hand you're saying the court can't look at the plan. So, which is it? Because there's a real tension. On one page, you say isn't it great the court looked at the Texas plan. And then you say the court can't look at the Texas plan.",
  "Mr. Garza, what would you think of a system in which the court could start with the Texas plan and say -- the new Texas plan and say anything that's consistent with statutes and the Constitution can go forward, but it's Texas that has to show that consistency? So, flipping the burden of proof in the way that Mr. Srinivasan was suggesting? In a way that makes it more consistent - -",
  "-- with section 5's burden.",
  "Mr. Young, could I ask you to speak to the mootness question first?",
  "As -- as I understand your brief, you're essentially saying that it's impossible to moot a claim for nominal damages. Is -- is that a correct reading of your position?",
  "So, that's a different point, right, which is that the notice was inadequate?",
  "And -- and when you say \"inadequate,\" I read you to be saying sort of not apologetic enough. And -- in other words, not saying, look, you had a claim against us, we think you're right; it was a valid claim; here is your judgment in satisfaction of that claim. That it didn't forthrightly say that. But do you think if it had forthrightly said that, we would be living in a different Article III universe?",
  "And how is that? How did they fail to comply, other than, you know, the question of whether they were forthright enough about the fact that they were satisfying a claim?",
  "Does it have - -",
  "But isn't that important, Mr. Young, because usually where we've talked about capable of repetition or where we've talked about the same thing could happen again, it's where an injunction has been before us rather than a suit for damages as to a past act?",
  "Mr. Collins, as I understand Mr. Young's argument, there is a serious dispute about the adequacy of this notice, and it might be a dispute about whether it was clear enough, about that it was satisfying claims, or it might be a dispute about whether it allowed refunds easily enough, but that Mr. Young is contesting whether the notice complied with the district court's order. Now, as long as that's true, don't we have a live case before us? Somebody has to answer that question about whether your notice complied with the order, and if it's the case that a court has to answer that question, doesn't that depend on the questions presented here, the substantive questions?",
  "But, General Verrilli, it seems to me that this contract notion of yours can only go so far. I mean, if the idea is just we gave them something, now they have to do whatever we say, you wouldn't accept that. So, the question is why is this condition appropriate when many other conditions would not be appropriate? I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, if you would say all conditions are appropriate. But I -- I frankly think you wouldn't.",
  "Well, the broader point, General Verrilli, isn't it, is that no matter -- even if you're right that there are many non-vague applications of this commission policy, that there is some amount of uncertainty and ABC finds itself in that area of uncertainty --",
  "-- because it turns out that nudity -- that there really -- sometimes it's allowed as to some body parts, and sometimes it's not allowed; and the commission hadn't really said anything about it for 50 years; and the length of time doesn't seem to be what's indicative of anything; the kind of body part doesn't seem to be, with some limits, what's indicative of anything, so that ABC just didn't really know.",
  "But this goes --",
  "We're almost there, right -- 10 percent?",
  "But how about this, Mr. Phillips: Look, you've been given a privilege, and that gives the government at least somewhat more leeway to impose obligations on you. Not -- can't impose everything, but at least has a bit more leeway. And here we've had something that's very historically grounded. We've had this for decades and decades that the broadcast is -- the broadcaster is treated differently. It seems to work, and it -- it seems to be a good thing that there is some safe haven, even if the old technological bases for that safe haven don't exist anymore. So, why not just keep it as it is?",
  "Do you think that there is a difference between what a person sees on broadcast channels and what a person sees on basic cable? Basic cable now?",
  "In -- no, in content. Is there a difference in content? Because basic cable channels are not restricted by these rules, and I'm just wondering whether you think that there's a difference. Because I -- it has not been apparent to me that there is.",
  "General --",
  "I think that the -- that the networks really are saying, well, even -- even if some regulation is permissible, the kind of regulation that the FCC has done here is regulation that gives it complete discretion as to what kind of speech to go after and what not to go after; that it has not tied itself in any way to any kinds of standards. And it's, you know, evident in the notion that this -- the way that this policy seems to work, it's like nobody can use dirty words or nudity except for Steven Spielberg --",
  "-- and that there's a lot of room here for FCC enforcement on the basis of what speech they think is kind of nice and proper and good. And that that's a serious First Amendment issue.",
  "Well, Mr. Foreman, I guess the question in this case is what this particular statutory provision has to do with gender discrimination and the history of gender discrimination, whether Congress was aiming to eradicate gender discrimination through this provision or whether it was trying to do something else entirely.",
  "But women don't get sick less often than men, do they?",
  "So, you're just adding something to both sides of the balance, and it doesn't affect the employer's incentive. The employer still - - the -- the hypothetical discriminatory employer would still say, well, women are going to be caregivers more often; so, I'm -- I'm going to not hire that person.",
  "And that's why (A), (B), and (C) go to the problem, but what does (D) have to do with it? If you assume that both men and women get sick at an approximately equal rate -- maybe you don't assume that -- but if you do, it doesn't seem to factor into the employer's incentives in any way.",
  "So, you're saying -- let me just make sure I understand. You're saying that the - - that Congress is thinking that an employer actually does think that women take more sick leave because women get pregnant. And just as Congress was thinking about the employer who thought women are going to take more family leave, you think Congress was thinking about the employer who thinks women are also going to take more sick leave because of pregnancy?",
  "Do you have any evidence that Congress in fact was thinking about either of these two things? Is there anything in the record that suggests either of those two theories?",
  "I'd go with Justice Alito here.",
  "If I could just - -",
  "-- stop you there, Mr. Howard, for a second, as I took from Mr. Foreman something that I hadn't understood from his briefs - - maybe I just missed it -- which is that he's making a kind of analogous argument, that, just as in the -- in the prior provisions of the Act, employers thought of women as caregivers and the response of Congress was to provide a gender-neutral leave benefit that had both - - that both women and men were eligible for. So here, employers think of women as needing more medical leave because of pregnancy, and the response of Congress is to provide gender-neutral sick leave. So, what is your response to that argument?",
  "And, Mr. Howard, I -- I do think that the point about the package is that if you look at (D) alone, when you abstract it from everything else, you have a good point, that it seems to be related to economic security, which is not a section 5 issue; that it seems to be related to discrimination against sick people, which would also put us in a different legal universe. But when you look at (D) as passed at the same moment on the basis of the same record as (A), (B), and (C), with the overwhelming purpose of Congress being to protect women from discrimination in the workplace because of unfair stereotypical -- views about what women do as workers, then (D) assumes a different kind of aura. And you can talk about a number of theories for that, but I guess I would just ask for your -- your reaction to that, that (D) is just part of a package which was about telling employers: Get rid of your old stereotypes. Don't act on your old stereotypes. Employ women.",
  "But I thought Congress wanted the system to operate so that people just did it voluntarily without an award.",
  "Well, Mr. Gillelan - -",
  "Could I follow - -",
  "Mr. Gillelan, if a - -",
  "I think the way the argument has gone so far is that we've all been saying this can't make sense, and you've been saying, as you have every right to say, yes, but this is what the statute says based on the \"newly awarded\" language. But that does assume that \"newly awarded\" can't mean an entitlement. And then you run up against some other statutory provisions where an award does seem to mean, not a formal compensation order, but instead an entitlement to funds. So, 908(d)(1), it seems as though the word \"award\" means entitlement; 910(h)(1), it seems as though the word \"award\" means an entitlement; and 933(b), which says \"award in a compensation order,\" suggests that awards can be made in a formal order or awards can be made differently because of an entitlement that is automatically paid. So, I guess there are three places that it seems to me your reading of the word -- your limited reading of the phrase \"newly awarded,\" you know, runs into problems in those three ways, and I'm left then thinking we should do what makes sense.",
  "933(b), 908(d)(1), and 910(h)(1).",
  "And in what percentage of the cases are we in that world?",
  "Mr. Keisler, if I could just go back to this language. If -- if according to Justice Scalia's old opinion, the statute awards compensation at the time of disability, essentially what you would be saying is that an employee who becomes disabled in a certain year is awarded compensation at that time. Is that right?",
  "Ms. Millett, our cases have said that we're supposed to look not only to policy but also to history. Would you disagree with the premise that a person in your client's position historically would have had at most an actual malice -- a malice defense or a reasonable cause defense? Would a person have anything more than that?",
  "But, in Wyatt, we said that that was a very different kind of immunity than the Harlow immunity, and we said historically it provided no basis for giving Harlow immunity.",
  "So, I take it that your answer is, yes, it would only have been a malice defense, but that doesn't matter, notwithstanding Wyatt. Is that your answer?",
  "Doesn't that suggest really that we don't have a historical test anymore, that really all we're looking to is policy considerations?",
  "Wasn't Richardson really all about how market forces would make immunity unnecessary? And how is it that market forces play any different role in this case than they do in Richardson?",
  "Do you think market forces do operate differently here, or is it basically the same thing?",
  "Mr. McGill, back to immunity, what -- one thing I don't understand about our law here, you say there was no historic basis. And I have to concede that that's right. Seems to me that there's -- there was only a malice defense. But isn't that always true when it comes to a -- a private person? In other words, of course there's no historic basis for qualified immunity. This kind of immunity was developed in 1970. It's sort of by definition there's no historic basis for this sort of immunity. So, to say that the historic basis matters is really to say that private people never get Harlow immunity.",
  "Mr. Stewart, don't you have two arguments? One is that the statute changed, but the other is that even the statute remained the -- even if the statute remained the same, Colony itself was a decision that found ambiguity in the statute. So, you have the power under Brand X to go back to that statute and reinterpret it, if you will.",
  "But if the Court thinks it has to reach that question because it agrees more with Justice Scalia than with you as to whether this statute stays the same, then you have independent Brand X arguments, don't you?",
  "But, Mr. Stewart, prior to this latest round of litigation, had the IRS ever said, ever given any indication, that it viewed Colony as not controlling any -- any -- any longer?",
  "And as a result of this case, had the IRS suggested in any kind of guidance or rulings or anything else that it viewed Colony as an outdated decision? Because, you know, I'm a taxpayer, and I'm reading Colony and I'm thinking the language of the statute is still the same; why wouldn't Colony control?",
  "Well, why do you think they added that paragraph? Because it seems clear that there was a circuit split at that time about exactly this question and that this paragraph was a response to that circuit split. So, what else could Congress have meant by it?",
  "But you agree that that's not why Congress passed that provision?",
  "Well, Mr. Garre, where do you find evidence of that? Because you cite some cases in your brief that end up not really supporting your position. And as far as I can see, there's only one case after Colony that deals with the question of whether Colony continues to govern after the 1954 amendments. And that case, which is Phinney, seems to cut in the opposite direction. So, am I missing something? Are there cases that -- that favor you that say that, yes, Colony continued to control?",
  "Well, whatever the Fifth Circuit said about Phinney, when I read Phinney, it seems to me to cut in the Government's direction if not to be entirely on all fours. But I asked, are there any other cases that you have that suggest that the courts did think that Colony was continuing to be the governing rule?",
  "Because what I was thinking, Mr. Garre -- and tell me what you think the consequence of this would be -- is that if I were a tax lawyer and somebody came to me and said is Colony still the rule, I would have said: Well, I can't tell you 100 percent. I think you're good 70 to 80 percent. You know, it's the same language, and there's Colony out there, and -- and -- and nothing the IRS hasn't said that Colony doesn't control, but I can't -- so, I'm giving a 70 percent. Do you win if that's the state of the world as I see it?",
  "Well, in terms of what a taxpayer thinks, whether Colony continues to govern.",
  "Well, that was the specific situation, but then the question was, how clearly did Congress speak to that specific situation? And in order to get his result, Justice Harlan says first that the statute is -- that the statutory text is ambiguous, goes to a bunch of legislative history, and none of that legislative history actually speaks to the exact question before the Court, only by implication. So, if you look at the whole of -- of the Colony opinion, it sure seems as though there's a lot of extrapolation going on and essentially a lot of ambiguity.",
  "Well, in the end, there has to be a resolution. But the question is, what does it look like before you get to that resolution? And -- and Justice Harlan is doing a lot of tap dancing there, you know, going to this Senate report, going to that House report, going to this colloquy, before he can come up with an answer.",
  "Do you -- do you understand the preamble as part of the regulation? Because if I look at the preamble, the preamble seems pretty clear to me. It seems to me that your view that the government did not do this clearly enough must rest on looking at the regulation without the preamble.",
  "I take your point about the purpose, but you would have to ignore every rule of grammar that there is in order to read it your way, don't -- wouldn't you?",
  "Well, Mr. Bibas, how is it different then from a felon in possession statute, where you look at the past offense - -",
  "-- and then you say, well, this man, because of that past offense, can't buy a gun in the future? How is it different at all?",
  "Well, why isn't the -- the government, Congress, making the exact same judgment here? If the activity to be regulated is entry, and Congress is making a judgment that we do not want dangerous people to enter, and we're using the conviction, the prior conviction, as a marker for who is dangerous, and that's exactly what Congress has done in the felon in possession statute.",
  "Well, that event is the event that the government cares about, which is the entry into the country. It's not as though the -- you know, the government says -- just picks an event at random and -- and makes it the trigger mechanism. The government has picked the event that it wants to regulate, which is entry.",
  "How do you explain St. Cyr if reliance isn't necessary? St. Cyr is all about reliance.",
  "Well, do you have any case in which a court has deemed a statute retroactive even though it wasn't triggered until the party took some further action? Is there any case out there either from this Court or from another court where we've said, you know, it's retroactive even though it depends upon a future event?",
  "What do you take the trigger to be? Because in your brief you kept on talking about the trigger being the trip. And I would have thought that you would have talked more about the activity being the attempt to enter the country.",
  "All right. Well, that's what's going to be important to the person, right? It's not inadmissible and all the legal terms. Am I going to be able to make short trips to visit my mother? Yes, you are going to be able to make short trips to visit your mother. And then you wake up the next morning, and Congress has passed a statute, and now you're not able to take short trips to visit your mother. So, something very real has happened to the life of this person.",
  "You're quite right, Mr. Miller, as a formal matter that that's true, that that's the words of the statute. But how many times has the Department of Homeland Security tried to declare a person inadmissible on the basis of the commission of a crime without putting into evidence either a conviction or a guilty plea?",
  "I can't imagine that it's like more than on one -- you know, five fingers of your hand. I mean, that's the way people prove crimes in this area, isn't it, by convictions or guilty pleas?",
  "Or convictions after trial or convictions by guilty pleas.",
  "If, as a fact of the matter, the way the commission of crime is proved in this area is through showing a conviction, does your distinction stand up at all?",
  "It -- it can't be right that it's any future conduct. If -- if there's a trigger mechanism that is entirely random, you know, it's -- you can be deported if you've committed a crime of moral turpitude in the past, but not until you go to the movies on a Saturday. Surely, that would not change the analysis.",
  "And how do we separate those two? How do we decide that this is not that, and that it's instead something else, that it's a regulation of future conduct?",
  "Well, Mr. Miller, the Solicitor General actually represented to us -- in the Judulang argument, used that as an example, the Fleuti case, as something that people doing pleas did think about and did rely upon.",
  "Ms. Kruger, you take a statute that doesn't say anything about imputation one way or the other, and you say that statute can still be unambiguous. And that would I think be true as a general matter. But now you add to that statute a history and a tradition and a practice in immigration law of imputation of various kinds. One is imputation of domicile in the way we talked about, but there are other imputations that occur throughout the field of immigration law. Some cut for the alien; some cut against the alien. In the world of that practice and tradition, are you at least in a sphere in which there's ambiguity, in which the agency essentially has discretion to decide whether it wants to impute in this way?",
  "But none of them are textually commanded; is that right? I mean, the - - they're all situations in which the agency has decided that there are good reasons to impute various factors.",
  "So, you think that all the imputations that exist in immigration law are all a matter of imputing intent?",
  "Mr. Kinnaird, I take it that the point you're making is the statute is ambiguous in the sense that its silence does not prevent the BIA from making this imputation if it wants to. But the BIA clearly doesn't want to. So, where does that leave you?",
  "Well, are you saying that the BIA needs to write an opinion that says now we are doing Chevron step two analysis? Is that what you're saying, that this is a matter of labeling?",
  "It looks to me as though you have an additional statutory problem. You have two sets of verbs in this statute. One is the \"give and accept\" set of verbs, and then the other is the \"charge made or received.\" So, it seems to me that what the statute is -- is thinking about is that first, that there is a charge made or received, and that charge is, of course, the charge that the consumer pays to the provider. And then there's another transaction. And that transaction is the \"give or accept\" transaction, and that transaction occurs between two service providers. So, one set of verbs refers to the consumer-provider relationship; the other set of verbs refers to the provider-provider relationship.",
  "Mr. Hefferon, if you are right about subsection (b) and its meaning, what does it do that subsection (a) does not do?",
  "Well, if that's the case, I mean, why would Congress have done something that says (a) pursuant to an agreement, (b) not pursuant to an agreement? Why wouldn't it just have one provision that didn't make any reference to an agreement?",
  "Well, Mr. Hefferon, I don't think that that's true, that -- we defer to agencies, not because we think that agencies do statutory interpretation in exactly the way courts do. We actually defer to agencies because we think they provide something different, not because they're the best parser of statutory language, but because when they see ambiguity, they're able to import policy judgments into that ambiguity. And that seems to me exactly what the agency did here.",
  "Mr. Hefferon, you might be right that we never get to Chevron deference here because the statute is plain on its face, and there's no ambiguity for the -- the agency to think or do anything about. But let's just assume that there is ambiguity on the statute, and the question is whether to provide this interpretation with Chevron deference. So, then, what's your argument for why there should be no Chevron deference to this interpretation, given that the statute under which this interpretation was promulgated refers identically to regulations and interpretations as something that HUD gets to do?",
  "Now that's just a way of saying that there's no ambiguity here. But I was suggesting that if there is ambiguity here, I -- at least I have not found a reason not to give HUD deference in this situation. I mean, you say they didn't do a very good job. But we don't usually grade agencies like that, and say, well, you didn't do a very good job; so, you're not entitled to Chevron deference.",
  "So, just out of curiosity, why do you think that all these courts just took for granted the opposite reading?",
  "Well, aren't you asking for an interpretive principle that errs on the side of breadth rather than narrowness?",
  "Why don't we just ask ourselves what's the most common, what's the best reading?",
  "But the dictionaries themselves tell us that one usage is far more common than the other.",
  "Well, how about in the U.S. Code? Is there any place in the U.S. Code where the word \"interpreters\" clearly encompasses written translators?",
  "So, in every other case in which the U.S. Code uses the word, \"interpreters\" means only oral translators, and that's the obvious way to use the word, but in this case, we're supposed to reach a different conclusion.",
  "You're, like, daring Justice Alito to go do this now.",
  "I don't know, Mr. Himmelfarb. I mean, why is this any -- any different from any case in which we draw a line and we find that the result of drawing a line is that we've created some close cases, cases that are near the line. So, you know, just to give you an obvious example, the fact that there are some few minutes in every 24-hour period where's it's hard to say that something is night or day does not mean that there's not night and that there's not day. And that seems to me what the question is here. Yes, you can think up some hard cases, but they're just that; they're marginal cases.",
  "Well, I guess one --",
  "Where does it say that in the jury charge?",
  "Well, as I understand what the Arkansas instructions said, what the instructions in this case said, is that the jury unanimously had to have a reasonable doubt on an offense before it could go down to the next offense. So, that's to say that the jury unanimously had to find what is -- what leads to an acquittal. So, the jury had to unanimously acquit on the greater offense before it could go down to the next. And the -- the instructions don't say anything about moving back up. And this jury seems to take its responsibility under these instructions extraordinarily seriously. This jury was instructing the judge on the instructions --",
  "-- and about how they had to go down step by step and reach unanimity on the one before they could get to the next lowest down. So, I guess I'm asking why do you think, under these instructions, that the jury felt itself able to go back up?",
  "The chief prosecutor kept saying: You all have to agree on this.",
  "I think if you -- if you look at what the -- what the judge said, what the prosecutor said, what the defense counsel said, and then what the jury said, it's clear that they all thought that they had to unanimously agree on something before they could go to the next crime. And, again, there's no suggestion in what anybody said that they could go back up.",
  "Well, even if, General --",
  "Even if you're not required -- and maybe you are required -- but even if you're not, here the jury comes back. The jury tells the judge we've unanimously reached acquittal on these two counts. At that point, why doesn't the judge have an obligation -- you know, the judge sends them back for a half hour. There's no reason to think that in that half hour they moved back up the scale. There's every reason to think they just remained stuck where they were. But even assuming that there is some conceivable possibility that they went back up, why doesn't the judge, working with the manifest necessity standard, have an obligation to say, well, what about it? Did you? Did you reach acquittal? Did you reach a judgment on these two counts?",
  "I guess, General McDaniel, one question about what Arkansas law does is -- it seems a little bit as if it's trying to get the sweet of an acquittal for a State without the bitter. So, the sweet is an acquittal-first system, where you force a jury to reach agreement on one thing before it goes to the next thing, makes compromised jury verdicts harder, and that's why a State might say we want an acquittal-first system. The bitter that most States take with that is that they say, well, if we're forcing them to agree on these things and they agree on a verdict of not guilty, we're stuck with that. Now, what Arkansas seems to want is a system in which it forces juries to agree on the -- the greater charges before going to the less, but won't take the consequence of that, which is that sometimes they agree that on the greater charges, they're not guilty.",
  "General, you mentioned Green and Price before, and those are the cases, of course, where there is a conviction on a lesser charge. We don't know anything about the greater charge. And then the conviction is overturned. And what the Court says there is, well, we don't know anything, but we're going to make a reasonable assumption, and the reasonable -- no, I think it said a \"legitimate\" assumption. The legitimate assumption that they acquitted on the greater charges before they went down to the lesser charge. Now, it seems to me as though there are a hundred reasons why that might not be true. The jury could have just gone to the lesser charge immediately as a compromise position without voting on the greater charge, but the Court said we'll make a legitimate assumption. So, why isn't the same true here? We're making a legitimate assumption, I think honestly, on the basis of much more than Green and Price had to work with, if you will, that the jury, in fact, acquitted of those greater offenses.",
  "There was a verdict --",
  "-- that eventually got overturned. There was no verdict on the greater offenses.",
  "Well --",
  "General -­",
  "General, is that -­",
  "General, what -- what about these State statutes -- there are more of them than I thought that there would be -- that say no demonstrable falsehoods by a political candidate in a political race, and prohibit demonstrable falsehoods by political candidates? How would your analysis apply to those? Would they come out the other end as constitutional?",
  "Well, suppose it says demonstrable falsehoods about yourself -- ­",
  "-- just about your qualifications, about what you've done in your life, your -- you know, whether you have a Medal of Honor, whether you've been in military service, whether you've been to college. So, any demonstrable statement that a candidate, political candidate, makes about himself.",
  "I guess I don't understand why it would be more chilling in the one case than in the other. They're the same kind of statement, and one knows the same sorts of things about oneself.",
  "Well, I assume that that would be, in the case of these State statutes, because the State feels that it has a specially important interest in maintaining the political sphere free of lies.",
  "But, Mr. Libby, you've suggested to us that we should apply strict scrutiny to all of these cases. Now, almost nothing passes strict scrutiny. Why should 1001 pass strict scrutiny? I mean, it seems to me you're proposing a test that would invalidate all of the laws on the books regarding false statements.",
  "But Mr. Libby, let's suppose that I agree with Gertz that there is no constitutional value in a false statement of fact, and the reason why we protect some false statements of fact is to protect truthful speech. So, if -- if that's so, is -- how is it that this statute will chill any truthful speech? What truthful speech will this statute chill?",
  "So, boy, I mean, that's a big concession, Mr. Libby. Then you're saying you can only win this case if this Court decides that the Gertz statement was a kind of overstatement, an exaggeration, puffery.",
  "How about extramarital affairs?",
  "The government has a strong interest in the sanctity of the family, the stability of the family; so, we're going to prevent everybody from telling lies about their extramarital affairs.",
  "But this is something about the person's own experience, that the person knows everything about. You either had one or you didn't have one.",
  "Ms. Lord, could I ask you about the first question presented?",
  "As I understand the opposing argument, it goes sort of like this: It says, in Day, we said it's fine to do this in the district court. Even if the party hasn't raised it, the court can raise it on this exact issue. In Granberry, we said with respect to a different issue that the appellate court could raise it. And, in Day, we said that those two issues were really the same. So, that seems sort of like a logical argument that just gets you to a place where you lose on the first question, unless perhaps there's a difference between a court raising a question sua sponte and a court allowing a party to raise it later than the party ought to have raised it. Are you relying on that distinction, or are you questioning the logic of the basic argument that Granberry and Day decided this?",
  "But didn't Day say that those two issues were functionally identical for this purpose?",
  "But, Mr. Domenico, you're saying something considerably more. You're saying that when a State gets up -- after inquiry by the district court, when a State gets up and says we do not want to press this argument; now we're not saying the argument is wrong, because after all we're a repeat player and we're going to hear that argument again, and we are not saying that argument is wrong, but in this case we do not want to press that argument. That's -- that's unequivocal to me.",
  "Mr. Domenico, do I understand your argument correctly to think that if you had not said, or if the lawyer for the State had not said we're not conceding, if all that the lawyer for the State had said is we're not challenging this, Your Honor, would that count as a deliberate waiver under Day?",
  "But this is --",
  "But isn't the concession language really going to a different point? The concession language is going to the point of why it is that you're not raising it, that you're not challenging it.",
  "Ms. Sherry, there is one difference. If you put Granberry and Day together, it gets you most of the way there. The one difference is that here there was a sua sponte decision by the court; whereas, in even the combination of Granberry and Day, it was a party that raised it, although the party raised it late. So, why should that difference not matter? If you think that party presentation has some consequence in this area, you might think that that difference does matter, that once you get to the court of appeals and even then the party doesn't raise it, sort of enough is enough.",
  "But at the trial court level.",
  "Of course, the habeas court has a significant screening function.",
  "Mr. Schwartz --",
  "-- suppose an employee is fired and he has a variety of different kinds of claims, constitutional and statutory. What would you think happens then? Does he bring the constitutional claims in one court but the statutory claims in another court -- excuse me -- in the -- in the commission?",
  "Well, that seems just as bad. In other words, that then, you -- it's not inefficient necessarily, but your scheme would force the employee to choose between her constitutional claims and her statutory claims.",
  "Why would we do that?",
  "You suggested that it's a situation that doesn't often arise, and I guess that puzzles me. Why wouldn't it often arise?",
  "Well, why wouldn't the dividing line be -- and I think that this is consistent with your argument. The dividing line should be where the MSPB itself could decide the claim.",
  "If the MSPB can decide the claim, then it goes to the MSPB. If the MSPB can't decide the claim, I think is what you're saying, then it has to go to the district court.",
  "And you're saying that the MSPB has said that, although it can decide, can decide, cases where he says, you know, my -- my supervisor fired me for a discriminatory reason, that that's within the scope of the MSPB's authority, a claim like this, which is that the Selective Service Act is unconstitutional full stop, is not within the scope of the MSPB's authority. Is that right?",
  "Now, in your original briefs, Mr. Schwartz, you suggested that if the MSPB can't hear a claim, neither can the Federal Circuit. And as I understood the Government's brief, the Government comes back and said that's not the case. Even when the MSPB can't hear a claim, the Federal Circuit could hear it. Now, then there's a question of, if there's a necessity for a record, how does the record get developed? But do you now concede that the Federal Circuit could hear the claim as a matter -- you know, on the -- at the -- at the first level?",
  "Well, isn't your basic answer to Justice Breyer -- I mean, correct me if I'm wrong -- you think that the problem is that there's no record that the Federal Circuit can use to evaluate this constitutional claim?",
  "We could just ask the MSPB, Mr. Feigin. If you bring the claim to the MSPB, and then the MSPB says, no, we have no authority to adjudicate this claim, then you know that you're in a world in which the MSPB doesn't have authority, so that you can go to the district court.",
  "Well, but the CSRA is presuming that the MSPB actually can decide something.",
  "Well, could you help me with something? Because I agree with you, Thunder Basin is a very strong case for you, but McNary is a very strong case for Mr. Schwartz. And I read those two opinions, and, frankly, I have a tough time reconciling them. So, could you tell me how you do?",
  "Yes, I imagine so.",
  "But they're very different because the magistrate can come back to the district court judge and say we have a tough one, Your Honor; why don't you decide it? I mean, here you're stipulating that the board has no power to decide this question. Call it jurisdiction; call it something else. The board cannot decide the question, but the board is going to now become the arbiter of discovery disputes? The factfinder? I mean, \"weird\" is a good word for it.",
  "Do you think the MSPB should find facts with regard to this claim?",
  "Well, maybe it will and maybe it won't.",
  "I would think, Mr. Feigin, it would depend on how it's litigated. But in a case in which there is some factfinding to be made, would the MSPB have authority to find facts?",
  "Well, Mr. Feigin, they might well be the same claim, but if the MSPB can decide the one and cannot decide the other, that's a relevant distinction. Now, you might be right in what you said. Well, maybe one answer is that the MSPB can decide both. But as long as the MSPB can decide the one or the other, it seems -- I mean, that's -- it seems like a sensible dividing line.",
  "Although, that's weird in another way, isn't it, Mr. Feigin, because, can we really imagine in the real world the MSPB deciding that the Selective Service Act is unconstitutional? I mean, what do they know about that question?",
  "Well, but this is a question, and -- and you can -- I take the point that I'm just talking about this case. But this is a question about whether women should have to register for the draft in the same way as men should. That goes to defense policy. It goes to equal protection law. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with -- with workplace issues of the kind that the MSPB is expert on.",
  "Mr. Feigin, could I go back to the Chief Justice's question about what actually would happen in the MSPB? Presumably in this case, what the plaintiffs seek to do is to develop an extensive factual record showing how much has changed in the military in terms of the -- the -- the role that women play in the military. And that it's almost impossible to litigate this kind of claim without having such a record. That's the entire basis for -- for arguing that Rostker is outmoded, given current military operations. So, how could the -- the plaintiff develop that record that is needed to litigate this claim?",
  "Well, but this is that case.",
  "Mr. Hoffman, could I --",
  "But, Mr. Kneedler, when you --",
  "Excuse me.",
  "When you say in your brief that we should look at this as a remedial question, as a question of enforcement, do you say that because you're thinking of this as a vicarious liability case? In other words, there's an individual person who clearly has violated a norm of international law, and then the question of whether to hold the corporation liable is an enforcement question. Or would you say that it's also an enforcement question when we're talking about direct corporate liability?",
  "But I think, Mr. Kneedler --",
  "But, Mr. Kneedler, in Sosa, and this is the footnote 20, we said that the question of whether you were a state actor or not a state actor might be relevant to the question of whether there was a substantive norm that applied to you. And I guess the question here is why that same analysis doesn't apply to the question of whether there is corporate liability? In other words, is there a substantive norm that applied to corporations? Maybe there is; maybe there isn't. But that that's the question, as opposed to what you suggest in your brief, that really we should just think of this as a question of enforcement, which is entirely up to Federal common law. And I guess the question is why think of it as enforcement rather than as a substantive obligation?",
  "No, I'm not saying footnote 20 --",
  "It addressed a different question, but it's an analogous question. If the question of whether non-state actors are part of the substantive obligation question, why, too, isn't the question of whether international law extends to corporations?",
  "But, Ms. Sullivan, I think that that's mostly because all of these are written to prohibit certain acts, and they don't talk about the actors. So, if I could, you know, draw an analogy, it's as if somebody came and said, you know, this -- this norm of international law does not apply to Norwegians. And you -- well, there's no case about Norwegians, and it doesn't specifically say \"Norwegians.\" But, of course, it applies to Norwegians because it prevents everybody from committing a certain kind of act.",
  "Ms. Sullivan, take an example that has all the extraterritoriality aspects of this case removed from it. Let's assume that the French ambassador is assaulted or attacked in some way in the United States and that that attack is by a corporate agent. Would we say that the corporation there cannot be sued under the Alien Tort Statute?",
  "Well, could you explain that to me? We would have to sue the person individually.",
  "And what -- so, this goes back to Justice Breyer's question. Where do you find that in international law? Where -- where does it say, when the French ambassador is sued in the United States by a corporate agent, we can't sue the corporation?",
  "You don't -- of course, one could bring an ATS suit against the individual. Is that right?",
  "Now, all of United States' law and mostly other countries' law would hold the corporation liable for the individual's act. Isn't that right? That's a general principle of law.",
  "Ms. Sullivan that would be true against an individual as well. The ATS is just a unique statute. It's unique against individuals, and it's unique against corporations. That doesn't answer the question that you're here to address, which is whether corporations are meaningfully different from individuals.",
  "Well, if that's --",
  "If that is true -- let me just take you back to this question of separating out direct corporate liability from vicarious corporate liability, because it's clear if -- one question is, is there a substantive international law obligation? But there's another question which would not be an international law question, which is a remedial question. Remedies are addressed by common law rather than -- American common law rather than by international law. So, why shouldn't we look at the vicarious liability question as essentially a question about the scope of the appropriate remedy once an international law violation has been found?",
  "But the question of who can be sued --",
  "-- is a remedial question.",
  "The question of who has an obligation is a substantive question.",
  "But in my example, the tort in violation of the law nations has been committed. It has been committed by the corporate agent. And the question then is, can one hold the corporation responsible for that tort? And that seems to be a question of enforcement, of remedy; not of substantive international law.",
  "Ms. Sullivan, could I take you back to --",
  "Well, the TVPA is one limited statute dealing with one particular category of offense, and it was specifically meant to supplement, not to supplant, the ATS. So, between those two things, the fact that it's limited to torture and that there was no design to supplant the ATS, I guess I think that if your best shot is the TVPA, that's a -- that's a weak one.",
  "Ms. Sullivan, if I asked you --",
  "If I asked you --",
  "You said the international community draws this line. And as far as I can see, the international sources are simply silent as to this question. So, if I said to you, Ms. Sullivan, I want to go back and read the best thing you have saying that the international law sources draw this line, what do I read?",
  "Well, the Rome statute is different because the Rome statute is about criminal liability. And we know that the Rome statute was meant to complement many -- many international states' laws which in fact do not hold corporations criminally liable domestically.",
  "Yes, but that's for individuals as well as for corporations.",
  "Mr. Fisher --",
  "You know, it's obvious that \"individual\" doesn't usually mean what you want it to mean. Now, you have a theory that they all just read Judge Edwards, and they came in and used \"individual.\" But it seems actually that we know where \"individual\" came from in this statute. The statute started out by saying \"person,\" and then there was this moment where one Congressman said I don't want this to apply to corporations, and the staff member said I have a great idea to make sure it doesn't apply to corporations; let's change the word \"person\" to \"individual.\" So, that's the way \"individual\" got into the statute, and it got in specifically to address this question.",
  "And \"individual\" means what it means.",
  "But let's suppose that is true, Mr. Fisher. Let's suppose that aside from Congressman Leach, nobody thought about this question. But we know what the normal meaning of \"individual\" is, and you're suggesting -- let's suppose that they just -- the -- the question of individual versus corporate liability was not on their mind, but they chose a word that means something. And you're suggesting that we should resort to background norms that -- you know, what Congress generally does when it imposes liability, rather than the words in the statute that they passed. And why should we do that?",
  "How about non-state actors?",
  "Non-state actors.",
  "Individuals and organizations.",
  "But it doesn't really need an answer. Suppose we think there is no answer to that question because Congress didn't think about it, other than Congressman Leach who appears to have thought about it and --",
  "-- reached the opposite result. Most of them just didn't think about it. But there you are. The statute says what it says.",
  "Mr. Fisher, one case that you seem to have on your side -- you don't have very many, but you have this one -- is Clinton, which -- which does read \"individual\" in the way that you say and does it in order to avoid an absurd result, what the Court thought of as an absurd result. Do you think that this statute is absurd if not read your way?",
  "But, Ms. Ferguson --",
  "Your story makes it sound as though everybody was really focused on this question and made a determination to proceed incrementally and not to include corporations. And isn't it, if you -- if you look at what happened here, more likely that other than Congressman Lynch -- Leach -- in fact, nobody was focused on this question. But because of Congressman Leach's intervention, the words changed, and the word was continued throughout the legislative process, and that's the word that was voted on.",
  "That counts as a gross disparity?",
  "What does, is my question. How -- how do you separate a gross disparity from a non-gross disparity?",
  "Mr. Stancil -­",
  "Mr. Stancil, if that's right, and let's take a case which is different from the one that -- that you're saying. Let's take a case where there are many, many, many more open projects, involving much, much more cost than you're saying is true here. And the mayor looks at this and says: You know what? Unless I can just draw the line here, I'm not going to be able to change this financing system, either unless I can draw the line here or unless I can say, you know, nobody gets any money. What's a mayor to do?",
  "Well, but I -- I guess what I'm asking is we have this terrible program; everybody hates it; it's not fulfilling its intended purposes; the mayor and everybody else wants to change it: How is the mayor going to change this program now?",
  "I'm suggesting -­",
  "-- that that is financially prohibitive.",
  "Well, isn't that what you're saying, Mr. Stancil? Is what you're saying that when cities create tax policy, they can't think about the budget implications of that tax policy?",
  "Mr. Stancil, here's what worries me about this case: To me, this is a case about transition rules. All legislation creates classes of citizens, and some are -- and -- and puts them all in a group and says you're going to be treated in the same way as long as this legislation exists. And then a legislature comes along and changes that piece of legislation, and different people are affected differently by it. And to me what you are suggesting is that when that break is made and when that transition occurs, the -- I don't know how you would apply the rule that you're suggesting, which is that everybody in the former class has to be treated the same as a matter of transition policy.",
  "Isn't there something sort of bizarre about your reading, because Congress in the (e) section sets up very specific definitions about stepchildren and grandchildren and even stepgrandchildren in which State intestacy law is not referenced? But you're saying that as to the largest category, the category in which 90 percent of people are going to get benefits, there Congress sent us all off to State law.",
  "Well, suppose I'm not so convinced that (h) is as clear as you think it is, because there are two sentences of -- of section (h). I'm just asking you to provide a reason why Congress would have specified everything about what -- how you get benefits for stepchildren and grandchildren and stepchildren, but not for the main category of people at issue.",
  "Mr. Miller, could I take you back to 416(e)? I take it that you don't contest that for purposes of deciding the -- which stepchildren get benefits and which grandchildren get benefits, we're just looking to Federal law, that we don't look to State law on those questions; is that correct?",
  "And, you know, I'm looking at some of these, the grandchildren one, for example. It says a person who is the grandchild, but only if, blah, blah, blah. It seems to have just sort of an understanding of what a grandchild is. In other words, it's not really defining a grandchild here; it's limiting a class of grandchildren with a pre-existing understanding of what a grandchild is. And so, I'm wondering, if that's true of grandchildren, why isn't it also true of children?",
  "I'm sorry, the child of a child. The child -- what kind of child?",
  "Oh, so, for grandchildren, the agency is also looking to State law?",
  "But, Mr. Rothfeld, I guess the question is, when it says a child is a child, does it mean a child is a child born in wedlock or a child is just a child? And we know that Congress knew how to distinguish between the two because Congress distinguished between the two in this very Act in the dependency provisions. It talks about the legitimate child of such individual. Well, here it didn't add that word. It just said \"the child.\"",
  "Are there any other statutes that you can point to around this time which support the notion that when people said \"child\" they meant child within a legal marriage?",
  "I'm sorry. You can't point to anything because it's so clear?",
  "Well, I suppose the question is aren't you at the very least getting us into a situation where we should interpret the statute the Government's way because of constitutional avoidance concerns?",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, I'm curious why you didn't argue a different theory, which is that (e) refers to all biological children whether in marriage or outside of marriage, and then (h) is set up for cases in which biological status is contested. I mean, what would you think of that theory?",
  "Well, why didn't you argue it?",
  "But then, Mr. Rothfeld, why can't one just say, well, first sentence, who is a child? Look to State law. Second sentence, when State law treats other people as children, you should treat them as other -- as children, too. So, the two sentences can cohere fine. For children, look to State law, and also look to State law to see who they treat just like children.",
  "Well, why not?",
  "Well, that's exactly right, Mr. Rothfeld. But you have two choices. In the second sentence, you do have two groups, and one has to be compared to the other, which is children. The question is, are children described by the first sentence of that, or are children described by the (e) section? So, you're just reading the first sentence out of the statute and saying that the second sentence totally subsumes the first sentence, and we have to go back to (e). But the first sentence exists. And it says: Who are children? Children are who they are under State law.",
  "It's a mess.",
  "Mr. Miller, what do you think is wrong with the alternative theory that -- that I suggested, that (e) is all biological children in a marriage, not in a marriage, doesn't matter; and that (h) is designed to deal with situations in which biological status is contested?",
  "But why do you think that? What would you point to in (h) that is inconsistent with the theory that I just gave you?",
  "Mr. Phillips, do you think that you could say that there was no going above the statutory maximum here? In other words, you know, if the judge had said, well, it's $500 a day, I'm going to find some facts and fine you $600 a day, that would be going above a statutory maximum. But I'm wondering whether this is different because here the judge was sticking to the $500 a day that was set out in the statute, and then the question is more, you know, of an -- is it an element or is it a -- is it a sentencing fact as to how many days the violation occurred?",
  "But, Mr. Dreeben, wasn't the core domain defined by whether it related to a specific statutory offense? So, Ice says the core concern is \"a legislative attempt to remove from the province of the jury the determination of facts that warrant a punishment for a specific statutory offense.\" How is that not relevant precisely in this context?",
  "How does it not determine this context? I mean, those --",
  "What other rules do you think are different? I mean, is there a jury trial in the one case but not in the other? Is there a right to counsel in the one case but not in the other? What else turns on this fine/incarceration distinction?",
  "Mr. Stevenson -­",
  "Mr. Stevenson, do you have statistics about how many of these sentences are imposed on under 18-year-olds in non-mandatory States?",
  "So, you think it would be true, going up to age 18, that 80-plus percent are imposed in States that have mandatory systems?",
  "But, Mr. Neiman --",
  "Mr. Neiman, I am wondering if we can go back to the issue that Justice Breyer left on the table, and this doesn't have much to do with how many States do what, but instead just to say that in the death penalty context, we've insisted on individualized sentencing. And in Graham, of course, we equated juveniles who were sentenced to life without parole to people who -- to adults who were sentenced to death and said that those two should be treated equivalently. And I'm wondering whether that doesn't suggest that the rules we have in the death penalty context about individualized sentencing ought to apply to juveniles who are sentenced to life without parole?",
  "Regardless of, like, how many States do what and how many times this happened, but just, you know, two facts: We've insisted on this in the death penalty context, and we've equated the death penalty context to juveniles without life -- parole in Graham.",
  "Yes, but of course Harmelin is pre-Graham, and in Graham we equated these two things, adults sentenced to death and juveniles sentenced to life without parole.",
  "But the fact that we've said that individualized sentencing was not enough in one context does not suggest that individualized sentencing ought not to be the rule in a different context where there is no categorical bar.",
  "When you look -- Mr. Neiman, if you look at those two cases and you look at the individuals, the child's actions in the two cases, they really are remarkably similar. They're sort of a piece. Don't you agree? I mean, how -- how is it that the child's actions in this case were any different from that in Graham?",
  "I'm sorry. Justice Ginsburg is, of course, right.",
  "Mr. -- I'm sorry; go ahead.",
  "One of the arguments that the State makes is that when you look at all these numbers, the number that is most different between this pair of cases and Graham is the denominator. And I'm wondering whether you would address that. What kind of denominator we should be using here and how it compares to the denominators that we've used in past cases.",
  "What would you point at in the majority opinion below that suggests that they did an analysis that didn't look at the error and its possible prejudicial effect?",
  "Well, Mr. Brindley, I mean, I guess one difficulty -- and this is really repeating Justice Alito's question, but it seems that you're parsing things pretty closely. If I ask the question whether an error altered the verdict, it seems to me I'm asking pretty much the same question as whether without that verdict the -- whether without that error, the verdict would be the same. That seems like just two ways of saying the same thing. Now, if what you're saying is put aside that formulation, there are lots of courts that are doing something wrong, which is that they're not looking at the error and its possible prejudicial effect at all, then I understand the argument; but then I ask the question, well, is that what this court did?",
  "Mr. Yang, that does raise the question that I think most separates you and Mr. Brindley, and it's the question that Justice Alito suggested. So, let me give you a hypothetical. Let's say that this jury was not out for 8 hours but was out for 8 days. And on the 7th day, a note came from the jury, and the note said we really think that these tape recordings are extremely important, but we're -- we're having a dispute about how important they are, and we'd like to listen to them again. And they do that, and then they come back with this compromise verdict. Now, what you are suggesting is that we cannot look at any of that. Essentially, the best proof that's available to us about whether the error in fact affected this jury's decision, you would have a court close its eyes to. And I guess -- why would that be?",
  "So, let me make sure I understand what you're saying to me, that you're saying to me: No, we didn't mean to say that that was irrelevant; we just mean to say that an appellate court should be cautious about it and look at that kind of evidence in the -- in light of everything else that happened at the trial.",
  "Well, you just told me it wasn't, Mr. Yang. Because -- well, I think that the -- that the reason why this jury versus a reasonable jury is important is whether you're going to take into account what you know about what this jury did: how long it stayed out, what notes it wrote to the court, what eventual verdict it reached. And you just suggested to me that that was fair game to consider in this analysis, although one should be cautious about doing it.",
  "Well, a rational jury is not the jury that I said stayed out for 8 days and sent back a note on the 7th day. That's this jury.",
  "That's starting to look, Mr. Yang, very much like a directed verdict for the government on the part of a judge, because you're so abstracting it from this case and this jury and what this jury's reactions to everything that happened was that, you know, why not just go to the directed verdict route?",
  "You do have a jury -- excuse me. You do have a jury verdict, but you are giving us a formulation of the test that essentially pretends that the jury is not there and that we know nothing about how it reacted to various things.",
  "Sorry. A question mark.",
  "But critical to the Court's view in that case was that the -- the defendant could not have contested that element.",
  "Can I ask you a different question, Mr. Yang, which is, you know, this difference in the formulation of the test, which I find it hard to wrap my mind around, but -- and it strikes me that there's two different ways of saying the same thing. But I'm told that there's a fair bit of scholarship out there which suggests that courts that use one formulation tend to come out one way, and courts that use the other formulation tend to come out the other way. And I'm just wondering what your view of that is, that somehow one formulation seems to put the emphasis on the entire case, whereas the other formulation seems to put the emphasis on only the government's evidence, and that that makes a difference in the end.",
  "Well, even since Williams Packing, there was South Carolina v. Regan. And that case can also be understood as a kind of equitable exception to the rule, which would be inconsistent with thinking that the rule is jurisdictional.",
  "Mr. Long, aren't there places in this Act -- fees and penalties -- that were specifically put under the Anti-Injunction Act? There's one on health care plans, there's one on pharmaceutical manufacturers, where Congress specifically said the Anti-Injunction Act is triggered for those. It does not say that here. Wouldn't that suggest that Congress meant for a different result to obtain?",
  "No, but it -- in section 9008 and in section 9010, it specifically referred - -",
  "-- to the part of the code where the Anti-Injunction Act is.",
  "But, Mr. Long, aren't you trying to rewrite the statute, in a way? The statute has two sections. One is the \"you have to have insurance\" section and the other is the sanction. The statute has two different sets of exceptions corresponding to those two different sections. You're trying to suggest that the statute says, well, it's your choice, either buy insurance or pay a -- or pay a fee. But that's not the way the statute reads. And Congress, it must be supposed, you know, made a decision that that shouldn't be the way the statute reads, that it should instead be a regulatory command and a penalty attached to that command.",
  "General - -",
  "General, can I ask - -",
  "General, can I ask you about Reed Elsevier? Justice Ginsburg suggested that the language was very similar in Reed Elsevier as it is here, but there are even further similarities. Reed Elsevier pointed out that the provision in question wasn't in Title 28. Here, too, it's not in Title 28. In Reed Elsevier, it was pointed out that the provision there had numerous exceptions to it. Here, too, there are numerous exceptions that we find that have been created by the courts over the years. In Reed Elsevier, the question was essentially one about timing. Come to court after you file your registration. Here, too, the question is one about timing. Come to court after you make -- after you pay your taxes. So, Reed Elsevier seems in multiple respects on all fours with this case. Why is that wrong?",
  "I take the point - -",
  "-- but if you would comment on the similarities of Reed Elsevier to this case. How do you think it's different, at all?",
  "General - -",
  "Could I - -",
  "Sorry.",
  "The nature of the representation you made, that the only consequence is the penalty, suppose a person does not purchase insurance, a person who is obligated to do so under the statute, doesn't do it, pays the penalty instead, and that person finds herself in a position where she is asked the question, have you ever violated any Federal law, would that person have violated a federal law?",
  "And that's because - -",
  "But as long as they've paid the penalty - -",
  "Mr. Katsas, is your basic position that when we're talking about the jurisdiction of the district courts, a statute has to say it's jurisdictional to be jurisdictional?",
  "Well, how is -- I mean, I suppose one could try to make a distinction between this case and Reed Elsevier by focusing on the difference between instituting something and maintaining something. I'm suggesting that instituting is more what a litigant does, and maintaining, as opposed to dismissing, is more what a judge does.",
  "Mr. Katsas, do you think a person who is subject to the mandate but not subject to the penalty would have standing?",
  "And what would that look like? What would the argument be as to what the injury was?",
  "Could I just understand, Mr. Katsas, when the States say that they're injured, are they talking about the people who are eligible now but who are not enrolled? Or are they also talking about people who will become newly eligible?",
  "But who are eligible now.",
  "But that does seem odd, to suggest that the State is being injured because people who could show up tomorrow with or without this law will show up in greater numbers. I mean, presumably the State wants to cover people whom it is declared eligible for this benefit.",
  "General, you've talked on -- a couple of times about other alternatives that Congress might have had, other alternatives that the Respondents suggest to deal with this problem, in particular, the alternative of mandating insurance at the point at which somebody goes to a hospital or an emergency room and asks for care. Did Congress consider those alternatives? Why did it reject them? How should we think about the question of alternative ways of dealing with these problems?",
  "And this is especially true, isn't it --",
  "-- General Verrilli, because in this context, the subsidizers eventually become the subsidized?",
  "I suppose, though, General, one question is whether the determined efforts of Congress not to refer to this as a tax make a difference. I mean, you're suggesting we should just look to the practical operation. We shouldn't look at labels. And that seems right, except that here we have a case in which Congress determinedly said this is not a tax. And the question is why should that be irrelevant?",
  "Well, Mr. Clement, now it seems as though you're just talking about a matter of timing, that Congress can regulate the transaction. And the question is when does it make best sense to regulate that transaction? And Congress surely has it within its authority to decide, rather than at the point of sale, given an insurance-based mechanism, it makes sense to regulate it earlier. It's just a matter of timing.",
  "Well, doesn't that seem a little bit, Mr. Clement, cutting the baloney thin? I mean, health insurance exists only for the purpose of financing health care. The two are inextricably interlinked. We don't get insurance so that we can stare at our insurance certificate. We get it so that we can go and access health care.",
  "But, Mr. Clement, this goes back to the Chief Justice's question. But, of course, the theory behind, not just the Government's case, but the theory behind this law is that people are in this market right now, and they're in this market because people do get sick, and because when people get sick, we provide them with care without making them pay. And it would be different, you know, if you were up here saying, I represent a class of Christian Scientists, then you might be able to say, look, you know, why are they bothering me? But absent that, you're in this market. You're an economic actor.",
  "Well, we're talking about the health insurance market, which is designed to access the health care market.",
  "Well, once again, though, who's in commerce and when are they in commerce? If the effect of all these uninsured people is to raise everybody's premiums, not just when they get sick, if they get sick, but right now in the aggregate, and Wickard and Raich tell us we should look at the aggregate, and the aggregate of all these uninsured people are increasing the normal family premium, Congress says, by a thousand dollars a year -- those people are in commerce. They're making decisions that are affecting the price that everybody pays for this service.",
  "No, this is very different, Mr. Clement, and it's different because of the nature of the health care service, that you are entitled to health care when you go to an emergency room, when you go to a doctor, even if you can't pay for it. So, the difference between your hypotheticals and the real case is the problem of uncompensated care, which --",
  "Well, Mr. Carvin --",
  "Please.",
  "I've forgotten my question.",
  "See what it means to be the junior Justice?",
  "Well that's why I suggested, Mr. Carvin, that it might be different if you were raising an as-applied challenge and presenting a class of people whom you could say clearly would not be in the health care market. But you're raising a facial challenge, and we can't really know which of the -- which of the many, many people that this law addresses in fact will not participate in the health care market and in fact will not impose costs on all the rest of us. So, the question is, can Congress respond to those facts, that we have no crystal ball, that we can't tell who is and isn't going to be in the health insurance market, and say most of these people will be and most of these people will thereby impose costs on the rest of us and that's a problem that we can deal with on a class-wide basis?",
  "Mr. Carvin, a large part of this argument has concerned the question of whether certain kinds of people are active participants in a market or not active participants in a market. And your test, which is a test that focuses on this activity/inactivity distinction, would force one to confront that problem all the time. Now, if you look over the history of the Commerce Clause, what you see is that there were sort of unhappy periods when the Court used tests like this, direct versus indirect, commerce versus manufacturing. I think most people would say that those things didn't really work. And the question is why should this test, inactive versus active, work any better?",
  "So, Mr. Clement, let's start with the text. And you suggest, and I think that there is -- this is right, that there is a textual basis for saying that the guarantee-issue and the community-rating provisions are tied to the mandate. And you -- you pointed to where that was in the findings. Is there a textual basis for anything else? Because I've been unable to find one. It seems to me that if you look at the text, the sharp dividing line is between guarantee issue, community ratings, on the one hand; everything else, on the other.",
  "Although the exchanges function perfectly well in Utah, where there is no mandate. They function differently, but they function. And the question is always, does Congress want half a loaf? Is half a loaf better than no loaf? And on something like the exchanges, it seems to me a perfect example where half a loaf is better than no loaf. The exchanges will do something. They won't do everything that Congress envisioned.",
  "Mr. Clement, you just said something which you say a lot in your brief. You say the question is the manner in which it would have operated. And I think that that's not consistent with our cases. And I guess the best example would be Booker, where we decided not to sever provisions, notwithstanding that the sentencing guidelines clearly operate in a different manner now than they did when Congress passed them. They operate as advisory rather than mandatory.",
  "Well, it's not inconsistent with our practice, right, Mr. Clement? I mean, you have to go back decades and decades and decades, and I'm not sure even then you could find a piece of legislation that we refused to sever for this reason.",
  "Mr. Clement - -",
  "And, Mr. Kneedler, that would be a revolution - -",
  "-- in our severability law, wouldn't it?",
  "I mean, we have never suggested that we are going to say, look, this legislation was a brokered compromise, and we're going to try to figure out exactly what would have happened in the complex parliamentary shenanigans that go on across the street and figure out whether they would have made a difference. Instead, we look at the text that's actually given us. For some people, we look only at the text. It should be easy for Justice Scalia's clerks.",
  "But the problem, Mr. Farr, isn't it, that they're going to a pool of people that will gradually get older and unhealthier. That's the way the thing works. Once you say that the insurance companies have to cover all of the sick people and all of the old people, the -- the rates climb. More and more young people and healthy people say why should we participate; we can just get it later when we get sick. So, they leave the market. The rates go up further. More people leave the market. And the whole system crashes and burns, becomes unsustainable.",
  "And this is not - -",
  "-- like what I think. What do I know? It's just what -- what's reflected in Congress's findings, that it's -- it looks at some States and says this system crashed and burned. It looked at another State with the minimum coverage provision and said this one seems to work; so, we'll package the minimum coverage provision with the nondiscrimination provisions.",
  "Mr. Farr, I understood that the answer that you gave to Justice Scalia was essentially that the minimum coverage provision was not the heart of the Act. Instead, the minimum coverage provision was a tool to make the nondiscrimination provisions -- community rating, guaranteed issue - - work. So, if you assume that, that all the minimum coverage is, is a tool to make those provisions work, then I guess I would refocus Justice Scalia's question and say, if we know that something is just a tool to make other provisions work, shouldn't that be the case in which those other provisions are severed along with the tool?",
  "Mr. Clement, can I ask you a -- just a matter of clarification? Would you be making the same argument if, instead of the Federal Government picking up 90 percent of the cost, the Federal Government picked up 100 percent of the cost?",
  "The exact same argument. So -- so, that really reduces to the question of why is a big gift from the Federal Government a matter of coercion? In other words, the Federal Government is here saying we're giving you a boatload of money. There are no -- there's no matching funds requirement, there are no extraneous conditions attached to it, it's just a boatload of Federal money for you to take and spend on poor people's healthcare. It doesn't sound coercive to me, I have to tell you.",
  "Yes, I mean, if you --",
  "Yes, you do make that argument in your brief, just a standalone program, a boatload of money, no extraneous conditions, no matching funds, is coercive?",
  "Let me give you a hypothetical, Mr. Clement.",
  "Now, suppose I'm an employer, and I see somebody I really like, and I want to hire that person. And I say I'm going to give you $10 million a year to come work for me. And the person says, well, I -- you know, I've never been offered anywhere approaching $10 million a year. Of course, I'm going to say yes to that. Now, we would both be agreed that that's not coercive, right?",
  "Wow. Wow. I'm offering you $10 million a year to come work for me, and you're saying that this is anything but a great choice?",
  "Ah. But, Mr. Clement --",
  "Mr. Clement, can that possibly be? When a taxpayer pays taxes to the Federal Government, the person is acting as a citizen of the United States. When a taxpayer pays taxes to New York, a person is acting as a citizen of New York. And New York could no more tell the Federal Government what to do with the Federal Government's money than the Federal Government can tell New York what to do with the monies that New York is collecting.",
  "Mr. Clement, let's let this --",
  "Well, if you are right, Mr. Clement, doesn't that mean that Medicaid is unconstitutional now?",
  "So, when does a program become too big? I'd want you to -- give me a dollar number.",
  "I thought $1 trillion --",
  "So, on the third -- on the third, suppose you have the current program and Congress wakes up tomorrow and says we think that there's too much fraud and abuse in the program, and we're going to put some new conditions on how the States use this money so we can prevent fraud and abuse, and we're going to tie it to everything that's been there initially. Unconstitutional?",
  "I guess I don't get the idea. I mean, Congress can legislate fraud and abuse restrictions in Medicaid, and Congress can legislate coverage expansions in Medicaid.",
  "But, Mr. Clement --",
  "-- that is very confusing, because the idea behind cooperative Federal/State programs was exactly a federalism idea. It was to give the States the ability to administer those programs. It was to give the States a great deal of flexibility in running those programs. And that's exactly what Medicaid is.",
  "Cooperative federalism --",
  "-- does not mean that there are no Federal mandates and no Federal restrictions involved in a program that uses 90 percent here, 100 percent Federal money. It means there's flexibility built into the program subject to certain rules that the Federal Government has about how it wishes its money to be used. It's like giving a gift certificate. If I give you a gift certificate for one store, you can't use it for other stores. But still, you can use it for all kinds of different things.",
  "Well, General, what's the -- been the history of its use? Has the Secretary in fact ever made use of that authority?",
  "And, General Verrilli --",
  "General Verrilli, before you do that, I'm sorry, but in response to the Chief Justice's question, I mean, \"the money or your life\" has consequence because we're worried that that person is actually going to shoot. So, I think that this question about are -- what do we think the Secretary is going to do is an important one. And as I understand it, I mean, when the Secretary withdraws funds, what the Secretary is doing is withdrawing funds from poor people's health care, and that the Secretary is reluctant and loath to take money away from poor people's health care and that that's why these things are always worked out. It's that the Secretary really doesn't want to use this power, and so the Secretary sits down with the State and figures out a way for the Secretary not to use the power.",
  "But, General Verrilli, you're not willing to give away whether the APA would bar that, but the APA surely has to apply to a discretionary act of the Secretary.",
  "May I ask you --",
  "Mr. Goldstein, doesn't --",
  "Mr. Stewart, there's this other regulation which is I guess in the coverage section, 779.241, which says that if an employee performs any work that in a practical sense is an essential part of consummating the sale of the goods, he'll be considered to be selling the goods. So, I guess this question is a two-part question. Do you agree that that regulation does cover the -- these detailers? And the second part is, if you do, you know, how does it work that we should understand \"sale\" one way for purposes of coverage and another way for purposes of exemption?",
  "But that seems a little bit blind to the way the industry actually works. The way this industry actually works is the real work is done by the detailer getting the doctor to say, yes, I'm going to start prescribing this where it's medically appropriate. The actual sales from the company to the pharmacy just follows from however successful the detailer is.",
  "Well, that might be one thing that they are concerned about, but it may not be the only thing. I mean, if you look at these regulations, it seems as though what they're trying to do is draw a distinction between people who actually consummate transactions, transactional people, and people who are pitchmen. And -- and what the Department of Labor here is saying is detailers are people who make pitches; they're not people who consummate the transactions.",
  "But why isn't that possible? I mean, your brief seemed to suggest that in every industry there needs to be some group of people who would be classified as outside salesmen. And that's not necessarily the case. There may be some industries, and here it's a result of regulation, or it may be because of other business practices, where there just isn't anybody who's an outside salesman.",
  "But, Mr. Clement, I thought that in 2004 there were two proposals, really, and one was the proposal that was changed, and the other was the proposal to get rid of this promotional stuff and to allow people who promoted products to qualify as outside salesmen, and the agency specifically rejected that suggestion.",
  "Well, Mr. Clement --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "You've suggested --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Mr. Clement, I guess I'm not sure I understand what you just said. If -- forget the transfer of title business, but if it's just -- we're requiring a transaction here. And we're drawing a line between people who do transactions and people who just advertise or make pitches or whatever you want to do it. That's perfectly consistent with the statute, isn't it? I mean, you can argue about is it the only possible reading; you can even argue about whether it's the best possible reading. But it's surely a -- a possible reading.",
  "Well, I suppose that that's a question for them. I read their amicus briefs to sort of suggest two things. Sometimes they just talk about transactions, and sometimes they talk about transfer of title.",
  "Well, I think that they would say that it doesn't make any difference, because they've never really seen a person who makes transactions without transferring title. So, I think that --",
  "-- they would think the -- the difference is --",
  "But, Mr. Clement, this isn't a change. You've referred to it as a change in a lot of ways -- in a lot of times, but what we have here is an agency that, for some number of years, thought that this was not the most urgent problem on their plate. Indeed, one would think this is a pretty peculiar Department of Labor if they thought that this was the most urgent problem on their plate. So, they didn't enforce it. But now the question has come up. And so, they say we'll look to our regulations. This falls on one side of the regulation. Now, you've been given a gift for all these years is one way of looking at it, because -- because you were not their most urgent problem; and so, they didn't enforce their own regulations against you.",
  "But don't you think that the way this works -- I mean, the way we should all hope it works is that the detailer comes in, the detailer provides information, the doctor says that's very interesting, I want to think about it, I'm going to think about it. Then the doctor reads some medical journals; then maybe the doctor goes to a convention and talks to other doctors about the product. I mean, that's what you would hope that a doctor would do before a doctor decided I'm going to start prescribing this medicine. And the detail work is a part of that, but so are many other things before the doctor actually decides to do something.",
  "Do you think that if -­",
  "Do you think that if we stick to the language of the statute, if we are, indeed, looking for an express provision, do you agree that there isn't any here?",
  "Mr. Estrada, I mean, that's true, that it took Congress a long time to decide to do this. I think the question is, once having decided to do this, what did it decide to do; and whether it would make sense, once having decided to do this, to have the guidelines be the new guidelines, but the mandatory minimums be the old mandatory minimums. And what everybody understood was that if that were the case, if the new guidelines and the old mandatory minimums sort of -- both applied together, it would lead to ridiculous disparities in the way people were sentenced. And so, the question is, once having decided to do this, can't we assume that Congress decided to do it?",
  "But the problem with this -­",
  "But, Mr. Estrada, you don't -­",
  "Mr. Estrada, before you do, if I can understand your argument as it relates to Justice Scalia's questions -- I just want to make sure I understand it. There's a person who has 4.99 grams of crack cocaine. And you do not dispute, do you, that that person would be subject to the new guidelines, which are based on the 18-to-1 ratio rather than the 100-to-1 ratio?",
  "Okay. So, you do not dispute that. So -- so, then we're living in a world in which the person who has 4.99 grams of cocaine is getting the 18-to-1 ratio, and a person who has 5 grams is getting the 100-to-1 ratio that's embedded in the mandatory minimums.",
  "Now, when Judge Easterbrook talked about this anomaly -- and he, of course, adopted the position that you adopted. But he just said, look, there is no earthly reason for this. It's just that we can't find a clear enough statement in the statute. I guess the question I would ask you is: Can you do better than Judge Easterbrook? Can you find an earthly reason for why Congress would have wanted to create this weird halfway system in which, if you have 4-1/2 grams of cocaine, one rule applies, but if you have 5 grams, another rule applies?",
  "But could I understand what you're saying, Mr. Estrada? Because if Justice Alito is right, then the new guidelines that the Sentencing Commission has in fact promulgated should not be being applied right now to those who committed crimes before the enactment date. And that's not what's happening now on the ground, is it?",
  "Mr. Freeman, could I try a hypothetical on you? And it's -- it really is going to this question of what Ferris means. So suppose that there's a government program, and it's to purchase airplanes. And it's -- the authorization language says this is subject to appropriations, in the same way that this language does. And the government, under this program, enters into 10 contracts of a million dollars each to buy 10 airplanes. But then it turns out that Congress appropriates only $9 million, not $10 million. So my question is: Now there are 10 contractors and -- but there's a shortfall of a million dollars --",
  "-- do those contractors have contractual rights under Ferris?",
  "Yes. So the appropriation has been made. It's a $9 million appropriation.",
  "So -- so either one of these airplane manufacturers is going to not have what he contracted for, or all of them are not going to have what they contracted for, because everybody is going to -- their contract is going to be sliced.",
  "My understanding, Mr. Freeman, is that that is what Ferris said, was that Ferris said in that situation where it turns out that there's a shortfall but where there are contractual commitments, that -- that the government is bound to live up to those contractual commitments. And if there's a shortfall, then it comes out of the Judgment Fund.",
  "Well, but that's partly why I asked you my hypothetical, Mr. Freeman, because I sort of wanted to see whether you would distinguish the hypothetical on that basis -­",
  "-- but you didn't. You said no, it really doesn't matter. Even if the government is not obligated to enter into contracts, if the government has entered into too many, too bad; we can't make those additional appropriations.",
  "But that runs you right into Ferris. Then you're saying that there's no difference between the standard Ferris-type appropriation, which is just an amount of money, and this kind of appropriation, which is up to or not to exceed that amount of money.",
  "Mr. Phillips, if you look at this situation, it seems pretty clear that Congress did want to do something, which was to limit the amount of money that was going to the tribes under these contracts. Do you think that there's a way that Congress can do that --",
  "-- consistent with this scheme that's set up by the statute? How could Congress do that? You know, if -- if -- if they can't do it this way, how could they?",
  "When you say \"specific limitations,\" what would that look like?",
  "Mr. Phillips, do you think -- and the long question here is what did Congress want. And what -- one answer might be Congress wanted exactly what the government says it wanted. But another answer might be something different, that actually, Congress wanted there to be unlimited funds for these tribes, but that it wanted to shift the costs of some of those funds to the Judgment Fund outside of the Interior budget.",
  "Do you -- I mean, do you contest the government's view of what Congress wanted here? And if so, how?",
  "I guess what I don't understand about the government's argument, Mr. Freeman, is exactly what the contractual rights of the tribes become. I mean, as I -- this is supposed to be a contract, and we've held that it's a contract, and usually contracting parties have rights to something.",
  "So what do they have a right to, in your view?",
  "That was -- that was a straightforward question.",
  "No, but what do they have a right to with respect to these additional overhead costs?",
  "What does each individual tribe have a right to?",
  "So you think they do have a right to a pro rata share?",
  "In other words, the Secretary could not say, oh, you know, these tribes have been doing a better job, so we'll give it to them; or these tribes need it more, so we'll give it to them. You think that there's a contractual right to a pro rata share.",
  "Well, then this is a very -- this is a very strange kind of contractual right. The -- the contracting tribe has a right to have the Secretary use discretion to decide how much the contracting tribe gets. What kind of contract is that?",
  "No, I'm not contesting -- I mean, clearly you think and the Secretary thinks that there's an obligation to distribute all that money.",
  "And -- and I don't think anybody disagrees with that. The question is what each individual tribe has a contractual right to.",
  "Well, how would they get anything, anyway? I mean, your brief suggests that, somehow, there are these unsecured creditors in the mix who are going to receive some benefit if your understanding of this statute goes forward. But, you know, in a circumstance like this, doesn't the secured creditor either get the property or get the money from the property, and the unsecured creditors are out of the mix regardless?",
  "But those are -- those continue forward. So even if the secured creditor got the property, there would be mechanic's liens on the property, isn't that right?",
  "Mr. Neff, can I understand how your system would actually work in practice? Suppose you have an -- an auction, and there is -- the top value was $500. And then you have the secured creditor, let's say, is in the position of the United States and comes in and says, we couldn't credit bid, but we -- excuse me -- we couldn't pay cash, but we think it's $750.",
  "And, now, the court has to decide whether it's $500 or $750, after the auction has gone forward. What happens?",
  "Well, now, let's say the court says, You know, I think that the government is right; it's really $750. But you've already had a sale.",
  "And -- and you've sold it for $500.",
  "But doesn't clause (i) depend upon a judicial valuation? In clause (i), the Court has to say, what is the present value of your property, so that it knows what the right income stream is.",
  "How about in subsection (iii), where it talks about substitute collateral? That's completely a judicial valuation, isn't it?",
  "The Petitioner suggests that the usual rule that the specific governs, rather than the general provision, doesn't apply in this case because the specific is not a subset of the general. What's -- what's -- what's your view about that?",
  "Well, that assumes that you can just pull out a wad of cash from your back pocket, but, mostly, the debtors are not in that position. So it just seems like a gigantic waste of time.",
  "Well, on the standing point, I mean, the -- the distinction that you're setting up between acquisition of land and use of land -- this goes back to Justice Scalia's question -- that strikes me as -- as artificial, that the question of when land is acquired is all tied up with the question of what use is going to be made of it. The government doesn't acquire this land with no object in mind. It thinks about how the land is going to be used. So that in the end, this really is a land use statute, isn't it?",
  "And the statute as well thinks of this as a -- is a statute that's designed to promote economic development, which is dependent on some understanding of how the land is actually going to be used by the tribes.",
  "Ms. Millett, it also says: \"Under this section.\"",
  "And the section describes the complaint. It says: \"The complainant shall set forth with particularity the nature of the right, title, or interest which the plaintiff claims.\" So the type of suit that this section has in mind is a suit in which the plaintiff claims a right, title or interest. And the language that you read, \"under this section,\" well, that's what this section is about, a suit in which a plaintiff claims the right, title or interest.",
  "Mr. Nelson, putting that question aside of whether this is or isn't a quiet title action, there's another question, which is whether sovereign immunity can come into effect after a suit has been filed. It seems to me a hard question, and one that has not been briefed by either party particularly. So I just ask you, is there case -- are there any cases that you can point to that suggest that sovereign immunity cannot come into effect after a suit has been filed? Because what the government says is, you know, circumstances change, conditions change on the ground, sovereign immunity can pop up where it didn't exist before. Is there any precedent that you have to negate that?",
  "But, Mr. Nelson - -",
  "Mr. Nelson, could I understand the scope of your argument? Because I had understood -- let's take the timing question aside for a minute. Let's -- let's assume that you had filed this suit after title had transferred. I had understood that your argument was, yes, you should be allowed to do that because, even though this was filed after title had transferred, yours is just not a quiet title action. And it's not a quiet title action because you're not seeking title yourself. Isn't that the question? Isn't that your argument?",
  "So your argument really has nothing to do with the question of timing. Your argument would be the same even if title had transferred prior to your filing your lawsuit.",
  "Well, as I understood your brief, 49 pages of it were about one thing, and there's one footnote that's about something else. In other words, all of your brief is basically saying: Ours is just not a quiet title action, and so we should be allowed to proceed irrespective of when the government acquires title. And then you have this little additional argument which says: By the way, we started this lawsuit before the government had title anyway. So, I mean, the briefing in this case is all about what you now say is your weakest point.",
  "I think - -",
  "I suppose the question, Mr. Nelson, though, is whether you can provide us with a reason why Congress would have wanted what you call quiet title suits -- and I agree that your definition is the traditional definition. When somebody -- when the plaintiff is a -- is himself asserting a right or interest -- why those suits should be barred, but your suit involving a third party should not be barred. What could possibly be the reason to distinguish between those two sets of cases? Now, you might just say, I don't have to give you a reason, this is what the result of the statute says. But if I say, just try to provide me with a reason why Congress would have wanted that distinction, what would you say?",
  "Well, but -- but in saying that you've just broadened it, or arguably, you have. If -- if you think that the quiet title action is really about the narrower set of cases, which is when a person himself claims title, how can you get from that to say that there is an express or an implied refusal of -- of this kind of claim?",
  "But you would agree, Mr. Hoffman, that if there were an exhaustion requirement, it would not apply only to Nigeria, but also to the Netherlands and to the U.K.?",
  "Well, Ms. Sullivan, your argument is very broad, and I want to ask you a question. Your case might properly be dismissed. But take a different case, and it's a -- just a variation on the Marbois incident, where instead of being attacked in Philadelphia, the French ambassador to Britain is attacked in London, but is attacked by a United States citizen, who then comes home to the United States, seeks refuge in the United States. And the French ambassador -- the French ambassador wants to bring an action. Wouldn't the ATS have contemplated exactly that sort of action? I mean, why would it make any difference whether the attack on the French ambassador by a United States citizen occurred in Philadelphia or occurred in London?",
  "Well, I think I'm advised by the Solicitor General's office that there were very few extradition treaties at that time. And even if extradition was a possible remedy, I mean why shouldn't we understand the ATS to provide supplemental remedies as well, civil as well as criminal, civil as well as extradition?",
  "Well, we should fix that then. But that's not the question here, right? The question here is -- is the different one of whether you ever get to the exhaustion question.",
  "And if you go back to the reverse Marbois, you said Congress didn't speak, but I think what we said in Sosa is that Congress did speak, that Congress was referring to exactly that kind of tort when it passed the Alien Tort Statute. And you are saying it would have made a difference to Congress that the incident occurred in a different place even though the attacker was a United States citizen seeking refuge in the United States and leaving the French with no remedy.",
  "But - -",
  "But, Ms. Sullivan, I'm going to read you something from Sosa, which -- it talks all about the rule that it adopts and then it says: \"This is generally consistent with the reasoning of many of the courts and judges who faced the issue before it reached this Court. See Filartiga.\" And then it quotes Filartiga: \"For purposes of civil liability, the torturer has become like the pirate and slave trader before him, an enemy of all mankind.\" So we gave a stamp of approval to Filartiga and Filartiga's understanding that there were certain categories of offenders who were today's pirates.",
  "And isn't that really the way to reconcile the Dutch positions? The Dutch are objecting because they think they have a fair forum, but when the judges were faced with a case arising from Libya, they thought that there was no fair forum there. And that's the difference, that in one case there was exhaustion and in the other there wasn't.",
  "Well, then you're not talking about purpose; you're talking about function, right? You're just using purpose as a kind of strange synonym for function. But you're not talking about purpose of either the homeowner or the manufacturer of the boat. You're just saying what does this -- or what does this thing, this floating home, do.",
  "Right. So you are really talking about a function test. And you are using strange words, because they come out of our opinions - - kind of not your fault. But you're really saying that what should apply here is a function test. We are looking at this floating home. What does it do? Is it just a thing that sits, or is it a thing that transports things over water. Isn't that your test?",
  "Well, how do we know that.",
  "How do we know that, Mr. Fisher? I mean, maybe these floating homes are just a poor man's houseboat, right? That the point of getting a floating home is actually to have a home that you can hook up to a boat and move from place to place, and so you don't have to, you know, have the motor running all the time or have the capacity to move it all the time, but when you want to move it on water and when you want to move your possessions on water, you have the capacity to do so.",
  "So, Mr. Gannon, you think that even at the moment that the thing is being transported, and let's say that the thing has, you know, various furniture and things on it, you think even at that moment under section 3, it's not a -- it might not be a vessel?",
  "Take the inner tube and, you know, paste a couple of pennies on the inner tube. Now it carries things. There are things on the inner tube, and it floats.",
  "Well, suppose, Mr. Frederick, this. Suppose we had a trial on the question of whether these floating homes or this floating home was a vessel, and we found out that actually 99 percent of people who buy floating homes move it exactly once. They purchase the floating home and then they move it to the place where they want the home to be, and then it sits there. And this was just a clear evidence that, you know, except if there's a hurricane or a tornado, people do not move floating homes. They buy it, they move it to where they want to live, and then it sits. In that case, do you think the thing is a vessel?",
  "Well, it's a statute - -",
  "You're reading the statute -- you're reading the statute as if it says something can be transported over water. But the statute doesn't say that. It says something can be used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water. So that -- that the question is whether this thing is transporting other things over water, and whether that's its function; and in my hypothetical it's not its function. Its function is to serve as a house. That house happens to be on water, but it's just a house.",
  "Mr. Frederick, if that is the case, then your test really comes down to how securely is something fastened. I mean, you have to deal with Evansville's wharf boat and you have to deal with Cage's dry dock, and you have to deal with all these floating casinos and restaurants. And you're saying that in all these cases we are supposed to look to is it a rope or is it a cable, how many cables, how quickly can it be disengaged, and that that's going to end up being the test that you would have us adopt which is how easy it is to get out of the port.",
  "That really does become a jury question -- a question of fact for everything, right? You know, are there six cables, are there nine cables, what are they made of, you know, how long is it going to take to rip up the -- the I-beams, whatever?",
  "Could I make sure I understand something that you said, Mr. Schnapper. When you talk about the affirmative defenses that the Government can raise, that is -- those are exhaustion defenses under the applicable anti-discrimination statute, right? It's whatever exhaustion requirements Title VII sets out or whatever exhaustion requirements the ADEA sets out; is that correct?",
  "Those time periods relevant to the MSPB?",
  "And would that --",
  "And would that put the employee who has a mixed case in the same position as an employee who has a straight anti-discrimination case?",
  "I'm sorry -- go ahead. I'm sorry.",
  "Mr. Schnapper, if I disagree with everything that you just said, I can still rule for you in this case, right?",
  "Because there does seem to be a good deal of difference between the question, what happens to something that is clearly a mixed case, and alternatively, the question of whether something is a mixed case; that is, whether it includes a claim about an action which the employee may appeal to the MSPB. And one could think that questions about what can be appealed to the MSPB ought to go to the Federal circuit under this statutory language in a way that questions that are involved in this case do not.",
  "Well, that just makes the next case very complicated but it has nothing to do with this case; is that correct?",
  "But, Ms. Harrington, go back to the question that the Chief Justice asked you, because the question was: Should we read \"judicially reviewable action\" as something different from action subject to judicial review, which is how you would normally read that language, as something different from just final agency action that you can take to a court. Not saying which court, that you can just take to a court. And you're asking us -- you said it's a term of art. So I guess the next question is: How do you get the definition of the term of art that you say exists in this statute?",
  "Yes, it has to be an action that -- you know, the MSPB is done and now you have a certain number of days to take it to a court. So that's the normal way you would read that language.",
  "But you say no, it really, you know, it includes some kinds of decisions and not other kinds of decisions and the effect of that is that it's really a switch as to which court you get to take the action to, which is a very counterintuitive way to read this language. So I guess I'm asking you: Where do you find the definition of the term of art? And I think what your answer is going to be is this notion the board shall decide the issue of discrimination and the applicable action; is that correct.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Ms. Harrington, would you agree that this is a remarkably strange way of Congress trying to accomplish this objective? I mean, if Congress were really saying we don't want procedural determinations to go to the district court, that's a very easy thing to say. Congress does not need to send you -- you know, involve six different cross-references and unnatural reading of statutory language. And, you know, in the end, your argument just is based on this notion that Congress used the word decide rather than dispose of in this single provision. The argument would completely collapse if that were not the case. It just seems like if Congress wanted what you say it wanted, Congress would not have done it in this extremely complicated and backhanded way.",
  "But you're not -- the Federal circuit didn't exist at the time that these statutes were written, so what -- you know, really, it would have been taken to the various courts of appeals, and you wouldn't have gotten that uniformity anyway.",
  "Right, but Justice Sotomayor is right, that when you define \"judicially reviewable action\" in your way, then 7702(e)(1)(B) becomes nonsensical and you have to save it by inserting additional language, by saying, you know, \"and other\" -- \"and other kinds of action.\"",
  "Well, it wouldn't make sense, but it's what the language would command if \"judicially reviewable action\" means what you say \"judicially reviewable action\" means.",
  "Mr. Srinivasan, what you say has a good deal to recommend it, and it's basically, you know, why should we read the Tucker Act to reverse everything that we know about sovereign immunity, but it's really hard to get that from the text of this -- the Tucker Act. In fact -- I mean, I guess my question is: Do you have any textual argument for the result that you are asking us to reach?",
  "Well, that's not really a textual argument. That's an argument about how we've sensibly limited the reach of the Tucker Act. But the Tucker Act does seem to include what your friend there says it includes --",
  "-- against any statute. Not any statute except the ones with remedial provisions, but just any statute.",
  "Mr. Srinivasan --",
  "How specific does the other statute have to be? Suppose there were another statute that just said any party can bring suits to enforce any rights against any persons under this statute. Would you be making the same argument?",
  "Yes. If that's all the statute says. It just says any party can bring suit to enforce rights under this statute. So there’s not a lot of hoopla and a lot of detail about a remedial scheme. Would you still say that -- this controls over the Tucker Act?",
  "How about if a statute has no remedial provision at all; it just lists a set of legal obligations, but it’s a generally applicable statute, it doesn't concern only the United States? Would your argument still apply that the Tucker Act has no force?",
  "So then your argument really isn't about another statute having a remedial scheme. In the briefs, you present it as another statute has a remedial scheme, of course you should look to that more particular remedial scheme. But you would take the argument and say, even if the other statute doesn't have a remedial scheme, we don't look to the Tucker Act; we just think of the Tucker Act as having a limitation that is not in the Tucker Act's test -- text in order to make the Tucker Act consistent with everything we thought we knew about principles of sovereign immunity?",
  "Mr. Jacobs --",
  "-- the -- the import of the Government's argument is that if your interpretation governed, we would be facing, really, a quite massive change in the law of sovereign immunity as we've known it until this time. So I will give you an -- Congress decides to pass a statute, and the statute has a cause of action in it. And the drafters say to each other, do we have to say that the Government retains sovereign immunity? And everybody says, no, the rules are that if we say nothing at all, the Government does retain sovereign immunity. Now, under your world, the next time Congress passes such a statute and that question comes up, you would say, oh, we have to say that the Government waives -- retains its sovereign immunity, because if we don't say that, somebody's going to bring an action under the Tucker Act. So for every statute, both the ones that have been written under the old rules and the new ones to come, we have completely flipped the presumption. Now, Congress is going to have to say when it wants to retain sovereign immunity, and if it doesn't -- if it doesn't, the Tucker Act applies, and you get to be in court.",
  "I don't think that quite answers the question. That's a -- that's a question about what FCRA means and whether under any standard, whether the fairly arguable standard or the express standard, you should win. And that's a different question. The question is what standard are we going to hold you to. Are we going to say, all you need to show is that it's fairly arguable, or are we going to say, no, unless there's an express statement that the Government has waived its sovereign immunity, the Government retains it? And as to that, you're asking us to flip the presumption from now on.",
  "But Mr. Jacobs, you are trying to evade a certain kind of limitation. The limitation that you are trying to evade is the rule that waivers of sovereign immunity have to be express. And that's the rule you are trying to evade by going under the Tucker Act.",
  "But then you wouldn't need to go under the Tucker Act. The difference between going under the Tucker Act and going under the statute is the difference between, you know, what -- what standard is a court going to hold you to, to decide whether there has been a waiver of sovereign immunity.",
  "Ms. Brenan, can I ask you what you mean by a plain statement? Because you've said a couple of times a plain statement to the contrary. Justice Sotomayor and Justice Alito have given you hypotheticals, very different from this case, but hypotheticals, where there is, I think, a strong inference that there was no adjudication of the particular Federal claim alleged. You said that's not a plain statement, even though it seems as though there is a strong inference. So what would be a plain statement?",
  "Yes, I don't know why they would say that either. Well, by the way, we're not adjudicating this, you know. So if that's your test, your test is an irrebuttable presumption.",
  "Could I go back, Ms. Brenan, to your basic theory, because I guess I'm not sure I understand what you're arguing now. In your brief, you talked about focusing on the error. So if evidence was admitted, you would say it doesn't matter that there were three different theories for why the admission of evidence was wrong; you should just look at the fact that we're talking about the admission of evidence. Now, is -- is that what you're arguing, or are you also saying what the states say in their amicus brief, that even if, you know, one claim is about the admission of evidence, and one claim is about ineffective assistance of counsel, you would still apply the same rule?",
  "Well, why does your theory make any sense? I mean, we're supposed to be interpreting a statute here that says whether the claim was adjudicated on the merits. Usually when we speak of claims, we speak of legal grounds for relief. We don't look at a claim and say, we'll just check, you know, what -- we don't use an operative facts test, and you seem to be suggesting that that's the kind of test we should use.",
  "Well, I may be just repeating some of my colleagues here, but I think if you take this opinion at face value, it cuts against you. I mean, it's a -- they're applying Cleveland. Cleveland is a constitutional decision. It's a Federal constitutional decision. The concurrence makes that completely clear. California has made it completely clear in other cases post Cleveland that it thinks it's applying the Sixth Amendment. Whether it's applying a correct interpretation of the Sixth Amendment is unclear, but it's also completely irrelevant. It thinks it's applying the Sixth Amendment, and it's reaching a Constitutional judgment, isn't it?",
  "You're quite right, it does not adopt the consensus standard. It specifically rejects the consensus standard, but it's entitled to do that. As a state court, with no Supreme Court decision that it has to follow, it can say, we have a different view of the Sixth Amendment. I'm just repeating what Justice Alito here said. And that's what it's doing. It's saying, we're applying the Sixth Amendment, we're applying it differently from the way these other courts have done so because we think they're wrong.",
  "But, Ms. O'Connell, where does that outer limit come from? You suggested looking to that statute as an analogy, but there would be no outer limit in application of that statute, would there?",
  "Ms. Marquez, could you tell me, if it were the case that somebody was limited to the state court record, what's your best example of a case in which, nonetheless, a stay would be appropriate; in which, nonetheless, consultation with the client was necessary for a full and fair adjudication? Because I have been trying to think of examples, and -- you know, I'm not doing very well, quite honestly. So what's your best one?",
  "General, could I ask you, you have been arguing on two different axes. One is how tight the standard should be to grant any stay at all, and the other is what limits there should be on how long a stay can be if a stay is warranted. And I'm just curious, if I forced you to prioritize, in terms of the state's interests in effective habeas adjudication, which is more important -- you know, cranking up the standard or making sure that there is a time limit in place?",
  "But ordered in that way, that, for you, the time limit is the more important?",
  "Yes, I know. But, really, I said, if I forced you to prioritize between the two.",
  "What situations would they be appropriate in?",
  "Ms. Schimmer, if you are right that no stay was appropriate in these circumstances, we would never reach the question of how much of a stay is appropriate in other circumstances; isn't that right?",
  "I'm saying the exact opposite.",
  "In other words, if there was one bright line, which says that stays are not appropriate in a record-based claim because there's really nothing that the client can contribute, then we'd have no need or cause to reach the second question of what happens, in a case where a stay might be appropriate, how long that stay should be.",
  "Well, Ms. Schimmer, why would that be? I mean, assume a case where you say a stay would be appropriate. So it's not a closed record case. It's a case where the client might be expected to provide information that's -- let's -- let's assume it's necessary to a full and fair adjudication of the habeas claim. Why would you cut it off at a year? Why wouldn't it be still true in 2 years, that a full and fair adjudication couldn't take place in those circumstances.",
  "Well, it's not an indefinite stay. I think the judge would do what the Chief Justice suggested, that -- you know, it's not for ever and ever. We're just going to come back to it periodically. But if the answer is the same, which is that the client's participation is necessary for a full and fair adjudication, then the court's answer should be the same, too. Why isn't that right?",
  "Well, Mr. Goldstein, assuming he was convicted of that, as you suggest, you have an underinclusiveness problem. The Government has an overinclusiveness problem.",
  "If you assume that this statute covers and is regularly used to cover both sets of people, both people with these very minor offenses and people with much more major offenses - -",
  "-- the at least apparent attractiveness of the government's position is that they've tried to cure their overinclusiveness problem. And they have done it by sticking on -- and -- you know, one can ask where this comes from in the statute - -",
  "-- but they have done it by sticking on something that attempts to address their overinclusiveness problem, so that people who are really misdemeanants get classified as misdemeanants, and people who are really aggravated felons get classified that way. And you have no similar cure for your underinclusiveness problem. So why shouldn't we go with their problem, which at least attempts to solve this problem?",
  "Do you think that the Attorney General could just issue some kind of directive telling all administrative law judges and officials to deny cancellation of removal to anybody who commits these kinds of offenses?",
  "To do the exact same thing - -",
  "-- but through - -",
  "-- an Attorney General directive.",
  "Well, Mr. Shah, the Board may have been doing these inquiries, but I just don't understand the statutory argument because the way the statute -- the way your own statutory argument runs is that if the conviction -- the State conviction, was a conviction for possession with intent to distribute, then those are the elements of a Federal -- of a Federal felony. And so the person -- and an aggravated felony. So you say, under the elements approach, this person has committed an aggravated felony. And the statutory directive is that, when a person has committed an aggravated, felony, he is deportable, and there is no exercise of discretion that can come into play. And so your whole back-end process, which says, oh, well, maybe not, maybe he's not automatically deportable, it doesn't come from the statute, and it seems to run into the statutory language, which says an aggravated felon must be deported, the end.",
  "Well, that's what the statute says, and that's what your own statutory analysis says.",
  "No, I'll just read you, Mr. Shah, this sentence from your brief -- and I could read you a thousand of these in your brief. \"Because Petitioner's Georgia conviction necessarily established that he knowingly possessed marijuana with the specific intent to distribute it, that conviction constitutes an aggravated felony.\" Well, if that conviction constitutes an aggravated felony, he has to be deported, and there is no exercise of discretion that this statute allows.",
  "Well, now, you've just put in words into your brief.",
  "-- and -- and really, truly, you say this 10 or 15 times.",
  "Mr. Shah, I think the problem with your main argument is that it leads you to a result that you don't want to accept because your main argument is all we've done in our past cases -- and I can argue with this, but your argument is all we've done is compare the elements. But if all we do is compare the elements, then we don't get to your discretionary scheme in which we also admit evidence of -- of the case-specific nature of the offense. I mean, so your arguments all go towards a very purist solution. And then you say, oh, no, that's a crazy solution. It's a crazy solution because we would wind up saying that misdemeanants, like this person, like people who are actually convicted under (b)(4) who are clearly misdemeanants, would wind up as aggravated felons and -- and must be deported.",
  "I don't think we really have an agreement - -",
  "-- because it seems to me that Carachuri actually says we don't just look to elements. But if we were just to look to elements in the way you're arguing for, we wouldn't get the result that you're arguing for.",
  "I don't think that that is quite right, Mr. Shah, because if you read this statute, what it most looks like is that Congress is simply classifying two different kinds of conduct. Congress has the -- the social sharing conduct, and that's in one section. And the everything else, the more dangerous conduct, is in another section. And so it's not something where it's like, oh, you're trying to get them to negate a specific -- a point. Congress has created two separate sections, two -- and one is a felony, and one is a misdemeanor. And that's the -- the real way to understand this statute. And then the categorical approach suggests, well, in that case, we accept the underinclusion, rather than the overinclusion.",
  "I guess I don't understand, Mr. Shah. That seems just a question of labeling to me. I mean, why should we -- why should we accept that labeling, rather than, look, what Congress did here was to say that certain kinds of offenses are felonies deserving of grave punishment, and other kinds of offenses are misdemeanors deserving of less than a year in prison, and -- and we see those -- those categories of conduct differently. And if you are saying that if Congress had -- had said two separate offenses, then the categorical approach means that Mr. Goldstein's client wins, I guess I just don't get what in this statute suggests something different from that.",
  "General Verrilli - -",
  "But, General Verrilli, this statute greatly expands the government's surveillance power. Nobody denies that. And so if the question from these lawyers' perspective is, what chance do I have of being overheard, and what precautions do I have to take, this statute makes them think about that question in an entirely different way, doesn't it?",
  "Yes, but if you take the baseline position before this statute and the position after this statute, these lawyers and other people in their situation are going to understand that this is just true, that the government is intercepting more material, and that they have to take greater precautions in order to keep their conversations confidential, if that's what they want to do, which lawyers want to do. So they're going to take precautions that they wouldn't have had to take the day before this statute was passed, it seems to me, just from a kind of commonsensical point of view.",
  "I guess I don't see why, General Verrilli, this case is any different from Monsanto. In Monsanto, the government deregulates genetically modified alfalfa, says, go plant it. Now, there were these farmers who were complaining, and they said, we don't know if that will contaminate our crops or not; we think that there's a significant risk that it will contaminate our crops. Because we think that there's that significant risk, we have to take precautions. Now, why isn't that exactly what's happening in this case? We now think, says the -- say the lawyers, that there is a significant risk that our conversations will be surveilled, a risk that didn't exist before. Because of that significant risk, we have to take precautions of the exact same kind that the farmers in Monsanto took; therefore, there is standing.",
  "I don't see that difference at all, General Verrilli - -",
  "-- because, in fact, what Monsanto did -- it's not Congress; it's an agency -- but the agency issued a rule saying that farmers could go plant genetically modified crops. And then there was the question whether, because of that, essentially, delegation of authority, the plaintiffs in that case were going to be burdened. And the plaintiffs said, you know, we might be harmed, and we have to take precautions in order not to be harmed. So it's the same thing. It's a different actor, but it's a delegation of authority and a -- and a fear that that delegation of authority will result in harm leading to a set of precautions.",
  "Well, is it really such speculation, General? I mean, just imagine that -- yourself in this lawyer's position, and the lawyer says, I'm representing a person associated with a terrorist organization, I'm representing KLM in the case of one of these lawyers, and I'm going to be talking to that person's family members and associates and trying to find out everything that I can. Now, as a lawyer, would you take precautions, or would you pick up the phone and start writing e-mails to all those people?",
  "I don't even think it has to do with an ethics rule. If you're a good lawyer - - forget the ethics rule and how the ethics rules apply. Are you really going to tell me that you, as a lawyer, would just pick up the phone in the face of this statute and talk to -- these terrorists' associates?",
  "In Summers, the Court said - -",
  "Excuse me. In Summers, the Court said, well, we don't know that this person is just going to stumble upon a piece of land that's affected by this government action. I asked you a different question. You're a lawyer representing a terrorist and talking to the terrorist's affiliates, and the question is, is this statute going to make you not use the e-mail in the way that you ordinarily would use the e-mail? Well, given the availability of traditional FISA surveillance, surveillance under Executive Order 12333, surveillance by foreign governments, I don't think it depends on this statute. But -- but, in any event, whatever the reasonable judgment of a lawyer in those circumstances, there isn't a concrete application of the statute that creates a case or controversy here.",
  "Mr. Jaffer, it seems to me that your -- the government's strongest argument goes something like this -- and I don't think that they would say it in these words, but you have some clients where it actually does seem completely reasonable that they would take precautions, that they would not get on the phone, and that they would not use e-mail in the way that any old person would. But just -- those clients, these lawyers of terrorists, essentially shouldn't be using that e-mail or getting on the phone anyway. Even before the FAA was passed, they would have been wise and, indeed, maybe ethically required to use precautions. So what does the FAA do? I guess this is a point about redressability, it's a point about - -",
  "-- causation, but that seems to me the strongest of the government's arguments.",
  "Do you have specifics in the affidavits of things that your clients would have done previously that they cannot do now?",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Mr. Jaffer, you mentioned your journalist clients. Do you have any affidavits or anything else in the record to suggest that those journalists have simply not gotten information from third parties that they otherwise would have gotten? In other words, this would not be a question of what precautions they took and what precautions were reasonable.",
  "But if you assume that information is the lifeblood of journalism, that their sources and their information has dried up as a result of this statute.",
  "That's a fair point, General. What if it said something different? What if she said -- what if there were even an affidavit from the source saying, \"I have stopped talking with this journalist because of the FAA and because of my fear that my communications will be intercepted\"?",
  "No, General Verrilli, this is not about the merits of the statute. They might have no claim on the merits at all, and so there would be no question of invalidation. The question is only: Can they make their argument to a court?",
  "So, Mr. Rosenkranz, is what -- is your theory of this statute essentially that this language means non-piratical copies as that is defined by U.S. copyright law?",
  "No.",
  "I said as defined by U.S. copyright law.",
  "So that's, that's what the statute means. It's -- the statute in your view is setting up a distinction between piratical, pirated, whatever the term is -- copies - -",
  "-- and other copies, and saying that that distinction should be measured by U.S. copyright law?",
  "But a motivation for 109, or a motivation for 602?",
  "So on 602, you said that one of the things that they wanted was the segmentation of markets. They got half of it. They got the rogue distributors' half. And I guess Mr. Olson makes the point, and it seems a good one, it's like that's a crazy half to have gotten. That's the kind that they don't need because they have a contractual remedy about -- against the distributors. And then they don't get people like, frankly, your client, who are rogue something elses, with no contractual privity. And what sense does that make?",
  "Mr. Rosenkranz, there is that passage in Quality King, which is, I think it's fair to say, unfortunate to your position. Is your basic view of that passage that it was simply ill-considered dicta that we should ignore?",
  "Well, in result, but not in reasoning. The passage specifically says this was presumably not to be lawfully made under this title.",
  "Mr. Rosenkranz, can I take you back to Justice Ginsburg's opening question? Just as a matter of copyright theory, I had always understood copyright to -- a copyright holder has a kind of a bundle of rights. It's not one right that applies everywhere in the world. It's you have your U.S. rights and you have your Chinese rights, you have your rights under each jurisdiction's law. And your position is essentially to say that when I sell my Chinese rights to somebody, I'm also selling my U.S. rights to that same person, because the person who has the Chinese rights can just turn around and import the goods. I mean, that's the nature of your position, isn't it, that your U.S. rights are always attached when you sell more -- your rights under the jurisdiction of another country?",
  "It wasn't necessary, was it?",
  "Well, Mr. Olson, can I just take you to - -",
  "Please.",
  "Can I take you back to the words here, \"lawfully made under this title,\" which you say clearly means what you say it means. So, I find this language a little bit perplexing, and I can kind of see it both ways. So what you say is made under this title, that must mean made in the United States, and \"lawfully,\" just as this little word that's -- that modifies that basic phrase, \"made under this title,\" which means made in the United States. But what Mr. Rosenkranz essentially says - - he doesn't say it in these words, but he says, \"The focus of this provision is on 'lawfully made.'\" That is what the focus is on. It's on \"lawfully made\" as opposed to \"unlawfully made.\" Now, when we just say lawfully made, you know, we need something to measure, well, how do we know whether it's lawfully made? Well, you look to the rules in the copyright law. So if you just -- if you focus more on the lawfully word, lawfully made, and then under this title doesn't mean made in the United States, it means lawfully made under the rules of this title.",
  "Well, lawfully made, under the rules of the United States, regardless where the thing was manufactured, is what I'm saying. That's the way -- it just seems to me as though - -",
  "-- you are saying made must be manufactured. But lawfully made is a lawfully made copy. How do we know if it's lawfully made? We look to this title.",
  "Well, intending where? I mean, I -- you spend a lot of time talking about the legislative history and the purposes behind 602. But the language that we're supposed to be interpreting is the language in section 109. And the language in section 109, as far as I can see, there's really nothing to support your argument that that language was intended to address this gray market problem. Isn't that correct?",
  "But you know, section 109 is just a rewording of a prior provision that you would clearly lose under, where the prior wording had nothing to do with where any product was manufactured. And what you're suggesting is that we should read this change in wording -- which actually, there's a real theory behind what the change in wording meant that has nothing to do with the place of manufacture, that we should read it as incorporating a place of manufacture requirement, because there was a separate debate going on in section 602 about that question.",
  "So Mr. Stewart, if I understand your argument, both here and in Quality King you want the copyright holder to have some control over importation, but at the same time you don't want the copyright holder to have control over all downstream sales.",
  "And that's what your Bobbs-Merrill argument is designed to do. It's designed to prevent that.",
  "Coming back to Justice Ginsburg's question, do you think that truly the way to do those two things, to give the copyright holder control over importation, but not over downstream sales, that our problem really is, do you think in your heart of hearts that we got it wrong in Quality King?",
  "So you are essentially saying that the appropriate way to read this statute, to make sense of all of its provisions, is to give the copyright holder control over the importation, to give Wiley the ability to go after this importer, Mr. Kirtsaeng, but to find a way to stop it there?",
  "Well, that's not what the record says, Mr. Garre.",
  "I mean, the record suggests that he put the dog on a very long leash, the dog goes back and forth, tries to figure out where the smell is coming from. It's not just -- you know, my first thought was you go up to the door, the dog barks once, and that's it. But you read the record, this dog is there for some extended period of time, going back and forth and back and forth, trying to figure out where the greatest concentration of the smell is. It actually seemed, from my reading of the record, to be, you know, a lengthy and obtrusive process.",
  "Mr. Garre, this is what we said in Kyllo. And I'm just going to read it. We said, \"We think that obtaining by sense-enhancing technology any information regarding the interior of the home that could not otherwise have been obtained without physical intrusion into a constitutionally protected area constitutes a search, at least where, as here, the technology in question is not in general public use.\" So what part of that do you think separates your case from this one? In other words, what part of that language does not apply in this case?",
  "So does that mean that if we invented some kind of little machine called a, you know, smell-o-matic and the police officer had this smell-o-matic machine, and it alerted to the exact same things that a dog alerts to, it alerted to a set of drugs, meth and marijuana and whatever else, the police officer could not come to the front door and use that machine?",
  "So your basic distinction is the difference between like a machine and Franky.",
  "That we should not understand Franky as kind of a sense-enhancing law enforcement technology, but we should think of him as just like a guy.",
  "How does what you're saying, Ms. Saharsky, square with Karo? Because in Karo, the only thing that the beeper alerted to in the home was the can of ether, which was clearly an item that was being used for drug manufacture. And there was nothing else other than that item, which you might not call it contraband, but it was evidence of illegality, this can of ether. There was no thought that it was used for anything else. And that was the only thing that the beeper alerted it to; and, yet, nonetheless, we said, you know, of course that's a search.",
  "Well, not lawful uses in somebody's house. I mean, maybe lawful uses in a factory or in an operating room, but nobody has cans of ether in their house unless they're making drugs.",
  "But in Kyllo -- and I think this was what Justice Kennedy was saying. In Kyllo, there was already a seizure that had happened, and the Court just said, this is no -- this is really no greater an intrusion.",
  "Okay. So that's clearly -- you do concede if the police officer walks up to the door, smells it himself, no problem there; is that right?",
  "But smells it himself, so there's no problem there. So the difference is the dog. So what difference does the dog make? Suppose the dog were not doing this ten-minute bracketing that Justice Breyer was talking about. Suppose this really were a very simple procedure. The dog comes up, takes a sniff, barks, sits down. And, you know, to make it even more, the dog is not a scary-looking dog, the dog is a Cockapoo. So just like, you know, your neighbor with his Cockapoo walks up to your door all the time, that's what this police officer has done. Why do you win then?",
  "The dog does what your neighbor's dog does.",
  "-- that if they select somebody with a sense of smell because they have gotten a tip of drugs in a house, that we give up, in that situation, the assumption that they went to investigate?",
  "But I think, Mr. Garre, that the - -",
  "I think, Mr. Garre, that you have to concede that this is a case about police use - - call it a technology, call it whatever you want to call it -- of something that enhances what normal people can sense. And then the question becomes, do you have a reasonable expectation of privacy in, basically, people just having their normal senses, rather than some technique or method or technology that enhances those senses? So that your implied consent or expectations about your neighbor might differ fundamentally, you know, if the neighbor comes and knocks on your door, or if the neighbor brings his magnifying glass and his microscope and everything else and starts testing everything around it. You might say, no, that's -- I'm -- I'm not there for that.",
  "Well, Mr. Garre, could I understand your argument? Because -- suppose in a case the government comes in, says this dog has been through training and the handler has been through training. And this is a case in which -- this is never going to come up when the dog actually alerts to narcotics; it's not worth anybody's time at that point. It's only going to come up in a case like this, where a dog alerts to narcotics, there is no - - there are no narcotics, but something else is found, and so the person ends up being criminally prosecuted. So it's, you know, a small universe of cases. So the government comes in and says that the dog has been trained. Can -- can the criminal defendant at that point call the handler, say, how has the dog been trained, what are the methods that -- that the dog has -- was used, and how did the dog do in training? Can the -- can the defendant do that.",
  "But you can ask questions like how did the dog do in training.",
  "And how about if you really, if there were some articles that said, you know, that there was a certain kind of method that, for example, led to a lot of subconscious cueing by the handler. Could the -- could the criminal defendant say, did you use that method that leads to these problematic results?",
  "I'm using \"cueing\" not in terms of any intentionality, but one thing that I learned in reading all of this was that one difficulty here is that dogs respond to subconscious cues and that there are different ways of training that make that less or more of a problem.",
  "Yes, I didn't mean to say that. I just meant to say that there were -- there were no drugs found.",
  "If you take out the Florida Supreme Court and this one trial court in Massachusetts, basically you think what courts have been doing is the right thing?",
  "But where at the same time they'll allow a defendant to question the handler about that training, about how the dog has performed in that training; is that right?",
  "And what is the immediate vicinity? How would you define that?",
  "Well, what if he were aware, or what if there was reason to think he might be aware, would you then allow the police to do what the police did here?",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, when you talk about the justifications in your brief and just now, you talk about two; but, there were, in fact, three, and the third was flight. So how is it that that's dropped from your understanding of Summers?",
  "Well, Mr. Wall, you have that, too, about the person in her workplace, and you said that your argument didn't apply to the person in her workplace. So you have to come up with something better than that. And I guess the question is your rule would seem to encompass, you know, a whole set of people who are leaving their houses for ordinary reasons: I'm going to work in the morning. And the question is whether the police can stop this person who's going to work in the morning, who's given no indication that he's seen the police officers at the scene, no indication that he's coming back immediately or, you know, in any amount of time that it will take you to complete the search. And that's not an outlier case. It seems to me that the hypothetical I just gave you might very well be the more common case than the hypothetical that you gave me. So, you know, why isn't this just too broad a categorical rule?",
  "Right. But the across-the-board is a set of people who are at the house when you want to search the house. And of course, Summers makes perfect sense. You want to search the house, you can't have these people roaming around, right? So you have to detain the people. But what you're now saying is: Well, there's another class of people, they're going to work in the morning. And we've -- there's -- there is no indication that they've seen the police officers; they're going to work. But we get to detain them, too, just because we have a warrant to search the house. And the question is why?",
  "I mean, something meaningful very -- very much changes. Before, you're dealing with a problem of a person on the premises while you're trying to search the premises. And now you're talking about a person who is going to work, leaving the premises, letting you search the premises without any interference.",
  "Well, Mr. Fisher, think about this in an AEDPA context. I mean, assume that you have these ten circuit courts all going in the way that the Chief Justice said, and then one court came along and said, you know, we think that they -- in an AEDPA context, a habeas consideration of a state conviction -- we think that this is all wrong, and, in fact, the law is exactly the opposite of what ten circuits have held. Wouldn't we think that that's a very easy case that the AEDPA standard had not been met?",
  "Mr. Fisher, it would seem to me that this case presents a kind of threshold question. Before you get to the question of what are prevailing professional norms and whether they have been complied with, there is the question of whether the Sixth Amendment applies to collateral consequences at all and, if so, which collateral consequences. And that’s the question on which Padilla opines, and that's the question that seems, you know, very different from anything that Strickland’s discussed, not just an application of Strickland.",
  "Well, but even before the 1996 act, deportation -- there were deportation consequences. Those consequences were enhanced by the 1996 act; but, even before that, a reasonable lawyer, you might think, would have a conversation with his client about the deportation consequences of a conviction.",
  "Mr. Fisher, before you get to the reasons --",
  "-- the government says that you forfeited this argument. Could you address that?",
  "But you haven't presented this argument to any court before; is that right?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, if Justice Breyer were right, that there should be sort of one run -- run up the flagpole and that Teague doesn't kick in until that one run up the flagpole and here because of Massaro the one run should include collateral review of IAC claims, if that's right, what are the costs of that? Is that an extra year to the statute of limitations for bringing a collateral claim or is it something more than that?",
  "It can't proceed as an anything action, can it? I mean, the -- the remedy, if you had thought that the -- the statement was immaterial, is not to say, I won't approve a class. It would be to say, the suit has no merit.",
  "Well, do you mean to say that a judge, who has just ruled that a statement is immaterial, is going to keep the case in his court, litigated by an individual plaintiff, even though he's just ruled that the statement is immaterial?",
  "But you're saying that a judge on a class certification stage can say, this is immaterial, the statement is immaterial; therefore, this can't proceed as a class action. But when a summary judgment motion comes in, arguing the exact same thing, the judge will say, oh, it's not immaterial after all, or it's disputed enough, that the case can -- can continue?",
  "I guess the question, Mr. Waxman, is if it is not immaterial as a matter of law, at the summary judgment stage, how could a judge possibly say it is material at the class certification stage?",
  "So the class certification stage becomes kind of a super merits inquiry?",
  "-- where the plaintiff has to -- has to surmount a higher burden on the merits?",
  "Mr. Waxman, that is exactly right, and that's what we said in Wal-Mart recently, that the question is a question of coherence; it's a question of whether the class wins or loses together. And here, for materiality, the class wins or loses together. If it's material, it's material as to everybody. If it's not material, it's not material as to everybody. And that's just a function of the fact that materiality, as we've repeatedly said, is an objective test. It doesn't have anything to do with whether a particular person finds it material. And where that's the case, it seems to me that the Wal-Mart test, which is -- is an issue central to the -- you know, when you rule on the issue, do you rule on each of the claims in one stroke? The answer to that is yes.",
  "Mr. Waxman, I was saying that's right.",
  "There is class cohesion as to materiality. People win or lose on materiality together.",
  "What is that statement, Mr. Waxman?",
  "Because the difference is if there is an unefficient market, the case goes forward, and people have to prove individual reliance, and that means that the class splits apart, and you don't get a coherent class. So the function of -- of your winning an argument either on publicity or on the efficient market is that the class becomes incoherent, that everybody then has to prove individual reliance. But that's not what happens when you prove immateriality. When you prove immateriality, the whole class falls together because it's immaterial for everybody.",
  "But, Mr. Estrada, doesn't Justice Ginsburg's question actually point out that the -- the law that both district court and the circuit court used in this case was actually quite favorable to you? Unlike some courts, both the district court and the circuit court said that the plaintiffs needed to show that there was a class-wide measurement of damages. And then in addition, both courts said, really, it was -- the burden was on the plaintiffs to demonstrate that that class-wide measure of damages existed. Now, I understand that you have problems with the way in which the plaintiffs met that burden. You say that they didn't meet that burden. But it seems to me that the legal standard that was used was exactly the legal standard that you wanted, that the plaintiffs had to come in and show, by a preponderance, that they had a class-wide way to measure damages in this case.",
  "Well, here's what the district court said. \"The experts' opinions raise substantial issues of fact and credibility that we are required to resolve to decide the pending motion.\" That is the motion for class certification. \"Having rigorously analyzed the experts' reports, we conclude that the class has met its burden to demonstrate that the element of antitrust impact is capable of proof at trial through evidence that is common to the class and that there is a common methodology available to measure and quantify damages on a class-wide basis.\" So that seems to me exactly what you say they should have done. Now, you disagree with their ultimate determination, but not with the statement of the law.",
  "Well, Mr. --",
  "Mr. Estrada, as -- as the case comes to the Court, I guess I wonder why any of this is relevant. You mentioned earlier -- you mentioned earlier that we reformulated the question presented in this case. And we reformulated in a way which said that what we wanted to talk about was whether a district court at a class certification stage has to conduct a Daubert inquiry, in other words, has to decide on the admissibility of expert testimony relating to class-wide damages. And -- you know, it would not be crazy to surmise that we reformulated the question because we wanted to present -- we wanted to decide a legal question, rather than a question about who was right as to this particular expert's report and how strong it was. And it turns out that, as to that legal question, your clients waived their -- their argument that this was inadmissible evidence. So -- so what do we do in that circumstance?",
  "The district court, Mr. Estrada, clearly understood you to be making an argument about weight and not about admissibility. And indeed, the district court in open court -- and -- and it's in the transcript -- suggests that it's doing something different from holding a Daubert hearing, explains how it's different from holding a Daubert hearing, and both lawyers agree to that statement.",
  "Mr. Estrada, it seems like a remarkable proposition, honestly, especially with a client like yours that is well-lawyered. It seems like a remarkable proposition that somebody -- a party can say, we have objections about the weight of this evidence. We don't think -- we don't think it's a strong expert report, and that -- and that we -- and that the Court should then infer that there is an objection to admissibility of evidence, as opposed, again, to the weight and strength of evidence. I mean, surely, a district court confronted with an argument about the weight and strength of evidence does not have to say, oh, I better go hold a Daubert hearing to rule on admissibility even though nobody's asked me --",
  "-- to rule on admissibility.",
  "Did you -- did you ever file a motion to strike the expert report?",
  "Mr. Barnett, it's always true, isn't it, that evidence that is inadequately probative is inadmissible?",
  "It's always been true, right, if evidence is not probative?",
  "Well, that's the thing. I mean, but have we ever said that -- that without an objection, somebody can say, look, we -- we argued about this evidence, and that should be just good enough, even though we didn't -- we didn't make an objection to exclude it?",
  "Mr. Barnett -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
  "Okay. Then I will.",
  "I am still in search of a legal question that anybody disagrees about here.",
  "You know, I read before the district court statement of the standard, now all points of the circuit court statement of the standard, where the circuit court says, \"The inquiry for a district court at the class certification stage is whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated\" -- burden is on you -- \"by a preponderance of the evidence that they will be able to measure damages on a class-wide basis using common proof.\" The parties both agree with that statement of the standard. It seems to me that the parties also both agree -- and this goes back to Justice Sotomayor's question -- that if the Daubert question had not been waived, that if -- if Comcast had objected to the admissibility of this expert report, that, indeed, the court would -- should have held a hearing on the admissibility of the expert report. So this is a case where it seems to me that, except for the question of how good the expert report is, none of the parties have any adversarial difference as to the appropriate legal standard. And -- you know, usually, we decide cases based on disagreements about law. And here, I can't find one. Is there any? Do you disagree with Mr. Estrada on any statement of the legal standard?",
  "Well, I suppose the question - -",
  "But isn't it -- isn't it hard to argue with a notion that your client has gotten a windfall here? I mean, this is not continuing government oppression and -- and -- you know, that's - - that -- that suggests a real harm on the part of your client. I mean, here because of a legal error, your client walks away the winner when he shouldn't have.",
  "Yes, I think that's right. This is -- this is an argument against this whole line of cases, that this whole line of cases essentially has set up a system where the real purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause do not apply and where defendants walk away with windfalls. And I guess what's your best argument against that proposition?",
  "Mr. Baughman, what would happen if the defendant asked for improper instructions, really saying exactly something like this -- you know, that the jury has to find this additional element that, in fact, it doesn't have to find? But your theory, I would think, would say that too, the government could try the defendant again. After all, the government didn't get its one fair shot.",
  "You don't go that far, in other words, just because it doesn't happen to be this case.",
  "But do you concede that the logic of your position would extend to improperly instructed juries?",
  "Well, we've historically said it in this context, too. I mean, the cases that you are asking us to overrule go back 50 years.",
  "But the point I was making was that the same windfall is received by the defendant that gets an acquittal from an improperly instructed jury.",
  "But in several of our cases, what the court has done wrong is to make the prosecution prove additional facts in order to prove an element. So the distinction that you're drawing is one between incorrectly making the prosecution prove additional facts and incorrectly saying that the prosecution has to show an additional element. And I guess I just don't understand that distinction.",
  "Well, if I understand your test correctly, under your test, Rumsey, Smalis, and Smith would all have come out differently.",
  "Mr. Kramer - -",
  "Ms. Harrington - -",
  "So how do we tell that, Ms. Harrington? Because it seems to me that the crux of the difference between you and your friend is that you say the element is membership in the conspiracy at some point, it doesn't matter whether it's in the limitations period. And he says the element is membership in a conspiracy in the limitations period. And if he's right, a set of things follow from that; and if you are right, another set of things follow. So how do we determine that the -- you know, that the statute of limitations -- that the timing question is not baked into the elements question, that it's just membership sometime, as opposed to membership at a particular time?",
  "Could I make sure I understand one part of your argument, Ms. Harrington? The conclusion that timing -- the timing is not an element. Now, take Justice Sotomayor's example of something which is not a conspiracy at all, let's say somebody commits a robbery, and you have to show that the person has committed a robbery and if the person brings up the question of timing, you also have the burden of persuasion on that. But would the timing be an element in that case or not?",
  "And so you are essentially saying that this case should be treated just as every other case. You happen to have the burden of persuasion if somebody says the statute of limitations has been violated, but the question of when conduct occurred is never an element.",
  "Why is it then -- I mean, why would Grunewald be right, that you do have the burden if, in fact, this isn't an element?",
  "Well, that's because they thought that you had the burden. And it -- it does strike me that, if you are right that this is an element -- membership in the conspiracy at a particular time -- and the government has the burden, this idea that the government could -- you know, just sort of say, well, we don't have any evidence, but we think you should presume that we're right, I mean, that's -- the government couldn't do that if you are right.",
  "Well, if you make an assertion, and they don't really respond to the assertion and -- you win.",
  "Well, Mr. Kramer, if they really have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is membership in the conspiracy during the limitations period, they couldn't just come in and say, well, there's membership in the conspiracy before the limitations period, and, you know, you should assume that it continued. I mean that's not a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt kind of proof, is it?",
  "Ms. Blatt, it -- it seems to me that the -- the most natural way to read this statute, and it's not -- it's not your way, it's, look, we have this Federal Rule of Civil Procedure that -- that contemplates that Congress sometimes doesn't write -- it writes statutes authorizing lawsuits without providing a cost provision. And because we know that about Congress, we provide a default rule. And the default rule is what's laid out in subsection (d) as to costs and then also later as to attorney's fees. But, we know that Congress sometimes does address costs and fees, and where Congress in a particular statute has addressed costs and fees, we look to whatever Congress has said -- you know, unless Congress has otherwise provided. And here, this is -- 1692k is a provision that addresses costs and fees. It addresses them comprehensively and specifically.",
  "I expected you might.",
  "It's not a question of field preemption.",
  "Maybe I'm --",
  "-- not in the business of trying to figure out what Congress's intent is. All I'm trying to figure out is whether this Federal statute provides otherwise, and this Federal statute does provide otherwise.",
  "It's both, you know?",
  "And if I might say, I mean, you object to this statute; it's perfectly reasonable to say Congress should have written a separate provision about costs and attorney's fees, but for whatever bad, good, or indifferent reason, Congress didn't, and so this statute basically says, here's what prevailing plaintiffs get as to both costs and fees, here is what prevailing defendants get --",
  "-- under what circumstances, as to both costs and fees, and those are the rules.",
  "This statute is very -- is very normal if it were just about fees, right? It would be just like the civil rights fees statutes, where it said prevailing plaintiffs get fees, but prevailing defendants only get fees upon some higher standard, here, bad faith. What makes this statute different -- and it is different -- is that this statute twice says not only fees, but also costs.",
  "Now, you might say that's very uncommon, but in both sentences, it says, we want the same rule for costs as we do for fees.",
  "Sorry. I'm sorry.",
  "Well, you say that, but it says to both. It says the costs, together with the reasonable attorney's fees, and then the next sentence, it says fees and costs. So you might wish that they were a different statute, and it might be good policy to have a different statute --",
  "I'm not in the business -- I'm not in the business of trying to figure out exactly what Congress is doing. I'm in the business of just reading what Congress did. And what Congress did is it created a set of rules that applies to attorney's fees and costs at the same time.",
  "Well, that sounds very terrible.",
  "Well, Ms. Blatt, you say it -- it's supposed to make defendants better off by focusing on just part of the provision, but the provision is -- as a whole, it does a set of things. It treats plaintiffs and prevailing plaintiffs in a certain set of ways. And it treats prevailing defendants in a certain set of ways.",
  "Prevailing defendants, but when -- prevailing defendants are treated worse than prevailing plaintiffs because they have to show that there is a bad-faith lawsuit.",
  "Ms. Blatt, let me try it a different way.",
  "Let's just suppose that 54(k) didn't exist at all. Okay?",
  "54(d) didn't exist.",
  "And all you had was this provision. Okay?",
  "So this provision says, on a finding by the court that it's brought in bad faith, the court may award to the defendant attorney's fees and costs. So suppose a defendant wins, but there's not a finding that it was made in bad faith, would then the person be entitled to either attorney's fees or costs?",
  "So I'm saying that --",
  "In my world, you would not get fees or costs.",
  "I'm just asking you a simple question.",
  "You would not get costs under that provision.",
  "Okay. So if you would not get costs under that provision --",
  "-- under 1692, a provision that talks about fees and costs, generally, as to both plaintiffs and defendants, then how does a rule that says what -- where you would get costs unless a Federal statute provides otherwise change matters?",
  "You might be right, but suppose Congress wasn't thinking about Rule 54. Suppose it didn't occur to the drafters what Rule 54 said or what the default provision was. They just wrote a statute about fees and costs. And then -- it doesn't really matter whether they were thinking about Rule 54 or not.",
  "Well, that's -- that's just a different way of saying the following: The first sentence says, when you're a prevailing plaintiff, you get costs and fees. How about defendants? Well, prevailing is not enough for defendants. Defendants have to show --",
  "-- that the suit was filed in bad faith --",
  "-- and then they get costs and fees.",
  "I completely agree with that. But that's what it comes down to, that if you think that Congress has to use super extraordinary language to over -- to -- to get out of 54(d), then you're right. But 54(d) doesn't say that. It just says --",
  "-- unless the Federal statute provides otherwise.",
  "I understood Ms. Blatt to actually agree with that, that if you put Rule 54 aside, this does say, you may, under a certain set of conditions, which implies you may not, under -- if those conditions are not met.",
  "But why?",
  "But that's not the question, Mr. Dabney. The question is: Is there any covenant that exists in the world that would make you feel secure? And I suppose I'm having a little bit of difficulty with the answer, with an answer that says, no, there is no covenant that you can write that would make us feel secure.",
  "But if that's the case -- if the difference is that you've been sued, then it should be adequate protection, if you know that you won't be sued again. And that's why there's the question of what kind of covenant would give you adequate protection that you won't be sued again?",
  "Well, Ms. Anders, take this case, where Already says -- you know, we're not really going to say anything particular. We're just going to say that we're in the business of making shoes, and we might make a shoe. Would that -- would that -- that would not be enough under your standard; is that correct?",
  "Given what Already has said in this case, why is it that you think that we should remand? I mean, it sounds as though we're remanding for no purpose, given what Already has said throughout the course of the litigation and, indeed, in this Court today.",
  "Do you that this covenant covers an exact copy of your shoe?",
  "But suppose in a different hypothetical case, they had said, what we want to do is to copy Nike's shoe --",
  "-- what then should have happened then, in your view?",
  "Mr. Horwich, could I just --",
  "-- before you give examples, just make sure I understand your basic position? Suppose the State had said, very clearly, that these hospital authorities had the power to engage in acquisitions of hospitals that, for a normal actor, would violate the antitrust laws, but -- but basically said the -- the hospital authorities had the discretion to do that or not. And the State didn't know the hospital authority might do it, but it also might not do it. That would be subject to the immunity; is that correct?",
  "Yes. It's a clear grant of authority --",
  "But the authority is completely discretionary. So the State is basically saying, we don't know, we're going to let the hospital authority figure it out.",
  "What -- but what I'm trying to get at is the State has put it on the table only as a completely discretionary action. The State has not expressed a preference for it. The State has only said that the hospital authority can think about conditions on the ground in its particular locality and can decide whether such an anticompetitive acquisition is appropriate.",
  "So all of this language --",
  "So all this language in your brief about necessarily and inherently and compelled, all of those things really are not part of your -- your governing test?",
  "Mr. Waxman, we do have a brief from quite a number of States, and the brief basically says, we do this all the time, we set up these local authorities, and then we give them powers because they have to act in the world, and we give them normal powers, like the ability to make contracts and the ability to buy property. And when we do that, we don't mean that they can do anything they want, notwithstanding the antitrust laws. And to construe these very normal powers that we would give to a State entity, in order to allow it to operate as a permission to violate the antitrust laws, is not at all consistent with our own intentions.",
  "But I'm --",
  "Mr. Waxman, could -- could I understand where you think this expressed approval is coming from? Because you said general corporate powers is not enough. So the general ability to buy property, you said, is insufficient. Then you have this idea they have a mission. But the mission can be accomplished in all kinds of ways that are perfectly consistent with the antitrust laws, so that doesn't seem to get you all that far. So what else have you got to show that the State actually thought about this issue and approved this power for the hospital authorities?",
  "Well, if that -­",
  "Mr. Waxman, I mean, that's right, it is about choices, but -- but the question is whether the State has made a choice. And that's what all these cases are about --",
  "-- is our trying to find whether the State has made a choice as to this kind of conduct.",
  "So now, we have your corporate powers aren't enough, your general mission isn't enough. You said a certificate of need, but a certificate of need, it isn't even given out by this authority. It's something that has nothing to do with the powers of this authority. Then you said there -- there's some kind of a price regulation that happens as to the -- the hospitals that the authority owns, but not with respect to other hospitals. So I guess I'm still looking for the things that show that the State has made a choice that it wants these -- these hospital authorities to be able to make anticompetitive purchases. Where do I find that?",
  "Mr. Ortiz, suppose I agree with your standard, but I just can't find on the record as it has been presented in this Court any evidence that Davis actually served as Vance's supervisor. What -- I mean, what's your best -- so if that's true, I would be tempted to actually just decide the thing rather than to remand it. So as against that approach, what is your best evidence that there was a supervisory relationship under your standard here?",
  "Well, is that the case? Is there evidence that you did not present because the Seventh Circuit applied a different standard?",
  "Could I ask you how the Seventh Circuit test works in operation? We're in a university setting here, so let me give you a university hypo. There's a professor, and the professor has a secretary. And the professor subjects that secretary to living hell, complete hostile work environment on the basis of sex, all right? But the professor has absolutely no authority to fire the secretary. What would the Seventh Circuit say about that situation?",
  "No, no, the secretary is fired by the head of secretarial services. Professors don't have the ability to fire secretaries; but, professors do have the ability to make secretarial lives living hells. So what does the Seventh Circuit say about that?",
  "Under the Seventh Circuit test.",
  "Even though, of course, it's actually more difficult for the secretary to complain about the professor than it would be for the secretary to complain about the head of secretarial services.",
  "And Mr. Srinivasan, if I can just continue on about this, because I just don't even understand the Seventh Circuit test. Would the Seventh Circuit test also say that -- that that person is not a supervisor even if the professor evaluates the secretary on a yearly basis?",
  "Mr. Garre, could I ask you about that? You said before that there is no -- nothing to suggest that she left anything on the table because of the nature of the Seventh Circuit standard. So what's the best place in the record for us to look -- to decide that question as to whether she at all didn't present or didn't develop evidence because of the nature of the Seventh Circuit standard?",
  "But, Mr. Katyal, could I ask you about the legal argument that you are making, the distinction you are making between reimbursement agreements and subrogation agreements, which you think -- seem to think is critical here. And -- you know, once you put it in one box, rather than another, some result follows -- different results follow.",
  "So -- so how do you know whether you have a reimbursement agreement or a subrogation agreement? And what follows from that categorization?",
  "So if this were a subrogation agreement, what would follow?",
  "So if your friend's argument would get a lot stronger if it were a subrogation agreement, how do we tell that this agreement is a reimbursement agreement, rather than -- are we supposed to just take that because that's the way the Court -- it's come to us? Or -- or is there an argument about why there is a reimbursement?",
  "Mr. Palmore, do you agree with Mr. Katyal's view of this distinction between subjugation -- subrogation agreements and reimbursement agreements and which this agreement is?",
  "Well, but I think Mr. Katyal said that, if this were a subrogation agreement, Mr. McCutchen would have a much better argument because a different set of rules would apply. And so that makes this categorization question quite meaningful. Now, you could say, well, we don't see it as all that meaningful. We think, no matter what you call this agreement, the same rules apply. Or you could say, yes, different rules apply with respect to these two different kinds of agreements, and your job is to figure out which kind of agreement this is.",
  "But doesn't Sereboff suggest not? I mean, I realize that Sereboff has this footnote, but if you read the text in Sereboff, it says, these affirmative defenses that would arise in a normal subrogation context are beside the point. So how are they not the beside the point?",
  "So is that true that, in Sereboff, there was no agreement?",
  "I guess I don't understand that because it seems to me that, when Sereboff said it was beside the point, they were refuting the arguments that the insured party was making, that the insured party was saying, hey, look, we have these great defenses. And -- and you are saying they had an agreement, but they also said they have these great defenses, and the Court said, too bad, those defenses don't work for you here.",
  "Mr. Wessler, would it be fair to say -- I mean, we're in this unusual position because we're supposed to be looking back to before the 1930s sometime. Would it be fair to say that we just don't have very many cases, and Mr. Katyal doesn't have any, and you don't have any, that raise this question that, where somebody walks into an equity court with a contract, and we try to figure out whether the equity court is going to use these unjust enrichment defenses? Would it be fair to say that we just don't know?",
  "Why didn't it?",
  "But, Mr. Wall, your whole argument about judicial efficiency is an incentives argument, and it depends upon the notion that a lawyer is going to change their behavior, a lawyer is going to make an objection that he otherwise wouldn't have made if the rule that Ms. Gilley proposes is accepted. And this goes back to what Justice Breyer said earlier. I don't know of a lawyer who would say the following to himself: I'm not going to make this objection because I'm just going to assume that sometime between now and my direct appeal the law is going to change, and it's going to change in my favor, and when it changes, I'm going to be able to make this objection and get over not only prong two but prong three and four of the test, and life will be grand for my client. Now, who is going to say that?",
  "Well, should the government agree with that really? Should some -- can you imagine -- isn't it just as much of a unicorn for an attorney to say, I'm not going to take great care because I think that the law is going to change between now and the appeal, and because I think I'm going to win on prongs two and three -- three and four. I mean, nobody can think that those circumstances would arise. They're flukes when they arise. And so it -- it doesn't affect either the attorney's intentional conduct or his level of preparation and care.",
  "Well, the government had a different argument before. In Johnson, the government called this distinction an amorphous one. And it says, \"Nothing in the text of Rule 52(b) contemplates or permits any such distinction. An error is either plain, or it is not. It is more faithful to the text of Rule 52(b) and simpler for the courts of appeals to obviate that distinction altogether,\" said the government.",
  "This Court did not disagree. This Court took a half step. And the question before us is still the question that was before you when you wrote this passage, you being the government, which is should we distinguish between the Johnson case and this one. And you very clearly stated, both as to a matter of text and to a matter of what's simpler for the courts of appeals, that there should be no such distinction.",
  "Mr. Wall, can -- can I ask you about footnote 4 of your brief? This is the footnote in which you say that this case involves only a claim of sentencing error, and it doesn't involve a claim of actual innocence based on an intervening decision. Is that footnote meant to suggest that you think, or at least that you contemplate the possibility that where there is an intervening decision making clear the conduct that a person had been convicted of was in fact not criminal, that you would think a different rule should apply? That the Johnson rule should apply?",
  "Because then that creates yet another complication in this interpretation of Rule 52. And one might say, we just want a uniform rule, that it should all be at one time, and having said which time it should be at in Johnson, and having suggested that it should also be in the time of appeal for actual innocence claims, that it would be strange to carve out this single set of cases involving intervening changes of the law, and say those should be at the time of trial.",
  "But -- an honest footnote, an honest footnote in that you're saying there is this other category of cases that's lurking out there, and that category seems as though we should have the Johnson rule.",
  "But now we have two tails. But -- you know, the one tail is Johnson and one tail is actual innocence, but this is just a tail, too.",
  "Well, it seems as though it's more than a housekeeping issue that's involved here because -- I mean, I realize that you have an argument about what happens when the plaintiff's individual claims have been fully satisfied, but the plaintiff continues to want to represent other individuals. But, here, the plaintiff's individual claims had not been fully satisfied. She walked away with nothing. She walked away with no judgment, and she walked away with no $7,500. And the question is: How can it possibly be that her individual claim was moot?",
  "Well, here's what -- here is what the Court said last in Knox last year, when it said, \"What makes a case moot?\" It says, \"A case becomes moot when it's impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party.\" Now, here, the judge says, okay, is this case moot? Well, it's not moot because I could give -- at the very least, I could give the plaintiff $7500, but, I didn't give the plaintiff $7500, so she still has her claim for at least $7500, regardless of the collective side of this action. I mean, she hasn't been satisfied.",
  "But, Mr. Mann -- excuse me.",
  "What do you think the court should do in that circumstance, where a defendant comes forward and says, I'm willing to satisfy the entire claim? What should happen?",
  "Is this under Rule 68? Or is this under some inherent authority?",
  "Mr. Katyal, if we do get to the question that Mr. Mann wants us to raise, you spend a lot of time talking about McLaughlin and talking about Gerstein. Those cases were about prospective relief. You're asking for retrospective relief. Why doesn't that make a difference?",
  "So, Mr. Yang, do you think it would be -- I -- I mean, I take the point completely that judgment was rendered against the wrong party here. But if the judgment had been rendered against Ms. Symczyk -- for Ms. Symczyk, but -- but the court had done so prior to looking at the whole class question --",
  "-- do you think that that would be an abuse of the court's discretion? Do you think that the court has to look at the class question before rendering judgment for an individual plaintiff?",
  "But, Mr. Bishop, as -- as Justice Ginsburg said, that question was not decided below, and in the context of this case, which, of course, was very different when it was briefed, Mr. Fisher spent a grand total of 2 pages and rightly so. It wasn't -- it was -- it was not the main issue in the case then. So would we really be doing something -- you know, a good practice to decide this issue, without really any briefing on it and without a decision below?",
  "Well, that isn't really quite fair. It is 2 pages because it wasn't decided below and because -- and because the -- the question in the case was very different, with a different regulation.",
  "Mr. Bishop, could I -- I'm sorry that I don't understand this well enough yet. But can I understand what's still at stake for you in -- in the case? Put aside the question of whether the new rule is valid or not, all right? And what -- what do you have riding on whether the Ninth Circuit's decision is correct at this point?",
  "So which remedies are you worried about?",
  "Is what you said true also of the remediation piece of this? You said that, at this point, even if we understand this as a change in the law, the Plaintiffs would not be entitled to fines. Would they also not be entitled to any kind of remediation?",
  "It seems strange that you would -- that there would be an order of remediation to undo the results of past discharges when, at this point, the law going forward is, go ahead and discharge.",
  "Mr. Fisher, why would you proceed that way? It's at least arguable that you're wrong on that. I mean, it's a -- it's a question as to what 1369 does. And you obviously do have the route of direct review. Why don't you proceed that way with respect to the new regulation?",
  "Do you think that, on your view of 1369, you can't go to the Ninth Circuit?",
  "But, Mr. Kneedler, do you think you could do the same thing in the veterans' benefits context? Because in Henderson, of course, we dropped a footnote saying that we weren't deciding whether equitable tolling was available. All we were saying was that this was a claims processing rule and not a jurisdictional rule. Could the Secretary of Veterans Affairs then go on and say, okay, it's a claims processing rule, but still, we get to decide how much equitable tolling we want, and we're going to adopt a regulation, much like the one in this case, saying you can't come in after 3 years? Could you do that in Henderson?",
  "I guess the question I was trying to ask, Mr. Kneedler, was do you think it's a general principle of administrative law that, when there is a claims processing rule that -- that relates only to internal agency process, that the agency gets to decide how much, if any, equitable tolling to allow?",
  "I mean, you don't need that label, do you, Mr. Kneedler? You could do just as well with a claims processing label. Maybe you could do better, as Justice Scalia is suggesting, with a claims processing label, as long as, with that label, comes the general rule that the agency gets to determine the extent of discretion as to late filings.",
  "But, Mr. Roth, on -- on the legal question here, I think Justice Breyer is right, that this all comes down to congressional intent, how we read this statute. If you -- one response to reading the briefs in this case is that you and Mr. Manning present opposite views of the statute, and -- and both of you say the statute is clear as to your opposite view. In other words, Mr. Manning says the statute clearly prohibits equitable tolling, and you say the statute clearly requires equitable tolling. And both of you have kind of decent arguments. And one response to that might be to say, Mr. Kneedler is right, that the statute is just ambiguous and that it can be read a bunch of different ways, and both of you have presented good arguments, but in the end, it really all goes to show that there is a lack of clarity here, and then it's up to the agency to decide.",
  "Mr. Roth, I'm not certain about the extent of your argument, so let me -- let me try something. Now, are you saying that any time Congress passes a statute saying -- you know, there is 30 days to do this, there is 60 days to do this, in the agency context now, as to administrative process, that Congress necessarily means that equitable tolling applies and that the agency cannot limit that equitable tolling?",
  "I guess I'm not sure I understand this, Mr. Roth. Are you saying that, in all of our cases about the presumption in favor of equitable tolling, when we talk about equitable tolling, we are only talking about misconduct or fraud cases -- you know, as opposed to the case where it's just a person cannot possibly know the -- the information that would back up a claim and that we regard that as a good excuse?",
  "Right.",
  "Well because I thought that most of your argument was built on the presumption in favor of equitable tolling that we've recognized in those cases --",
  "-- and whether it applied to the agency context. But now, you're saying that in the agency context, it's -- it's a different kind of equitable tolling that we are talking about, a more limited kind?",
  "Mr. Colangelo, suppose we did what the Solicitor General says to do and vacated this. Can you think of any reason why the Ninth Circuit would change its mind? I mean, is there any connection between these two issues that you can point to, such that our making clear to the Ninth Circuit that they made a mistake on one actually would affect their analysis on the other?",
  "Mr. Cullen -- Mr. Cullen, it's often true, in international litigation, that enforcement is very difficult. I mean, take a commercial litigation case where somebody is going after assets and the assets are not in the United States, and somebody looks and says, well -- you know, a court can do whatever it wants, but nothing is going to happen afterwards. So why is this case any different from -- you know, a very frequent problem in international litigation, which is, sometimes, judgments are difficult to enforce? And if you look at it practically, it may -- may never be enforced, but we don't put courts to the job of saying, oh, well, let's check out the various enforcement options and make predictions about who's going to do what.",
  "Well, it's different -- that might be -- it's certainly different in terms of the interests at stake, and that might be a very good reason for Congress to step in and try to fix this system, so that you don't have children shuttling back and forth. But -- you know, at the risk of sounding hard-hearted, in terms of the law, what is different?",
  "Mr. Cullen, may I ask -- I'm trying to figure out what exactly your argument is. So let me give you two options, and you tell me what your argument is, all right? One -- you can tell me it's neither, I suppose. But one is this case is moot because there's no practical way to enforce any relief that's ordered by the Eleventh Circuit, all right? That's what I came in thinking your argument was. The second is -- is just no, it's just improper for the Eleventh Circuit to enter any order granting relief. So which is it? Is it that it's improper to enter any order at this point? Or is it -- you know, you can enter an order, but it's just not going to be enforced, and, therefore, this case is moot?",
  "I don't understand the third option.",
  "And there could be no rereturn by the terms of the treaty. So this is an argument that hangs on what the treaty's terms say; is that correct?",
  "But Mr. Boutrous, you say what Congress is concerned about and point to the Senate report. You know, usually we look to the text and the text makes very clear that Congress was concerned about many things and it did many things. It got -- it really -- it raised the matter in controversy threshold. It eliminated the Zahn anti-aggregation rule. It eliminated the complete diversity requirement. It eliminated the one-year limit on removal. Here's one thing it didn't eliminate. It didn't eliminate the St. Paul master of your complaint rule. So -- so I guess where in the text do you see this? You point to claim, the word \"claim.\" Is that the only thing that you are resting on in the text?",
  "Well, if I said to you, Mr. Boutrous, \"Is your claim for over $100,000,\" what would you think I mean? Would you think I mean some sort of abstract version of the best claim you could bring, or would you think I mean what I demanded, what I asked for?",
  "Do you think that the word \"claim\" is not -- when you say Joe made a claim for $100,000, a claim is not what he asked for, but is instead some kind of law professor's view of what the best thing that he could have asked for?",
  "But he doesn't have power to affect those claims before the certification has happened.",
  "Before the certification has happened, they can do whatever they want. They can go bring their own claim for $6 million. And that's why Smith v. Bayer, which you so happily rely on, does not have much to do with this case. Smith v. Bayer is the question of can an -- can a person be precluded by a judgment when that person was not part of a class. There's no question that this person is going to be precluded. This person can go do whatever he or she wants before class certification and judgment.",
  "Mr. Boutrous, that form of argument -- Congress could have said -- does seem to me to be much worse for your position. If Congress had wanted to get rid of the St. Paul master of your complaint rule, it could have said, we are getting rid of the St. Paul master of your complaint rule. But you're trying to find it in a provision which is really an anti-Zahn provision, not an anti-St. Paul provision.",
  "Let's get back to the Chief Justice's question because there are a thousand ways in which we let the named plaintiff prior to certification construct a case, and then we ask, as Justice Sotomayor said, later we ask, is the way he's constructed a case adequate or not, and we allow him to go forward or not based on that. But he gets to decide whether to seek damages. He gets -- at all, or whether he only can seek injunctive relief. He gets to decide which claims to bring, trespass or negligence. He gets to decide how many years' worth to ask for. He gets to decide which defendants to sue. All of these things are going to have an effect on -- on the amount that's -- that's being asked for. And yet in all of these ways, we allow or -- maybe you're telling me no -- do we stop the named plaintiff from doing all -- all of those things, too?",
  "It's binding if the class is certified and a case proceeds to judgment. It's not binding on the absent class members prior to certification and prior to judgment.",
  "I think I don't understand that, Mr. Boutrous, because what you have, given that this is a State which says that these stipulations are binding if it proceeds, if there's certification, and if it proceeds to judgment, you have a cap of $5 million. You cannot be charged more than $5 million under this State's law, if this case ever gets to judgment.",
  "Well, Congress was concerned about suits of over $5 million. And -- and the question here is, is this a suit of over $5 million. Now, if it is a suit over $5 million, a State court is bound by the due process clause and a State court is going to find, look, you're just giving these plaintiffs' claims away. We're not going to allow you to do that. You're not an adequate representative. On the other hand, in a case like this where it's $5,024,000 and it only gets there because you've added on one and a half million dollars of legal fees, the Court might very well say you are an adequate representative, go for it. Now, usually we don't question State court judgments of that kind. Why should we do so here?",
  "Mr. Boutrous, I do think -- you have to be careful about two different uses of the word \"binding.\" It has no binding effect right now on an absent class member; they can go out and bring their own suit. If the -- the named plaintiff is found to be adequate and the suit goes forward and goes to judgment, then the stipulation does indeed have binding effect and -- and you have not been exposed to more than $5 million.",
  "It's binding -- it is binding on everybody if there's a finding of adequate representation and if this goes forward as a class action; then it's binding and you haven't been exposed.",
  "And they can remove no matter when that happens; is that right, as a result of CAFA, because CAFA took off the one year limit?",
  "Can I ask you this? Because I have been trying to figure out exactly what Mr. Boutrous is concerned about. And one thing he might be concerned about is that, notwithstanding that the class has really claims for $20 million, the thing is going to be certified for $5 million, and all these absent class members are -- are being deprived of something meaningful to them. But that's something which -- you know usually, we assume that State court judges will do their jobs, will pay attention to the Constitution, will apply adequacy of representation standards that come from the due process clause. So that seems like a strange thing to worry about in interpreting this Federal statute. The other possibility is that he might be worried that this stipulation won't be really as binding as you say, that in a case in which there is an adequacy of representation determination made, the class goes forward, and then things work out and it really looks like all these absent class members are going to get -- you know, badly treated. He's going to tear this stipulation up or do something like that. And it's going to be way down the line. And why should we allow that to happen?",
  "But this is -- he's done the certification, now it turns out that the certification was wrong, that in fact, these claims are worth a good deal more. And he says, I can't in good faith allow all these people's claims to be adjudicated for this amount of money when I know they're worth five times as much.",
  "Mr. Boutrous -- you know, a lot of your brief talks about this problem of discovery. And it -- it may very well be that there is a significant one, I don't know, but when you look at CAFA, I mean, CAFA did a lot of things. And it did not address this problem that you have with discovery. There could be -- I can give you -- you know, ten different proposals that would enable you to bypass expensive discovery, but CAFA didn't do any of them. And this is a kind of a jerry-rigged solution to get at a problem that Congress, in fact, did not address.",
  "Mr. Boutrous, the idea of master of the complaint is inherent in every class litigation because there could be no class actions, there could be no definition of anything, of the claims, of the amount of damages, of the number of defendants, of the amount of time unless the plaintiff, the named plaintiff, had some ability to define the claim. And this is just one aspect of that larger power.",
  "Okay. Then you really are asking us to blow up the whole world.",
  "Because you're saying: Next time we will be back and tell you that the named plaintiff can't define the clans. Next time we are going to be back and tell you that they can't name the defendants.",
  "Mr. Johnson, can I try what Justice Alito is getting at maybe in a slightly a different way? And it's really the argument that the Ninth Circuit made, which is that you can take any indivisible statute -- indivisible statute, and you can reimagine it as a statute with divisible elements, and Justice Alito gave one example of that. And the question that the Ninth Circuit says, is, once we've said that we can look to Shepard documents when we have a divisible statute, why not apply the same reasoning when we have an indivisible statute, given that any indivisible statute can kind of be reframed in our heads as a divisible one?",
  "And your principal argument isn't that -- is that what we've said in the modified categorical cases is that you look to these Shepard documents to help you define the element of the offense. So if you're not sure which offense the person has been convicted of, you look to the Shepard documents to do that. But you don't look to the Shepard documents for a different purpose, which is, we know what the elements of the offense are, but we want to know whether this person also committed the generic offense.",
  "Yes, but -- here's, I guess, the rub, which is -- you know, I take the point that what the Ninth Circuit has said does not seem very categorical. It doesn't seem categorical, it doesn't seem modified categorical. But there is something a little bit insane about your position. I don't see -- you take the most populous State in the country and everybody who's convicted of burglary, in the most populous State in the country, is not going to have committed an ACCA offense, even though, as Justice Breyer suggested, 98 percent of them really have.",
  "Mr. Horwich --",
  "I'm going to ask you about an argument you did make.",
  "As I understand your argument, your argument is not the Ninth Circuit's argument, because you very carefully distinguish what are what you call missing elements cases from this case.",
  "So do you reject the Ninth Circuit's view that the categorical approach should apply even where there is a missing element, as you -- as you call it?",
  "Let me give you a -- let me give you a different kind of example. Let's suppose you have a statute that's made it illegal to interfere with a law enforcement investigation. And you're prosecuting somebody, maybe the person is pleading, maybe he goes to trial; it doesn't matter. The theory of the case is that the defendant violated this statute, interference with a law enforcement investigation, by assaulting a police officer, okay? Is that a missing elements case or is that what you think is going on here, which is just -- it's just an overbroad statute?",
  "The conviction is interference with a law enforcement investigation. That's the statute. But interference with a law enforcement investigation can be done in extremely -- it can be done in an extremely violent way, which would be an ACCA offense or not.",
  "And it's overbroad. There are ACCA offenses in it, but there are also non-ACCA offenses in it.",
  "Sure.",
  "Well, why would there be any difference between those two? Why would you take your argument differently from the residual clause than in the enumerated crimes?",
  "Okay. Well, let me -- let's talk about this case, then. I mean, I'm not sure I understand that quite. But let's talk about the burglary. Suppose that there was a State that just said entry. In other words, this State says unlawful entry and you say that's overbroad, but we're still in sort of the same universe of an element. Suppose the State just said entry. Would we be in a missing element world or in an overbroad world?",
  "Your approach creates its own idiosyncrasies. I mean, suppose the same plea colloquy had taken place and the prosecutor, instead of saying -- you know, the defendant broke and entered, he had said, the defendant unlawfully entered, right? Completely different result under your theory; isn't that right?",
  "I think it's -- I think it's a deeper problem than that, because the defendant is standing there and he doesn't care at all whether the prosecutor says unlawfully entered or broke and entered. It doesn't matter a whit to him. And so -- and so something is -- is --",
  "-- the difference between an enhanced sentence and not an enhanced sentence that is not likely to be thought about, let alone adjudicated.",
  "I guess it depends on whether the basis has any relevance to the punishment he's going to receive, which in this case it doesn't, but put that aside. Here's one thing that strikes me as odd about your position. You said before in response to a question -- you said if the California Supreme Court had not decided Gauze, then you would not be up here arguing what you're arguing.",
  "Yes, if there were -- if there were no unlawful entry that counted under California law --",
  "-- but -- you know, the fact that there is a strange Gauze case which says that you can't burglarize your own home -- right -- the fact that the Court happens to come across that case and happens to decide -- it seems completely irrelevant as to this matter whether or not the California court once decided that you can't burglarize your own home. What does that have to do with anything in this case?",
  "Mr. Liman, what you suggested, when we talked about the discovery rule, is that it has its basis in the notion that a defendant with unclean hands who has committed deceptive conduct preventing the plaintiff from understanding that he or it has a cause of action -- you know, shouldn't be entitled to the benefit of a statute of limitations. And if that's the understanding that lies behind the discovery rule, I guess the question for you is, why doesn't it apply in this case, as well as, in a case where the person bringing the action has himself suffered a harm?",
  "It is true, though, isn't it, that Justice Scalia pointed to an anomaly that could easily exist in other contexts because this isn't only a statute about securities violations. So that you might have in other contexts in which this statute applies a world in which a private individual could sue, but the government -- could sue after the -- the period of time --",
  "-- the 5 years, but the government could not.",
  "And I take it that your view would be that a case like Exploration, it's different than this case because it does have a natural start date; is that the idea?",
  "But, Mr. Wall, I'll go even further than Justice Ginsburg. I mean this case actually seems to me a good example when Mr. Liman said there's no natural starting point and Justice Kennedy and Justice Alito referred to just -- this is a -- this is a decision about enforcement priorities. The government had decided not to go after market timers. And it changed its decision when a State attorney general decided to do it, and it embarrassed them that they had made that enforcement priority decision, and then the government made a different enforcement priority decision. But that's not the kind of situation that the discovery rule was intended to operate on, is it?",
  "Mr. Wall, why is it that you don't you have any cases? I mean, you said way back when: This didn't come up, this is a modern problem. So explain to me why this is a modern problem. This is obviously an old statute. Are you saying that this statute has not been used very -- was not used very much until very, very recently?",
  "But what you're running up against is a skepticism, that -- you know, the government, which has not -- asserted this power for 200 years, is now coming in and saying we want it. And the question is why hasn't the government asserted this power previously?",
  "General, how do you come up with 33? Why 33? Why not 10 or 60 or 90? Why -- how did you come up with the number?",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "General, you were -- you were telling me a little bit about the history of this statute. But why 30? Is there any indication of why the State picked 30?",
  "If that's where it comes from, then it does relate to a kind of estimate, doesn't it?",
  "General, on your theory am I correct that the North Carolina legislature could amend this statute tomorrow to make it two-thirds?",
  "But that's what I mean. I mean, on your theory it seems not to matter whether this statute says one-third or two-thirds. And I'm asking whether that's correct.",
  "I guess I'm not sure about that. In other words, I'm assuming an amendment that just all it does is it changes one-third to two-thirds. And so your theory it seems to me would work the exact same way. Then you say, well, you need a rational basis for doing that. But I thought you told me that the one-third really doesn't have anything to do with an estimate of how much is medical and how much is not medical. So it seems that you would have the same basis to say two-thirds as you do to say one-third. Am I wrong about that?",
  "But you're saying there's a kind of side constraint, that Medicaid recipients have to be treated like others, but then presumably, the State could change everybody's?",
  "Mr. Browning, let me give you a different rationale for this statute. It's different from the one the State suggests, but it would go something like this: There is an allocation that has to be made. In making allocations there are two ways of doing it. We can do it case-by-case, individualized decisionmaking; or we can use some bright-line rules. And the advantage of bright-line rules is that they are cheap and efficient and sometimes they are not more inaccurate than individualized decisionmaking because in individualized decisionmaking you can maker errors, too. So this is a reasonable way to make an allocation decision. And nothing that we said in Ahlborn suggests that a State needs to use case-by-case decisionmaking rather than bright-line rules to make the allocation that it needs to make between medical and nonmedical damages. What about that?",
  "And in those rebuttal presumption States, can both sides come in and try to rebut it? So the individual beneficiary can try to rebut it, but the States could as well? Or is it just a right for the beneficiary to try to rebut the presumption?",
  "Well, General, how about this, and I am having a little bit of trouble here because I think a State could come in, or I think there is a reasonable argument that a State could come in and say -- you know, we've made an estimate, and here's our best estimate, and we don't think there is a need for an individualized decision-making on top of that. But as I understand your argument, that is not what you are saying. You are making a very different kind of argument, suggesting that you can peg this number any place, no matter what the relationship between the number and the actual allocation that cases -- that allocation of medical and nonmedical damages in the real world. So if that's the case, what do I do?",
  "Mr. Koester, suppose that, instead of waiting two hours, there were procedures in place in Missouri and, indeed, across the country where it was possible to get a warrant in these circumstances within 15 or 20 minutes. Would you still be saying that there is a sufficient exigency to avoid the warrant requirement?",
  "You suggest that 15 or 20 would be a different case. I am wondering where you would draw the bright line.",
  "Or maybe they're drunk.",
  "But, but, but -- I mean, Justice Scalia raises a point, which is you always have some delay. Unless you are talking about sticking a needle in somebody roadside, you have to take them to the hospital. So there's going to be some amount of time which you're going to lose, and why can't you use that amount of time, if you can, to try to get a warrant?",
  "Do you think going back to Justice Scalia's question, if a person does take a breathalyzer, is there ever a reason for a warrantless blood test?",
  "All this talk about -- you know, losing evidence every second, I mean, I suppose the exact same thing could be said in other alcohol-related crimes, public drunkenness, underage drinking. You wouldn't be making the same arguments there, would you? Or would you?",
  "So it's not just exigency that you're -- you're saying that there should be a weighing of the costs and benefits here.",
  "Mr. Shapiro, that's a separate question, isn't it? I mean, one prong of your argument is you need individualized circumstances, you can't have a per se rule. And now this other set of questions is about what you get to count in the totality of the circumstances test; is that right?",
  "So one could disagree with you and one could think, as Justice Alito and Justice Kennedy suggested -- you know, you do take into account that it's the middle of the night in a rural county and it's going to take two hours, but still think, well, that's the analysis you have to go through.",
  "Mr. Shapiro, Schmerber is an odd case because Justice Ginsburg and you are exactly right, that they spend a lot of time talking about special facts, and particularly so, but then you read the opinion kind of backwards and forwards, and you can't find the special facts.",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Guerra, I have to admit that, given what a mess this statute is, those three words don't quite do it for me. So, I mean, the -- the argument against you, right, is -- as to using (b)(12) to define (b)(4), is that, look, this is just a list of exceptions to a general prohibition, and no one is more general or specific than any other, and all you have to do is fit within one of them. And it doesn't matter whether you don't fit within two of them, if you don't fit within one of them. So then the question would be: Are you covered by (b)(4) or not? If not, are you covered by (b)(12) or not?",
  "Mr. Guerra, where do you get that from, in (b)(4), this focus on tribunals, rather than lawyers? Because -- you know, the -- the investigation is done by lawyers, right? And that's a critical part of (b)(4), so where -- where does that come from in the statute?",
  "But then it includes things that are clearly done by lawyers.",
  "Mr. Guerra, that distinction -- I understand that you are deriving some of it from (b)(12), but if I -- just -- just assume with me that (b)(12) has nothing to do with anything, and you were just limited to (b)(4), can you find that distinction in (b)(4)?",
  "Mr. Guerra, don't you think -- I mean, I understand the distinction. The lawyer as commercial actor versus lawyer as officer of the court. But, boy, it's hard to get that from the words here. I mean, that -- that seems like the kind of old-time legislative interpretation, where we just figured out the statute that we hoped Congress would have written, as opposed to the statute that it did. I mean, tell me where that distinction is in this -- in this provision.",
  "Mr. Guerra, suppose I am a lawyer, and I want to bring a toxic tort case, and I am really -- I am looking for witnesses who have the same kind of symptoms as my client had. And so I put out a letter saying -- you know, have you have been exposed and -- and tell me about it, so that I can find out if you are a good witness, and -- you know, if you have, I would also like to represent you. Would -- would that count?",
  "Well, I guess what I was suggesting was that, if I was just asking for witnesses, you would have to say that that was included by (b)(4); is that right?",
  "So, now, the court -- the lawyer is saying, in addition to your help as a witness, if you have the same symptoms -- you know, you can join the suit.",
  "Can I ask about your line, Mr. Clement?",
  "Let me just see if I understand it, and I'll give you two things --",
  "-- and I think one falls on one side of your line --",
  "-- and the other falls on the other, but this is just to clarify where your line is. One is -- you know, I'm a lawyer, have you ever been in a car accident lately? If you have, contact me, and I would love to represent you. That -- the other is, I'm a lawyer, I think that there's a -- a real -- I'm -- I'm bringing a lawsuit about these red light cameras and saying that they're unlawful, and would you like to join me in that litigation? Am I right to think that the first falls on one side of the line, it's not enough, there's no litigation there; and the seconds falls on the other side, according to you?",
  "But your line --",
  "-- is a contemplated litigation.",
  "A specific contemplated litigation.",
  "But what you say, Mr. Clement, that you and your varsity version of the -- which is stronger than the other one is --",
  "-- is something like, if (b)(4) is hard, we have to draw a line someplace, we can look to (b)(12) as expressing some kind of concern that we can use to draw that line.",
  "It's not a conflict, we don't have to -- you know, it's not inconsistent, it's just this is an expression of what Congress was thinking about, we're going to use it as a clue.",
  "But, Mr. Guerra, it didn't draw the line at solicitation in (b)(4), and the advantage of Mr. Clement's argument is that the line that he sets up actually has a textual basis in (b)(4) because it focuses on words like \"what is a litigation,\" and \"what is a proceeding,\" and \"are we there yet.\" And that seems to be what the language of (b)(4) indicates.",
  "But why is this not workable? I mean, you can -- you can argue about whether it was right or wrong. You can argue about whether it has created some incongruity in the system. But haven't the last number of years suggested that it's perfectly workable? Everybody knows what they are supposed to do; everybody does it. Why -- why is this not workable?",
  "Ms. Maguire, could I take you to a different kind of question?",
  "Let's assume that there were a statute, and it said carrying a gun is an offense and that the range is 5 to 10 years. I realize it goes up further in the real word, but let's just say 5 to 10 years. And Congress said, in setting the penalty within that range, the judge shall consider whether the defendant brandished the gun and whether the defendant discharged the gun. Now -- and that's all the statute said. That would be constitutional; is that not right?",
  "Okay. So it's constitutional for the judge to say, seven years because you brandished, nine years because you discharged. So what makes it unconstitutional, what makes it a violation of the Sixth Amendment, when, now, Congress just provides something extra in the statute? It says not just you shall consider brandishing and discharging, but, if you find brandishing, you get 7; if you find discharging, you get 9.",
  "Well, that seems right as a definitional matter, as a descriptive matter. But I guess the question I'm having difficulty with is why does that matter for purposes of the Sixth Amendment? The jury is doing the exact same thing, which is the jury isn't doing anything in either of my examples. So the only difference between example number one, which you said was constitutional, and example number two is that, now, Congress is giving further instruction to the judge, but nothing more is being taken away from the jury; is it?",
  "Well, Apprendi, thought, did it both ways. I mean, that's the best sentence for you in Apprendi, but there are other sentences in Apprendi which more go towards what Justice Scalia suggested, that the question was increasing it above the maximum that the jury authorized. So I'm not sure that we can get from the language of Apprendi -- and I guess the question is, as a matter of principle, why I -- I completely understand why a defendant would care about this. The question is does it -- does it create a Sixth Amendment violation, which is -- you know, the jury has to do this, when -- when Congress is decreasing the judge's discretion, but it's -- either way, the jury isn't deciding this.",
  "Well, is that -- Mr. Dreeben, and -- and I think it's -- it's a great question. Is the jury functioning as a low-level gatekeeper under the Harris rule? Because I could make the argument that, in fact, it is -- you know, you take a statute, and it says, five and up for carrying, and seven and up for brandishing, right? And this isn't even a hypothetical. This is pretty close to this case. It goes to the jury. The jury says, we think he was carrying, we do not think that he was brandishing, all right? And then it goes to the judge. And, now, the judge says, you know what, if I had my druthers, I would only give five years. If I had my druthers, I absolutely would defer to the jury verdict, but I can't defer to the jury verdict because Congress has said I have to make this special factfinding, and the truth of the matter is I think he did brandish, and so I have to give seven years. So the judge is not deferring to the jury, and he's not deferring to the jury when he would prefer to do so. I guess the question is isn't that, in every practical sense -- doesn't the mandatory minimum effectively increase the maximum punishment that the -- that the defendant otherwise would get?",
  "Yes. But what I'm suggesting is that in the world of judges -- you know, this -- the graph you wrote has this very little difference in the Harris situation between five and seven. But, in fact, most judges want to give five. I mean, that's the truth of the matter, that -- you know, nobody's giving a 97-year sentence. So -- so the action in the criminal justice system is at this lower range. And, at this lower range, what the mandatory minimums do is effectively tell a judge that they cannot defer to a jury verdict.",
  "I know there are plenty of cases. All I'm saying is it's not the unusual case to find ourselves in exactly this position, where the judge wants to give five, the jury wants to give five, the judge can't defer to the jury's verdict that it should be five.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, could I take you back to the principles involved? Let's suppose that, instead of this statute, which is 579, you had a statute which was five for carrying, five up to life, and then, for brandishing, 40. All right? And maybe if we're discharging, 60. All right. So a very large gap. Is your argument still the same?",
  "But suppose the legislature --",
  "But suppose -- suppose that Congress is absolutely clear about it, and you say -- and I think that you're right, you've got to be right about this -- it's a constitutional matter, it's the same, but the hypothetical sort of suggests exactly what you said our inquiry ought to be, is that, in a world like that, the jury is, in fact, functioning only as a low-level gatekeeper; isn't that right?",
  "And that the only reason we see it in the hypothetical a little bit more clearly is because the numbers are a bit more dramatic.",
  "I mean, there's something deeply incongruous, isn't there, where you have an Apprendi rule which says if the maximum is -- you know, if it's five to seven, and then the -- the judge says seven years and a day, we're going to take that out, but as a mandatory minimum that will leapfrog you from five to 40 doesn't get the same result?",
  "Mr. Bourke, did anyone --",
  "Well, but how do we know that? How do we know that they would have reached the same determination if they had gotten it right on that single factor?",
  "Whether something is --",
  "Whether something is the State's fault is a significant factor in the analysis, and we have made that very clear in our cases. And so, if they got that wrong -- and -- and you, I think, quite rightly, are saying we can't defend that part of it -- if they got that wrong, don't we at least have to say, okay, well, get it right now, and do it again?",
  "Ms. Sigler, on appeal, you said this, the -- the State said, because the defendant was without properly funded counsel for so long, the State simply could not ethically or legally bring him to trial. So what did you mean when you said that, that the State could not ethically or legally bring him to trial?",
  "Well, did you ever say to Mr. Boyer -- you know, you can go ahead, right now, with this single counsel that you have? Was -- was that ever a choice put to him? Or because -- the way I read all of your assertions below and, indeed, the entire record below, is that everybody simply assumed that the case could not go forward in its present circumstances.",
  "Well, a decision implies a choice. Was a choice ever put to him?",
  "Well, you didn't even know that. You said the State could not ethically or legally bring him to trial. How was he supposed to know that?",
  "Ms. Sigler, could you go back to Justice Alito's question?",
  "That was a good -- that was a good segue.",
  "When we said in Krillon delays resulting from a systemic breakdown in the public defender system could be charged to the State, so that suggests systemic breakdown doesn't necessarily mean deliberate. It just means there has been a breakdown, and the result is that the person can't get to trial. And if -- I think -- if Justice Alito could even read that again and if you think about it, in light of this statement in Krillon, that systemic breakdowns are systemic breakdowns, whether or not they are deliberate.",
  "Mr. Boyer -- why would --",
  "Why would we get to that question? I mean, no courts below have dealt with it. It has been briefed to us in a grand total of two paragraphs, I think. There would be no reason for us to get to that question.",
  "And so -- so, from that point of view, we can assume that there is a robbery conviction that is still out there.",
  "Mr. Feldman, is --",
  "Mr. Feldman, as I understand your argument and -- and the differences that you have with the government, you have one set of differences about the meaning of 1089(e), but then another set about this question of, if it were true that the government was immune from suit, could you bring a tort suit against the doctors? And the government said -- says no. And you say, yes, you might be able to do that. But do you have to answer that question, at all, in order to say that you're correct on 1089(e)?",
  "So there is a lot of going back and forth about this question of what would happen if the government were immune, would the individual doctor be immune? But that is, essentially, irrelevant to the question before us; is that correct?",
  "Saying it a different way, I don't have to accept your broader argument; I can remain ambivalent about your broader argument and still accept your narrower argument.",
  "Is that correct?",
  "Well, let's go back to the text then, Mr. Shah. As I understand your argument, it goes something like this: This provision is there to -- to prevent people from drawing a mistaken inference. And the inference would be that the doctors were liable because the government was not. Now, there are a thousand ways to do that pretty clearly. You could just say, irrespective of whether the government is liable, the doctors are not -- or some such thing.",
  "But, instead, what Congress did was it enacted a kind of \"let's pretend\" provision, right? Let's pretend that the government is liable, so then the inference won't arise. Now, that has to be not just not the best way of achieving Congress's objective; it has to be the worst, right, because, then, you're raising the inference that in fact the government is liable. Why would Congress have wanted to do that?",
  "I'm saying something more than that.",
  "It could not have written it in a worse way.",
  "But this is not a side issue, Mr. Shah. In fact, you used your understanding of 1089(e) as an argument to produce that the result this Court reached in Smith, so it was -- it was not a very large issue, but it was -- it was an argument. You said -- you know, we should reach the result that we -- that you wanted in Smith because 1089(e) would continue to have this effect.",
  "It was a supportive argument. I am not saying that it was the but-for argument, but it was clearly a supportive argument in your brief.",
  "Mr. Shah, your basic theory of the case, which is that, in order to make absolutely certain that everyone gets the benefit of the intentional tort exception, both the government and individual doctors, in order to make that absolutely clear, Congress writes a provision saying that the intentional tort exception shall not apply. Now -- I mean, the -- the position, I have to say, seems to refute itself. If Congress wanted to make absolutely clear that the intentional tort exception would apply, it wouldn't have written a provision saying that it doesn't apply.",
  "Mr. Beard, can I go back to Justice Ginsburg's first question and make sure I understand your answer to it? Suppose that the State just had a policy that said, We're concerned about wetlands; in order to develop your piece of property, you have to come forward with a proposal -- a mitigation proposal and an adequate mitigation proposal. And then it gives some guidance about what an adequate mitigation proposal would mean, but it really leaves it up to the landowner. And the landowner says, sorry, I'm not giving you anything, I think I should be able to develop this on my own without providing any mitigation. Is that -- and -- and the State says, well, then, sorry, you don't get a permit. Is that a taking? Does the man have a takings claim? I heard you answer the question yes.",
  "Well, I -- that's the next question I was going to ask you because my understanding of Nollan and Dolan was that it assumed the condition, if taken alone, would constitute a taking. Do you disagree with that?",
  "Okay. So then you need a taking someplace in the picture; isn't that right? Nollan/Dolan says this is how we analyze takings in the context of a permit scheme. So we have to look for a taking. So, in my example, where is the taking? This was Justice Ginsburg's example. Where is the taking?",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Beard, I don't think anybody is contesting that there was a condition imposed or maybe there are. But -- you know, there's another question whether that condition is a taking. And we've been trying to figure out what's the taking here. In Nollan and Dolan, they took an easement, they took a piece of land, so that's the taking. Now, you said the funds are the taking; is that correct? Any time that somebody comes up with a proposal for -- for a developer to pay money, in order to compensate the State for the costs that are associated with his development, that that is, itself, a taking?",
  "No, I understand. But, in the permit context, a State can't say to somebody, you have to pay to perform some service or to compensate without it being a taking and without it being subject to Nollan and Dolan analysis.",
  "So -- so, for example -- and I'll try to do this very quickly, if -- if the State just had a policy for every acre of wetlands you fill in, it costs us $10,000, you need to pay $10,000, that's subject to Nollan and Dolan analysis, too.",
  "Well, are you saying, Mr. Michel, that what -- what the State courts are going to do is to say that, notwithstanding that the Federal circuit has ruled on a matter and notwithstanding that the lawyer has complied with the rule as articulated by the Federal circuit, that, nonetheless, they will be held to have committed malpractice because they didn't comply with the State's rule? Is -- is that what you think the State judges are really going to do?",
  "What if a lawyer says to the -- you know, I complied with all the Federal law -- all the rules from the Federal circuit, I complied with.",
  "You are suggesting that the State court is going to say, too bad, you committed malpractice anyway because you didn't comply with our hypothetical law about patents?",
  "Well, Mr. Goldstein, at one level, you are right. It's just a level that doesn't help you very much. I mean, it's -- it's true that, always, there is an initial question of whether an agency is entitled to Chevron deference. But, usually, the way we answer that question is just this: We say is this the agency's organic statute? Yes. Does that organic statute provide the agency with lawmaking power? Yes. Has the agency acted in accordance with that lawmaking-- under that lawmaking power? Yes. Well, then, the agency gets deference. We go on to the next thing, which is Step One and Step Two. So -- you know, we don't -- what we don't do is this sort of provision by provision, subsection by subsection, did Congress have a special intent as to this subject matter or that subject matter or the other subject matter? We've just had some very simple rules about what gets you into the box where an agency is entitled to deference.",
  "But take Meade, Mr. -- I'm sorry. Did --",
  "And Meade presented -- whatever you think of Meade, it's a very different question from this because what the majority in Meade said was that the agency wasn't entitled to deference because it was acting by way of these opinion letters that weren't -- that didn't have the force of law. So that's the threshold question, is does the agency have power to make rules with the force of law, and is the agency exercising that power? That is a threshold question that has been set by this Court. It's a very different kind of question from provision by provision, subsection by subsection, did -- did Congress think that the agency had authority over this particular subject matter or not.",
  "Well, Mr. Goldstein, I think, with respect, it's not silliness. You have been running as fast as you can away from the arguments that IMLA has presented, that, in every case, it's a who, what, where -- you know, or how question and that we have to answer that. But the question that General Verrilli raises, I think, is a fair question, is how your argument, which says that we have to consider in each case as to each statutory provision whether an agency has interpretive authority is any different from IMLA's argument that we have to consider with -- in respect to every case whether we're dealing with a when, what, who, where question, or a how question. It's the same argument; isn't it?",
  "Of course, there's a threshold question, but the threshold question has always been is the agency interpreting its organic statute and is -- does that statute give the agency rule-making authority and is that what the agency is exercising?",
  "Well, I guess I'm still waiting for -- for the -- the way in which your inquiry is different from IMLA's inquiry.",
  "What are the kinds of things, Mr. Yang, that would be within the scope of employment, but would not be acting in a law enforcement capacity for a law enforcement officer? What's the difference between those two standards for a law enforcement officer?",
  "But you can't give me just a couple of examples of how the difference would matter, you know, in some States, where something would be -- would meet the scope of employment test, but not meet the acting as a law enforcement officer test, for a law enforcement officer again.",
  "Mr. Bucholtz, the statute itself has a kind of conduct-based limitation in it. It says law enforcement officers acting within the scope of their employment. So I guess my question is, given that there is that conduct-based limitation in the statute, why one would substitute for it law enforcement officers acting as law enforcement officers? Why wouldn't one use just the conduct-based limitation that's already there?",
  "But again, it's not just any acts of law enforcement officers. It's acts of law enforcement officers acting within the scope of their authority. And now you're saying acting as a law enforcement officer. I mean, one question I suppose I have, which is the same question that I gave to Mr. Yang, is what's the difference between those two things? And I guess the second question is: Why would we substitute one phrase about how they have to be acting for the phrase that Congress actually used?",
  "Mr. Bucholtz, I'm sure you have done this already, so I apologize, but could you just state your definition of what it means to be acting as a law enforcement officer? What activities other than the three listed get included?",
  "But you don't want to limit it to those -- so what else gets in the mix? How would you define it generally?",
  "Maybe? I mean, yes or no or when or --",
  "But if we're going to adopt your definition, we have to have some understanding of where it's taking us.",
  "Have they also adopted the government's view of what counts as an officer, or have they not?",
  "Well, except to the extent, as Justice Breyer suggested, except to the extent that the purchase is going to use the article just to create a new one of the exact same kind. And it seems to me that what you're suggesting is that the basic rule that says that the purchaser does not get to do that should have an exception for self-replicating technologies.",
  "Mr. Walters, could you go back to the Chief Justice's opening question because the Chief Justice asked you what incentive Monsanto would have to produce this kind of product if you were right. And you said, well, they can protect themselves by contract. Actually, it seems to me that that answer is peculiarly insufficient in this kind of a case because all that has to happen is that one seed escapes the web of these contracts, and that seed because it can self-replicate in the way that it can, essentially makes all the contracts worthless. So again, we are back to the Chief Justice's problem, that Monsanto would have no incentive to create a product like this one.",
  "Ms. Sherry -- I'm sorry. In everything you've said you agree with Mr. Waxman. There is this issue in the case where you disagree, which is the Conditional Sale Doctrine. I am just wondering, before you finish up, could you say a bit about whether that doctrine is causing trouble as it presently exists in the Federal Circuit? In other words, could we just ignore that doctrine if we wanted to, or is it a very problematic one that we should take this opportunity to do something about?",
  "Mr. Waxman, there is a worrisome thing on the other side, though, too. And that is that your position has the -- has the capacity to make infringers out of everybody. And that is highlighted actually in this case by how successful this product is and how large a percentage of the market it has had. So that -- you know, seeds can be blown onto a farmer's farm by wind, and all of a sudden you have Roundup seeds there and the person -- farmer is infringing, or there's a 10-year-old who wants to do a science project of creating a soybean plant, and he goes to the supermarket and gets some edamame, and it turns out that it's Roundup seeds.",
  "And, you know, these Roundup seeds are everywhere, it seems to me. There's, what, 90 percent of all the seeds that are around? So it seems as though -- like pretty much everybody is an infringer at this point, aren't they?",
  "Okay. I'll change the hypothetical.",
  "And I thought I was being so clever, too.",
  "And is the only thing that's necessary -- excuse me -- is the only thing that's necessary that the law affect a few people commercially? I mean, how much -- how many of the requesters have to be engaged in some kind of commercial activity in order for your arguments to work?",
  "But you don't deny that, in general, this does affect out-of-State data collectors, people who are engaged in the kind of business that Justice Breyer was talking about, is that right?",
  "Well, General, can I-- just indulge me with a hypothetical. Suppose that the background for these statutes was different. The statutes were the same, but, in addition to talking about people's right to know about how their government works, the people spend a lot of time also talking about the economic benefits of a free flow of information in our country. Would that -- if that were true -- and I want to put myself on record as not remembering when these statutes were passed -- you know.",
  "But, if that were true, would this case be different? Or would you still be up here saying the same thing?",
  "The statute does exactly the same thing. I'm just suggesting that there might be two interests behind the statute. One is about knowing the way your government operates, and the other is about free flows of information in our economy. And, if both of those things had gone into the mix to create statutes of this kind, would you be up here saying the same thing or not?",
  "I think the thing, General, that I was trying to get at, it seems to me you have a very good case that these statutes were -- were meant for a different purpose. But, in fact, it seems as though your friends there have a good case that these statutes have been taken over, to a large extent, across the country by economic enterprises doing economic things. And, at that point in time, Virginia's -­ and -- you know, you are only one of two States -­ Virginia's maintenance of this kind of -- no, it's Virginians -- you know, Virginia information for Virginians, looks very different from what it might have looked like when the statute was originally passed.",
  "Mr. Clement, if I --",
  "Well, Mr. -- I'm sorry, please.",
  "Okay. Then let me ask you my question.",
  "Ok. Do you agree -- I mean, you said we should look to the way this is designed, so let's look to the way that the actual formula is designed. Do you agree that this tax would impose identical tax liability for companies with -- at the same average profits, but could impose very different tax liability for companies with the same total profits? That's the way the thing is designed, is it not?",
  "Well, that's the question. Is that true of every Excess Profits Tax? Take a -- a hypothetical like this: You have two companies, Company A and Company B, and one company operates over four years and makes a lot of money, and one company operates over one year and makes only a quarter of that amount of money. Now, a typical Excess Profits Tax is going to take Company A, which has made a lot of money, and -- and it's going to end up paying four times as much tax as Company B, which has made only a quarter of the amount of money. But, under this tax, Company A and Company B pay the exact same thing; isn't that right?",
  "One year or four years? Four --",
  "In other words, a company that has made four times as much profits under this formula could pay the same tax; isn't that right?",
  "Because it was operating four times as long.",
  "And because there is that D variable.",
  "Assuming the floatation value is the same for both companies.",
  "It definitely could. It would have to. And that's because what this is trying to tax is not total profits. This is trying to tax average profits, or what may be the better way to say it, is it's taxing profitability and not profits.",
  "But -- but the reason why this formula was devised in the way that this formula was devised was specifically to get at the outlier. In other words, it was to get at the company that only operated for a short amount of time, but they wanted that company to pay just as big a tax bill as the company that had operated for a much longer amount of time and had made many more profits. So the end result is that this company that operates for a very short amount of time and makes almost no excess profits pays the exact same tax bill as a company with four times as much excess profits.",
  "No, but even companies with the exact same profits and the exact same floatation value can be subject to different taxes, and that's a result of the amount of time, that's a result of the D variable. If you were right --",
  "Excuse me. If you were right, the D variable wouldn't exist. If this were an Excess Profits Tax, it would have been written without a D variable because they would not have cared whether it was four years or one year or any place in-between.",
  "If you were right, it would just be a 52 percent tax on annual profits above 1/9th of floatation value, and it's not that. It's not that -- specifically, in order to get at railroad track, which would have paid very little tax under your formula, but, instead, pays a great amount of tax because they think that railroad track got the same good deal at the beginning as all these other companies did, but -- so, even though they didn't make very much in the way of excess profits, they were going to tax them just as much.",
  "But you're -- you're not saying that the amicus brief is wrong. The Chief Justice is, of course, right, the amicus brief is the amicus brief, and the amicus brief develops this argument, which I think is the right argument. But you're not saying that's wrong?",
  "Because they're saying this is not an income for anybody because, in fact, this doesn't tax anybody's income. It taxes annual -- excuse me -- it taxes average profits, not total profits. It taxes profitability as a mechanism to tax value.",
  "Well, now, I'm totally confused because this outlier is an outlier not because the tax hasn't worked. It's an -- it's an outlier that the tax is designed to get at, that this formula was developed with this D variable, in order to make sure that outliers, meaning people -- companies that operated for only a short amount of time would still pay a significant tax bill. So the whole design of this tax was to get at the outlier. That seems, to me, to suggest that the predominant character of the tax is not an income tax, but is, instead, a value tax.",
  "Mr. Clement, what do you think would -- is the answer -- suppose that the Labour government had come in -- not after 4 years but after 2 years -- that they had looked at those 2 years of profits, they said, that's enough for us, to know that these companies were grossly undervalued, and they had done this exact same formula, and the result is that they would have ended up with a tax rate of over 100 percent. Would that have been creditable or not?",
  "I guess what the hypothetical suggests is that, in some respects, the fact that you now -- that you have a tax rate here of between 0 and 1 is a bit of a fluke -- you know, if they had come in a little bit earlier and done the exact same thing, based on their understanding of how profitable these companies were, which they would have seen after 2 years, you wouldn't have been able to make the same argument.",
  "So if everything -- if everything in Texas's system were the same, but you had a year, would that flip Texas into a different category?",
  "Is the problem -- is what makes this impracticable just the amount of time?",
  "Mr. Oldham, I --",
  "Well, able -- able to be brought, Mr. Oldham, but, as Justice Ginsburg started off by saying, many times, the court of criminal appeals has said the preferred mechanism is to bring it on collateral appeal. And, more to the point even, when attorneys try to bring these kinds of claims on a motion for a new trial, the typical response is to say, no, this is not the proper venue for that, go back and do it again on collateral review. So we have -- you say that there's a formal mechanism that could be used. But it seems as though the courts and the lawyers, both, in Texas, are being told continually, don't use that formal mechanism; instead, do this on collateral review.",
  "Well, isn't the usual response just to dismiss it without prejudice and to say, we don't have time to deal with this, go away, come back again on collateral review?",
  "Well, because, mostly, the record isn't sufficient for a Wiggins claim. So anytime somebody brings a Wiggins claim on this 30-day window, the Court says -- you know, there's only 30 days, the record is insufficient. Go away, do it again.",
  "That's your one case, it seems to me. You only have one case. It's Armstrong. Armstrong seems to me sort of like proof as to why it is that the Texas courts don't do that generally because what they did in Armstrong was they ended up trying to adjudicate that on the merits and realizing that there was -- that the record wasn't sufficient.",
  "Do you agree, Mr. Oldham, that, if you didn't have the mechanism for a new trial, then you would form under the Martinez rule?",
  "In other words, no opportunity for factual development.",
  "Mr. Oldham, I had thought that Martinez was really an equitable rule. It was an equitable rule about giving people an opportunity to raise a trial ineffectiveness claim. And if it's true that, although Texas has a technical possibility of doing that outside of collateral review, but, in fact, that the lawyers are told not to use that route, that the lawyers don't use that route, that, if they do use that route, the likelihood is that they will be thrown out for using that route, the question is why that -- the formal availability of a mechanism that nobody uses and that everybody is told not to use should matter with respect to the application of an equitable rule like Martinez?",
  "So you are suggesting that if -- if an attorney is appointed within a few days or within a week, as happened here, that, in that case, there would not be that opportunity, it would be the 30 days, that's it, stop?",
  "But you're creating a world in which this would function as an exception to a State time limit, but not to the AEDPA time limit.",
  "Why does that make any sense?",
  "But I thought we said, in Missouri v. Holland, that AEDPA was -- was enacted against a background rule, which stated that normal equitable principles, such as this one, which had been applied everywhere to all procedural bars, that AEDPA suggested that those would -- that AEDPA was against a background that those would continue to apply.",
  "But why is a Federal statute of limitations any different?",
  "Yes, but, again, it's Congress but we said, in Holland, that it's Congress and AEDPA has -- has -- was drafted against this presumption that normal equitable principles would apply.",
  "But, again, why would Congress have thought that there would be any difference in -- with respect to a statute of limitations?",
  "But that applies to States, as well.",
  "General, you had suggested, earlier, some way out of this puzzle about why Congress would have put the actual innocence exception into the second successive petition provision and not had one for a first petition?",
  "So that seems really quite odd to me. I mean, a number of my colleagues have said, well, can we really believe that Congress contemplated this. But, I mean, don't we have evidence that Congress contemplated it in the second and successive context, a slightly tighter version, wouldn't it be quite odd to say that Congress contemplated an actual innocence exception when you are on your second petition, but barred it when you are on your first? What sense would that be?",
  "Well, I guess I'm just not sure I understand that. I mean, they could have added a separate provision, just saying there's an actual innocence exception, or there is -- there's not, consistent with the way they did it in the -- in the second and successive petition.",
  "Well, it didn't have to. Why would it have necessarily have limited (d)(1)(D)?",
  "Well, you just you make the converse clear.",
  "All I'm suggesting is that your interpretation of the statute creates a glaring anomaly that people would be out of court on the first petition, and they could turn around on their second petition, which is usually disfavored, and get an actual innocence exception.",
  "But, Ms. Winfree, that can't be quite right, can it? I mean, such a person -- assume you've been arrested for something, the State doesn't have the right to go search your house for evidence of unrelated crimes; isn't -- isn't that correct?",
  "It doesn't have the right to go search your car for evidence of unrelated crimes.",
  "Just because you've been arrested doesn't mean that you lose the privacy expectations and things you have that aren't related to the offense that you've been arrested for.",
  "Well -- and if there were a real identification purpose for this, then I understand that argument. But, if it's just to solve cold cases, which is the way you started, then it's just like searching your house, to see what's in your house that could help to solve a cold case.",
  "Well, but, if that's what you're basing it on, then you're not basing it on an arrestee. I mean, then the Chief Justice is right, it could be any arrestee, no matter how minor the offense. It could be just any old person in the street. Why don't we do this for everybody who comes in for a driver's license because it's very effective?",
  "Well, Mr. Dreeben, is it really? Because, if this were like fingerprints, I think that you would have a quite good case. But, as I've been reading about this, it -- it seems as though the technology is not the same as the fingerprint technology; and, because the technology is different, it is used differently. Fingerprints, you go in, you put in a fingerprint, there is identifying information that comes back to you in 5 minutes, right? This, you put in something, and Ms. Winfree said was 11 to 17 days, in this case, it's four months, and it doesn't seem to be used because the technology doesn't allow it to be used as the kind of routine identifier that fingerprints does. So am I wrong about that?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, could I understand how this works, exactly? The swab is taken, and if I understand -- there is a database which is known offenders, and there is a database which is kind of crime scene DNA, is that correct?",
  "And, when the swab is taken and it's put into the system, you check that against the crime scene DNA database, is that correct?",
  "Do you check it -- does Maryland check it against the known offenders database?",
  "Because that suggests that, right now, it's functioning as let's solve some crimes, which is a good thing -- you know, that we should solve some crimes, but not as an identification device because you're -- if it were an identification device, you would be comparing it to the known offender database, not to the cold case database.",
  "But the typical special needs case is one in which we say there's no law enforcement interest, that there's an interest other than the interest in solving crime.",
  "When you started, Mr. Dreeben, you started by saying -- you know, they have a reduced expectation of privacy, and we have important interests. You went right into free-form balancing. That's typically not the way we do it. If we said to you, look -- you know, the way we do it is you need a warrant, and if you -- there is some exceptions, then you have to put yourself into a well-recognized exception where you can search without a warrant. And that's especially the case when there is no suspicion whatsoever. How would you do it? How would you do it short of free-form balancing? What exception are you a part of?",
  "What are your other two distinctions?",
  "So, Mr. Shanmugam, that seems to me a real distinction in this case, as it's been litigated. I take what the government is saying is something like, give us 5 years, and those won't look very different. In other words, we will be able to do, in 5 years' time, exactly what we can do with fingerprinting, except it will be, as Justice Breyer says, more accurate. So we are just about 5 years ahead of that, so give us a break.",
  "But, Mr. Shanmugam, just suppose -- I mean, I guess the question is would this be unconstitutional? It's not the world we are living in now, but let me -- 10 years from now, the government says, we are really switching over to a fingerprint system -- to a DNA system, and what that system is going to allow us to do is it's going to allow us to identify, and it's going to allow us to bring up the old criminal history, and it's going to allow us to see whether there are also unsolved crimes that we can tag to this person and discover that he's really, really dangerous. All right? And so the government puts that system into effect. Is it constitutional?",
  "But isn't the important point, Mr. Kinnaird, that there's a presumption of correctness that attaches to guidelines sentences on appeal --",
  "-- that does not attach to non-guidelines sentences?",
  "I mean, this has, one would think, great legal consequence.",
  "But what that suggests is that the guidelines are -- serve as an anchor and are supposed to serve as an anchor and that the reason why the miscalculation is error is because you've picked the wrong anchor and that's going to affect or -- or has a significant likelihood of affecting your ultimate decision. And isn't that, really, what we've suggested? Is the way the guidelines ought to work and the way you think the guidelines ought to work, that it serves as an anchor for sentencing decisions; yes, you can vary, you can deviate, but it's your anchor.",
  "I think I'm saying more than it's all in your head. I think I'm saying you start in a particular place, you have to get the particular place right. The appellate court looks at the particular place that you've started and, if you -- if you've ended up there, has to grant a presumption of reasonableness. But the rules are all geared towards saying, yes, you can deviate, but you have to understand that there's -- that deviation requires some kind of thought process and some kind of reason. Otherwise, this is where you should be.",
  "Mr. Feigin, you're sounding awfully like according deference to the guidelines counts as reversible error.",
  "But, surely, you do not want judges living in a world where they think that they cannot give deference to the guidelines, isn't that right? You want them to give appropriate deference to the guidelines, isn't that correct?",
  "Mr. Feigin, take -- take this example: Let's suppose that there's a crime and the punishment for crime is 5 years to life, all right? Now, Congress passes a statute, and it says, no, we think this crime, now, is much more important than we used to; now, it's 25 years to life, right? A person commits the offense prior to that change. Absolutely obvious case, right, that you have to apply the -- the 5 years to life, right? Obvious, correct?",
  "Okay. Now, the Sentencing Commission does what the Sentencing Commission always does when there is a legislative change like this. It says, well, we have this guidelines that assumes 5 years to life. We have to change our guidelines because, now, it's 25 years to life. And it passes a guideline amendment which completely conforms to the legislative amendment. But you're saying, no, the 25-year-to-life guideline is the appropriate one to implement, even though the 5-year statute is the appropriate one to implement -- is the appropriate one to give effect to. Is that -- can that possibly be right?",
  "But, Mr. Feigin, I think more goes into it than empirics. But there's this unbelievable chart, really, in one of the green briefs about -- you know, where there's one line, which is what happens to the guidelines, and there's this other line, which is what happens to the sentence, and they follow each other identically, exactly. You can't get a chart that looks better from this than -- from Mr. Kinnaird's point of view.",
  "Mr. Kellogg, do you think that if in your arbitration agreement you had a clause which just said, I hereby agree not to bring any Sherman Act claim against American Express, could -- could your arbitration agreement do that?",
  "It -- it couldn't, right because we would say no, there has to be an -- an opportunity for a vindication of statutory rights, is that right?",
  "And -- and suppose that the arbitration clause said something different. Suppose that the arbitration clause said, I -- I hereby agree that I will not present any economic evidence in an antitrust action against American Express. Could it do that?",
  "Well, even putting aside State unconscionability principles, wouldn't you think that our Mitsubishi case and our Randolph case would again come in and say, my gosh, this arbitration clause prevents any effective vindication of the rights to bring an antitrust suit. Wouldn't you say that.",
  "So you think -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
  "So I just want to make sure I understand your answer, which is that you read Mitsubishi and Randolph as so narrow that you would say that the principle that they embody does not prevent American Express from saying, you cannot produce -- you cannot use any economic expert or any economic testimony in an antitrust suit.",
  "Well, my -- my question is not about class procedures, it's about allowing economic evidence to help prove your claim. And you said, no problem, even though it is, of course, true in the real world that to prove a successful antitrust claim, you need economic evidence.",
  "And you said that's fine because you're going to read Mitsubishi and Randolph in such a way that it allows an arbitration clause to 100 percent effectively absolutely frustrate your ability to bring a Sherman Act suit.",
  "Well, I think -- I think what they are saying is something a little bit different, which is that if you go -- if you accept my premise that the arbitration clause could not say no economic evidence, what the -- Respondents here are saying is, well, now you have to give us the ability to produce economic evidence and maybe that involves class procedures, maybe it involves something else. It could involve some other cost-sharing mechanism. But if the arbitration clause works to prevent us from sharing costs in such a way that we can produce that evidence, then once again we have a problem about completely frustrating the effect of the Sherman Act.",
  "Mr. Kellogg, are you suggesting that you can win an antitrust suit in arbitration without presenting economic evidence of such things as monopoly power, antitrust injury, damages? How could somebody do that?",
  "Well, Mr. Kellogg, could I go back to Justice Alito's point because I'm not sure I quite understood your -- your answer to it. Essentially, the claim here, right, is that this is a party with a monopolistic power, such that -- and this is just the Plaintiff's allegation, it may or may not be true, but -- but they say that American Express is using its market power to impose particular contract terms. And they have a tying thing, but it could just as easily be the case that American Express could be using its economic power to impose terms essentially making arbitration of antitrust claims impossible. And why shouldn't we understand this problem as connected to the very allegation that's being brought? That -- you know, how is it, how is it going to be possible in a case where there's a monopoly power able -- able to impose contracts terms that -- that you can create an arbitration clause, which essentially prevents that from being challenged?",
  "And, Mr. Kellogg --",
  "Just to be sure I understand it, that you're saying that it does not violate the confidentiality agreement of this clause to -- to all get together and produce one report?",
  "Okay.",
  "And did -- did you say that below as well, that -- that the confidentiality clause does not sweep so widely as to prevent this? Because clearly, the court below thought that the confidentiality clause did sweep so widely as to prevent this.",
  "So but you're saying the confidentiality position would not apply in that circumstance.",
  "And, Mr. -- Mr. Stewart, isn't that also consistent with the way the Court addressed the issue in Randolph? Because what the Court said there was it might be that these arbitration fees are prohibitive. And if those arbitration fees are prohibitive, then this doctrine kicks in. And it didn't look to say, well, let's compare how these fees relate to whatever costs you would wind up with in litigation. It just said, if the arbitration fees are prohibitive, in such -- in such a manner that it prevents you from vindicating your Federal claim in arbitration, that's enough.",
  "Well, Mr. Kellogg, it does seem like both of the parties have changed what they're saying a bit. And -- you know, if this case as presented to us was presented to us in the first instance that the premise was that if you go into arbitration, it would not provide an effective way to vindicate the claim. And, now, people are saying different things about the confidentiality clause, and people may be saying different things about the necessity of an expert. It suggests that the premise on which this case was presented to us was not quite right.",
  "But think about this State that you're representing, it's about a quarter black, but Alabama has no black statewide elected officials. If Congress were to write a formula that looked to the number of successful Section 2 suits per million residents, Alabama would be the number one State on the list. If you factor in unpublished Section 2 suits, Alabama would be the number two State on the list. If you use the number of Section 5 enforcement actions, Alabama would again be the number two State on the list. I mean, you're objecting to a formula, but under any formula that Congress could devise, it would capture Alabama.",
  "And in 1986 -- or excuse me, 2006 -- Congress went back to the problem, developed a very substantial record, a 15,000-page legislative record, talked about what problems had been solved, talked about what problems had yet to be solved, and decided that, although the problem had changed, the problem was still evident enough that the act should continue. It's hard to see how Congress could have developed a better and more thorough legislative record than it did, Mr. Rein.",
  "Well, that sounds like a good argument to me, Justice Scalia. It was clear to 98 Senators, including every Senator from a covered State, who decided that there was a continuing need for this piece of legislation.",
  "Well, the Fifteenth Amendment says \"denial or abridgement.\" What would \"abridgement\" mean except for dilution?",
  "Well, the formula that has --",
  "Well, Mr. Rein, the formula that -- that is applied right now, under that formula covered jurisdictions, which have less than 25 percent of the nation's total population, they account for 56 percent of all successful published Section 2 lawsuits. If you do that on a per capita basis, the successful Section 2 lawsuits, four times higher in covered jurisdictions than in noncovered jurisdictions. So the formula -- you can -- you know, say maybe this district shouldn't be covered, maybe this one should be covered. The formula seems to be working pretty well in terms of going after the actual violations on the ground and who's committing them.",
  "Well, all formulas are underinclusive and all formulas are overinclusive. Congress has developed this formula and has continued it in use that actually seems to work pretty well in targeting the places where there are the most successful Section 2 lawsuits, where there are the most violations on the ground that have been adjudicated.",
  "Well, Mr. Rein --",
  "-- that is the question, isn't it? You said the problem has been solved. But who gets to make that judgment really? Is it you, is it the Court, or is it Congress?",
  "Well, that's a big, new power that you are giving us, that we have the power now to decide whether racial discrimination has been solved? I did not think that that fell within our bailiwick.",
  "But I guess the question is how do you measure this loss? I mean, if you take money away and then you give it back, or even if you give it back with 2 percent interest or something, I mean, maybe if that money had remained in the trust and I realize that this is a strange trust, but we have to think about other kinds of trusts, if that money had remained in the trust, there would have been a profit to be made from that money. And -- you know, it's not -- if you say, well, I gave it back, well, yes, but if you had just left it there, you would have had that money plus all the money that that money earned.",
  "Mr. Bensinger, if I heard you correctly, you said that the definition was a monetary deficiency arising from a breach of trust. Is that -- does that mean that you're conceding that there has to be a loss of monetary deficiency?",
  "Whether there was or was not in this case, but you're conceding that there has to be a monetary deficiency according to the traditional definitions.",
  "Well, monetary deficiency, again, isn't that a loss? But I thought that your position was that there didn't need to be a loss.",
  "Well, that's certainly true --",
  "-- in an ordinary trust, but isn't there a real question as to this trust because if this trust would -- the trustee shouldn't have been investing this in the first place. All that this trust was going to get was the principal plus a fixed income.",
  "But, General Horne, wouldn't it contradict it if instead of saying well, we'd like you to offer identification, saying, well, we'd like you also to have a paper ticket.",
  "That would be inconsistent with the accept and use language, isn't that right?",
  "Well, you added something to the Federal form, and that essentially creates a new set of requirements and a new form.",
  "Do you -- do you think that you could have said -- you know, we have our own State form, which we're allowed to have under the statute. Anybody who requires the Federal form has to append the State form as well. Could you have done that?",
  "Well, how do we draw the line? Where does the line get drawn between adding just your own form, and adding a new set of requirements, which -- you know, you could just as easily have called a form?",
  "But -- but, General, doesn't the -- the statute make the EAC the decision maker with respect to what can be added to the Federal form? The Federal form -- form, you're exactly right, sets a floor. But if you look at Section 7, what Section 7 does is to say the EAC gets to decide the minimum necessary, and it consults with the States and the States can come to it and tell it what it needs, and the EAC can take action. But the EAC is driving the bus, according to Section 7 of this statute.",
  "I'm a little bit confused.",
  "General, could -- could I take you back to this distinction that you're making. You said you can't append an additional form, you can't use an additional form, but you can require additional information.",
  "So how do -- what's the difference between requiring additional information and requiring an additional form? Isn't -- when you say you need information A, B, C, D, E, that's just a form, isn't it?",
  "Well, what is the -- what would be the purpose of requiring a Federal form if you could just say, and in addition to that, you have to give ten more items of information? I mean, then the Federal form just becomes another hoop to jump through.",
  "Ms. Millett, I mean, suppose it were true that the EAC has been inconsistent in this respect. That would be a different kind of lawsuit.",
  "Mr. Lefkowitz, could I understand something just about the scope of your argument? It -- it seems to me that in this case we are not really dealing only with generics, we are also dealing with brand-named drugs. And I guess the -- the thought there would be, in -- with -- with -- in this respect, as to design, as compared to warnings, but as to design, they're really all in the same boat. In other words -- you know, they have a design, that it is only that design that's approved. If they change their design there's no authority to continue marketing it. They have to go back to square one. And that's just as true of brand names as it is of generics. So am I right about that? That -- that if we're just looking at a pure design defect claim, putting the warning card aside, where you are in a different position from the brand-name drugs, but as to design, don't the brand-name and the generics go hand in hand?",
  "I want you to put that aside for me for just a second, and I understand that's a very significant thing in your argument to put aside. But let's just assume that there was a design defect claim that didn't have to do with warnings, where you are in a different position. Let's just assume on a pure design defect claim, am I right that generics and brand-name manufacturers are in the same position with respect to those claims?",
  "Just about how you make the drug?",
  "Not what the government is saying, I mean, I myself, I just can't figure out what distinction there would be.",
  "So I'm asking you.",
  "But, you -- but again, and I know that this is a big part of your argument, but to the extent that a warning was not involved in the claim, and it was just about the design of a drug, I guess I'm asking you, is there any possible way to distinguish between generics and brand-name manufacturers?",
  "But, Mr. Lefkowitz, I think in describing the FDCA just now, you used the word \"authorizes,\" and typically, when we think about impossibility, it's not enough that a State law penalizes what Federal law authorizes. What we -- something is impossible when a State law penalizes what Federal law requires or maybe -- or, where State law penalizes what Federal law gives you a right to do. But it's not enough for impossibility that State law penalizes what Federal law permits. And it seems as though what we have in the FDCA is a statute that authorizes, that says, you can sell this. But it doesn't say you must sell it, and it doesn't give you a right to sell it.",
  "Well, that is your best case, but -- you know, there are quite a number of cases where we've really held when a Federal law permits something, typically, a State can do more if it wants to.",
  "I mean, that suggests that there is an obligation of the Federal government. If there is one, yes, there's a conflict and yes, there's an impossibility defense. But if there's no obligation, if all there is, is permission from the Federal government, where do you get the impossibility from?",
  "Well, I take that point, Mr. Yang. I take that point, Mr. Yang, but I think then you're -- you're saying something quite deep about the FDCA, which is that the FDCA should not be thought of as merely authorizing drug sales. You're saying essentially that when the -- when the FDA does what it does, it's saying not just -- you know, you can do this if you want to, but you can do this and we really think this drug ought to be marketed. So that when States take action as against that -- you know, it's -- it's a conflict.",
  "And that's --",
  "-- and that's something I don't think we've really ever said.",
  "Mr. Frederick, it -- it does seem to me, and I understand that there's a waiver argument floating around here, but it does seem to me that this case was litigated such that the adequacy of the warning is really all over this case. There was expert testimony about the adequacy of the warning, there were jury instructions about the adequacy of the warning. In the closing statements that the lawyer gave, it was -- there was a lot of talk about -- that the FDA's decision to change the label, to show that the label was ineffective before. So there is just all over this stuff about adequacy of the warning, which does suggest that this is sort of within the four corners of Mensing.",
  "Well, how can that be, Mr. Frederick, because the plaintiff really spent a large portion of their case trying to show this, that the warning was inadequate. So the plaintiff must have thought that there was a possibility that if the warning was adequate, the jury would find one thing, but if the warning was not adequate, liability would follow.",
  "There is no such thing then as a brand name manufacturer can change some design features of the drug -- you know, without FDA approval or without going back to square one of the FDA, there's nothing like that?",
  "Mr. Horwich, could you say a little bit more about the reporting to Congress provision because that presumably does not happen at the very beginning, but happens more at the end or in the middle. So do -- does the Department subtract the number of untimely petitions from the number that it reports?",
  "All actions filed, using \"filed\" in the normal sense.",
  "Mr. Horwich, before you go to the consequences argument, just to keep on with the text a little bit, is this understanding that you have of what it means to be filed, does it have any consequences other than with respect to attorneys' fees, or is that the only thing that -- that depends on viewing the word \"filed\" in this way?",
  "Do you think it would be within the discretion of the court or Special Master to look at a case and say, for whatever strange reason, this is a case where it's going to require some lengthy mini-trial in order to figure out fees and that's a bad use of everybody's time, so I'm not going to grant attorneys' fees here? In other words -- you know, this is a \"may\" provision; would it be a sufficient reason that this is just going to take too long, it's too involved, so I'm going to deny attorneys' fees in this case?",
  "Mr. Fishman, this may be a hard question for you to answer, but is your sense of why it is that petitions are untimely filed that they usually have to do with things like -- you know, snowstorms and lawyer error, or that they usually have to do with questions about the manifestation of symptoms? Or something else, if something else is -- just the range of cases out there, what are we talking about? Why are these cases untimely filed?",
  "Mr. McConnell, I'm sorry. Could I -- along the lines of what Justice Ginsburg was saying, suppose that the Hornes had given over all the raisins, right, but that they thought that this was improper, that this marketing order was -- it was a violation of the takings clause. Could they have gone to the Court of Claims, via the Tucker Act, and said, we want our money back? They gave -- they gave over the raisins, they say we're entitled to compensation. Could they have gone through the Court of Claims?",
  "In other words, the Hornes did what the marketing order suggested they should do. They gave over the raisins. But they said this is just improper. You're saying they could go to the Court of Claims?",
  "Okay. So if -- if that's the case, I guess then the question is, why didn't they have to go that route?",
  "Right.",
  "That's true --",
  "I think that's true, Mr. McConnell, as to part of the fine, that part of the fine falls under Apfel, but not the other part. As to the compensation part, it seems to me you have a pretty decent Apfel argument. But as to the penalty part, I don't really understand how the Apfel argument would go. It seems to me that as to the penalty part, the key thing is that if they had handed over the raisins, they could have gone to the Court of Federal Claims and had the compensation done there. And the fact that the government is penalizing them for not complying with the marketing order does not fall within the rationale of Apfel.",
  "Mr. Palmore, before you do that then, have you conceded the point that this is not jurisdictional?",
  "But Mr. Palmore, if you are conceding now that this is not jurisdictional, it seems to me that your Tucker Act argument as a substantive argument, I mean, has been waived. You didn't raise that argument until the rehearing petition.",
  "Well, why is that a necessary part of Apfel? Why didn't Apfel just mean when we are dealing with cash you don't have to go to the Court of Claims? So even if -- you know, you can have a discussion in the district court about whether it's not dollar-for-dollar and it should be discounted in some way. But why should the fact that its dollar-for-dollar mean -- why is that a requirement, as opposed to just it's cash and so the question of, like -- you know, handing some -- handing it all over and getting some back, that can be done in the district court rather than making somebody file a separate suit?",
  "Mr. Palmore, what would be wrong -- would anything be wrong -- with a -- with a disposition of this Court that went something like this: Everybody agrees that this is not a jurisdictional issue, including the government, so they got that wrong. Now, as to this whole business about the Tucker Act and whether the Tucker Act provides a remedy, the government only started talking about that in a petition for rehearing en banc, and the government can't do that. You know, it can't introduce an argument like this in a petition for rehearing en banc. So that's waived. And now, the Ninth Circuit can go and try to figure out whether this marketing order is a taking or it's just the world's most outdated law.",
  "Suppose, Mr. Shaughnessy, that the New Hampshire laws were more onerous than they are. Suppose they said to a towing company, once you've towed this car you have to hold on to it forever. Or suppose they said to the towing company, you have to hire private investigators to go figure out who owns this car. Would any of those be preempted?",
  "Mr. Yelin, I gave Mr. Shaughnessy a couple of hypotheticals about very onerous regulations involving storage after the towing that might very conceivably have an effect on the tower, drive up the tower's prices, conceivably even drive the tower out of the market. So how do we draw the line as between this and those kinds of things?",
  "But it's a process that allows you in certain circumstances to sell the car and to take the money. And what Justice Ginsburg is suggesting is -- you know, you have to take the bitter with the sweet.",
  "Mr. Waxman, could I just ask you what you think the standard is under 10(a)(4) because my understanding of the standard was that a court had to find that an arbitrator was exceeding his powers, was acting outside the scope of his authority --",
  "And that we have said quite a number of times that the fact that the arbitrator committed an error and even a serious error is not enough, that he had to be doing something that was simply outside the scope of his authority. Do you agree with that or disagree with that? And if you disagree with that, what's your standard for what we should be thinking about in -- under 10(a)(4).",
  "And you don't disagree, do you, that this arbitrator -- if you read his opinion, you might think it's terribly wrong, but that what he's doing is trying to construe a contract.",
  "Yes, but he is going -- but he's looking at the words, that he's trying to figure out what the parties agreed on when there's no explicit statement about what the parties agreed on.",
  "So now you're saying that he exceeded his authority because he didn't apply a kind of clear statement presumption. But I don't think that we've ever suggested that there is such a clear statement presumption. In Stolt-Nielsen, we said that if the parties have stipulated that they haven't agreed on anything, then we're not going to accept class arbitration. But we've not said that in the process of construing an agreement there is a clear statement rule. Now, maybe we should have said that, but -- you know, it's -- it's no place in our case law now.",
  "Am I wrong?",
  "Mr. Weinberger, can I just understand what you're saying, and maybe do it through a hypothetical.",
  "Suppose you had a -- a lawsuit and the generic sends the brand name manufacturer an e-mail and the e-mail says, we have this lawsuit, I think I have about a 50 percent chance of winning. If I win, I take your -- your monopoly profits down from 100 million to $10 million. Wouldn't it be a good thing if you just gave me 25 million? Alright? And then the brand name sends an e-mail back, says -- you know, that seems like a pretty good idea, so I'll give you 25 million. Now, as I understand it, your argument is, I mean, that's just fine. That's hunky dory.",
  "Is that fine?",
  "Even though -- but what does that mean in good faith? It's clear what's going on here is that they're splitting monopoly profits and the person who's going to be injured are all the consumers out there.",
  "Well, Mr. Weinberger, I think if we give you the rule that you're suggesting we give you, that is going to be the outcome because this is going to be the incentive of both the generic and the brand name manufacturer in every single case is to split monopoly profits in this way to the detriment of all consumers.",
  "Well, I don't think that that's true, Mr. Weinberger, and it's because of something that Justice Scalia suggested, that there's a kind of glitch in Hatch-Waxman. And the glitch is that the 180 days goes to the first filer. And once the 180-day first filer is bought off, nobody else has the incentive to do this.",
  "But the -- the huge percentage of the profits is done in the exclusivity period. I mean, it's true that it can go on for a long time, but you're making dribs and drabs of money for a long time. Where you're really making your money is in the 180 days.",
  "But it's just an economic --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Could I just make sure I understand the way the 180-day period worked? The first filer gets it, if I buy off -- if I'm a brand name manufacturer and I buy off the first filer with one of these reverse payments, you're suggesting that that's not going to do me much good because they're all going to be -- there's going to be a long line. And that long line of people, it's not just that they don't get the 180-day period, it's like even if one of those people wins, the person whom I've paid off is going to get the 180-day exclusivity period, isn't that right?",
  "But if it's not waived by the parties, in other words, it's not just like I don't get it so my incentives go down. It's that my competitor gets it. So why in the world am I standing in line to -- to challenge this if my competitor is going to get the exclusive period?",
  "And what's your understanding of why there would not be a long line in some cases or in many cases?",
  "And is there anything to show what I think Justice Kennedy asked -- you know, how much of one's profits comes from the 180-day period as opposed to what happens after that?",
  "Could the State --",
  "-- could -- could the State assign to any citizen the rights to defend a judgment of this kind?",
  "Well, I just -- if you would on the hypothetical: Could a State just assign to anybody the ability to do this?",
  "Mr. Cooper, could I just understand your argument. As -- in reading the briefs, it seems as though your principal argument is that same-sex and opposite -- sex couples are not similarly situated because opposite-sex couples can procreate, same-sex couples cannot, and the State's principal interest in marriage is in regulating procreation. Is that basically correct?",
  "Is -- is there -- so you have sort of a reason for not including same-sex couples. Is there any reason that you have for excluding them? In other words, you're saying, well, if we allow same-sex couples to marry, it doesn't serve the State's interest. But do you go further and say that it harms any State interest?",
  "Well, could you explain that a little bit to me, just because I did not pick this up in your briefs. What harm you see happening and when and how and -- what -- what harm to the institution of marriage or to opposite-sex couples, how does this cause and effect work?",
  "Well, suppose a State said -- Mr. Cooper, suppose a State said because we think that the focus of marriage really should be on procreation, we are not going to give marriage licenses anymore to any couple where both people are over the age of 55. Would that be constitutional?",
  "Because that's the same State interest, I would think, you know. If you are over the age of 55, you don't help us serve the government's interest in regulating procreation through marriage. So why is that different?",
  "No, really, because if a couple -- I can just assure you, if both the woman and the man are over the age of 55, there are not a lot of children coming out of that marriage.",
  "Well, I just asked about age. I didn't ask about anything else. That's not an -- we ask about people's age all the time.",
  "A couple where both people are over the age of 55 --",
  "A couple where both people are over the age of 55.",
  "But, Ms. Jackson, I mean, to go back to Justice Kennedy's point, we have injury here in the most classic, most concrete sense. There's $300,000 that's going to come out of the government's treasury if this decision is upheld, and it won't if it isn't. Now, the government is willing to pay that $300,000, would be happy to pay that $300,000. But whether the government is happy or sad to pay that $300,000, the government is still paying the $300,000, which in the usual set of circumstances is the classic Article III injury. Why isn't it here?",
  "But don't we often separate those two things, ask whether there's injury for Article III purposes and causation and redressability, as you say, but then say, well, sometimes when all of those are met, there's not going to be adequate presentation of the arguments, and so we will appoint an amicus or we'll restructure things? And we do that when the government confesses error often. I mean, we do that several times a year in this courtroom.",
  "Mr. Srinivasan, Chadha says what you said it said about what it means to be aggrieved -­",
  "-- but Chadha also left open the Article III question. Why did Chadha leave it open if it's the same thing?",
  "How about a couple of cases sort of in the middle of the Chief Justice's and this one? So let's say that the Attorney General decides that a particular application of a statute is unconstitutional and decides to give up on that application. Or even let's say the Attorney General decides that the application of the statute might be unconstitutional, so decides to interpret the statute narrowly in order to avoid that application. Could Congress then come in?",
  "Mr. Clement, for the most part and historically, the only uniformity that the Federal government has pursued is that it's uniformly recognized the marriages that are recognized by the State. So this was a real difference in the uniformity that the Federal government was pursuing. And it suggests that maybe something -- maybe Congress had something different in mind than uniformity. So we have a whole series of cases which suggest the following -- which suggest that when Congress targets a group that is not everybody's favorite group in the world, that we look at those cases with some -- even if they're not suspect -- with some rigor to say, do we really think that Congress was doing this for uniformity reasons, or do we think that Congress's judgment was infected by dislike, by fear, by animus, and so forth? I guess the question that this statute raises, this statute that does something that's really never been done before, is whether that sends up a pretty good red flag that that's what was going on.",
  "Well, is what happened in 1996 -- and I'm going to quote from the House Report here -- is that \"Congress decided to reflect an honor of collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality.\" Is that what happened in 1996?",
  "Yes, but General, surely the question of what the Federal interests are and whether those Federal interests should take account of the historic State prerogatives in this area is relevant to the equal protection inquiry?",
  "Well, on that, what's the most minor thing that the government could do that would still count as a Rule 11(c)(1) violation?",
  "That the judge could do. I'm sorry.",
  "Well, Mr. Yablon, have we ever said that about the violation of a rule of criminal procedure, that it's structural error no matter what the circumstances?",
  "You worked for her, too, I think.",
  "I would think, Mr. Yablon, that one of the effects of doing what you are asking us to do is that the rule will just get narrower and narrower. In other words, if automatic reversal is always the effect of finding a violation -- and I think you acknowledge this in a way -- that people will just find fewer and fewer violations. And I'm wondering why we should do something like that rather than interpret the rule as it was meant to be interpreted, but then say, you know, somebody can look and say it really just didn't matter that it was violated in this case.",
  "But that seems a bit odd, don't you think, Mr. Yablon? You know, you're saying, well, there are core violations as opposed to noncore violations. I mean, presumably, that's part of what the Court would think about when it was doing prejudice analysis.",
  "Mr. Yablon, do you know of any case where there is one of these core violations, these exhortation cases, where the Court did not find prejudice?",
  "Mr. Feigin, can I ask you the same question that I asked Mr. Yablon, do you know of any cases where in these -- where there are really core violations, where a judge exhorts the defendant to plea it -- does the Court ever find that non-prejudicial?",
  "Mr. Hansen, could you tell me what you think the incentives are for a company to do what Myriad did? If you assume that it takes a lot of work and takes a lot of investment to identify this gene, but the gene is not changed in composition, and what you just said is that discovering uses for that gene would not be patentable, even if those new -- even if those uses are new, what does Myriad get out of this deal? Why shouldn't we worry that Myriad or companies like it will just say, well, you know, we're not going to do this work anymore?",
  "I thought you were going to --",
  "I thought you were going to say something else, Mr. Hansen, and I guess I -- I hoped you were going to say something else, which is that, notwithstanding that you can't get a patent on this gene, that -- that there are still, you know, various things that you could get a patent on that would make this kind of investment worthwhile, in the usual case. But if that's the case, I want to know what those things are rather than you're just saying, you know, we're supposed to leave it to scientists who want Nobel Prizes. And I agree that there are those scientists, but there are also, you know, companies that do investments in these kinds of things that you hope won't just shut them down.",
  "Mr. Hansen -- Mr. Hansen just said that to do recombinant technology, you have to use the cDNA rather than the native D -- the isolated DNA. Do you disagree with that?",
  "General Verrilli, could I understand what you said because I think it might be a little bit different from Mr. Hansen and I just want to understand your position. You said that a company can't get a -- a patent on the thing, but can get it on the uses. So if I find this plant, let's say, in the Amazon and I can't get a patent on the thing itself, but can I get a patent when I discover that if you eat this plant it has therapeutic effects?",
  "Mr. Castanias, go back to Justice Alito's plant in the Amazon, right because it takes a lot of ingenuity and a lot of effort to actually find that plant, just as it takes a lot of effort and a lot of ingenuity to figure out where to snip on -- on the genetic material. But are you -- are you saying that you could patent that plant because it takes a lot of effort and a lot of ingenuity to find it?",
  "Well, but can you patent the thing itself?",
  "Even though you know you have to extract the plant itself --",
  "-- from the Amazon forest.",
  "I'm not -- I mean, I don't know what manipulation means. I mean, you have to take the plant and uproot it, all right?",
  "And carry it away and isolate it. Can you now patent the thing itself? You've now taken it out of the Amazon forest. Can you now patent it?",
  "Well, the plant in the forest can't be used for any purpose either. It only has a use when it's taken out -- you know, when it's uprooted and taken out of the forest. But it's still the same thing. And I guess what you haven't gotten me to understand is how this is different than that. It's still the same thing, but now that you've isolated it, it in fact has lots of great uses.",
  "Mr. Castanias, could I take you away from the deference point and just ask again about the -- the kind of law that you would have us make. Do you think that the first person who isolated chromosomes could have gotten a patent on that?",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "But the first person --",
  "I'm sorry, because -- because, like Justice Breyer, I consider uses -- patents on uses in a different category. So I'm just asking, could you patent the isolated chromosome?",
  "Yes. Chromosomes are very useful.",
  "The first person who found a chromosome and isolated it, I think we can all say that that was a very useful discovery. And the question is, can you then -- can the person who found that chromosome and isolated it from the body, could they have gone to the PTO?",
  "And the PTO seems very patent happy, so could, you know, would -- would they have had a good patentability argument?",
  "Yes, of course it does.",
  "Would -- would -- okay.",
  "And that's interesting --",
  "-- because then it's not a question about, you know, breaking these covalent bonds or whatever Judge Lourie thought it was about. Right? So you know, if -- if not DNA, if -- if not the -- the more smaller unit in the chromosome, you know, we could just go up from there and talk about all kinds of parts of the human body, couldn't we? Couldn't we get to, you know, the first person who found a liver?",
  "Castle's didn't say that, Mr. Lerman. What if the Court is just saying, we want to keep unsafe trucks off the road, but we're not prohibiting you for past violations that you've cured. All we're doing is keeping unsafe trucks out of our port.",
  "But why does that -- why does it have to be truck by truck rather than operator by operator? Why can't the port say, you know, when we found a couple of trucks that this company uses that are unsafe, we're just going to keep the company off our premises until the company can show us that they've cured all their trucks, that they are a safe operator now.",
  "Mr. Bash, what would you think of this case if the criminal penalties were taken out of it? In other words, if the Port did this all through contract, basically said to each terminal operator, look, if you contract with truckers that don't have this concession agreement, we are going to charge you a higher price. So -- so if the criminal penalties were not in the case, is there enough here to still make this the force and effect of law?",
  "Mr. Rosenthal, could I interrupt you for a second and just make sure I understand what your policy is? Who do you exclude from the Port? What trucks -- what trucks or what trucking companies do you exclude?",
  "And -- and not just the noncompliant trucks, but the entire operator for having some noncompliant trucks, is that correct?",
  "Well, if you're saying there isn't that experience, I mean, could -- are you in a position actually to represent that you would not exclude anything except noncompliant trucks?",
  "But, Ms. Blatt, if he's a parent, why wouldn't some provision in 1912 give him some rights? In other words, what's the point of making him a parent under that definitional section if he doesn't get any of the protections that 1912 provides for when to terminate rights?",
  "But what's the point of labeling a parent if he gets no parental rights under the statute and if the termination provisions don't apply to him?",
  "But what is he supposed to --",
  "Well, how are they significant? I mean, I'm trying to understand this because if you get notice, but then you have nothing to say in the proceeding because the statute gives you no rights and the statute doesn't provide any standards for terminating those rights --",
  "-- what are you supposed to do once you get notice?",
  "I think you're not answering the question of what's the point of labeling him a parent if he gets none of the protections that the Act provides to a parent?",
  "Ms. Blatt, continuing on the assumption that this man is a parent under the statutory definition, what your argument seems to be suggesting is that there are really two classes of parents under the statute, right, that everybody is labeled a parent, but then there are the parents who get the protections of -- of the termination of rights provision and the parents who don't. And I'm just wondering why if this statute creates two classes of parents it didn't say that in a more upfront kind of way?",
  "It seems a strange thing to read into a statute in this sort of backhanded way that there are really two kinds of parents.",
  "Well, how does (f) apply? It says \"continued custody.\" That seems to assume that custody exists.",
  "So your argument is not that \"continued\" means something different from the normal language, your argument is that \"custody\" means something different from its normal language.",
  "You might just have to pick --",
  "Mr. Kneedler, let's say you're right that this man is a parent under the terms of the Act, so not just a biological father, but also he has a legal status as parent under this Act. And then 1912 says, well, this is how you go about terminating parental rights, right? But then your argument suggests that one of these clauses applies to him and the other one doesn't, even though he's a parent. But you're saying he only gets some of the protections, that there are really two classes of parents, custodial parents and non. So where does that come from?",
  "But as a Federal overlay, Mr. Kneedler, I mean, does it make sense to sort of split apart (d) and (f) in this way? Because (d) is the curing provision that says you have to take steps to try to cure this parent and, you know, to try to make him or her a better parent. And then (f) says here's the standard for terminating parental rights if those curative efforts have failed. Right? So to -- to use -- to have the curative provision but not the standard just seems to -- to make a -- a mess of the statute.",
  "Isn't the -- isn't the point, Mr. Fisher --",
  "The question is: What is it insufficient for? In Berghuis, it was insufficient for the purpose of cutting off police questions.",
  "That's not the case here. The question here is whether it's sufficient or insufficient for the purpose of allowing his -- his silence to be used against him at trial.",
  "That's an entirely different question, isn't it?",
  "Mr. Curry -- I'm sorry. Just to nail that down because your first three words were \"absent an invocation.\"",
  "Are you -- are you, now, adopting the Solicitor General's argument? Because your brief goes further. So are you, now, saying that the crucial thing is the invocation?",
  "And so you would agree with the government that, if he had invoked, that the Fifth Amendment right would come into play?",
  "But, Mr. Curry, in a case like Berghuis, which is in a custodial setting, if the defendant there had not ever said anything, had gone through the entire interview and, really, never said a word, so that the police kept asking him questions, but he never said anything, the prosecutors could then not go in and say, look, for 3 hours, we asked him questions, and he didn't talk. That would be off limits. And the question is, if that's off limits, why shouldn't this be off limits as well? If there's no invocation necessary there, for some of the reasons that Justice Ginsburg was saying, why should there be an invocation requirement here?",
  "Yes. I -- I understand that, in your case, there happens to be a kind of selective answering sort of question, but let's say -- let's take that out of the picture, all right? And just say -- you know, he just didn't want to answer questions, all right? So then the question is, why would that case be any different from the case that I posited?",
  "He -- he didn't invoke. He just didn't answer.",
  "Okay. So you're pinning your argument really, on the fact that he did a lot of answering.",
  "On this -- on this, you know, you can't pick and choose kind of argument.",
  "So would it be fair to say that your argument is, look, you can't just like keep talking and talking and talking and -- and, at that point, you have to invoke? If -- if you've been doing a lot of talking and then decide you want to stay silent, at that point, you have to invoke. But that's not to say that you have to invoke in every noncustodial encounter. Is that your argument?",
  "You took the words out of my mouth.",
  "Mr. Curry, Berghuis is different for a different reason. Berghuis is different because the question in Berghuis is what do you have to do to make the police go away. Here, the police were not going away. There was no -- there's no question of that. The -- the question is what do you have to do in order to bar the prosecutor from introducing your silence at trial. So that's a really different question, isn't it?",
  "Exactly. That's why Berghuis is irrelevant here because Berghuis said at a certain point -- you know, you need to invoke in order to stop questioning. But -- but that's not what's at issue here.",
  "Ms. Anders --",
  "I'm sorry. We don't require invocation at trial, and we don't require invocation in a custodial setting. And you might think, well, custodial, that's very different because, after all, custodial is inherently coercive, but that's the whole point of Miranda warnings, is that, once we give Miranda warnings, that coercion is dispelled and the custodial setting, essentially, becomes like a noncustodial setting. So, if we don't require invocation, even after Miranda warnings are given in a custodial setting, why should we require invocation here?",
  "Yes, but then --",
  "-- you're given the warnings, and then that's gone.",
  "What -- what does that mean? Does he just -- how about if he just says, you know, I don't really want to answer that question?",
  "Well, Ms. Anders, suppose -- you know, he thinks that the interview is going to be one thing, and then it turns out that the interview was something else. He realizes, it dawns on him, that the police really do see him as a suspect. And he says to himself, I better stop answering, right? So he says, okay -- he's answered a bunch of questions already, but -- but, now, he's -- you know, I don't want to answer any more questions. Is that an invocation?",
  "Or, if he says, I don't want to answer questions about a particular topic; is that an invocation?",
  "That doesn't sound like a clear rule. I mean -- you know, as -- as between -- you know, I don't want to answer those questions on a particular topic, I don't want to answer that question, or just like could we go on to a different question or -- or I don't know. Why is that different?",
  "Mr. Dreeben --",
  "Mr. Dreeben, it would help me in answering some of these questions if you went through the analysis on the assumption that this was instead a Commerce Clause case. So take the military out of it, what would the necessary and proper analysis look like?",
  "How about if he is on supervised release? He is not in the military, but his entire sentence has not been completed.",
  "I guess, Ms. Fuentes, what I don't quite understand about the argument, this goes back to Justice Alito's original question. You seem to say that if this -- if Congress passed a civil statute like this one within the time that Mr. Kebodeaux was in custody or within the time that he was under supervised release, that that would be appropriate. But I guess what I don't get is why the Federal interests change, whether it's the day before he gets out of supervised release or the day after he gets out of supervised release. What in the Federal interests shift based on that?",
  "Well, I wasn't assuming that he was in the military while he was on supervised release.",
  "I was assuming that he was out of the military in both these cases, but that you said while he was still serving his sentence, it would be appropriate for Congress to add this additional thing, but not after.",
  "In both cases, he's not in the military anymore.",
  "I -- I guess what I'm not understanding, Ms. Fuentes, is -- I understand the difference between a requirement of registration and a penalty for failing to register, but it's a little bit cutting -- slicing the baloney thin. And if you think that he was in any event while he was undergoing his sentence subject to a penalty, it's a pretty minor exercise of Federal power, isn't it, to say that, instead of making you just subject to a penalty for doing something, we're going to tell you, you have to do it?",
  "But I guess the question, Mr. Johnson, is whether we just got it wrong there. Because if you look at this statute, it seems -- you know, if you were just doing it as a matter of first impression, that what Congress wanted was a clear and uniform rule to allow it to pay benefits quickly and easily without any discussion or investigation of a person's true intent. But that after that, why does Congress have an interest any further? And if a State has a law that says, really, we think the better measure of intent is something else, then we should let the State go ahead with their law.",
  "And what does that mean exactly? What would Oklahoma do to evaluate that application and to compare it to other applications from Oklahomans, and also maybe to compare it -- maybe there is more than one Texas application. How does the Oklahoma board make those decisions?",
  "I'm really asking you to tell me what the Oklahoma board is going to do. I mean, why doesn't the Oklahoma board just say, you know, sorry, we like Oklahomans? Would that be all right?",
  "What -- what -- what different kind of priorities do they have to use, and why do they have to use them, as I think -- somewhere along the lines of what the Chief Justice was asking?",
  "Ms. O'Connell, isn't that a reason why we shouldn't accept your basic view? I mean, if -- if you think of all the issues that you laid out that are going to have to be decided and the difficulty of those issues -- I mean, you read this brief that you submitted, it gives you kind of a headache. That -- that -- you know, and it -- it suggests how difficult the process is. And then you look at this provision, and maybe this provision can be read as an entitlement, but it can just as easily, as -- as Justice Breyer suggested, be read as a cap, \"no more than 25 percent.\" So as between those two possible readings, the complexity of your way of reading this, which would have -- why?",
  "And what does that mean? What would Oklahoma do?",
  "Well, people keep on saying that, and I -- I guess I just still don't understand quite what it means.",
  "I mean, let's say Oklahoma, the board is sitting there and it gets lots of applications from Oklahoma users. And let's say it also gets multiple applications from Texas users. That it's not just one county, it's four counties. What does Oklahoma do to -- to decide who gets the water?",
  "Ms. Blatt, the solicitor general here today spoke of lots of different examples where the language of entitlement and rights was used. Do you have a view as -- as to that?",
  "Mr. Clement --",
  "Mr. Clement, just along the same lines. What you're saying is that it still would not be extortion -- let's say somebody in your client's position runs an investment company, wants an investment, wants the fees that come along with that investment. Goes to -- let's say that there's a single person who gets to decide whether to make that investment, and so to pay those fees, goes to that person, threatens that person with something terrible happening to him. You're saying that that does not count as extortion, that there's a reason that the Government didn't charge it like that?",
  "Well, they want the investment with -- and the fees that come with the investment. So -- and that's why they're threatening the person.",
  "Even -- even though they wouldn't have gotten the investment and they wouldn't have gotten the fees absent the -- the threat of force or -- or violence?",
  "But if you think the commitment is real cash, is a real contract, real cash, real property, right? Then it wouldn't matter under that -- under what you just said, that the threat was made to the general counsel rather than to the final person who issued the money, isn't that right?",
  "Right. But you wouldn't say, well, we're dealing with an organization, so it's only extortion if you threaten the person who writes the check?",
  "If you threaten the person who makes a recommendation to the person who writes the check, that's good enough.",
  "Ms. Harrington, just to go back to Justice Kennedy's -- I mean, suppose -- was there a reason why it wasn't charged in what seems to me to be the simpler way, which is a threat was made in order to get an investment and in order to get fees to put in your pocket and -- and go away with, and that's extortion. So why wasn't it -- why wasn't that the theory of the case?",
  "Do you think there's an obstacle to charging a case that way? Mr. Clement seems to think that there's an obstacle, that even though there's property in that case, there's some other problem with charging the case that way.",
  "Ms. Harrington, go back to the Scheidler example because that was a case where we said there was not extortion when there were threats of violence meant to close down an abortion clinic's operations. What you are suggesting is that if those threats of violence had been targeted at the abortion clinic's lawyer in order to get him to tell the clinic to shut down their operations because they were a violation of law, that it would be an entirely different case. Now, how could that be?",
  "So -- so you think if -- if they targeted the -- the clinic's lawyer or the -- if the threats were, Don't shut down the clinic, instead, start delivering babies, that that would be extortion, whereas in the real case it wasn't?",
  "Well, because there wasn't -- and there's nothing obtained either way. I mean, you are trying to change what the person is doing, but you are not getting anything from it.",
  "Well, yes, he would have ended up with something intangible in those hypotheticals. He would have ended up with the mowed lawn. He would have ended up with the thing that the service was providing them.",
  "The -- the problem here is that there is no obtaining of anything that the person is getting in your theory.",
  "Ms. Harrington, I guess I'm just confused, and this goes back again to Justice Kennedy's initial question, why it wasn't charged in a much simpler way where the property is not a right by a lawyer to do his job, which seems no other person can get, but where the property was the contract, was the -- was the investment and the fees, and the theory was that a threat was used in order to get that investment and fees. And why wasn't -- why isn't that just -- you know, I look at the facts here and I say extortion, but not on your theory, on my theory. And why wasn't that simple theory used?",
  "But you don't think that there's any reason why it, in a future case, it couldn't be charged just the way I said it?",
  "Well, I guess the question, Mr. Joseffer, is, is there any other discrimination statute in which one can say that there's a different standard for proving retaliation than there is for proving substantive discrimination? Because, as I sort of survey the universe, it seems as though whatever the standard is, the standard is the same for both, and there's no statute in which the two have been divorced. Am I wrong about that?",
  "I'll try again. Is there any other statute in which we have a different standard of causation for a retaliation claim than we do for a substantive discrimination claim?",
  "Well, is there -- I mean, it's but-for everywhere. Is there even any time at which whatever the standard that applied -- you know, pre-Gross, is there ever a moment and is there ever a statute in the history of antidiscrimination laws, where there has been a divorce -- a different standard for retaliation than for substantive discrimination?",
  "All I'm saying is -- you know, Gross was a couple of years ago. It said but-for covers the -- the ADA and outside Title VII -- you know, we've had a lot of discrimination statutes since 1964. We've had a lot of different standards applying to those discrimination statutes since 1964. And you're coming in here and asking for the first time, in all of those many decades, that we should divorce the retaliation claim from the substantive discrimination claim and make them follow two different standards; is that correct?",
  "Well, Mr. Joseffer, I mean, Title VII is written before any of these cases come along. So Title VII is written, and it says we have an anti -- a substantive antidiscrimination provision, and we have a retaliation provision. And then the Court starts issuing cases. And it says, by the way, you actually don't need both. One will do the job for you because one includes the other. And that's in Sullivan, and that's in Jackson, and that's in Gomez-Perez, and I'm sure I am missing a few. Three, four, five times, the Court says this. And so then, in 1991, Congress comes back, and it says, we want to make some amendments, what do we have to do? Do we have to amend both the anti -- the substantive provision and the retaliation provision? Well, no, we have been told five times that, as long as we say one, it means both. And so that's what Congress does in 1991.",
  "Well, but, Mr. Joseffer, in CBOCS, we said that, because of Sullivan, alone -- just because of Sullivan, there was no need for Congress to exclude explicit language about retaliation. In other words, we -- we said Sullivan made the point clear. Now, Justice Alito was right. After that, it goes on. We have done it many more times after 1991. But we have said that Sullivan, itself, made the point clear that you did not need explicit language about retaliation.",
  "I mean, here's what you're -- this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question -- but here's what you're asking us to accept, Mr. Joseffer: Congress comes along, in 1991, in a world in which there has -- there have never been separate standards for retaliation and substantive discrimination. Congress is trying to codify and make even stronger the Price Waterhouse decision, right? They -- you know, they say, basically, we like Price Waterhouse, but it's kind of confused, and the court was kind of fractured, we're going to really put it into place legislatively. They do that, they follow the -- essentially, the drafting manuals that we have given them in Sullivan. And you're saying, well, no. What they really meant was that retaliation would have a different standard, and, indeed, that the retaliation would have the standard that the dissenting justices suggested in Price Waterhouse, notwithstanding that what Congress was clearly intending to do was codify the -- the plurality-plus position.",
  "Well, Gross is talking about outside of Title VII. And -- and whatever might be said of Gross outside of Title VII, here, where Congress is specifically trying to make Title VII conform with Price Waterhouse, with the backdrop of our legislative drafting instructions and with the backdrop of never distinguishing between retaliation and anti-discrimination -- you know, how do you get to where you want to be? This would be, like -- talk about elephants in mouse holes or talk about -- you know, we can take up all our cliches, the dog that didn't bark -- you know, Congress doesn't do things like this without saying something.",
  "Well --",
  "Please.",
  "You -- you suggested, General, that the -- the fact that this is statutory makes your position easier.",
  "And I wonder if that's true. I mean, you could see an -- an argument the exact other way, which suggests that we all understand that common law changes and evolves over time, but that it's rare for a court to reverse a decision on what a statute means and that that's not foreseeable in the same way. So -- now, especially if it were a single court, saying the statute means A today, and then, tomorrow, it comes back, and it says, no, it means B, whether that isn't actually -- whether that wouldn't cut against your position.",
  "Well, General, I guess I wonder whether it's relevant what the statute really says, as opposed to what courts said it says. I mean, sometimes, judges make errors, and our law is dotted with places where courts have made errors and said that things mean what they don't mean or don't mean what they do mean, and -- you know, we expect people to follow what the court says is the law, even if there's really a better reading out there. And, also, we think that people should rely on what the court says is the law, even though there's really a better reading out there. And so -- you know, what does it matter if we come out and said -- and say -- you know, what were these crazy Michigan courts doing? If that's what they were doing, it seems as though people had a right to rely on that.",
  "Was there anyone prior to 2001 who couldn't raise a defense like this, who was precluded from doing so because a court thought, oh -- you know, the -- the statute really clears the field, and -- and this defense is not available? Was it -- can you point to anything?",
  "Well, I guess they can point to just a lot of people who were raising this defense.",
  "This is -- I'm sorry.",
  "Do you have something like in the middle?",
  "And, if you were a prosecutor, you would not have objected to that defense, would you have?",
  "Do you have any --",
  "-- have any reason to think that any prosecutor ever objected to such a defense?",
  "Just to go back to Justice Breyer's question -- I mean, there may be no way you can answer this, but are we talking about -- you know, do five people a year -- did five people a year raise this or -- or 20 or 100? I mean, what kind of numbers?",
  "Right.",
  "You can't really tell because nobody was objecting to anything --",
  "-- right?",
  "Well, suppose you say you're going to pay off the loan by selling some stock holdings, eventually.",
  "Suppose two people reach a prenuptial agreement, and as part of the prenuptial agreement, they agree that, in a year, one party to the marriage is going to sell as many shares of Google stock and buy a home with it. Is that covered by the securities laws now?",
  "Well, how is it removed from that? Because it has the same structural features, which is it's a misrepresentation about what you're going to do with securities, but, in fact, does not affect any securities trading. What it affects is a decision to do something else, here, to buy CDs or, in my example, to go get married.",
  "In all of our cases, there's been something to say when somebody can ask the question, how has this affected a potential purchaser or seller in the market for the relevant securities? And here, there's nothing to say.",
  "Somebody, not necessarily the victim of the fraud, but somebody has to have had some transaction in the market. It's the kind of misrepresentation that would affect someone in making transactions in the covered market. How would this do that?",
  "So, Ms. Goldenberg, suppose I think that the correct test is something along the lines of what Justice Breyer just said, is ­­ is this the kind of representation that could affect somebody’s ­­ It doesn't have to be the victim of the fraud, it can be somebody else, but that could affect somebody's decision to buy or sell or hold covered securities. Can you satisfy that test?",
  "Could ­­ could you go back to the Madoff case ­­",
  "­­ because you portrayed it as investors joining into funds that directly held stock, and I thought that it was more complicated than that.",
  "Could ­­ could I go back, Mr. Scodro, to the ­­ to the rationale of ­­ of the ­­ that ­­ that you're relying on. I mean, you keep on saying, \"part and parcel.\" But how is it part and parcel? That seems to allay the distinction between a right and a remedy. There's one question whether there has been a violation of law.",
  "There's another question whether a cause of action exists to remedy that violation. Why aren't those two separate inquiries?",
  "Well, I guess I'm asking you to explain it to me ­­",
  "­­ because that footnote is about a sentence long. So what's the theory as to why these are part and parcel of each other?",
  "Well, that seems a different argument, not that the two really are intertwined with each other, but it ­­ that it just might make sense to consider the one at the outset, even though, in fact, it's a separate inquiry.",
  "For some ­­ for ­­ please.",
  "But I think the point here is that Mr. Levin is covered not by the ADEA, but by a separate statute, the GERA. And there's a separate question whether the GERA would displace constitutional relief, which apparently has ­­ has never been argued to anybody in this case.",
  "Well, there are some similarities ­­ many similarities, between the ADEA and the GERA, but there are also real differences. I mean, they're obvious ­­ they obviously cover different people; there are different procedural prerequisites for the suit; you get a different kind of review, you only get administrative review under the GERA. So it's a separate inquiry as to whether this statute that has some commonalities, but some differences, displaces constitutional claims, and it's an inquiry that really has never been addressed in this case.",
  "Do you also agree that he is covered by GERA?",
  "Well, it was never discussed because you never raised it; isn't that right?",
  "Mr. Theobald, are there any cases out there in the universe of cases in which a person does not have an ADEA claim or a GERA claim, but has ­­ has pressed a successful constitutional claim based on age discrimination?",
  "I guess the question is what are the circumstances in which, given the very low standard ­­ or given ­­ given the very low rational basis standard, what are the circumstances in which you would have a viable constitutional claim, but not a statutory claim? What would that case look like?",
  "Well, not if there's no jurisdiction, right? If they didn't have jurisdiction, the thing would be wiped out.",
  "Mr. Scodro, you are in a situation where the question is not whether the remedial scheme displaces a 1983 suit brought for a violation of the same statute that contains the remedial scheme. Instead, you have to argue that this remedial scheme displaces a preexisting statutory or constitutional right. And when we've had that situation in the past, we've looked to more than just the remedial scheme itself. You know, Smith looks to the language of the statute, which refers to constitutional claims. It looks to legislative history. It looks to the coincidence between the statute ­­ the new statutory claim and the old constitutional claim. And it seems to me that you don't have any of those things. All you have is a complicated remedial scheme, which would be enough to say, look, you can't bring 1983 suits to vindicate this statute. But seems as though it's not enough under our case law to repeal preexisting rights and remedies.",
  "In just thinking about that Michigan Court of Appeals decision, there is one sort of troubling line in it to me. It says, \"When a defendant proclaims his innocence, it is not objectively unreasonable to recommend that the defendant refrain from pleading guilty no matter how good the deal may appear.\" And one way to read this is it's a kind of categorical rule, which says that, when the defendant says he is innocent, basically your obligations to properly advise him about a plea, go away. Now, I understand you not to read it that way.",
  "So could you tell me a little bit about what you think of that question and why you read the sentence the way you read the sentence?",
  "But we're in a position now, aren't we, where the State court can do exactly that, can say the circumstances have changed and ­­ and so leave everything undisturbed.",
  "Do you know whether the Michigan Court of Appeals was ever presented with this argument that, in fact, he gave the advice that he did because of the peculiar fee arrangement that he had?",
  "And Mr. Toca is now, remind",
  "Forever?",
  "Well, let's say this one, Ms. Murphy ­­ let's say this one, you have 100 PACs, and each of them say that they're going to support the five contest ­­ the five candidates in the most contested Senate races. There are really only five very contested Senate races, and 100 PACs say that they're going to support those five candidates. So a donor gives $5,000 to each of those 100 PACs, which support those candidates, the PAC divides up the money, $1,000 goes to each candidate. The total ­­ all those PACs, $100,000 goes to each of the ­­ of the Senate candidates in the five most contested races, 20 times what the individual contribution limits allow.",
  "This candidate knows all of his $100,000 donors. There are not all that many of them. He can keep them all in his head in a mental Rolodex.",
  "Five of the most contested Senate races. So a person gives $100,000 to each of five candidates who, if they win, become the five senators that are most attuned to donors. And he knows who's given him $100,000, each of those five senators who gets in on the strength of these contributions that are 20 times what the individual limits allow.",
  "I'm sorry. You ­­",
  "Ms. Murphy, if you think it's earmarking to have a PAC that gives money to the five most ­­ the candidates in the five most contested Senate races, I just don't think any FEC would say that that's earmarking.",
  "Ms. Murphy, can I give you another one? There are 150 House candidates with completely safe seats, all right? And there are maybe ­­ you know, 30 or 40 or something like that in their party who don't have safe seats. So the 150 get together, and they say, we're going to run a joint fundraiser, and anybody can contribute $2,600 to each of these candidates, 150 of them, right? So that makes about $400,000. And then these 150 candidates with completely safe seats just transfer all this money to the one person who doesn't have a safe seat, so that's about $400,000. Double it for a primary and a general election, that's about $800,000 that all goes to one candidate from one donor because of the ability for candidates to transfer money to each other.",
  "A candidate can transfer a maximum of $2,600 to another candidate per election.",
  "I stand corrected on the basis of $600.",
  "You're exactly right. You're exactly right, Ms. Murphy. One person could make an $800,000 contribution to a House race, where $800,000 goes a long way. And then what these 150 candidates can do is they can do it for every single other candidate in a contested seat. So take your 30 or 40 House contested seats, and it becomes a conduit for a single person to make an $800,000 contribution to a candidate in a contested district.",
  "Mr. Burchfield, if you take off the aggregate limits, people will be allowed, if you put together the national committees and all the State committees and all the candidates in the House and the Senate, it comes to over $3.5 million. So I can write checks totaling $3.5 million to the Republican Party committees and all its candidates or to the Democratic Party committees and all its committees, even before I start writing checks to independent PACs. Now, having written a check to ­­ for 3.5 or so million dollars to a single party's candidates, are you suggesting that that party and the members of that party are not going to owe me anything, that I won't get any special treatment? Because I thought that that was exactly what we said in McConnell, that, when we talked about soft money restrictions, we understood that you give $3.5 million, you get a very, very special place at the table. So this is effectively to ­­ to reintroduce the soft money scheme of McConnell, isn't it?",
  "But the money ­­ but the money goes to a single party. And indeed, I could make this even worse. I could say, let's say the Speaker of the House or the Majority Leader of the House solicits this money from particular people, so solicits somebody to ante up his $3.6 million. And then ­­ you know, Justice Kennedy said in McConnell the making of a solicited gift is a quid both to the recipient of the money and to the one who solicits the payment. So the Speaker, the Majority Leader, can solicit $3.6 million to all the party members, and you're telling me there's just no special influence that goes along with that?",
  "And, General, I suppose that, if this Court is having second thoughts about its rulings that independent expenditures are not corrupting, we could change that part of the law.",
  "Would it be a fair way to look at this to say that what you do at the partnership level is anything that doesn't require looking at an individual's tax return?",
  "Mr. Garre, it seems as though you and the government agree on sort of the nature of this problem, right, which is you have a partnership item, which is the sham determination. That leads to an adjustment in outside basis which, as you just said, is not a partnership item, is instead an affected item; and that leads to a penalty, right? So there's kind of three things, two steps in the process. And you say, well, that's not enough, essentially, because the penalty has to directly relate to a partnership item. And they say it is enough because it's okay if it indirectly relates to the partnership item. And I guess the question is, in some sense, you're both adding adjectives to the statute. You add directly, they add indirectly. How do we pick between those?",
  "And in that sense, Mr. Garre, it strikes me as wrong to say the words in dispute are \"partnership item.\" Actually, everybody agrees what \"partnership item\" means, what it includes, and what it doesn't include. It doesn't include outside basis. The government is perfectly happy to concede that. It seems as though the words in dispute are what does \"relate to\" mean and does \"relate to\" have to be \"relate to\" in this very direct way that excludes this intermediate step of adjusting outside basis.",
  "But I think that ­­",
  "Well, that was the prototypical case, Mr. Garre. There's no question that that's the central case that ­­ that Congress had in mind, but it doesn't have to be the only case. And they wrote words that seem to be applicable to this case, as well as to the kind of case that you're talking about.",
  "I'm sorry. You're saying they have text, and you have a bunch of other things.",
  "Mr. Hastings, Section 1391 says the following, \"Except as otherwise provided by law\" ­­ not by contract ­­ \"by law, this section shall govern\" ­­ shall govern ­­ \"the venue of all\" ­­ \"all civil actions brought in district courts of the United States.\" And then it goes on to specify certain rules for where venue in a case can lie. So if I'm looking at that, I'm thinking, well, those rules apply. And they can't be reversed or countermanded or whatever by ­­ by contract, by parties' agreement, except to the extent that the contract can figure centrally into the 1404 analysis. But it's not appropriate in the 1406 analysis because ­­ you know, the statute says what the statute says. Here is venue.",
  "Mr. Hastings, I wonder what you think of this analogy. Any party can waive a personal jurisdiction defense, but would you say that parties by contract can create personal jurisdiction in a court in which it otherwise doesn't exist?",
  "Well, as I said, anybody can waive it. Just like anybody can waive almost everything in our ­­ in ­­ in the way the Federal rules work. But do you think that parties can actually create personal jurisdiction where it doesn't exist by law?",
  "Mr. Hastings, has 12(b)(6) ever been used to your knowledge to deal with a case in which the question is which court the plaintiff should have brought the suit in, rather than whether the plaintiff has a viable claim in any court?",
  "Because it seems to me a bit of a category error. The 12(b)(6) is something ­­ it's an on­the­merits determination about the viability of your claim. It has res judicata effect, whereas this is not. This is just a question of, did you bring the thing in the right place and you should be allowed to bring it someplace else.",
  "No, I know the courts have been. I'm saying, except for this kind of case, has a court ever used 12(b)(6) to deal with a case of which court?",
  "Or to deal with anything that's not an on­the­merits determination that precludes a case in any court?",
  "But, Mr. Allensworth, where you agreed not to bring it.",
  "So I'm going back to what Justice Breyer says. Let's suppose you're right about 1404, and I think you have some pretty good arguments. 1404, it seems to me, shouldn't affect this case in the sense that you should have ­­ this was a negotiated contract. You got something for the fact that you accepted inconvenience when you brought a suit. And under 1404, the court is perfectly entitled ­­ the court has to take that into account, that this was a negotiated contract, that you accepted in convenience, and that you got something for your ­­ for your acceptance of inconvenience. The end. You have to live with your contract.",
  "Well, it does in this way.",
  "It does in this way. 1404, as Justice Ginsburg said, is a codification of forum non conveniens law, which is a balancing of private and public interests. It seems to me what Justice Alito said was absolutely right. You have given up the ability to claim private interests here by virtue of your choice to sign that contract. The only thing that could weigh in the balance against that is if there is some ­­ something that has nothing to do with your convenience, but is instead a feature of ­­ of ­­ something about why it's important to the judicial system, to the public interest, about keeping the trial in one place. And as Justice Alito suggested, you have not been able to point to anything, nor would there be anything to point to, in most cases involving forum selection clauses.",
  "No. Bremen is an admiralty case. Why won't it just be a forum non conveniens?",
  "Yes. I mean, 1404, it says that if it's says ­­ if the contract clause specifies a Federal court, it's a 1404 motion. If it specifies a State court, it's a forum non conveniens motion.",
  "Well, it's not 1406. It's just forum non conveniens, which is ­­",
  "Professor Sachs says that, in the case of any disputed facts on a 12(b)(6), you would have to have a trial. Do you agree with that?",
  "I think you mistook my point at least. Maybe I didn't express it clearly. Bremen comes up on a forum non conveniens motion, and the Court So ­­ you know, the fact that it comes up on a forum non conveniens motion has nothing to do with the question of whether the contract controls where, people have negotiated for a certain set of things and there is no exceptional public interest otherwise.",
  "Can I ask you one last question about 12(b)(6)?",
  "Which is ­­ you know, when 1404 is ­­ suppose a State which does not recognize these clauses, 1404 trumps that according to Stewart. But if you were under 12(b)(6), you would have to go to what Justice Scalia does in the Stewart dissent. I think you would have to go to a twin aims of Erie analysis. And in that circumstance, it seems to me that the State law would come out the victor; isn't that right?",
  "Mr. Dupree ­­ I'm sorry. Please.",
  "And, Mr. Dupree, even if you waived that point, if I understand it correctly, you did not waive the point that, even with all attribution in the world, there still is no general jurisdiction over Daimler. In other words, you could attribute all MBUSA's contacts, and you still would not have general jurisdiction over Daimler; is that right?",
  "So in that sense, it really doesn't depend on the attribution standard, all these hard questions of is it an alter ego test or is it an agency test and how does the Constitution relate to State law because we could apply any test we wanted and there still wouldn't be general jurisdiction over Daimler in California.",
  "Mr. Dupree ­­",
  "Mr. Kneedler, what do you think about this, that ­­ you know, as I've been looking through these cases, it seems to me that all these attribution issues and the conflict about attribution arises because courts generally have an improperly broad understanding of general jurisdiction and don't quite understand the distinction between general and specific jurisdiction. If the courts ­­ if the court here had understood that general jurisdiction applies when a company is essentially at home in a place, would any of these questions have arisen?",
  "But, of course, that just points out the difference between specific and general jurisdiction, that Daimler might be ­­ might be found ­­ found it ­­ there's jurisdiction over Daimler in a case which involves the blowing up of a car in California, but not over something that's not related to any of its contacts in California.",
  "Yes, but, Mr. Russell, it's usually ­­ it doesn't lead to good results when you assume something that is obviously in error ­­ you know, it leads you to go onto a road that you wouldn't otherwise have gone onto and get to a destination that might be improper itself. So it's ­­ it's bad practice ­­ and I understand your ­­ you know, idea about they didn't argue this, they didn't argue that. But to assume something that's, obviously, a fallacy as your basis for a decision is not likely to lead you to a good outcome.",
  "But, Mr. Russell, they did talk about Daimler wasn't subject to general jurisdiction. They didn't contest MS ­­ MBUSA's being subject to general jurisdiction, but they said Daimler isn't subject to general jurisdiction. So, you know, they didn't make the precise argument that they should have made, but they basically put the question at issue, is Daimler subject to general jurisdiction? Answer, no. Daimler is a German corporation. If it were subject to ­­ subject to general jurisdiction in California, so, too, it would be subject to general jurisdiction in every State in the United States, and all of that has got to be wrong.",
  "Mr. Russell, how would you make the argument ­­ and, again, with Justice Alito, sort of putting these waiver questions aside for a second, German corporation, incorporated in Germany, headquartered in Germany, 2.4 percent of its sales are in California. How do you argue that it's subject to jurisdiction, general jurisdiction, not specific jurisdiction, general jurisdiction, which means over suits that have nothing to do with California or, indeed, as here, over in the United States, have nothing to do with anything that happened in the United States, how do you make the argument that Daimler is subject to general jurisdiction?",
  "It's 2.4 percent of its sales. That would make it subject to general jurisdiction every place.",
  "If it is subject to general jurisdiction in California, is it subject to general jurisdiction in all 49 other States?",
  "So everybody is subject to general jurisdiction in, like, California and New York and Florida because they are big markets, but no worries about ­­ you know, Delaware?",
  "That's a bad example. Rhode Island.",
  "Mr. Wessler, this just I think follows up on Justice Kennedy's question, but have you identified any cases in which this serves to prevent somebody from bringing a suit?",
  "But it seems as though those courts have been pretty liberal in saying, whenever it is necessary, no, take a little bit more time. So, this you know, it seems just a little bit like a solution in search of a problem.",
  "What evidence do you have that any bad incentives ­­ you know, any bad effects are actually flowing from this? There's actually a big leeway in this statute, because it's 3 years. The administrative review process only takes about a year. Even if this is a ­­ it's a complicated case where there's some tolling, you know, maybe it gets you up to another year, you still have a year. I mean, what ­­ how would people behave badly or behave in ways that you think would disrupt the statutory scheme, if we just let everything stay as it is?",
  "I guess one question is, if you think that you do have authority and you think that the majority rule has been creating problems, why the Department of Labor hasn't done that?",
  "Ms. Carroll, what would you think if the State here just amended its statutes tomorrow and said not 3 years but 18 months? So for everybody, it's an 18­month period. It doesn't give people very long after the 12 or 13 months of the administrative review process is over. What should a court do then? Should a court strike the entire statute?",
  "Yes. Should the court say, that's unreasonable, that goes too far?",
  "I'm sorry. You know what? Take it out of the statute context. Just say that the contract said 18 months rather ­­ so ­­ so that's really what I meant. What is ­­ what's a court to do with a contract that says that?",
  "Well, but in 18 months. I mean and so 18 ­­ the administrative review process takes about 12 months in most cases.",
  "Is 18 months enough?",
  "Well but, what's the rule of law ­­ what's the rule of law that allows us to get rid of a contract provision that's set at 14 months or 15 months or 16 months and to leave this one?",
  "I was thinking that I would like to ­­ like, 14 months would just seem unreasonable to me.",
  "Ms. Carroll, please tell me if I'm wrong. But even if a contract does not have an exhaustion requirement, courts have required exhaustion.",
  "And courts have required it even though the statute doesn't say so.",
  "It's an extra­textual requirement the courts have made up, irrespective of what the contract provides.",
  "I think what Justice Breyer was suggesting, that maybe, given that we have this sort of judge­made rule of exhaustion, that the courts just did a sort of a half job of it, that they also should have put the statute of limitations that makes that exhaustion requirement work, and that ensures that it doesn't produce unfair, bad outcomes.",
  "The Congress was dealing ­­ you know, Congress passed ERISA before this exhaustion requirement came into play. So it's a little bit hard to read into anything, to read Congress's silence in the normal way here because Congress didn't think that there was going to be this exhaustion requirement ­­",
  "­­ and the courts put it on later.",
  "Can I ask what the prospects of success at a hearing like this are? You know, there's an amicus brief which lists 25 cases in the Second Circuit, in which this kind of hearing was held. My clerk went back and found that, in 24 of those cases, the motion was denied, and in the 25th, the motion was granted, but then reversed on appeal. So, then ­­ you know, it's not surprising really. I mean, probable cause, it's a pretty low bar. So what are we going through all this rigamarole for, for the prospect of ­­ you know, coming out the same way in the end?",
  "Ms. Saharsky ­­",
  "I'm wondering whether you way over read the cases that you rely on because in all of those cases what we were talking about was an examination that had specifically requested by the defendant. Now, here, that's not the case. The defendant has asked for something and has opened the door, conceivably. But the examination that we're talking about is one that the State has compelled and that the defendant does not wish to undergo. That's a big difference between this case and all the ones you rely on.",
  "Not to belabor this, but the ­­ the holding of the case is that the prosecution may rebut this presentation with evidence from the reports of the examination that the defendant's requested.",
  "I mean ­­ I guess the question is that you say it's a factual difference; it might be a factual difference between compulsion and lack of compulsion.",
  "So is that a waiver theory? Because Justice Scalia's opinion was not based on a waiver theory. But my understanding of your brief was that you were arguing about waiver, is that right? That the ­­ the defendant here has waived the ability to say that he's being compelled?",
  "Well, but if that's policy, why isn't the ­­ the cross­examination analogy policy as well? I mean, they are both based on some notion of what is parity and what's reciprocity and what's ­­ you know, what's appropriate to ask the defendant to bear once the defendant decides to become a witness in a proceeding. So they are both the same kind of policy. You want to call it that, but it's ­­ it's ­­ one is no more policy than the other.",
  "Mr. Katyal, could I go back to the cross­examination analogy? Because you say your case is different, but I think you'll have to explain that one to me. It seems to me that the cross­examination cases say you can't become a witness halfway. Once you've decided to become a witness, you have to subject yourself to all the things that every other witness is subjected to. And it seems to me that you haven't convinced me that the same point isn't true here, that the person, Mr. Cheever, has decided to become a witness, essentially, by giving an interview to his own expert and allowing his own expert to speak about what Mr. Cheever has told him. And so ­­ you know, he can't do it halfway. Now, the government has to get its shot. Same way.",
  "But ­­",
  "But I thought that your distinction was, well, there are two sets of clothes ­­ to use a better word. There are two sets of clothes, and they both look like clothes, but one is for protective ­­ a protective function, and one is for a sanitary function. And that's the distinction that you want to draw. And I guess another way of saying Justice Ginsburg's question is: Why should we look at a word that just says, \"clothes,\" and make that distinction as to what the purpose of changing clothing is, whether it's for sanitary reasons or whether it's for protective reasons or whether it's because people want the doormen to look nice?",
  "Well, when would it matter? Could you give a few examples of when it would make a difference, the ­­ the difference between your test and the government's test?",
  "Well, like what, that's not de minimis?",
  "I guess it just seems that, in most of these cases, everybody is just going to say it takes two seconds to put on a pair of eyeglasses. So I guess I'm ­­ I'm struggling with why you and the government are fighting so hard about the proper test.",
  "So, then, what does separate you from Mr. DiNardo? Now, you're sounding exactly the same.",
  "Like what?",
  "Mr. Schnapper ­­ I'm sorry.",
  "Do you happen to know why the government hasn't issued a regulation on this? It seems the quintessential question of statutory interpretation to which we would normally defer to the agency. Why hasn't ­­ this is really a question to Mr. Yang, but do you just happen to know, given the history of all this and all this ­­ these guidance documents, why they've never just like come to everybody's aid and issued a regulation?",
  "Well, what does it mean ­­ what does it mean, in the context of an intentional tort, which is what we're talking about here, to aim at a particular State, if it doesn't mean to aim at a person who you know to be within that State? I mean, nobody conducts an intentional tort intending to injure California, per se. You're intending to injure a person who resides in California. So what would it actually mean to aim conduct at a State, irrespective of a person?",
  "Well, suppose ­­ suppose ­­ and I'm sorry. Please.",
  "Yes. I mean, I guess I just ­­ the ­­ the McIntyre example is a very different kind of example because, in those cases, you really are talking about a company seeking to serve a general market in a State. But intentional tort cases don't usually have that quality. You're going after a particular person in an intentional tort case. And it's odd to think of going after an intentional ­­ a particular person, whether it's a defamation suit or it's a fraud suit or ­­ or what have you, as ­­ as targeting the State itself.",
  "Well, would you ­­ would your answer be different ­­ suppose that the ­­ the officer had said, you can keep ­­ you can keep your money, go on to Nevada with it. And then, once Fiore ­­ the Fiores had reached Nevada, the officer said ­­ the officer filed a false affidavit, which, let's say, froze the Fiores' bank accounts. Would your ­­ would your answer be different? The affidavit was filed in Georgia, but the money was not seized in Georgia; instead, the money has gone on to Nevada. Is there personal jurisdiction in Nevada?",
  "Well, he did it by filing an affidavit in Georgia, and then it froze a bank account.",
  "But imagine a case where everybody agreed that the initial seizure was lawful, so that that wasn't part of the complaint at all, and the only complaint was that a false affidavit had been filed, so that, after making the preliminary investigation, the officer hadn't transferred the money, but had, instead, kept it.",
  "Ms. Sherry, just to try to figure out how far your argument goes, suppose there's an IRS agent sitting in Washington, D.C., and she maliciously does something, files an affidavit, does whatever she does, to impose a tax penalty on somebody in Nevada, and everything that she does happens in Washington, D.C. Does the person in Nevada, who is the victim of this malicious attempt to impose a tax penalty, have to go to Washington, D.C., to sue her?",
  "Well, she's a very mobile person. She lives in Nevada, but she goes other places, and ­­ and this could ­­ you know, harm her wherever she goes. Isn't that what you said? So why should she be able to bring suit in Nevada, under your view?",
  "Well, if it were about them ­­",
  "So ­­ so suppose they seized a gold watch ­­",
  "­­ and then they refused to return the gold watch.",
  "But the gold watch really is still sitting there in Georgia.",
  "Okay? Would you say that ­­ that then there's ­­ there's personal jurisdiction in Nevada?",
  "Yeah, they seize it, and then there's a false affidavit keeping it.",
  "And the complaint is only about the false affidavit, but it's in reference to property that is indisputably in Georgia.",
  "But, Mr. Goldstein, as I understood what Mr. Bucholtz was saying, he was saying there is a distinction between an officer who commits a fraud in Georgia, when your money is in Nevada, and so he commits a fraud and he freezes your bank accounts in Nevada, versus he commits a fraud by filing this affidavit. But it is as to money that is located where he is, not where you are, but where he is in Georgia. That's the distinction that I understood him to be drawing.",
  "What do you think about that?",
  "I'm sorry. So there'd be a difference if the bag had been shipped to Washington, D.C.? And ­­ you know, money is ­­ is fungible. Money is everywhere and nowhere. So it ­­ it seems as though money is a bit different from a gold watch, that ­­ that it was ­­ it's only contingent that the money remained in Atlanta, rather than being shipped to a bank someplace else.",
  "Mr. Waxman, as I understand it, the agreement in this case identified certain patents and contemplated that there would be disputes about whether particular products of Medtronic violated or infringed or practiced, whatever, those patents. But there might be some other kinds of agreements which, instead, identify certain products ­­",
  "­­ and essentially treat those as infringing products in the absence of a license. In that sort of agreement, would you make the same kind of claim, that if Medtronic had that agreement that identified certain products, but Medtronic woke up one day and said, you know what, we don't think that those products infringe, we essentially want to relitigate our agreement, can Medtronic come to court and do that via a declaratory judgment action? And if so, who would bear the burden of proof?",
  "Well, they can be an infringer, Mr. Neustadt, if ­­",
  "They can be an infringer if they say, we're ignoring our agreement, we're not paying royalties, but we're going to go on and continue making the product. Then MVF would say they would be infringing. And that's the world that MedImmune imagines is happening. It says ­­",
  "No, I'm finished.",
  "Well, Mr. Neustadt, I think I just disagree with that. You keep on saying it's a question of claim coverage, but the question of claim coverage, all that is, is part of an infringement analysis. And that's the analysis, as Justice Kennedy said, that's the analysis that would have been appropriate if Medtronic had stopped paying royalties and MVF had sued Medtronic as a result for patent infringement. And that's the world that we're supposed to imagine after MedImmune, is if, contra the ­­ the actual agreement, the licensee stopped paying royalties, and we think about an infringement suit.",
  "It's ­­ it's not a patent law exception. It's the recognition that a procedural device that simply changes the nominal status of the parties doesn't change the substantive rules and that the burden of proof counts as a substantive issue.",
  "But Mr. Neustadt, I was under the impression that, according to this contract, if Medtronic stops paying royalties, you can bring not only a contract suit, but, in fact, a patent suit.",
  "An infringement suit.",
  "But you can bring an infringement suit according to the very agreement that you signed.",
  "They are infringing if they break the contract, and they stop paying royalties.",
  "And then you can bring an infringement suit.",
  "But the convention ­­ but the convention tells the State parties, go regulate individual conduct in exactly the way that this convention regulates State parties. And then what the legislation does is, as Justice Ginsburg said, just mirror the convention as the convention contemplated.",
  "Do you think ­­ do you think, Mr. Clement, and this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question, could the ­­ could this treaty have itself regulated individual conduct? Could the treaty have been self­executing?",
  "So where would you find that in the Constitution? Because there's clearly a treaty power that does not have subject matter limitations. And, indeed, if you go back to the founding history, it's very clear that they thought about all kinds of subject matter limitations, and James Madison and others decided, quite self­consciously, not to impose them. So where would you find that limitation in the Constitution.",
  "But this is an enumerated power. The enumerated power is the treaty power. So you have to find a constraint on the treaty power. Where does it come from?",
  "Mr. Clement, could I make sure I understand your test? Your test is to say that with respect to every prosecution under this ­­ under this treaty, that a court has to ask whether the prosecution has a sufficient nexus to national or international concerns? Is that ­­ is that your test?",
  "Well, I guess I'm still looking for a test, and I thought that the test that I just articulated was really directly out of your briefs. But if it's ­­ if ­­ if you're suggesting that that's not the test, give me the test that we're supposed to ask with respect to this case or any other as to whether the prosecution is unconstitutional.",
  "That sounds like a facial challenge. Now, I thought that you made very careful to talk about that this was an as­applied challenge to this particular prosecution.",
  "So you're saying, if the statute extends to things that we've generally thought of as part of the police power, that's sufficient.",
  "Okay. Nexus ­­ nexus to a national concern, again, is what I understood you to say in your brief. But let me give you a hypothetical, and you tell me whether your test meets it. Let's say it's the same convention, except it relates only to Sarin gas, and ­­ and there's a chemist out there and ­­ you know, the ­­ the implementing legislation mirrors the convention. There's a chemist out there who manufactures Sarin gas ­­ I take it it's pretty easy to manufacture ­­ and sends it through the ducts of a house and kills everybody in it. Does that have a nexus to national concerns?",
  "So ­­ but this is ­­ in my hypothetical ­­ and you didn't run away from it at all; I applaud that. In my hypothetical, it's a completely domestic use ­­ you know, it's just this chemist didn't like his neighbor and used Sarin gas. And you're saying that the difference is, well, what the treaty makers did was define the category of chemicals more broadly. And I guess what I want to know is you are imagining a world in which judges day to day try to get inside the head of treaty makers to think about ­­ you know, in this case, we understand that there's a national interest in regulating Sarin gas, but we don't think that there's a sufficient national interest in regulating some other chemical or some other chemical or so on down the line. It seems to me a completely indeterminate test and one that would have judges take the place of treaty makers, in terms of deciding what is in the national and international interest.",
  "Well, but, Mr. Clement, it's absolutely clear that the treaty was after enforcement as to individuals with respect to all the prohibitions, that the treaty said, go enforce this as to individuals and do it consistent with your constitutional processes. And then Congress passes a law that is consistent with its constitutional processes, and it completely mirrors the treaty.",
  "I guess I'm still trying to figure out why. I mean, Holmes dealt with this in Missouri v. Holland. He says there's a treaty power, it's an enumerated power, there's a Necessary and Proper Clause that functions to ­­ to allow Congress to give effect to that treaty power. It's ­­ you know, this is a ­­ a situation where there's a prohibition on the States in terms of entering into treaties or in terms of sharing that power in any way. And he says ­­ you know, it's just these invisible radiations that you think come from the structure of the Constitution. And he specifically rejected this argument, the same argument that you're making, the penumbras and emanations of the Constitution.",
  "Well, General, could I ask why that is? I mean, because this ­­ this Convention and the implementing legislation is very broad, and it's broad because it applies to a very large category of weapons and it applies to a very large category of uses ­­ of conduct. So what were they thinking about, about why they wanted these very broad categories, why it's not more limited with respect either to the chemicals or to the conduct?",
  "And, General, don't we have an amicus brief from almost all of the legal counsels of the State Department, Republican and Democrat, talking about how, if Petitioner's argument were accepted, it would severely damage the United States' ability to enter into and to negotiate treaties?",
  "Can I just ask you, Mr. Clement, and it's a variant of the hypothetical I gave you before, but it focuses more on your statutory point, the peaceful purposes. Suppose that Ms. Bond used Sarin gas and sent it through the ducts of Haynes' house; would you say that that's a peaceful purpose?",
  "Mr. Simeone?",
  "Could I take you back to ­­ to the agency proceeding? So I guess I understood, from your respective briefs, that you say the agency proceeding was not an enforcement proceeding, and the agency says it was an enforcement proceeding because you might have brought it initially, but you tried to get out, and then the agency compelled you to keep on going in its process. So could you explain that to me.",
  "I think ­­",
  "I guess, Mr. Lynch, the concern is, given that we think agencies are doing things that implicate important State interests most of the time, that's why they do them, that ­­ that your test ­­ and not just your test, but the Eighth Circuit's tests, would turn agency adjudicators into the primary legal decision­makers in our system on all matters that they were ­­ you know, wanted to get into, including matters of Federal law.",
  "That does seem like a big proposition ­­ no? I mean, do you think that Younger says that or that Middlesex says that or that we've ever said that?",
  "Mr. Massey, if you are right about what mass action means in this statute, what is this exception about the general public doing?",
  "If you go on and read that a little bit further, Mr. Curran ­­",
  "­­ it says, \"claims of 100 or more persons that are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs' claims involve common questions of law or fact.\"",

  "But, again, this clearly ­­",
  "But they don't have to show ­­ and this is clearly referring to a kind of Rule 23 inquiry, which they don't have to go through to do a parens patriae.",
  "Yes, but they do have to show that ­­",
  "­­ in a massive ­­",
  "­­ consolidation case ­­",
  "­­ the judge is going to say, you have 100 claims; we want to see that those 100 claims have common questions of law or fact. But in a parens patriae case, the State never has to make that showing. It can just stand up and say, here we are. We are the State. We're representing the interests of the State qua State. Here's our claim.",
  "Well, Mr. Curran, really, do you ­­ are you saying that, as a matter of State law, that, in this suit, the attorney general has to make a proposal that ­­ that the plaintiff ­­ that ­­ that he can bring the suit on the grounds that the plaintiffs' claims involve common questions of law or fact and that that proposal has to be adjudicated by the Court?",
  "But he does not have to show any common questions of law or fact in the typical way that we demand. I mean, that's actually a really demanding showing that we have forced lawyers to make in the class action context. All that the attorney general has to do is to stand up and say, I have a State interest in protecting my citizens and in deterring improper behavior, and here is my substantive right.",
  "I guess I don't understand the bifurcation point. It seems to me that what the attorney general is saying is he has a set of claims. They're his claims on behalf of the ­­ the populace, but ­­ but to further State's own interests. And there ­­ there's none of this Rule 23 kind of business about common questions of law or fact. So it's not a question of ­­ you know, one set of claims or another set of claims, now or later. He has a claim. That's all he has.",
  "And this is the main provision where they're trying to define what mass action means. And I take your point that there are ­­ there's some slippage between this provision and the various provisions that it refers back to because those provisions ­­ we're talking about class actions, and this one is talking about mass actions. But this is the essential definition. And this one seems to be pointing to a very different kind of suit, one in which there are 100 individual claims that ­­ that 100 people seek to have joined in which a court is going to make a determination about whether those 100 individual claims have questions of common law or fact.",
  "That's essentially what it says. I mean, the only ­­ the only thing it doesn't say in what you just said is that it says persons, instead of named plaintiffs. But then, if you read the sentence, it's pretty clear that persons and plaintiffs are the same.",
  "I might not answer it.",
  "But more than that ­­",
  "But more than that, Mr. Curran, is that there was actually a considered effort by the attorneys generals here to take themselves out of this statute ­­",
  "­­ and that that ­­ well, you say they failed, and ­­ I mean, that's the statutory question. But it's not just Congress didn't do it right this time. It was that there was a very serious effort to get attorneys general out of this statute. And that's ­­ and ­­ you know, it seems to me that they did pretty well.",
  "Mr. Hungar, I'm wondering what you would think of the following: suppose that, as we began this session of the Court, the Chief Justice had called a minister up to the front of the courtroom, facing the lawyers, maybe the parties, maybe the spectators. And the minister had asked everyone to stand and to bow their heads in prayer and the minister said the following ­­ he said, we acknowledge the saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross. We draw strength from his resurrection. Blessed are you who has raised up the Lord Jesus. You who will raise us in our turn and put us by his side. The members of the Court who had stood responded amen, made the sign of the cross, and the Chief Justice then called your case. Would that be permissible?",
  "So you are making a distinction just between the legislature and any other official proceeding; is that correct?",
  "Well, suppose I ask the exact same question, same kinds of statements, same sort of context, except it's not in a courtroom. Instead, it's in a congressional hearing room. Maybe it's a confirmation hearing, maybe it's an investigatory hearing of some kind, and that a person is sitting at a table in front of the members of a committee, ready to testify, ready to give his testimony in support of his nomination. The minister says the exact same thing.",
  "Well, I suppose ­­",
  "But Mr. Hungar, for 11 years, the prayers sounded almost exclusively like the ones that I read, and one year, on four occasions, there was some attempts to vary it up, to have a Baha'i minister or a ­­ a Wiccan, but for the most part, not out of any malice or anything like that, but because this is what the people in this community knew and were familiar with and what most of the ministers were, most of the prayers sounded like this?",
  "Mr. Gershengorn, could you respond to this? Here's what our ­­ our country promises, our Constitution promises, It's that, however we worship, we're all equal and full citizens. And I think we can all agree on that. And that means that, when we approach the government, when we petition the government, we do so not as a Christian, not as a Jew, not as a Muslim, not as a nonbeliever, only as an American. And what troubles me about this case is that, here, a citizen is going to a local community board, supposed to be the closest, the most responsive institution of government that exists, and is immediately being asked ­­ being forced to identify whether she believes in the things that most of the people in the room believe in, whether she belongs to the same religious team as most of the people in the room do. And it strikes me that that might be inconsistent with this understanding that, when we relate to our government, we all do so as Americans and not as Jews and not as Christians and not as nonbelievers.",
  "Mr. ­­",
  "Mr. ­­",
  "Mr. Laycock ­­",
  "Mr. Laycock, would you ­­",
  "Mr. Laycock, sort of, all hypotheticals aside, isn't the question mostly here, in most communities, whether the kind of language that I began with, which refers repeatedly to Jesus Christ, which is language that is accepted and admired and incredibly important to the majority members of a community, but is not accepted by a minority, whether that language will be allowed in a public town session like this one. That's really the question, isn't it?",
  "That's the issue that actually arises. Here's what ­­ I don't think that this is an easy question. I think it's hard, because of this: I think it's hard because the Court lays down these rules, and everybody thinks that the Court is being hostile to religion, and people get unhappy and angry and agitated in various kinds of ways. This goes back to what Justice Breyer suggested. Part of what we are trying to do here is to maintain a multi­religious society in a peaceful and harmonious way. And every time the Court gets involved in things like this, it seems to make the problem worse rather than better. What do you think?",
  "Mr. Schnapper, that's the position that the SEC took in its amicus brief to the First Circuit. It said Section 806 applies where employees of the contractor are reporting possible violations of law by the public company for which the contractor is performing work. So it did put a limitation on the kinds that Justice Breyer has suggested. In other words, yes, employees of the contractor, but only when the employees are engaged, you know, only when the violations of law that the employee is reporting relates to the work that the contractor is doing for the publicly held company. Do you think that that's a possible reading of the statute or not?",
  "Ms. Saharsky, if I could take you back to second. \"Contractor of such company,\" you're saying we can read that to impose a limitation, that it's ­­ it's not anything that the contractor does in any capacity for anybody, whether relating to the contract or not. We could instead read it as, you know, \"the contractor\" means the ­­ the entity doing a particular contract for a particular public company; is that correct? Do I get that?",
  "In other words, inherent in the ­­ in the word \"contractor\" or in the phrase \"contractor of such company\" is a sort of status of a company, and that one should not read this statute as applying outside that particular status.",
  "Isn't criminal law ­­ isn't criminal law replete with crimes which have lesser included offenses as part of them? So wouldn't your rule be a very difficult one to apply because it would suggest that the person had to facilitate some part of the crime that was not a part of a lesser included offense?",
  "Well, Mr. Bash, what about this case? Suppose that there are two guys and they are talking about committing a crime, and they have the same kind of conversation that Justice Alito was referencing, you know, one guy says I want to bring a gun, the other says, no, I think that's a really bad idea. But this time, the guy says: Okay, you've convinced me, it's a bad idea to bring a gun, I won't bring a gun. And so then they go out and they rob whatever they are robbing, and in the middle of it, you know ­­ or they do a drug transaction, and in the middle of that drug transaction the guy who said don't bring a gun looks over and he realizes that, notwithstanding the promise, his confederate did bring a gun. But there they are, they are in the middle of their drug transaction. So the guy, you know, they're right ­­ they are handing the money to each other and the guy keeps on doing it, all right? Is ­­ is that enough, even though, you know, there's foreknowledge, there's acts after he ­­ he realizes that the guy has a gun? Is that sufficient?",
  "Well, what exactly would you want him to do at that point to not be convicted of this, of this offense? Would you want him to just say, you know, sort of like drop everything, I'm out of there? Is that the idea?",
  "Right. I mean, I guess that's the question: Is there always a reasonable opportunity to withdraw after you see that there's a gun in the offense that you didn't expect to be there? And do you think that there has to be a reasonable opportunity to withdraw, or would you say, no, everybody has a reasonable opportunity to withdraw all the time; you can just leave?",
  "Mr. Bash, you know, what sticks in my craw a little bit about your position is this: Usually, we want punishments to ­­ two people and they do very different things and they have very different intents, we want them actually to be punished differently. And what you're suggesting is that there is ­­ let's say a crime, two people are involved in it. One person does almost everything. You know, he does 90 percent of the stuff. And the other person does just a little thing, but something, you know, that goes to the offense that helps facilitate the offense. But it's really pretty small compared to the overall crime. And then in addition to that, that person does not have really full­fledged intent, just has a kind of knowledge that this other person with real purpose of intent is going to bring a gun. So ­­ so, you have a lesser act and a lesser intent, and notwithstanding that, you're saying that the person ought to be punished in the exact same way as his confederate.",
  "But I guess what I would have thought was that the actus reus can be very small, but almost to compensate for that, you have to have full­fledged intent. You have to have a really kind of purpose of ­­ a ­­ a purpose that the crime succeed as opposed to just knowledge of ­­ of what will happen.",
  "Mr. Karlin, don't you find that a little bit odd? I mean, this social expectations analysis applied to a case in which a police officer has power that no person, no stranger has. The police officer has just put the man in handcuffs and taken him away. A stranger does not have that power. So it's a bit odd to say: Well, social expectations say that the stranger can walk into the house, you know, having just carted the person away. He can't do that.",
  "You see, I thought that Randolph rejected that analysis. I thought that Randolph said ­­ and you could agree with it or disagree with it ­­ but it said, and I'm quoting here, \"The cooperative occupant's invitation adds nothing to the government's side to counter the force of an objecting individual's claim to security against the government's intrusion into his dwelling place.\" So, when you have an objection, Randolph says, the objection trumps. And the fact that there is a cooperative occupant there, well, again, I'm just quoting, \"It adds nothing.\"",
  "I guess this goes back to my ­­ my other question. I find it impossible to get my head around this case without recognizing that we don't have it here, because the police have taken the objector away. And so the police themselves have, you know, properly exercised a power that is the reason we don't continue to have the situation that Randolph concerned.",
  "You don't disagree, do you, Mr. Karlin ­­ and I don't want to put words in your mouth ­­ but you don't disagree that the expectation of privacy does not decline after the arrest is made. In other words, that Mr. Fernandez's expectation of privacy remains the same.",
  "Mr. Karlin, there is in this case some indication that she was not inviting this search, that she in the end consented, but only after the police suggested that her child could be taken away and, you know, the facts of this case are not I'm standing at the door dying for you to come in.",
  "Mr. Palmore, could I ask what you think that this sentence means in Randolph? There's a ­­ there's a statement that says: \"So long as there is no evidence that the police have removed the potentially objecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of avoiding a possible objection.\" What do you think that means? When do you think it would apply?",
  "So it would only apply if the ­­ if the taking the person away from the home was unreasonable. But as long as that was lawful, whether you did it by saying, you know, come walk around the block with me or whether you actually had probable cause to arrest and you took him to the stationhouse, either way, that this language would not apply.",
  "And has anybody ever found that conduct fit within that language? Has any court ever used that language in any way to state that this, you know, this goes beyond the bounds?",
  "In the typical case, how important is an agreement like this to the union? How much does it increase the likelihood that the union will be selected as the exclusive bargaining representative?",
  "Why is that?",
  "Did you also raise in an earlier stage an argument that he had no private right of action?",
  "That has never been litigated?",
  "Mr. Messenger, do I understand the structure of your argument to be as follows: That whether before certification or afterwards in a collective bargaining agreement along the lines that Justice Scalia said, the only thing that an employer can promise a union or agree to provide to a union are things that are specifically authorized in other parts of the labor law? Is that the structure of your argument?",
  "You see, I would have thought that the premise and the policies of the labor laws are to encourage a wide variety of employer/employee agreements, both things that are listed in the labor laws, that are provided for in the labor laws, but many things that are not; that the idea is to get these parties together to reach agreements on a wide variety of things that matter to them regardless whether the labor law specifically refers to that.",
  "It seems sort of turning the whole thing on its head to say that the only things that are allowed in terms of promises, whether in a collective bargaining agreement or prior to that, are the things that the law itself requires.",
  "So, Mr. Messenger, just to make sure I understand that, you're saying that regardless of whether there was a bargain in this case, forget the bargain. Let's just say that there was an employer. This employer said, you know, I think that my employees should have a right to listen to you and to decide for themselves whether they want to be represented by ­­ by the union, so I'm inviting the union onto my premises. Just simple as that. You're saying that the employer cannot do that.",
  "But we ­­ we don't need this. I mean, you say ­­",
  "­­ of course, this is important to the union, so your argument is that it falls within the statute, regardless of whether there's any consideration or quid pro quo.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "So this is to say that the National Labor Relations Act prohibits employers from providing access to their premises, from granting a union a list of employees, or from declaring itself neutral as to a union election.",
  "Mr. Messenger, suppose that there was a ­­ a union and it was striking. And the union goes to the employer and ­­ and they reach an agreement, and the agreement is the union will stop striking if the employer agrees to sit down and negotiate with the union. So that's the promise that the employer makes to the union. I'm going to sit down and negotiate with you. And that's, obviously, a thing of important value to the union. Is that also prohibited?",
  "There's no thing that's given to the union? I mean, I would think if your argument is thing of value is anything that's of value, there's nothing that's of greater value to the union than an employer's agreement to negotiate.",
  "Well, I guess ­­ I mean, we're going to negotiate about all kinds of things, things ­­ things that unions and employers negotiate about, and that's of great benefit to the union. The union gets to turn around to all its employees and say: Look at this, the employer is going to sit down and talk with us.",
  "Mr. Messenger, would your argument apply to the following? I'm just going to give you a few kinds of different promises. A promise to give a union information about the company and its finances?",
  "But not if not during collective bargaining?",
  "I'm sure it does. An agreement giving the union a role in grievance procedures?",
  "Could you explain that distinction to me, ultimately go to the employee? I mean, I assume that everything that the union does, the union is saying, well, ultimately the benefits go to the employee.",
  "But the union, on the ones that you say, well, the neutrality agreements, the access, that's just to the union, the union can turn around and say: No, ultimately it's to the employee, that we're going to represent the employees well. I mean, so the line you're drawing seems quite inadministrable to me.",
  "Okay, so the thing­­",
  "No, please.",
  "Yes, but my hypothetical is the thing, was the union's role in grievance procedures.",
  "So the union gets it, right?",
  "Well, I guess I'll tell you that a union that can say that it has a role in grievance procedures is, that's an important thing for a union to be able to tell its employees. That's of real value to the union to have that.",
  "How about ­­ how about if a company gives a union a role in company decision­making, any kind, hiring, any other kind of company decision­making? The company says, we want the union to participate in this.",
  "Mr. Messenger, the Excelsior rule, if I understand it correctly, the NLRB says that an employer absolutely has to give a list of employees ­­",
  "­­ to the union seven days after an election is called; is that correct?",
  "Okay, okay. But the union gets it seven days after?",
  "And that's by requirement. So you're suggesting that if the employer gives it six days after, that's not only not required, that's forbidden?",
  "So it goes within a period of 24 hours, something that no employer can do voluntarily to something that has to be done.",
  "I would feel better about that argument, Ms. Anders, if you had at least suggested how we should go about deciding that question.",
  "Because you read this through your brief, and I don't know what a consent­based objection is. In fact, you say consent­based objections can look very, very procedural, and it's still consent­based, or it might not be consent­based. So all the ­­ the techniques that we use in the Howsam­First Options line of cases seem to go out the window and not be replaced with anything else.",
  "Mr. Blackman, can I just ask you to assume for a second that that's not so? If you had ­­ if BG and the Republic of Argentina had, itself, entered into this agreement, would you agree that this is a typical Howsam kind of provision?",
  "Mr. Blackman, could you sort of indulge an assumption for me? And the assumption is that, if this provision were in an agreement between two parties, we would treat it as a Howsam­John Wiley kind of provision; in other words, we would say that this is just a procedural rule. That's the side of the line it falls on. So my question to you is: Why should this be any different? You're treating yourself as though you never made an agreement. But, in fact, you did make an important agreement. You made an agreement with the U.K., the entire point and purpose of which was to allow U.K. citizens to bring certain kinds of disputes before an arbitrator. So once we have a U.K. citizen with the right kind of dispute, it seems to me you're just in the position of any other person who's agreed to this provision. And in ­­ in my assumption, if it's a John Wiley type provision, it should go to an arbitrator.",
  "I know, but I said just assume that for me. And tell me why you are in a position where some other result should go into effect.",
  "Please.",
  "I'm sorry. Could you explain that? Because I thought that the purpose ­­ that the whole point of the C&L Enterprises case is to say that when a tribe agrees to arbitration, it has waived its sovereign immunity for that purpose in that proceeding. Are you saying that there was something special in this agreement?",
  "But I think this is what Justice Kennedy was ­­ was getting at, when he asked you for a case, because what you're saying now is that when the State is the plaintiff ­­",
  "­­ the sovereign immunity of the tribe disappears, so ­­",
  "Okay. So what ­­ I guess what's ­­ what's ­­ what's the case that would suggest that, when the plaintiff shifts, the sovereign immunity is ­­ goes away?",
  "General, if ­­ if I could assume that this is not Indian lands and just ask why you need for sovereign immunity to go away? And ­­ so you have the ability to arrest people. You have the ability to bring Ex Parte Young actions. Presumably, you have the ability on non­Indian lands simply to shut down a casino. Presumably, you have the ability on non­Indian lands to condition any licensing of the casino on whatever you want. I guess the question is: On non­Indian lands, you have a thousand ways to stop a casino that you don't want. Why do you need the abrogation of sovereign immunity?",
  "Well, I think that all of our cases suggest that sovereign immunity is quite important to a sovereign's dignity and that it's not nothing to abrogate sovereign immunity. And so you can say, well ­­ you know, that would be less intrusive than all these other things, bringing Ex Parte Young suits, arresting people, just ­­ you know, conditioning the ­­ a license, stopping the casino from operating. But ­­ you know, I suspect that the sovereign tribe here would say that, no, it's ­­ it's an affront to their sovereignty to take ­­ to strip them of sovereign immunity, and ­­ and none of these other options that you have are that.",
  "Mr. Katyal, isn’t the difference ­­ the State can really ­­ it can shut down these gambling operations easily if it's off Indian lands. What the State can't do is get any kind of damages or money remedies; isn't that really the difference?",
  "Maybe that's an important difference. I mean, maybe we should give the State the ability to collect damages.",
  "Well, there seems something sort of strange about that, General, because as I read Kiowa, what it was, was an invitation to Congress. It was saying ­­ you know, we have some concerns about this, we're not sure it makes sense, we are dropping a very broad hint that Congress should change it. And, 15 years later, Congress has done nothing. And then to come back 15 years later and to say ­­ you know, Congress didn't really accept our hint, so we'll just do it ourselves and make Congress reverse it. Wouldn't you think that that's a strange procedure to use?",
  "Maybe we learned that Congress thought that this did make sense.",
  "But I would have thought, General Bursch, that one of the principles behind Indian law in this country goes something like this: Congress can do pretty much whatever it wants with respect to Indian tribes, but we will not likely assume that Congress means to undermine tribal sovereignty. We will ­­ we will insist that Congress says that before we put it into effect. And, here, it's not just ­­ I mean, Congress has given every indication that it does not wish to change this, notwithstanding our hints that it should.",
  "I guess I don't understand that, Mr. Clement, because I always thought that the way these agreements worked were there were agreements that, if I flew a certain number of miles on your plan, I was going to get a free ticket. And ­­ and it wasn't a gift that I was getting a free ticket, it was because I did something, I flew a certain number of miles, so that there was an exchange with value on both sides.",
  "I don't ­­ I just don't see why that would make sense because, if I knew that it was really up to you to give me the free ticket, maybe I was willing to get it and maybe I wasn't. I don't think that I'd be spending all this time in the air on your planes ­­ you know, I'd find another company that actually gave me the free ticket.",
  "But, usually, what we say when a contract has no consideration, we don't say, oh, we're going to hold you to it anyway because the market will solve it. We say the contract has no consideration, it's illusory, in just the way that Justice Ginsburg pointed out. And the question is: If there's really no obligation on the part of the airline here to give that free ticket, if they can do it when they feel like it and not do it when they don't feel like it, why is there any consideration? Why isn't the contract illusory?",
  "Well, Mr. Clement, suppose that this complaint only had one count. And suppose that they had said, look, we have this contract, and it gives very substantial discretion, it gives ­­ you know, by the words alone, it gives absolute discretion to Northwest. But that can't really be right because contracts have this implied covenant of good faith. There's an implied duty to perform in good faith. And that means that this discretion is narrowed in certain kinds of ways, that they can't terminate my membership for certain kinds of reasons, and that's all the complaint said. There was just this one count. Do you think that would be preempted?",
  "I guess what I'm suggesting is that the implied covenant here, it's just an interpretive tool. It says that there are certain kinds of provisions that are written very broadly or very vaguely, and an implied covenant comes in to help us interpret those kinds of provisions. And, viewed in that way, it's just a contractual device that, in light of Wolens, ought to be permitted.",
  "But, counsel, if it can't be waived, it sure seems as though it is operating independently of the parties' reasonable expectations.",
  "I mean, it might be, right, because people have different expectations in those two different situations and that the at­will employment is so pervasive and so customary and so sweeping that the policy ­­ the rule of an implied covenant of good faith doesn't apply there because we think everybody expects it not to apply there.",
  "That would be weird, isn't it, because in such a State, there might be a contract where the parties reasonably did expect this implicit term that limits something ­­ a very broad conferral of discretion to operate. And, yet, just because this State supreme court has framed its argument in a particular kind of way, they don't get the benefit of that.",
  "Mr. Loy, can I ask you what you think this standing doctrine is all about in a context like this? You said before ­­ you said to give ­­ to effect Congress' intent in passing Section 43. Is that what we're trying to do here?",
  "Well, one of the questions. Why isn't that the only question that we ought to be concerned with in a case like this? Congress creates a right of action, and it seems to me that the normal thing that we ought to do and do do in most contexts is just say, you know, what's the scope of that right of action? And ­­ and certainly we could take into account Congress' purposes in interpreting the scope of that right of action. But that would be the question.",
  "I guess, if that's the question, the AGC test strikes me as not the answer to that question. I mean, we don't usually say what was Congress' intent, how broad did Congress mean for this cause of action to go, and then sort of devise a five­part test with a lot of things that aren't mentioned in the statute.",
  "Mr. ­­ Mr. Loy, you said there's universal recognition that there should be prudential standing requirements in the Lanham Act. When should there be prudential standing requirements in a statutory right of action? In other words, Congress passes lots of statutory rights of action. And let's say that almost never, never does Congress talk about prudential standing one way or the other. Do you think that, every time Congress passes a right of action, the courts are supposed to engage in a kind of free­form inquiry about what kind of prudential standing rule should apply to that particular right of action?",
  "And ­­ and you just sort of know them when you see them, or it's a reaction to what are perceived to be very broad statutes or ­­ you know, when ­­ when do we know that we should be off on a prudential standing jag?",
  "But, there, couldn't that be done just by interpreting the ­­ the language of the statue, in accord with its purposes, because you have a specific purpose provision in the Lanham Act that says, we're ­­ we're trying to get at commercial competition here.",
  "Well, Mr. Jones, is the question that you are asking us to ask just did Congress want this kind of actor to be able to sue? Is that the question that you think we ought to be ­­ be asking?",
  "Well, let's not call the limits anything in particular. The question, in your view, is Congress passes this Act; did Congress ­­ in including this right of action, did Congress want this kind of actor to be able to use that right of action? Is that correct?",
  "But, if that's correct, I mean, rather than talking about whether something is arguably within the zone of interests in the way we have to do, in the APA context, because we are dealing with a lot of statutes that don't provide rights of action there, why shouldn't we just ask, what kinds of actors did the Lanham Act provide a right of action to, as sensibly construed? We should sensibly construe the Lanham Act, in accordance with Congress' purposes.",
  "And, then, what would be the test? What would we say the Lanham Act means?",
  "What I think, Mr. Jones, just a couple of years ago, we made clear that \"arguably\" was to be taken very seriously and ­­ and essentially established a kind of buffer zone, so that if you kind ­­ you know, we weren't going to be too strict about it. And the reason we did that, again, is because the way the APA works is it's on top of a lot of federal statutes that have no rights of action themselves. So there is nothing for us to interpret in those federal statutes. And we say, well, if you arguably come within the scope of that statute, then you are aggrieved for purposes of the APA. But this is a very different situation. This is a situation where we have a particular right of action. And rather than create any kind of buffer zone around it, we should just ask how is it sensible to interpret that right of action?",
  "How do we tell that, Mr. Horwich? What's the test for determining when a place is subject to military command?",
  "But a map, presumably, reflects who owns the property, and you, yourself, say that that's not what's significant. And I took your point in your brief to suggest some kind of more functional test, is this property being used for military purposes? Am I ­­ am I wrong in ascribing that to you?",
  "Do you think, Mr. Horwich, that there is any point at which a military installation can lose its character as such? I mean, I'll give you an example. Suppose ­­ you know, that in this ­­ in this base area, the government ­­ the military decided to allow four private condo buildings and six restaurants and three movie theaters, and it really just turned into a regular old town. And ­­ and it entered into agreements whereby all the policing was being done by local law enforcement officers, rather than by the military. Is there any point at which it just becomes too much not like a military base, where you lose the ability to do this, even though it's under the formal command of a military officer?",
  "So what happens, for example, at ­­ at the school if there's an assault on school premises? Who deals with that?",
  "Federal ­­ I'm sorry. Is that military police or is that ­­",
  "Who ­­ who comes in ­­ is it ­­ is it members of the military? Or is it members of the county police force? Or is it ­­",
  "Well, I guess I'm just wondering with respect to each of these places, I mean, the highway, the school, the Amtrak station, who's actually in control when something goes wrong in these places?",
  "The security forces meaning ­­",
  "­­ the military.",
  "So do military personnel actively patrol this entire area?",
  "But I ­­ I had thought that, in your brief, you thought that the ownership test was both underinclusive and overinclusive.",
  "Well, Mr. Chemerinsky, does that mean ­­",
  "Well, Mr. Chemerinsky, does that mean that the ­­ the government could not have issued this barment order in the first place?",
  "Well, then I'm ­­ I'm perplexed because if the government has sufficient commanding authority to issue the barment order to say, notwithstanding that Mr. Apel had not crossed the green line, that ­­ you know, he just can't be here, and he's excluded, then why don't they have sufficient authority to prevent him from reentering?",
  "I see. So ­­",
  "But you're saying that if he had not crossed the green line, he could not have been excluded?",
  "And you're saying that the military cannot exclude any person from any of this area outside the green line?",
  "Your ­­ your argument is sort of a use it or lose it argument, is that ­­ is that correct? That the government has this commanding authority, unless the government uses it to its full extent every day of the week, it loses it?",
  "One of the arguments that the government makes is, look, what the military wants to do here is something very sensible. It keeps tight what it needs to keep tight, but it allows to be more open areas that can ­­ that it ­­ it doesn't have an interest in securing entirely. And that's for the convenience of military personnel. It's for the convenience of other people who live around the base. What's wrong with that?",
  "May I just ask a background question, Mr. Horwich? What's the history of this First Amendment area? What ­­ when did this speech area come into being?",
  "Was the litigation essentially like this one, basically saying that this was not under military command?",
  "Well, Mr. Feigin, they have that wide scope because of the actual malice standard, that somebody needs to show that there was actual knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard as to falsity. And you're saying that we should do something different. You're saying that we should expand what falsity means in this context as a sort of extra protection, and I guess why is that true?",
  "I guess I'm not sure what you just said because, even the way you just phrased that, you're asking what TSA would have done. How else can we think about materiality, other than by asking, well, if you were a TSA officer and you heard this, what would you have done?",
  "Mr. Russell, weren't you, yourself, suggesting the twist on the materiality standard? You said it shouldn't be ­­ in the usual case, we said would it have had a different effect on the mind of, essentially, the average reader ­­ the reasonable reader. And you say, no, here, we're not supposed to think of the reasonable person, generally; we're supposed to think about the reasonable TSA officer. Haven't you conceded that yourself?",
  "Well, how do we know about the reasonable TSA officer? I mean, you made the point that we don't know a lot about TSA officers, in terms of what they are going to do with respect to any given set of facts, and ­­ you know, I find it a little bit hard to think about the question, what does a reasonable TSA officer think, without thinking about the question, what's a reasonable TSA officer going to do?",
  "So what are the other things TSA could have done? I mean, let's assume that this call was made and it was a much more ­­ in tone, it was much more factual and without using any of these words, but it said the guy really lost his temper and ­­ you know, he has this license, and we have no idea whether he, in fact, is carrying a gun, but he could be? What could the TSA officers have done? What do you think they should have done, short of what they did? Say that they were concerned, they thought this might be a problem? What are the midlevel possibilities about­­ of a response?",
  "Mr. Cohn, what if I think that TSA might have reacted differently to what was actually said and to what really should have been said? Would they have reacted either way, they should have done something either way, but they would have done a different kind of thing? What if I think that? What does that suggest about the proper resolution of this case?",
  "But I think that's not right, Mr. Himmelfarb. I mean, the rationale that they use might have something to do with an underlying merits/nonmerits determination, but the test is just does the statute authorize it or is it authorized by contract?",
  "Well, just focusing on whether that's a bright­line rule or not, in other words, whether it's easy to apply or not, I thought you were suggesting whatever is true about whether it makes any sense or whether it's conceptually justifiable, I thought you were suggesting it wasn't easy to apply. And it does seem to me that once you say contractual provisions will be treated this way, statutory provisions will be treated that way, that's not a hard rule to implement.",
  "But what if they hadn't done it that way? What if they had listed those fees in their complaint, and what if they had argued for them as part of the bench trial? Are you saying something would depend on that?",
  "Well, what about a different kind of standalone case? I mean, suppose that the fund had actually paid up what it was due prior to the litigation, but ­­ but there was still all these outstanding costs that had been incurred for auditors and all of that, and ­­ and a suit was brought just involving those?",
  "Why isn't it true? I mean, assume a contract which just says, if we go to litigation, the prevailing party will pay fees, in much the same way that a statute does. And now, assume lots of contracts basically have that provision as their attorneys' fees provision. Why wouldn't we just say ­­ you know, whether ­­ whether the source of the law is a contract or a statute makes no difference; they are essentially doing the exact same thing?",
  "I guess I'm not quite sure why the word matters. I mean, you can say attorneys' fees are costs under a statute and they're damages under a contract, but why should that control the analysis of what we do? It's just which word we put up on it.",
  "Is the idea, Mr. Stewart, that the States that are required to do more are the States that haven't done much already?",
  "Can I ask a question?",
  "Can I ask a question? Following up on Justice Scalia about the statutory language and how you read it, I think ­­ you know, most people, everybody, thinks that it's better to regulate with attention to costs than to regulate without attention to costs. We have this ­­ our Trucking Association decision, where we said, well, notwithstanding that everybody agrees that regulating with attention to costs is better, when Congress says the opposite, we have to go with the opposite. And, there, we said Congress had said the opposite because it had talked about protecting the public health with an adequate margin of safety. Now, I'm wondering, what does it take in a statute to make us say, look, Congress has demanded that the regulation here occur without any attention to costs? In other words, essentially, Congress has demanded that the regulation has occurred in a fundamentally silly way.",
  "Could you explain that to me, Mr. Stewart? Because are you saying that the straight proportionality approach that was applied in the D.C. Circuit, are you saying that that's impossible? Or are you saying it's complicated and dumb?",
  "I'm sure I should know this after reading all these briefs, but if we ­­ if we reverse the D.C. Circuit, what would happen, going forward? In other words, the States have had this time to ­­ to go first and do their SIPs, then they were found not to comply, so the EPA does its FIP. But that's not the end of the game, is it? I mean, isn't the EPA under a continuing obligation to look at, review its NAAQS, to give the States further opportunities to come back?",
  "Mr. Mitchell, I might just not be understanding you, but this goes back to the Chief Justice's question. The statute says, look, after these standards are originally promulgated, the State gets 3 years to make its best pitch, and then the administrator shall promulgate a FIP at any time within two years after that. Now, presumably, there are lots of conversations that can happen between the EPA and the States during those 5 years, and maybe, sometimes, more of those conversations happen and, sometimes, less of those conversations happen. But I don't see that as different constructions of the statute. It seems to me, as the statute sets up its framework, you go first, do it within 3 years; then the EPA goes, it has to do it within 2 years. The EPA just has very substantial discretion under this statute as to what kinds of conversations it wants to have when, within that broad structure. Why am I not reading it right?",
  "Well, why can't ­­ this is, of course, a statute on which EPA gets substantial Chevron deference. Why couldn't we read that language to essentially mean subject to the same procedural requirements as the original?",
  "Well, it's not a caveat. It's just a different understanding of what that language means. I mean, you say it has to be in the exact same ­­ in the exact same way they previously acted, and I guess I'm saying it could mean subject to the exact same procedural requirements. Was that not clear? Might not have been clear.",
  "Whatever procedural requirements constrained EPA when it approved the SIP, those were the same procedural requirements that constrained EPA when it's disapproved the SIP. But we're just asking, are they ­­ you know, both are ­­ have to be subject to the same procedural requirements. EPA can act differently, as long as they are acting within that same set of rules.",
  "Well, I think that they are trying to make that argument. They are saying, in the initial version, we could have done it by notice and comment rulemaking, or we could have done it if we had good cause, so, too, when we reverse that initial determination.",
  "So, Mr. Keisler, I mean, you have a statute here that clearly does not have any language about no costs allowed, that also does not have what the American Trucking Association statute had, which was like public health only, sufficient margin of safety; right? So none of that. What you have is exactly what you said. You have a statute that focuses on causal contribution, right? So this is a hard problem, right? Because ­­ I mean, let me just sort of give you a numerical example, which I'm sure is as simplistic as the other numerical examples floating around this case. But ­­ you know, let's say that the standard is a hundred. And there's a State that has 120, and there are two States, X and Y, that have each contributed 20. Right. So we ­­ you know, we only need 20 of those. We have 40. And the question is how do you get from those 40 to those 20? The D.C. Circuit would just say, well, we take 10 from each. But if this ­­ if the question is only about causal contribution and that's all that the statute talks about, there have to be other ways we can make that determination of what contribution each should be legally responsible for, right? And what the EPA said here was, we're going to distinguish between ­­ we're going to distinguish between States that have ­­ have put a lot of technology and a lot of money into this already and, on the other hand, States that have lots of cheap and dirty emissions. And why isn't that a perfectly rational thing to do under this very statute?",
  "But, Mr. Keisler, the nature of this problem is that there's an allocation issue. It's not just everybody gets down to a certain threshold level. It's there's a level, and we have to allocate. And the question is, what are we going to allocate on the basis of? And the word \"amounts\" doesn't tell you what you're going to allocate on the basis of. So there are lots of different choices for what we can allocate on the basis of. We can just divide ­­ you know, and do it all proportionally. We can take into account per capita. We can take into account a State's population, if we wanted to. Or we can take into account, as the EPA did here, costs on the understanding that costs reflect how much of an investment a State has already made in pollution technology. So the statute ­­ neither the word \"amount\" nor anything else says anything about those different methods of allocation, does it?",
  "Ms. Goldenberg, before you do that, could I just ask you to respond to a sort of different hypothesis of what Congress was up to here and tell me what, if anything, you think follows from it? Assume you think that Congress actually was not intending this very small category, that Congress was intending for this to be a pretty wide provision, but what Congress was ­­ it was laboring under a misapprehension. I mean, it thought that you could do this kind of automatic conversion with respect to all of these people, and it turns out Congress was just utterly wrong on that. So ­­ but Congress includes this language about automatic conversion. So what do I do if I basically have a hunch that that's what Congress was thinking, but, yet, the language that it adopted talks about automatic conversion, which is impossible for many of this category.",
  "I understand that argument, but that's not the argument that Wang made, is it? Wang suggested that if the ­­ the appropriate date was at the very date of aging out, so ­­ so it seems as though you shouldn't be entitled to Chevron deference on that question, given what Wang said about it.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Please.",
  "In the usual case, a petitioner has to show a bunch of things, right? You have to come in and say, I'm a legal permanent resident, and ­­ you know, I file an affidavit of support and show that you haven't committed any offenses against minors and all of this stuff, right? So ­­ but you're suggesting that we can just ignore all of those requirements that usually have to be shown at the threshold for a petition to be accepted; isn't that right?",
  "Mr. Fleming, to accept that argument, don't you have to accept your understanding of what the appropriate date is? I mean, let's suppose that the government is right, that the date is the one that's actually specified in the statute, which says the date on which an immigrant visa number becomes available. At that date, the parent is not even going to be a legal permanent resident; isn't that right? Kagan. First of all, your answer to Ms. Goldenberg was completely right, which is that is not the approach that the Board of Immigration Appeals took in Wang. The board thought, wrongly, and the government now does not even try to defend it, that the conversion had to happen, if at all, at the date that the ­­ at the moment that the beneficiary aged out. That's what they say. They say, we look to see which category the petition converted to at the moment the beneficiary aged out. That's on Page 35. They tried to defend that in front of ­­",
  "But let's assume that this is the right date, the one that's actually specified in the statute. Can you win if that's the right date?",
  "I know, but can you win if it is the right date?",
  "Based on ­­ another understanding of Chevron is, sometimes, Congress writes confusing statutes that point in two different directions at once, and then there's a choice. Does the Court make the best of it, or does the Agency make the best of it? And the Agency knows a lot about the subject matter, and especially this Agency, and so irrespective of whether Congress meant to delegate something in some very self­conscious way, this is a confusing statute, it's a kind of a muddle. The ­­ the Agency gets to do it.",
  "Ms. Lenz, could I ask you about what you just said? You said Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell; those are the three. So Carter says the Fifth Amendment requires that a criminal trial judge must give a no­adverse­inference jury instruction when requested by a defendant. And that was, of course, not a sentencing case. Then Estelle says, we discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of Respondent's capital murder trial, so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment, so a kind of general view that the Fifth Amendment applies equally in the two. And then Mitchell holds ­­ it basically repeats that from Estelle and says, we must accord the privilege the same protection in the sentencing phase of any criminal case, as that which is due in the trial phase. So when you put those together, Carter with Estelle, Mitchell, how ­­ why do you think that there's a gap?",
  "But take the ­­ take the hypothetical, Ms. Lenz, that suppose ­­ you know, the prosecutor had said you just heard testimony from our expert that ­­ the blood spattering expert, that the victim's suffering was especially prolonged, and look, the defendant didn't take the stand. Why didn't he take the stand to deny that? All right? So could the prosecutor have said that at the sentencing hearing?",
  "So you're suggesting that what we haven't decided, if you will, goes beyond the remorse question of ­­ that we ­­ that we talked about in ­­ not Mitchell, but ­­ is it Mitchell?",
  "It goes beyond the remorse question. And you're saying that really, in the sentencing hearing, the Fifth Amendment has nothing to do with ­­ with anything that happens there essentially, because once ­­ once the person has been found eligible for the death penalty, a prosecutor and a jury can ­­ can draw whatever inferences they want.",
  "Well, where does that difference come from? Because I thought that, every time and in every circumstance that we've prohibited an adverse inference, we've also required a requested jury instruction. I don't know of a ­­ of a case or any principle that would suggest that we can tear those two things apart and say, well, look, an adverse inference is prohibited, but, no, you don't get an instruction.",
  "I guess I'm asking a different question. Do you have any case that suggests that those two things don't go hand and hand? Because my ­­ my sort of reading of our case law is that they do. Any time we've said an adverse inference is prohibited, we've also said the defendant is titled ­­ is entitled to an instruction about adverse inferences if he requests it.",
  "But in not making that distinction, I mean, it does speak very broadly, and it says ­­ you know, I'm reading another quotation from it. \"The rule against negative inferences at a criminal trial apply with equal force at sentencing.\" Now, it does have this exception for remorse or a possible exception for remorse. But with that exception, otherwise, it says the rule against adverse inferences applies, doesn't it?",
  "I think my question was just the breadth of these statements about everything that applies at trial with respect to adverse inferences also applies at the sentencing phase, with the possible exception of adverse inferences about remorse. That's the way I read the cases.",
  "Well, Estelle might not have been overruled, but there's a caveat that Mitchell puts in, and it's a caveat about remorse and that remorse might be different. And the question is why doesn't that caveat suggest, at the very least, that the instruction that you asked for was so broad that it went beyond what this Court has decided because the instruction that you asked for did not distinguish remorse from other issues that were going to come before the jury at the sentencing phase. So at the very least, it seems that instruction sort of blows by the question that we have reserved.",
  "I'm sorry. So how was it an issue at the hearing? Because that would seem to cut against you very strongly, Mr. Komp. If remorse is an issue at the hearing, remorse is the very thing that, in Mitchell, we said we have not decided. And then you have no clearly established law to rely on. And I appreciate that this was before Mitchell, rather than after Mitchell; but it suggests that there was always a question about whether Estelle applied to remorse.",
  "Mr. Komp, did the Sixth Circuit apply the wrong harmlessness standard here? It seemed to a apply the standard that would be applicable on direct review, rather than on habeas review; is that correct?",
  "Because it seems to rely primarily on Carter. And Carter applies the Chapman standard, which is, of course, the direct review standard.",
  "Mr. Regan, Justice Breyer pointed out that all other countries seem to disagree with you. That's obviously a concern of ours when we interpret a treaty, that all other countries interpret it in a ­­ in a single way. Do you contest that? Are there any other countries that apply equitable tolling rules?",
  "Ms. Moskowitz, going back to Justice Alito's question. Could you tell me how you think this works? You said, in response to Justice Alito, that sometimes concealment can be a factor in determining whether a child is settled. And I presume you mean if somebody conceals the child by moving the child from place to place, the child would not be settled. Is it also a factor in determining whether a settled child should nonetheless be returned?",
  "Or under Article 18.",
  "No, but prior to that.",
  "If you could go back to ­­ do you agree with Justice Scalia, that, really, at that point, there's nothing to do? Once the determination has been made that the child is settled, there is no remaining discretion that the judge has?",
  "Well, if that's the case, if you're reading it that way ­­ I mean, I was reading it Justice Scalia's way, too.",
  "The first clause says, \"shall\" and the second clause says, \"shall not.\" But there is an alternate reading where the first clause says, \"shall,\" and the second clause essentially says, \"may or may not at your discretion.\" But, boy, that would open up a big discretionary hole if you read it that way, wouldn't it?",
  "If I understand the way you think this works, you don't ­­ there's not even a presumption that a settled child will stay, right? You're just saying, once you've found a settled child, the obligation to return the child goes away, but at that point, it really is a kind of \"all things considered\" inquiry, with no presumption operating at all, just in light of the purposes of the treaty?",
  "But General, I think you're ­­ you're not answering the real thrust of the Chief Justice's question, which is that we could just be back here if we ­­ if we said, well, they didn't phrase this in the right way. Well, they'll phrase it differently, and we would be back here with the same essential problem, that you're asking us to peg this on a formality that the Senate could easily evade, and that suggests that it really is the Senate's job to determine whether they're in recess or whether they're not.",
  "General, would you agree that this clause now is not mostly used to deal with emergencies arising from congressional absence? That most modern Presidents ­­ and I say this sort of going ­­ going back to President Reagan, Presidents of both parties, essentially, have used this clause as a way to deal ­­ not with congressional absence, but with congressional intransigence, with a Congress that simply does not want to approve appointments that the President thinks ought to be approved? You know, absence in this day and age ­­ this is not the horse­and­buggy era anymore. There's no real ­­ there's no such thing, truly, as congressional absence anymore. And that makes me wonder whether we're dealing here with what's essentially a historic relic, something whose original purpose has disappeared and has assumed a new purpose that nobody ever intended it to have.",
  "Yes, as a result of congressional refusal, not as a result of congressional absence.",
  "General, I think that's a really strong argument, but I have to say I'm not sure it applies consistently throughout each of the three claims that you make. Because if you are going to rely on history and on the development of an equilibrium with respect to what \"happens\" means, and if you are going to do that again with respect to whether intra­session recesses are included, then it seems to me you also have to look to history and the development of an equilibrium with respect to Congress's definition of its own power to determine whether they are in recess or not. In other words, your third argument about pro forma sessions, the history is entirely on the Senate's side, not on your side. And if we're going to take a kind of continuing practice and the development of equilibrium seriously, you might win on questions 1 and 2 and then lose on question 3.",
  "Suppose it was ­­ suppose it was the exact same no­business order, but the single senator who was there got up and asked for unanimous consent to name a post office, and every three days, he got up and said unanimous consent to name a post office. The post office is named. So they can do ­­ you know, trivial business in each of these sessions. Would that make a constitutional difference?",
  "But that, again, suggests that the rule that you're asking us to establish is ­­ is so easy to evade that why bother establishing it at all. The fact that it's so easy to evade suggests that this really is ­­ the question of how to define a recess really does belong to the Senate.",
  "I totally take your point on that. But what I'm suggesting is they could just come back, and by naming post offices, have the same effect, that they would write it out of the ­­ of the Constitution as much as you say this does.",
  "Mr. Francisco, I'm sorry, but could we go back to Justice Alito's question? Because I really have the same issue with your argument. You know, suppose that on one ­­ let's say the \"happens\" argument, that yours is at least the most natural reading of the statute, at least the way we understand the word \"happen\" today, and maybe a compelled reading, but the history points so much in the other direction; and that that history brings with it a whole set of practices and traditions and ways of dealing with each other that has grown around a certain interpretation of what \"happens\" means, right? The idea that we would wake up one fine morning and chuck all of that because all of a sudden we happened to read the clause, I mean, that at least needs to be defended.",
  "I know, but now, you're ­­ you're again ­­ I mean, assume that there is a 200­year­old established practice, everybody has agreed to it, but the text, when you really look at it, points the other way.",
  "Mr. Francisco, tell me if I am wrong about this, but it seems to me that intra­session recesses really only arose in the 1940s or so, right? There is the period with Andrew Johnson and Andrew Johnson used intra­recess ­­ intra­session recesses to make a lot of appointments. Other than that, intra­session recesses of more than 3 days that are not Christmas simply do not exist. So that assume that as intra­session recesses came to be, Presidents started making appointments in them.",
  "Mr. Francisco, can I ask a question about the second question presented, the \"happens\" question?",
  "And if you put aside all the history and you look only at the language and you look only at our own modern view of what happens, that surely seems to favor your position. But ­­ you know, given all the statements in the founding period itself about how this is ambiguous and it might have two meanings, if you look at the dictionaries of that time ­­ so I went back and I looked at the Oxford English Dictionary, and one of the definitions of \"happens\" there is \"chance to be,\" essentially the exact same definition that Thomas Jefferson said made this ambiguous. And we would never use \"happens\" in that way now. If you look at the examples that the Oxford English gives, they're laughable. Nobody would ever say that now. But it just suggested to me that maybe what we think is pretty clear is only pretty clear because one meaning of “happens” has ­­ you know, over 200 years ­­",
  "­­ lapsed.",
  "No, I don't think so, right. Essentially, Thomas Jefferson says it could mean one thing or the other, and the other thing that he said, which is \"happens to exist,\" is sort of exactly this old definition, which is \"happens\" means \"chance to be.\"",
  "You know, I don't remember them exactly. I just remember kind of laughing at them, as things that ­­",
  "­­ nobody would say ­­",
  "Mr. Estrada, you said in your brief that that was true within wide limits. What are the wide limits?",
  "Is the Chief Justice's example before, if the Senate just said, we're ­­ we're never in recess for purposes of appointments, would that be permissible?",
  "But people object all the time to things that in fact they can't do anything about, right?",
  "But, Mr. Hellman, (k) of course talks about exempt property.",
  "Is there a possibility of reading the statute such that the exemption just never comes into effect? If you look at 522(l) ­­",
  "­­ (l) says, \"unless a party in interest objects, the property claimed as exempt is exempt.\" Now, that suggests that if the party in interest does object, there's a question about whether the party claimed as exempt is exempt. So ­­ so why isn't it a permissible reading of the statute to essentially say the court gets to decide whether this is exempt property such that (k) comes into effect, and in deciding whether it's exempt property, it can take into account the Petitioner's abuse of process?",
  "Yes. I completely agree with that, but suppose one were.",
  "I think that's a little bit backwards, right? Doesn't 105 exist to the extent that there's no prohibition saying otherwise? And then 522(k) comes in, and there's your prohibition.",
  "So but then you're saying essentially that every provision in the Bankruptcy Code ought to be read with an addendum that says, \"Except if there's an abuse of process.\"",
  "Ms. Harrington, you clearly have the facts on your side. The question is whether you have the law. And ­­ and 522(k) says, as Justice Breyer said, \"Property that the debtor exempts under this section is not liable for payment of any administrative expense.\" Now, as I read your brief, you're essentially asking us to put the word \"usually\" in that provision. Is not usually liable. When is it ­­ when is it liable? It's ­­ it's liable when there are special circumstances dealing with debtor dishonesty. And where does that come from?",
  "I'm not sure I understand that. Are you saying that the court could not just have fined him, let's say, $100,000 or however much he wanted, however ­­ whatever the costs were, and that he could get that out of the debtor's future earnings?",
  "Mr. Lechner, I know Great Northern said so and that is surely very strong support for your view. But why did Great Northern think that there was a difference between pre­1871 grants and post?",
  "I mean, I guess I had thought if you were just dealing with this as a matter of first impression that the shift in Congress's policy was a shift about whether to give away ­­ you know, huge swaths of land to the railroads, and that Congress indeed decided, enough of this, we are not going to give these checkerboard grants of land to the railroad, because they are making a mint from this, and we would rather give it to homesteaders. But there was ­­ I don't see any evidence that there was any shift in policy or any reason why there would be a shift in policy, as to what the rights of way were. Whether they were easements or whether they were limited fees.",
  "I guess ­­ you know, again, if you were just looking at this as a matter of first impression, the language of Section 4 does not seem to me to be very indicative of anything. You know, it says \"subject to the right­of­way.\" Subject to the right­of­way. Whatever the right­of­way is. Subject to the right­of­way if it's an easement. Subject to the right­of­way if it's a limited fee. Doesn't seem to pick one or the other.",

  "Thousands, tens of thousands? How many people are involved here and how many acres of land?",
  "The patent here, Mr. Yang, which was, what, in the mid­1970s did not reserve anything. The government just made an uncritical grant to the grant family?",
  "Well, I'm just suggesting that after Great Northern and then you're given this patent, which is unequivocal and does not reserve anything, why anybody would think that they hadn’t gotten the whole ball of wax is a mystery.",
  "It seems to me a fair reading of the history here, Mr. Yang, is that it really didn't occur to the government until very recently that these rights of way had value as anything other than railroad tracks, and indeed that the government was anxiously trying to give these things away because it thought that these spaghetti strips of land, it's of no use to the government, here, take them, get them off our hands. And having done that for many, many, many decades, the government faces a problem when it turns around and says, you know what, we forgot, there are bike paths.",

Why couldn't we say that this presents a distinct problem, these Stern­type claims, and it's really a problem of severability, and that we should understand this statute in light of Stern as essentially creating this middle category which Congress clearly meant to have the treatment that the noncore claims get.",
  "Well, we do try though, again, to apply severability principles to write the statute that Congress would have written if it had known about a constitutional ruling. And that's essentially what Justice Breyer is suggesting.",
  "Well, couldn't you say the same thing once again about magistrates, the exact same arguments would apply to them?",
  "Well, I don't see why that would make a difference if you say the problem is congressional aggrandizement or congressional encroachment of a certain kind. It doesn't seem to me to make any difference in that case, if Congress says, by the way, you can consent to it.",
  "Mr. Gannon ­­",
  "Mr. Gannon, could you say a word about the relevance of arbitration here? Because I've been trying to figure out, if there's an Article III problem irrespective of consent when Congress adopts some kind of scheme for alternative adjudication, why schemes of mediation and arbitration wouldn't similarly be constitutionally problematic.",
  "Yes, but that would suggest that arbitration is more constitutionally problematic because it ­­ it extends ­­ you know, it goes ­­ it's further away from the supervisory authority of the district court.",
  "A matter of contract versus a matter of consent? Like I said, you understand the difference.",
  "Mr. Rienzi, the State says, of that particular tool, that it's a hard thing to prosecute because you have to show intent, and there is a lot of obstruction and interference that goes on naturally just because there are a lot of people around. So that is an insufficient tool is what the State argues.",
  "And sometimes there are those bad actors, but probably more often it's just a function of there are just lots of people, and they, your clients and all of ­­ all of them want to be as close as possible to the site, and that that naturally leads to an interference with normal access.",
  "But are you saying that you could not do an act that instead just says, look, it's a little bit too hard to figure out what and what does not disrupt peace and order, so we're just going to say 25 feet around a funeral, or 25 feet around any facility, that that's never permissible?",
  "Well, for example, I was intrigued by one of the examples that you gave in your own brief, which you said slaughterhouses. So, let's say, that there are animal rights activists, and this is easy to imagine, who try to interfere with access in and out of slaughterhouses. And a State passes a regulation that says there's a ton of interference, it's preventing the operation of these facilities, employees can't get in, suppliers can't get in, slaughterhouses are leaving the State because of this problem, and so we're just going to set up a zone and let's call it 30 feet, because it's very hard to enforce anything else. I guess my reaction to that hypothetical ­­ you ­­ you must have used it for me to say, oh, that's terrible. But my reaction, my intuition was kind of what's wrong with that? Just have everybody take a step back. So what is wrong with that?",
  "But let's go back to the slaughterhouse case. I mean, there might be people who say it's really important to us to actually be able to face­to­face talk with the employees and tell them why they should get different jobs or why they should change their practices in various kinds of ways. And ­­ you know, there are some people who think signs and chants are great, but there are people who really want to make one­to­one contact with the truck drivers, with the employees, whoever. But ­­ but you say ­­ you know, we have to let whatever interference goes on, even if there's a record of ­­ of real obstruction, of real interference with the operation of the facility, in order to allow that to happen. And I guess I think that that's ­­ that's pretty hard.",
  "But isn't that more a function that they just have a private parking lot? So even if this law didn't exist, you actually couldn't reach most of these people because they drive into the private parking lot and you can't talk to them anyway.",
  "Is there a buffer zone that you would concede is permissible? In other words, if it were 12 feet, would that be all right?",
  "Well, but that goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question. I mean, how is a law supposed to deal with ­­ with that, sort of the fluctuating conditions that may be at a particular clinic site?",
  "It's more than a speech­free zone. It's also a conduct­free zone, right? You can't sell hats there, you can't ­­ you know, beg there. I mean, you just can't go there.",
  "It's still a thoroughfare ­­",
  "Well, it's more than a few feet. You know, 35 feet is a ways. It's from this bench to the end of the court. And if you imagine the Chief Justice as sort of where the door would be, it's most of the width of this courtroom as well. It's ­­ it's pretty much this courtroom, kind of. That's a lot of space.",
  "How did you pick 35 feet? Why 35?",
  "Well, that raises another question, Ms. Miller, because I assume that that's true because the crowds and the obstruction really are with respect to one facility at certain periods of time. So Mr. Rienzi says, look, if it's at one facility, not all ten of them or whatever it is, and it's only for certain periods of time, not all day every day ­­ you know, why not narrow it that way?",
  "So why not?",
  "And I would think, Ms. Miller, that if you tried to do a statute that distinguished between protestors and counselors, that would be content­based much more than this statute is.",
  "I mean, but ­­ you know, which is not to say that this statute doesn't have its problems, in my view. I mean, so I guess I'm a little bit hung up on why you need so much space.",
  "Is that true, Mr. Rienzi? Is Massachusetts' statute the only one of this kind?",
  "Can I ask you about that Ms. Sherry? If ­­ I mean, suppose we accepted your argument as to bodily injury, but offensive touching just went too far. What happens? How are the laws of the 50 States constructed? Are we going to have ­­ are you going to have, a terrible difficulty prosecuting real ­­ you know, punch­in­the­nose kinds of incidents of physical violence, because there are indivisible statutes that apply to both?",
  "Well, presumably, if they're divisible, you don't have a problem. The only time you're going to have a problem ­­ and, again, I'm assuming that the Court will say physical touching goes too far, that that's not included under 922. So you'll have a problem as to any State statute that indivisibly makes illegal both ­­ both offensive touching and more violent forms of activity. How many statutes are like that?",
  "Of the 28 States, if I could just understand this ­­",
  "Of the 28 States, how many separated out on the face of the statute as between ­­",
  "­­ offensive touching and bodily injury?",
  "How does marital rape figure in this? In a ­­ is a marital rape considered a bodily injury, or is that actually ­­ could that fall under the offensive touching?",
  "Of course, that's the same language as was in Johnson, but you would be asking us to apply it differently here.",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, I thought that what Johnson said, it defined physical force as force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person. It didn't say anything about serious pain or grievous injury. It just said force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person. That's what Johnson said. Why would we adopt a different approach?",
  "No. I mean, it specified it is not involving any level, that ­­ that there was no inquiry into level. It's force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.",
  "That's the clear standard in the holding.",
  "Ms. Sherry said 14. And is that your view, too?",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, how serious do you think the injury has to be? What ­­ what counts as serious enough injury?",
  "But Mr. Rothfeld, this might go back to our difference on what Johnson said. But you're asking us to apply a higher standard than Johnson, which just said force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person without any notion of seriousness or grievousness or whatnot. And ­­ you know, I ­­ I can see an argument that says we should apply the exact same standard as Johnson. I can see an argument that says actually, we should apply a lower standard because this is misdemeanors rather than felonies, but I guess I can't see an argument about why we should apply a higher standard than Johnson.",
  "But your argument, of course, isn't limited to that. It goes beyond that situation?",
  "But what ­­ what you're objecting to, to the extent that you're not objecting to the entire system of collective bargaining, you're objecting ­­ you're saying an individual employee can say, I don't feel like supporting a union that makes a certain kind of argument about wages or about benefits. So, just to carry on with Justice Scalia's example, the subject matter is the exact same in the two contexts, whether it's an individual employee or whether it's a union, and in both contexts, the ­­ the ultimate sanction is the same, right? Somebody grouses about his pay too much, he could get fired. Somebody refuses to support a union that is negotiating about pay, he can lose his job. So it's ­­ it's really identical across the two situations.",
  "Same subject matter, same sanction. What's the difference?",
  "But you're not objecting, I think, to the union as a whole. What you're objecting to is an individual employee having to support that activity. The scale is no different. It's an individual employee.",
  "But that's exactly what the individual employee in Justice Scalia's hypothetical is arguing for. He wants wage rates to be changed across the board. He knows they're not going to be changed just for him. He wants higher wage rates.",
  "Mr. Messenger, I'm not sure that Justice Scalia's answer satisfies his own question.",
  "Because here's the thing: That, in the workplace, we've given the government a very wide degree of latitude, and there's much that the government can do. It can fire people, it can demote people for things that they say in the workplace, not for things that they say as a citizen, but for things that they say in the workplace. That's the fundamental lesson of Garcetti and of many, many others of our cases. So you're saying, well, the government can punish somebody for saying something, but the government in the exact same position cannot compel somebody to say something they disagree with. And I want to know what's the basis for that distinction, which it seems to me is just as hard as ­­ as if you were answering under the Petition Clause.",
  "Good, okay.",
  "Mr. Messenger ­­",
  "So, Mr. Messenger, even on the compulsory fees ­­ I mean, what strikes me is that this is ­­ I'm just going to use the word here ­­ it is a radical argument. It would radically restructure the way workplaces across this country are ­­ are run. And let me just put it to you this way and ask if you agree with this ­­ with this statement. Since 1948, since the Taft­Hartley Act, there has been a debate in every State across this country about whether to be a right­to­work State, and people have disagreed. Some States say yes, some States say no. It raises considerable heat and passion and tension, as we recently saw in Wisconsin. And ­­ but ­­ you know, these are public policy choices that States make. And is it fair to say that what you're suggesting here ­­ your argument is essentially to say that, for 65 years, people have been debating the wrong question when they've been debating that because, in fact, a right­to­work law is constitutionally compelled?",
  "Mr. Messenger, do you doubt that these ­­ you said that there were no reliance interests, and ­­ and that's curious to me. There must be thousands and thousands of contracts across the United States with fair share provisions. Do you doubt that these were core central provisions in the making of these contracts; that if these kinds of provisions were prohibited, the ­­ the agreements would look fundamentally different in many ways?",
  "You think that the union would ­­ would not ask for anything, would not have different ­­ you know, would not ask for different mechanisms in order to support its own activity? The unions go into these contracts with the understanding that this is what's going to enable them to at once satisfy their universal obligation to employees to fairly represent them and, also, get the funds they need for administrative and other expenses.",
  "So you think that if we just strike these provisions, in other words, the ­­ the contracts would have been negotiated in exactly the same way, nothing else would have changed?",
  "Mr. Bibas, I would have thought that there was something in the copyright context that cuts against you, and that's that, because of this separate accrual rule and the feature of these rolling statutes of limitations combined with very, very lengthy copyrights terms, that essentially a plaintiff cannot bring suit for years ­­ decades ­­ and time the suit in order to maximize her own gain. That strikes me as something that we don't usually see in statute of limitations cases. I mean, we don't have very many cases where courts have applied laches as against the statute of limitations, but that's because you can't think of many instances in which it would be considered unfair to take the entire statute of limitations to bring a suit. But in this context, you look at something that seems very different. A plaintiff can wait 20 years, given the way the separate accrual work ­­ rule works.",
  "We don't make that distinction with respect to equitable tolling. Why would we make it here?",
  "\"Bizarre\" seems to me a little strong, I mean, because I take it that Mr. Bibas is making a statutory argument ­­ I mean, he's saying not the language of the statute, but he's saying what was Congress thinking at the time. Congress was faced with all of these precedents, essentially saying laches was not available. There are no cases out there, really, where laches does cut into a defined statute of limitations period. And then you have the feature that Congress knew that it was enacting these rolling statutes of limitations, you would have thought that it might have been foremost in their head, how are we going to prevent somebody from suing 30 years later? And they did nothing of the kind. They could very easily have made it clear that laches applied, or they could have set an outer limit, or they could have done a number of things, and they really didn't do any of them. So how are we to account for all that?",
  "Mr. Perry, the Ninth Circuit here used this language of presumption. It said, \"If any part of the alleged wrongful conduct occurred outside of the limitations period, courts presume that the plaintiff's claims are barred by laches,\" and you just said, laches is, at least in part, a prejudice doctrine.",
  "Do you concede that that presumption is wrong?",
  "Well, that's one ­­ you know, one understanding of the opinion is, look, that's just nothing. But do you agree with it?",
  "Well, I guess, partly, that suggests a burden of persuasion, but partly, it suggests just a kind of starting position is that, if there was conduct outside the limitations period, it was prejudicial, and I guess I want to know why that would be.",
  "Well, one can agree with that and not think that if conduct happened three years and two days earlier, there is ­­ that the burden of coming forward and the necessity to give a reason flips to the other side.",
  "Is your argument limited to that? Would you say laches is also available when there's no continuing violation or when there's no",
  "Mr. Perry, what troubles me a bit about your argument is I think that the dearth of cases on this is probably explainable by the fact that people just haven't thought that they had a laches defense when a plaintiff brought a suit within a statute of limitations period. And now, if we open this all up, grant it in a statutory context, in which it makes some sense to give people a laches defense, if we open this all up, we'll be seeing motions that nobody ever dreamed of before.",
  "But in the context in which we've approved sobriety checkpoints, why should we get bent out of shape over this?",
  "Well, but why is that an important line? Why should we be more concerned when an individual automobile is pulled over?",
  "If I understand you correctly, as long as you can identify the car, you need no specificity as to what the car has actually done. In other words ­­ you know, just saying the driver was reckless is enough. Is that ­­ is that correct?",
  "What would fail your test?",
  "And, Mr. Laurence, do I understand what you're saying? You're saying that in every case when we have to decide whether the threshold level of reasonable suspicion has been met or whether the level of probable cause has been met, that courts can take into account the seriousness of the offense, and what would not count as probable cause for one crime will count as probable cause for another? Is that what you're saying?",
  "Well, I don't understand how what you're saying is different from what I just said, and that would seem to me to work quite a substantial change in ­­ in Fourth Amendment law, that when we decide whether reasonable suspicion exists, when ­­ whether probable cause exists, that we get to take into account how serious the offense is.",
  "The balancing occurs categorically. We decide that there's a reasonable suspicion standard by balancing interests. What we don't do is say ­­ you know, depending on how serious we think this crime is, more or less will meet that reasonable suspicion standard. That would be a very substantial reworking of Fourth Amendment law ­­ or so it seems to me. Maybe I'm wrong.",
  "So do you think, Mr. Laurence, if the police had followed this man for half an hour and seen no other signs of erratic driving and nobody can drunk drive ­­ can drive drunk for half an hour without swerving, without doing something else. So they could still have stopped the car?",
  "Well, I thought you were saying as long as somebody had ­­ had given an account that, some time ago, he had driven another driver off ­­ he had run another driver off the road, doesn't matter whether you're drunk, doesn't matter anything, there was an account of an illegal act taking place, and that was enough to stop him. It doesn't matter what he's doing now.",
  "But all crime represents a threat to public safety, and yet, we have these standards.",
  "Well, what ­­ what goes on the other side of the line? I mean, why ­­ why is this on one side? And then tell me what's on the other.",
  "How about somebody cutting someone off in their lane?",
  "But then you think J.L. would have come out differently if the tipster had said, \"I just saw these guys and I saw ­­ you know, one of them had a gun\"?",
  "I'm sorry. So you're saying that in that case, the gun dealer runs the background check on the person who hands the gun dealer the credit card as opposed to the person who will be the actual recipient of the gun? Is that what you're saying the statute requires?",
  "Mr. Dietz, can we go back to the question that Justice Alito raised? The primary object of this statute is to keep guns out of the hands of felons, of people with mental illness and so forth. Now, it's absolutely true, as you have said, that Congress didn't do everything it could have to achieve that result, right? That there are many kinds of resales that are allowable, that there are gifts that are allowable. It's one thing to say that. It's another thing to say that at the initial point of sale, which is where the entire system is set up, right, with the gun dealer doing the automatic checks, that at that initial point of sale, which is the centerpiece of this statute, that we will ­­ that we will essentially disregard fronts, that we ­­ you know, that we don't care that the person standing at the counter is a front. I mean, that goes far beyond the other kinds of resale possibilities that you're talking about. And I guess what I want to know is why you think a Congress that was geared towards this object of keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people and set up a mechanism that had the gun seller be the kind of enforcer, at the point of sale, would have thought, oh, it's fine if a front, if a straw walks in the door.",
  "Well, Mr. Palmore, is that right? I thought that Mr. Dietz's argument went beyond what Justice Scalia just said, that for Mr. Dietz, regarding ­­ you can ­­ he might be prosecuted under another statute for selling something to somebody he knows is Al Capone, but that he was ­­ you know, because he was the guy at the counter and he was buying for somebody else, as to this question of material representation, it does not matter whether the ultimate transferee was Al Capone or somebody else.",
  "I think he said that just right in here.",
  "If you're right on Question 1, 922(t) just makes this a slam dunk on Question 2. And there's a question about whether you are right on Question 1. But if you are, (t) says, look, the dealer is supposed to check the transferee, right? And if we assume that when Congress says \"the transferee,\" it's the real transferee, not the fake transferee, the dealer is supposed to check the real transferee. So what does the dealer think is material? I mean, the question is, what does a reasonable dealer think is material? I better know who you are so I can check you. That's material.",
  "Well, it's not just the structure ­­ it's not just the overriding purpose. 922(t) says that the dealer is supposed to check the transferee to find out whether the transferee has a criminal record, to find out whether the transferee has mental illness. So who does he check? Who is the transferee? Well, I need to know who the transferee is to make that check. So, obviously, it's material to know who the transferee is.",
  "Mr. Schneider, on your view, if only one person viewed the pornography, that person would be responsible for the entire damages, but if a thousand people viewed the pornography and the harm was that much greater, nobody would be in ­­ would be on the hook for restitution. How could that possibly make sense?",
  "Well, could you say more about that? You said that the Chief Justice's question was right, that it doesn't work for the first person, and you said there are better ones. What are the better ones?",
  "But ­­ you know ­­ I mean, it struck me, when I read your brief, that it said, I don't know why these courts started where they started, whether each violation is worth 1,000 or 5,000 or And it seems as though somebody just plucks an initial number out of the air and then everything is pegged to that initial number, but that the initial number has nothing in particular behind it or am I ­­ is it more sensible than that?",

And you come in and you say, no, it shouldn't be ­­ notwithstanding that this particular offense was responsible for only a part, you think the defendant should be liable for the whole.",
  "I guess I'm just not sure what that means, contributed to $100. Does that mean she's ­­ the defendant is responsible for the entire",
  "­­ as a matter of fact? Or does it mean that the defendant is responsible as a matter of fact for some lesser part of the entire harm?",
  "I ­­ I guess I'm ­­ when I say responsible, I don't mean as a legal conclusion. I mean did the defendant cause the entire $100 of harm?",
  "Well, that's ­­",
  "Well, full amount ­­",
  "­­ from the particular offense, Mr. Cassell, so that it's the full amount of whatever the particular offense caused. But you're not saying that this Defendant caused the entire 3.4.",
  "Usually, when we approve joint and several liability, we do so against a background of a functioning system of contribution, where one defendant pays the entire thing, but then can go after ­­",
  "­­ other defendants and be pretty well assured that he gets their share. Now, here, there's nothing like that, and the question ­­ I guess the question is you're asking us to impose that kind of system without the usual thing that goes along with it, which is a sharing mechanism.",
  "Mr. Keisler, I'm sorry. Can I ask about your interpretation of the phrase \"any air pollutant\"? Because there are a lot of different interpretations that have gone on among the various briefs and among the lower court opinions in this case. So here are some choices, all right? And I want really to ask you to pick what you're arguing for. Your original position was that \"any air pollutant\" meant any NAAQS pollutant for which the area is in attainment; that was your original position. Judge Kavanaugh's position is that it means any NAAQS pollutant. There is another position that goes on in the briefs that says, no, it doesn't mean any NAAQS pollutant; it means any local pollutant, whether or not it's a NAAQS pollutant; and there is still another position that says it's really any regulated pollutant other than greenhouse gases. So those are four different interpretations that all of the folks on your side, and I realize there are a lot of them, have presented. And I guess I'm asking you which one you're arguing for.",
  "When you say area­specific, I mean, I take it that these sort of ozone pollutants are not area­specific. Would your interpretation exclude those as well?",
  "But, again, that's because they're not local.",
  "Mr. Keisler, if I could follow up, really, on Justice Breyer's question, because the conundrum here, you keep saying: Look, EPA is violating this specific statutory term. But the conundrum that this cases raises is that everybody is violating a statutory term. EPA is saying, no, we can't do the 100 to 250 with respect to greenhouse gases, but you are also violating a statutory term. You know, it says any pollutant or it says in the other provision each pollutant subject to regulation. Nobody would think that the most natural, most reasonable readings of those phrases are any pollutant if they have localized effects, but not otherwise. So I mean, what's happened here is that you have this new kind of emission that basically makes these two terms of the statute irreconcilable, and the agency has essentially picked one. It said: Look, we're not going to just exempt a broad class of pollutants. Instead, we're going to fudge the numbers. And why isn't that the more reasonable of the two things to do?",
  "Well, I think I don't really understand then. But I mean, it's true that one is a number. But the other, each pollutant subject to regulation or any air pollutant, what the EPA has done is for 30 years across presidential administrations treated those phrases as meaning a single thing, which I think if you put aside the absurdity problem in this case, everybody would agree is the most reasonable interpretation of those phrases. And you're saying the EPA should junk that most reasonable interpretation of those phrases because there's a new kind of emitted ­­ emitted chemical or whatever that makes the numbers not work.",
  "Well, but that's not Judge Kavanaugh's position. I thought Judge Kavanaugh's position is any NAAQS pollutant, all NAAQS pollutants.",
  "And it comes from a different portion of the statutory language.",
  "Can I ask, Mr. Cavanaugh, why Judge Kavanaugh's argument has been left by the wayside?",
  "Well, it does ­­ it comes from different statutory language. His arguments about the structure of the statute don't apply to your argument. So I think, notwithstanding that there is some overlap between the arguments, the legal rationales are entirely different, and I guess I'm just curious.",
  "General, I take it that the unambiguous statutory language that you are referring to is the references to 100 and to 250. And it seems to me that that's an odd kind of term to drive such an important statutory interpretation question, because what those numbers were all about is that they were supposed to separate major emitters from minor emitters. I mean, they were supposed to be about the size of the facility. They were not supposed to have ­­ they were not supposed to make any distinctions as to the type of pollutant. So you're essentially using those numbers to make distinctions as to the type of pollutant rather than, it seems to me a more sensible approach would be to say, look, the 100 and 250 numbers don't work for this new kind of pollutant, we're going to up the numbers, and that will leave the rest of the statute and all the purposes of Congress intact.",
  "But, General, if you think about the question of what any pollutant means, and you put aside this whole absurdity question that the numbers get you to, you just say, what does any air pollutant mean? Does it mean what EPA has said it has meant for 30 years, which is any pollutant that's regulated under this Act, or does it mean something more along the lines of what you're saying, which is anything other than greenhouse gases, or anything other than pollutants that have particular localized effects. You would obviously choose EPA's version of the thing. And the only reason that you're not choosing that is because of these numbers that are in the statute, which were designed only, only to distinguish between major and minor emitters. So if you can distinguish between major and minor emitters while keeping the completely sensible longstanding interpretation of any pollutant, why wouldn't you do that?",
  "General, one question is what would Congress have wanted, given the obvious purposes of the Act. And that's an important question. Another question is: What did the agency decide here? I mean, obviously, this is the apex of Chevron deference. There's nothing that gets more deference than this agency with respect to this complicated a statute. And given that this whole thing arises because there's this new kind of emission, which ­­ which the numbers don't work for, but which essentially makes these two terms in the statute irreconcilable, why isn't that a classic case for deference to the agency, that the agency gets to choose how to make the thing work as best it can, when a changed circumstance makes it work not entirely the way Congress had foretold?",
  "General ­­ General, if I could actually get back to Justice Alito's question, because I had a similar issue with what EPA did here. It seems to me it would be completely responsible and understandable if EPA had said, look, the 100 and 250 don't work with respect to this category of pollutant, Congress didn't know that this kind of pollutant was out there when it wrote those numbers, what it was trying to do was to distinguish between major and minor emitters. The new numbers are X and Y for that ­­ for this kind of pollutant. But, you know, and I understand that EPA may have felt like, oh, gosh, can we really do that? But the solution that EPA came up with actually seems to give it complete discretion to do whatever it wants, whenever it wants to, and to not ­­ and to be much more problematic than if EPA had just said, no, it's not 100 and 250. It's 10 times that.",
  "And ­­",
  "General, wouldn't it be right to say that the rule that Justice Scalia is referring to only applies if there are alternative interpretations that are consistent with the legislative purpose. There have to be plausible alternative interpretations of the statute. And reading the phrase \"any pollutant\" to mean any pollutant except for greenhouse gases for reasons that have nothing to do with the purposes of the statute is not a plausible alternative interpretation. Wouldn't that be the argument?",
  "But isn't that the argument? Justice's Scalia's alternative plausible interpretation of the statutes might have been an alternative plausible interpretation of the statute pre­Massachusetts. But it no longer is; isn't that right?",
  "Could I make sure I understand that? Would you pick the number that leads to the same class of emitters? Is that the number you would pick?",
  "As in the more typical emissions context, right? So 100 and 250 ­­",
  "­­ captures a certain set of emitters. Are you essentially looking for the number that captures the same class of emitters?",
  "Ms. Harrington, your whole argument really rests on that statutory language.",
  "And one of the questions that came up in the last half hour is, is that the right section of the statute. Now, in your view, which is that the only thing involved here is money, that's all that's involved here, why aren't we under A, rather than B?",
  "Right. But usually when you don't have money, I mean, say ­­ let's just say I'm a fraud victim, and I get an order of restitution for $100,000, and the fraudster doesn't have the $100,000. He only has $50,000. So the court says: Well, now you have to pay the $50,000 and we're going to put you on a schedule of payments, and you are going to pay the other 50 over the next year or two years, whatever.",
  "Would you think that that's under B?",
  "So you think that my hypothetical ­­ let me ­­ I'm just ­­ I'm sorry for ­­ is under B, not under A?",
  "So any time I don't have enough money to make the victim whole, it's under B, not A?",
  "Well, I don't ­­ I guess ­­ gosh, I don't know. But I would have just thought that it was under A for pretty much the same reason that Justice Breyer said. It just doesn't make sense for it to be under B. I mean, essentially you are saying, you know, if ­­ if ­­ if return of the cash is impossible, pay the cash under B. That ­­ that just doesn't ­­ that's not a sensible statutory command.",
  "No, but you see if the ­­ it would make a difference as to whether A or B applies because your whole argument is premised on the language of B. So if we're not in B, if we're in A, your statutory argument goes away, and then we just try to figure out what offset rules make sense. I mean, there's got to be an offset in A, too, right? Suppose we were under A. It's got to be. You don't think that there is an offset under A?",
  "Yes, but suppose ­­ suppose another case. Just say the second half to Justice Breyer. Sorry.",
  "Well, what do you think happens in an A case where let's ­­ let's ­­ in a mortgage case, so there's a home, but this ­­ this person also has cash and repays the full amount in cash. And now the bank has the full amount in cash, but also has this home. And then the bank sells the home. Is ­­ is the defendant entitled to an offset?",
  "I know. But if it did arise, because I'm trying to figure out ­­ it seems to me that there has to be an implicit offset in A as well.",
  "Well, how does the defendant get the benefit of that? What would the defendants do to go get the excess?",
  "Over the ­­ the total amount lost?",
  "But if I could just be clear about what you're saying, you're saying it's not the sale price when the sale is for a nominal amount; is that right?",
  "And it's not the sale price if the lender has done something commercially unreasonable?",
  "Is that right?",
  "And so if that's right and both of those things sound right, but why doesn't that kind of explode your statutory argument, because then it's not any part of the property that's returned.",
  "Well, would you explain that to me a little bit, Mr. Katyal. In a case in which the district court just uses an erroneous claim construction, you would concede that that's a pure legal question, so that would be an abuse of discretion?",
  "No, but I ­­ I guess my first question was just if what ­­ if the district court says, Here's the appropriate claim construction, and in saying that, it's wrong.",
  "Is that a legal question?",
  "Okay. So let's just assume for a moment that an erroneous claim construction would be a mistake of law. Let's just assume that. And I understand you say that there's a question. But if that's right, why is it not also true that a judge's statement that a litigant ­­ that a litigant's claim construction was unreasonable is not a similar mistake of law?",
  "But isn't the main thing the judge doing when it says that a claim construction is unreasonable is essentially measuring the delta between the actual ­­ the correct claim construction and the mistaken claim construction? And doesn't that seem to be, again, assuming that the claim construction itself is a question of law? Doesn't that itself seem to be a question of law?",
  "Mr. Telscher, can I just ask very quickly the factors that you would think a court should consider. One is the degree to which the case is meritless. Another, I presume, is bad faith. Another is litigation misconduct. Is there anything else or are those the three?",
  "But I think, Mr. Martinez, what the Chief Justice is driving at is there's a bit of a disconnect between your list of factors and those two words. Gross injustice, I mean that's kind ­­ that's really, really exceptional. That sounds like, shocks the conscience. That sounds like something you've never seen happen in the litigation system ever. But then you're saying essentially ratchet it down when you list all of these various factors. And maybe that's ­­ that's right, we shouldn't be obsessed with this word, gross injustice. It just seems a disconnect between the two words and all the factors.",
  "Mr. Phillips, I realize that you have this argument that this statute was before Rule 11, so the superfluity argument doesn't work. But just as a matter of fact, would your standard give the court authority to order fees in any case in which it does not have authority by virtue of either Rule 11 or its inherent authority?",
  "But let me make sure I understand you. Give me an example of a case in which under your standard, 285 could be used to order a payment of fees, but Rule 11 and inherent authority would not allow.",
  "Inequitable conduct to the Trademark Office, but not with respect to the suit itself?",
  "So there's nothing ­­",
  "There's nothing with respect to the suit itself that Rule 11 and inherent authority wouldn't get you anyway.",
  "Mister ­­",
  "Mr. Waxman, can I take you back to a question that the Chief Justice asked? Because the Chief Justice said, you know, where does this SEM come from. And it is the test maker's determination that this is the margin of error that gives you a 95 percent confidence. I guess the question here or one question here is why do we have a 95 percent ­­ why do we need a 95 percent confidence level? And you could say it either way. You could say, gosh, we're putting somebody to death, we should ­­ we should have a 100 percent confidence level. Or you could say, as I take it Justice Alito ­­ Justice Alito's point was, well, look, the burden of proof is on the defendant here anyway, so a 95 percent confidence level seems awfully high. We should, you know, ration it down to 80 percent. So why for this purpose do we have to go with the test maker's determination that 5 is what gives you a 95 percent confidence level?",
  "Well ­­ and that's not really my question.",
  "I understand why they might use it for a wide variety of purposes. The question is: Why does their determination that it's useful for a wide variety of purposes to have a 95 percent confidence level, why is the State stuck with that for this purpose?",
  "So what ­­",
  "But, General, the ultimate determination here is whether somebody is mentally retarded; and the IQ test is just a part of that. It's a part of one prong of that ultimate determination. And what your cutoff does is it essentially says the inquiry has to stop there. And the question is how is that at all consistent with anything we ever say when it comes to the death penalty? Because we have this whole line of cases that says when it comes to meting out the death penalty, we actually do individualized consideration, and we allow people to make their best case about why they're not eligible for the death penalty. And essentially what your cutoff does is it stops that in its tracks, as to a person who may or may not even have a true IQ of over 70, and let alone it stops people in their tracks who may not be mentally ­­ who may be mentally retarded.",
  "But he doesn't have it with respect to this critical question, right? We've said you cannot execute somebody who is mentally retarded; and he says now you are preventing me from showing you that you're mentally retarded, because you have an IQ test, a part of one prong of the three­prong test, you have an IQ test that says that I'm not mentally retarded, but you know, that IQ test may be wrong. It's not ­­ given that you are not using a margin of error.",
  "But, General, at the very least, you give somebody an IQ test, he scores a 71. Now, he might actually have an IQ of 71, or we know from the way these standard margins of error work, he might have an IQ of 69, and you won't let him go to the adaptive behavior prong of the test and show that, you know, and ­­ and show that he can't function in society in the ways that Atkins seems to care about, as Justice Kennedy says, notwithstanding that this IQ score number might be accurate or might not be.",
  "General.",
  "Could the State change its statute to say we're ­­ we're now using a threshold of 60?",
  "Well, I guess I don't understand it. You have to explain that to me a little bit.",
  "Because I thought that the 70 was ­­ is very longstanding. Everybody has agreed that it's ­­ it's 70 for many, many decades. Maybe ­­ maybe forever. So how could a State ­­ if the State ­­ why could the State say no to that? What would you look at?",
  "General, can I just ask ­­",
  "­­ why you have this policy?",
  "Why you have the policy. I mean, is it administrative convenience? Just tell me why you have the policy.",
  "No, no, no. Why you have the 70 threshold.",
  "Well, that's just to say that it would double the number of people eligible, but some of them may be mentally retarded. I mean, presumably we want accurate decisionmaking with respect to this question, don't we?",
  "Who are not mentally retarded if they don't have an IQ score of 70 or below? I mean, you ­­ you don't believe that yourself, right? This is a tool to decide whether somebody is mentally retarded, and it's a tool that functions in one prong of a three­prong test.",
  "Mr. Bash, could I go back to Justice Ginsburg's question, because this is an area in which there's no alternative way really to develop legal standards other than by doing it in these kinds of cases. So if we only focus on the clearly established upon case after case after case, we don't make much progress in actually telling police officers where the line is. So how do we do that? Why shouldn't we do it here? When should we do it?",
  "Mr. Bash, could I ask you a question? Putting aside the \"clearly­established\" prong and if you were just looking at the reasonableness of this conduct straight, the Fourth Amendment violation, two factors, and tell me how the government thinks they both play. One is the degree of force involved, the fact that 15 point­blank shots were fired, and the other is what Justice Kennedy referred to before, the passenger in the car. So how do those two factors play in the Fourth Amendment question?",
  "It is a little bit weird. But as I understand the way the lower courts have done this is to say that the passenger actually doesn't have a Fourth Amendment claim, so there is a \"shock the conscience\" test, which is, of course, a very high standard.",
  "The degree of force.",
  "Mr. Smith ­­",
  "Mr. Mosley, just out of curiosity, does ­­ does this police department actually have rules for what a police officer is supposed to do when there's a fleeing vehicle? Were they ­­ were they acting in accordance or not in accordance with certain rules that the police department had?",
  "What were they? I mean, I don't know, and I ­­",
  "Mr. Streett, that argument, of course, is just an argument that Basic was wrong in ­­ in ­­ in not focusing on ­­ on Section 18, and that's contestable. One could say actually, they were right not to focus on Section 18, Section 9 is the closer analog. But let's put that aside. Are you just saying Basic is wrong, or are you saying that something has changed since Basic? Because usually that's what we look for when we decide whether to reverse a case, something that makes the question fundamentally different now than when we decided it. And that's especially so in a case like this one where Congress has had every opportunity, and has declined every opportunity, to change Basic itself. So what has changed, in your view?",
  "What is your third?",
  "You said three. What is your third?",
  "So ­­ so you are not relying anymore on the notion that the efficient markets hypothesis has been undermined. That is not one of the three points that you're making because, essentially, I think you ­­ you admit this in your reply brief. You just say Halliburton has never said that market prices ­­ has never contested that market prices generally respond to new material information. So you are agreeing with that, that market prices generally do respond to new material information.",
  "Well, but we don't have that kind of binary approach. What we allow plaintiffs to do is to try to establish a presumption, which they do by showing that a particular market is efficient, and then we allow defendants to rebut that presumption. So there's no binary on/off switch. It's actually ­­ it's a presumption, but it's quite dependent on the facts in a particular case as to whether there's an exception to this general rule that market prices, in fact, do generally respond to new material information.",
  "Could you explain ­­",
  "Now, we've required them to be considered because ­­",
  "Mr. Streett, there's a ­­ there's a real difference with respect to those issues and I think that this was really what Amgen said. It said that when you rule on those things, it essentially splits up the class so that different members of the class are left in very different positions; but that when you rule on a question like materiality, which leaves all members of the class in the exact same position, either with a viable claim or with no claim, and it doesn't split the class in the way that the efficient markets theory do, that's the difference. And here ­­ and this goes back to Justice Sotomayor's question ­­ I just don't see how this splits the class at all, because if you can't prove price impact, you can't prove loss causation and everybody's claims die.",
  "Well, I think that the ­­ that the difference is that even if you don't have market efficiency and so you lose the ability to bring the ­­ a claim with the fraud­on­the­market presumption, you might still have an individual reliance claim.",
  "Mr. Stewart, can I just ­­ can I ask a more general question? You're representing the SEC here, the principal regulators of the securities markets and the securities industry. So if ­­ I guess it's a two­part question. If Basic were overruled, what is ­­ what is the view as to what ­­ how that would affect the securities industry and how it would affect individual decision making with respect to securities? And same question for, if the law professors' position was adopted.",
  "Well, at the very least, Mr. Shanmugam, it's a one­way ratchet. You absolutely cannot add to these funds; is that correct?",
  "I mean, that seems like a strange feature of a retirement fund, that you can't add to the fund and that, moreover, you have to deplete the fund at least to a certain amount. It may not be the whole thing. You may try to keep it as a retirement fund in order to get tax savings, tax benefits for it, but at least in part you're going to have to deplete the fund. You can't add to it. That doesn't seem like a retirement fund in people's natural understanding of the language.",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, can I go back to Justice Kennedy's statement, because I wasn't quite sure I understood your answer. He asked why did they use this retirement ­­ \"retirement funds\" phrase at all and you said, well, just in case Congress adds something later to these sections. And then you thought that there was a second point, too. And what was the second point?",
  "Well, why would that be important to Congress, that it wanted to clarify the purpose of the provision, if you're saying that everything that was currently in, that was currently ­­ that currently received tax protection in these sections, counted?",
  "Please. I'm sorry.",
  "Can I go back to your initial point, and just ­­ I mean, it seems to me that these are kind of hybrids. You were saying, oh, they are nothing like retirement accounts for the ­­ for the reasons that you gave. But they are something like retirement accounts, which is that they are tax­deferred and that there is an enormous incentive for people actually to try to use them as retirement accounts to the extent that they don't have current pressing needs. So, you know, given that, why shouldn't ­­ given the sort of half and half, why shouldn't we just treat them as retirement accounts, if nothing else for, than for administrative simplicity?",
  "Yes, but in a case in which one inherits one of these things as a young person or even as a middle­aged person, they actually ­­ to the extent that you don't take the option to take it out at once, it really looks like a retirement account to a person. So I just did some back­of­the­envelope calculations. Suppose you inherit a $200,000 IRA. Looks to me as though you're going ­­ at the age of about 50 or so. Looks to me you're going to get a check for about $5,000 a year, and your account can grow far more than that. So it ends up sort of looking like one's retirement portfolio.",
  "Ms. Spinelli, here's one thing that's a little bit perplexing to me. These are not arcane accounts. Tons and tons of people have IRAs and they die every day, and then they're inherited IRAs. So, I mean, this is something that applies to masses of people, and it seems to me that if ­­ if Congress meant to exclude these inherited IRAs, why wouldn't it have said so? This is not like a hidden thing and then all of a sudden you realize, oh, that was there. We should have said something about it. And this is ­­ this is pretty obvious that an enormous number of people are going to have these accounts and you write language that suggests because of the listing of the sections, that these are ­­ you know, these accounts are in those sections, why wouldn't have Congress done something more explicit to exclude them?",
  "Well, that's at the least a very ambiguous way to exclude them. Then we have to get into this whole question of what did they mean when they said retirement funds? Are these retirement funds? In what way are they retirement funds? I mean, that's pretty ­­",
  "Can ­­ can I go back to the language?",
  "The retirement funds, your definition of retirement funds, are there any retirement funds that do not fall within the denominated sections under your definition?",
  "Well, then what's the \"to the extent that\" language doing there?",
  "Because that does seem a kind of narrowing language, but ­­",
  "­­ on your objective test, there would be nothing to narrow.",
  "I'm sorry. I didn't get that. Because lawyers to the extent that they are women, does seem ­­ it's saying, you know, we have this big category, it's lawyers, and now we have a smaller category, which is women lawyers, so the \"to the extent that\" takes you from the big category to the small category.",
  "Well, I mean, just take one of the things that Justice Sotomayor asked about, which is vaccinations, because there are many people who have religious objections to vaccinations. So suppose an employer does and ­­ and refuses to fund or wants not to fund vaccinations for her employees, what ­­ what happens then?",
  "Blood transfusions?",
  "So really, every medical treatment. And Justice Sotomayor is quite right that there are quite a number of medical treatments that difference religious groups object to. So one religious group could opt out of this and another religious group could opt out of that and everything would be piecemeal and nothing would be uniform.",
  "Mr. Clement, isn't this a special kind of statute? Because this is a statute that specifically refers back to a body of constitutional law. It basically says we want to get right back to the place that we were with respect to religious claims before Employment Division v. Smith. And so we have ­­ it's not ­­ you know, it's a statute that directs us to a body of constitutional law. That body of constitutional law is, I think, very different from the one you portray in your brief. It suggests that accommodations should be made sometimes, but rarely, and subject to a ­­ to a balancing analysis, not to a compelling interest standard in the way we would use it for, say, race discrimination. So, you know, what's ­­ what's the response to that?",
  "Well, it is applying the statute as written. The statute as written ­­ this is not a question of legislative history ­­ the statute as written points back to pre­Smith law. It says: That's what we mean.",
  "But, again, Mr. Clement as Justice Ginsburg said, this was a very uncontroversial law. Your understanding of this law, your interpretation of it, would essentially subject the entire U.S. Code to the highest test in constitutional law, to a compelling interest standard. So another employer comes in and that employer says, I have a religious objection to sex discrimination laws; and then another employer comes in, I have a religious objection to minimum wage laws; and then another, family leave; and then another, child labor laws. And all of that is subject to the exact same test which you say is this unbelievably high test, the compelling interest standard with the least restrictive alternative.",
  "Well, she had an understanding of how the Court worked pre­Smith that was a kind of Sherbert v. Verner­Yoder understanding, which was we did a balancing, we looked at the government's interests, we took those very seriously, especially to the extent that there was harm to identifiable third parties and that it fell on an identifiable third party. That was basically ­­ you could not get an accommodation for that kind of harm.",
  "Well, with respect, Mr. Clement, I think that that's probably because the Court has had a different understanding of what RFRA does and the kind of analysis that it requires courts to perform than you're arguing for in this case. That if your argument were adopted and there was a strict scrutiny standard of the kind that usually applies and a least restrictive alternative requirement, then you would see religious objectors come out of the woodwork with respect to all of these laws. And because you say that there ­­ and I think this is absolutely right when you say it ­­ that you ­­ you cannot test the centrality of a belief to a religion, you cannot test the sincerity of religion. I think a court would be, you know ­­ their hands would be bound when faced with all these challenges if your standard applies.",
  "No, I don't think that that's the same thing, Mr. Clement. There's one penalty that is if the employer continues to provide health insurance without this part of the coverage, but Hobby Lobby could choose not to provide health insurance at all. And in that case Hobby Lobby would pay $2,000 per employee, which is less than Hobby Lobby probably pays to provide insurance to its employees. So there is a choice here. It's not even a penalty by ­­ in the language of the statute. It's a payment or a tax. There's a choice. And so the question is, why is there a substantial burden at all?",
  "No, between paying $2,000 per employee per year if Hobby Lobby does not provide ­­",
  "You know, Hobby Lobby is paying something right now for the ­­ for the coverage. It's less than what Hobby Lobby is paying for the coverage. There are employers all over the United States that are doing this voluntarily because they think that it's less.",
  "Well, let's say that that's right. Let's say that they have to increase the wages a little bit. I mean, still we are talking about pretty equivalent numbers. Maybe it's a little bit less; maybe it's a little bit more. But this is not the kind of thing that's going to drive a person out of business. It's not prohibitive. It's like the thing that we talked about in Braunfeld where we said, you know, maybe if the store can't stay open 7 days a week, it makes a little bit less money. But so be it, is what we said.",
  "But Mr. Clement, it's not saying you must do something that violates your religion. It's giving you a choice. You can do this thing or if this thing violates your religion you can do another thing. And that other thing is approximately the same price as the thing that you don't want to do.",
  "Can I ask ­­",
  "But, Mr. Clement, you're not saying, are you, that their religious beliefs mandate them to provide health care? I thought that you were never making that claim.",
  "You know, I'm sure they seem like very good employers. And I'm sure they want to be good employers. But again, that's a different thing than saying that their religious beliefs mandate them to provide health insurance, because here Congress has said that the health insurance that they're providing is not adequate, it's not the full package.",
  "Well, but I think even ­­",
  "­­ that example, you know, initially Title VII did not apply to any employers with fewer than 25 employees. And then gradually, Congress brought the number down because Congress realized that there were going to be transition issues and that some time was needed to make sure that the compelling interest, you know, should be applied uniformly across all employers.",
  "I mean, Mr. Clement, isn't that just a way of saying that you think that this isn't a good statute, because it asks one person to subsidize another person. But Congress has made a judgment and Congress has given a statutory entitlement and that entitlement is to women and includes contraceptive coverage. And when the employer says, no, I don't want to give that, that woman is quite directly, quite tangibly harmed.",
  "Isn't that a merits question, General? I mean, I totally understand that argument as a ­­ as an argument about the merits. I'm not sure I understand it as a threshold claim that this ­­ that the claim is not recognizable at all.",
  "Well, do you agree with that, Mr. Gershengorn? Because you have these hypotheticals in the last page of your brief where you say that a complaint could survive a motion to dismiss if the Secret Service members had, you know, announced, had admitted that they had an intention to discriminate or if they had told the local police that. So I took what you were saying there to say, if there is evidence of a very clear nature, that it was all about animus and it was nothing about security, then the complaint would survive.",
  "Mr. Gershengorn, suppose that we changed the facts here and that both the pro­Bush demonstrators and the anti­Bush demonstrators were in the same place and they were at the foot of the alleyway, so that there was an objective security rationale, but that the Secret Service members ­­ and they were in all respects the same except that they had different signs. Some signs say the President is great and some signs say the President is terrible. And the Secret Service members had only removed the ones with the signs that said the President is terrible. So what would your analysis of that be, both under the clearly established, but also, I want you to get to what you think the law is there.",
  "I think you're changing my hypothetical, or let me just explain my hypothetical.",
  "I put them both at the foot of the alleyway because that meant that both have a straight shot, you know, that they can throw a grenade into the patio, which is, I take it, what the nature of your objective security consideration is. So that's true of both of them. But you only move the ones that say the President is terrible.",
  "But just ­­ just tell me what your answer to that case is. What do you think ­­",
  "And do you think it would be unlawful? Forget clearly established.",
  "I said both can throw a grenade into the patio area, but in fact you only remove the people who have the anti­President sign ­­",
  "­­ notwithstanding that the security consideration applies to both equally.",
  "No, that is.",
  "I mean, suppose I add to my hypothetical and I say ­­ and the Secret Service goes to the local police and says ­­ and, you know, doesn't talk about grenades at all and really just says we have got to get these anti­President people out of here because they're annoying the President; let's do it right now, and that's what they do.",
  "Well, there is one. I mean, there is one in a sense of as we look back, we can see that there's an alleyway and that somebody could have a grenade, but there is evidence that that's not at all what was in the heads of the Secret Service members.",
  "Mr. Wilker, do you concede that, looking back on this just in a hindsight kind of way, that there is an objective security rationale here, that they are standing at the foot of the alleyway, that you could throw a grenade into the patio area? Do you concede that just looking at the situation and not thinking, not taking into account any evidence of what was in their heads, that there in fact is an objective security rationale for moving people from this area?",
  "Mr. Wilker, sorry to take you back to this, but in this ­­",
  "­­ case, do you concede that a reasonable officer, even if not these officers, these officers might have had a terrible motivation, but that a reasonable officer could look at this map and say, look at the distance between the alley and the outdoor patio, you can throw an explosive in there, that seems really bad, let's get these people out of the way? Could a reasonable officer have said that?",
  "I'm not sure I understand that, because it seems to me there either is or isn't a valid security interest. Now, whether they acted because of that valid security interest is, of course, a different question, and you might say, well, there was a valid security interest, but that's not why they acted. But as to the first question, I mean, there either is one or there isn't one, no? And we look at it and we say, what would a reasonable police officer think of the security interest here? What would a reasonable police officer do? Would he clear this area or not?",
  "Mr. Phillips, could you ­­ could you disaggregate your argument for me? Because you just said, look, this Court has said it's not sufficient if you have an idea and then you say use a computer to implement it; right? So are you saying that your ­­ that ­­ are you saying that you're doing more than saying use a computer to implement it or are you saying that it's ­­ that the idea itself is more than an idea?",
  "Which part of what ­­",
  "So putting the computer stuff aside completely ­­",
  "­­ you're saying that you've invented something or you ­­",
  "There is something that you've patented that has ­­ that is not just simple use a third party to do a settlement.",
  "And what is that, putting the computer aside?",
  "Well, how are you saying the how? Because I thought that your computers ­­ that your patents really did just say do this on a computer, as opposed to saying anything substantive about how to do it on a computer.",
  "Can I give you a hypothetical, Mr. Phillips, and you tell me how it's different or the same? Let's say, you know, 30 years somebody took a look around the world and said, a lot of people seem to order products by mail. They get the catalogues in the mail and then they send back their return forms. And let's say that one of the founders of the Internet said, wouldn't this be an amazing system, we could actually do this by computer, and they had patented that. Is that the same?",
  "No, but exactly. I mean, the claim would have said something along the lines of, you know, there's this process by which people order products and we want to do it over the Internet, we want to do it electronically, and we will use a computer to do that, to essentially take the process of mail order catalogues and make it electronic.",
  "Mr. Perry, before we get back to these matters, just, you said to Justice Scalia if a patent sufficiently describes how a computer will implement an idea then it's patentable. So how sufficiently does one have to describe it? What do we want a judge to do at this threshold level in terms of trying to figure out whether the description is sufficient to get you past it?",
  "You're not suggesting that specific code is necessary?",
  "Should we be concerned, Mr. Perry, that there are old patents that in fact could meet the test that you set forth but won't because they were written in a different time and so used much more general language?",
  "One understanding of what led to this statute is this Court's decision in Maze, which actually seems on all fours with this case, right? Use of a fraudulent credit card to a merchant who then asks for money from the bank. Essentially the same case as this with a fraudulent credit card as opposed to a fraudulent check. So if we understand this statute as arising from Congress's desire to make that bank fraud, why should we rule for you here?",
  "What's the theory behind that? Why would presenting an altered check to a third party constitute sufficient evidence of intent to defraud a bank?",
  "But, Mr. Yang, your interpretation of the statute goes far beyond Maze. Maze was something with a fraudulent credit card or forged check or something like that, but if I understand your interpretation of the statute, you know, if I sell a painting to somebody and I represent it to be by a famous artist and in fact I've just made it in my kitchen, and that person pays me with a check and it's a perfectly valid check, it's a good check, the fraud is obviously as to the person who's just bought the painting. It has nothing to do with the bank. But your interpretation would cover that case as well.",
  "And it's just a little bit peculiar, right? I mean, if somebody pays me in cash, the government can't prosecute the person. If somebody pulls out a check, the government can, but that doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense in terms of what the statute is about.",
  "And what does that mean, Mr. Yang? I mean, it could mean that the ­­ that the defendant intends that the money come from the bank, or you could mean that the defendant intends to obtain money which he knows may or is reasonably likely to or is foreseeable to come from the bank. Which do you mean?",
  "Well, I think this does go back to Justice Alito's question, because the person can say ­­ the defendant here could have said, I really don't care whether the bank ends up paying Target. I don't know whether the bank will end up paying Target. I don't know how these things work and how often the bank honors it and how often the bank doesn't honor it. And I really could not care less as long as I get my money from Target.",
  "No, but ­­ so you're saying that my person ­­ forget the other examples. I mean, you're saying that this person who could not care less if the money comes from the bank and actually thinks that the money may not come from the bank because it's quite likely that the bank is not going to honor this, you think, nonetheless, that that person has intended to obtain bank property?",
  "Can I just make sure I ­­ I understand your ­­ your answer to my question. Suppose that this defendant did not return the merchandise for cash. In other words, suppose he just wanted an Xbox and he did the exact same thing. So he never himself wanted cash and, again, could not have cared at all whether the bank was going to give the vendor cash. Still, you would say that person intended to obtain bank property?",
  "Mr. Yang, your first order argument, which is, you know, the natural way one would read a statute that says \"(1) or (2),\" is to interpret it as meaning two different things.",
  "But that requires us to read it differently from the way we read the exact same words, without the numbers, but the exact same words in McNally. And we know that Congress wanted the bank fraud statutes to mirror the mail and wire fraud statutes. So we end up with this ­­ you know, if we ­­ if we go with your friend over there, we read a statute in a way we wouldn't normally. But if we go with you, we have to read these two statutes that say the same thing and that we know Congress meant to say the same thing differently.",
  "Well, how can that intent difference be significant? I mean, I would have thought that you would said the same proof that goes to whether you intend to obtain bank property, even though you're presenting this check only to a third party, and the check may or may not be honored by the bank. You could say the exact same thing about whether you intend to defraud the bank.",
  "But why isn't that the same under the intent to obtain bank property? Where you also, the defendant, might say: No, I really didn't intend to obtain property, because I didn't really know whether the bank would honor the check and, in fact, I thought it wouldn't.",
  "But even on the obtain property wing, it's obtain property from the bank, isn't it?",
  "Well, in the custody of the bank?",
  "No, but in a case like this, wouldn't the difficulties of proof be the same? The person ­­ whether you charge somebody with trying to defraud the bank or with trying to obtain property owned by or in the custody of the bank. If Justice Alito is right as to the one, that all these questions about the relationship between a bank and a retailer are going to come in, isn't he also right as to the other?",
  "Mr. Long, I think it ­­",
  "But ­­ but there are occasions, Mr. Long, outside of that very narrow category of cases that you define in which the stock is going to be way, way, way, overvalued relative to what the fiduciaries know is the company's actual value. Let's just say it ­­ the ­­ the market price is four times more than the actual value, and the fiduciaries know that because of inside information that they have. It just sort of defies language to say that some ­­ a prudent person would retain the investment in that kind of wildly overvalued stock, doesn't it?",
  "No. But I'm talking about a case in which the fiduciary has inside information that ­­ that ­­ that enables him to know that the stock price is way overvaluing the actual value of the company.",
  "Well, I ­­ I suppose it could, but a prudent manager might say that it would do greater damage to the ­­ to the participants in the plan to enable this misinformation to exist and to keep putting ­­ to keep buying stock, to keep putting more and more of their retirement investments into something that is really overvalued.",
  "Well, you assume that truthful information will out in the end, and is it better to keep on putting more money into something that is ­­ is ­­ you know, is really not a good investment for the participants and the beneficiaries?",
  "But even in saying that, Mr. Long, you have a category where you would say the duty of prudence applies, and it's this category of where the company is on the verge of collapse. But even there, you would face the exact same securities law problems that you're ­­ that you're saying should preclude ­­",
  "­­ the government's test. Because there, too, you would have this kind of, I don't know what to do, I'm between a rock and a hard place, the securities laws prevent me from selling on inside information. The same problems apply.",
  "Well, then, what if the ­­",
  "Justice Kennedy's question, I think, was different. He said, suppose that it said you are required to use this label and only this label, then you would acknowledge that there is an impossibility issue; is that right?",
  "Why isn't there a different kind of conflict here? Let's just focus on the name, which is what the solicitor general says the FDA has considered and has specifically permitted. They went through this very long and involved process, and they decided exactly what kind of names were permitted for this kind of product and what were not permitted, because they constituted misbranding. And essentially the FDA has said, This is what counts as misbranding, nothing else counts as misbranding. And now you're coming in and under a Lanham Act claim saying, no, the FDA is wrong. This is misbranding. That seems ­­ why isn't that a problem?",
  "Yeah. That the FDA said it's not misbranding, you're saying it is misbranding. That seems a quite direct conflict as to what the FDA says versus what you are alleging under the Lanham Act.",
  "Well, just hypothetically, let's say that the FDA said that this name was not misbranding, that this name was fine under their regulations, that they did not count as misbranding.",
  "Right. So I understand that, you would have some claims about different parts of the label. But I'm only asking about your claiming as ­­ your claim as to the specific thing that the FDA ruled on.",
  "Ms. Sherry, you know, there is no irreconcilable conflict if we view what the FDA has done as just setting a floor. And you talk a lot about how, oh, the FDA specifically considered this and it decided not to do this. You put a lot of emphasis on process. And I guess my question to you is, is that the way you are saying we should know whether the FDA has only set a floor or instead has also set a ceiling, that we're supposed to look to the process and figure out whether the FDA specifically rejected a more extensive proposal, a more aggressive proposal?",
  "Well, I guess I don't understand that. Why wouldn't it complement? You've said here is the floor to make it not misleading, but, you know, we are not saying that there are some things that, you know, wouldn't mislead a lot of consumers anyway, and then the Lanham Act can come in and supplement that and really put us in a position where nothing is misleading at all.",
  "Well, why can't it be? I mean, there are plenty of statutes which say you can't bring State law or Federal law claims. Congress knows how to do that. And instead, it said you can only not bring State law claims.",
  "They just say no claims or no ­­ notwithstanding any law to the contrary.",
  "Ms. Sullivan, can I ask ­­ if this gets you away from the argument you want to make, I apologize for that. But suppose we thought that the preemption provision here was utterly irrelevant, that it applies to state law and not Federal law, and that you can't go around broadening the statute just because the purposes behind that statute might be thought to apply to something else. So suppose I just put that aside. Do you still have any kind of argument?",
  "Do you think, Ms. Sullivan, that there are any Lanham suits regarding food labels that are allowable?",
  "But, Mr. Waxman, I take it that Ms. Sherry said that the FDA views itself as having a job beyond health and safety, that they view themselves as at least ­­ not thinking about competitors' welfare or lack thereof, but at least thinking about consumer understanding of labels. under the Lanham Act different from the determination under the FDCA?",
  "Mr. Kneedler, can I take you back to a question, I think it was Justice Alito who asked it. Assume that there was a suit between private parties and the private party that won the judgment thought that there were assets abroad. Do you have any question that the discovery rules would allow for discovery of what the person had abroad?",
  "But that's ­­ if you think that Rule 69 allows that, I mean, my next question was going to be what in the text would put a foreign government in a different position than the ­­ than when the suit involved only private parties?",
  "What in the text ­­ what in the text puts you in a different position ­­ if you have that view of 69, which extends abroad as well as within the United States, what in the text would suggest that we're not under that rule?",
  "Mr. Olson, can I just make sure I understand the scope of your argument? I mean, suppose there were some countries that executed on assets that in the United States would be nonexecutable. So suppose there were some countries that would execute on military assets or diplomatic assets or so forth. And somebody came into a U.S. court and said I want discovery about those assets, because after all, they are going to let me execute ­­ these other countries are going to let me execute on them. It's in aid of the judgment, so it fits within the discovery rules. What should the United States say to a ­­ a United States court say to a request like that, fine?",
  "If you win on the categorical question that's presented here, do you think it's still open to Argentina to go back to the district court and to say, modify your ruling for this or that privilege reason or because the order is overinclusive or any of these more prudential considerations.",
  "Mr. ­­ please.",
  "Is ­­ is your argument dependent on the following two facts: The first that there was a probable cause determination, and the second that the Susan Anthony group and the other group wanted to repeat the exact same statement? Are those the two things that ­­ that ground your argument?",
  "So if ­­ I'm sorry.",
  "But that would suggest something even broader. That would suggest that even in the first instance, before the probable cause determination was made, Susan Anthony would know that it's going to be speaking about a very controversial subject in which some people will think it's telling the truth and other people will think it's lying, and that there's a very good chance that somebody is going to bring this to the Commission. So that would suggest that they have standing even at that moment before the initial probable cause determination is made.",
  "Well, what would happen, Mr. Feigin, what would happen if a candidate knew ­­ it seems actually quite plausible that Representative Driehaus would know ­­ that this was something that Susan Anthony or some other like group would talk about in his campaign, and he were to write letters to all these groups saying, if you start advertising in this way, if you put up billboards, I'm going to take you before the Ohio Commission. Would that be sufficient?",
  "I'm not sure I understood that. Is it sufficient that somebody has said, I'm going to bring an action against ­­ before the Commission, but there's been no prior Commission determination as to this speech. And it's just somebody saying, I'm going to go to the Commission and raise this with them if you start speaking in this way. Would that present a credible threat?",
  "Now, take it just a step further. Surely, there are some kinds of statements or ­­ I don't know. Maybe \"surely\" is the wrong word. Are there some kinds of statements where, even though the ­­ the representative doesn't say, I'm going to do this, you know that somebody is going to do this, whether the representative or somebody else? It's the kind of statement that, given this process, it's just going to require too much fortitude to resist the temptation to bring this in front of this Commission.",
  "Well, I'm not sure it's a reputational harm. I mean, why isn't, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, the relevant harm the probable cause determination itself? There are voters out there and they don't know that probable cause is such a low bar as you describe it. They think probable cause means you probably lied, and that seems a reasonable thing for them to think and that's a relevant harm and we should just ­­ you know, we don't even need the prosecution to serve as the relevant harm. That seems quite enough.",
  "Well, but how would you get into Federal court? I mean, your own office expresses grave concern about the constitutionality of this statute. So that suggests somebody should be able to get into Federal court to do this. But I don't see a way where you would allow a pre­enforcement challenge. One would have to go through the entire process and get to the end of it and get a judgment to enable a challenge under your theory; is that right?",
  "Well, that's something else before you get to Justice Sotomayor's second half of the question, but something more along the lines of providing hardware. Suppose a company just gave the antenna and a hard drive, that's what they sold to the user, and the user was able to use the antenna and the hard drive in her own house or apartment in order to get all these broadcast programs. What would the ­­ would that be a performance?",
  "But then it really does depend on, like, where the ­­ where the hardware is. In other words, if ­­ if Aereo has the hardware in its warehouse as opposed to Aereo selling the hardware to the particular end user, that is going to make all the difference in the world as to whether we have a public performance or not a public performance.",
  "So you think that in my hypo, there's a performance, but it's a private performance and then you move the hardware and it becomes a public performance. Is that it?",
  "But what if, Mr. Clement, it's not so simple as a company that just allows you yourself to put something up there? What if ­­ how about there are lots of companies where many, many thousands or millions of people put things up there, and then they share them, and the company in some ways aggregates and sorts all that content. Does that count?",
  "Can I ask my same question to you that I asked to Mr. Clement? How about if there's a company that allows sharing and that aggregates all the content that different individual users put up and that in some sense sort of sorts and classifies the content in different ways? How about that?",
  "But, Mr. Frederick, it's also ­­ it's also no different from ­­ from a user's perspective, it's exactly the same as if I'm watching cable. Right? You just have a different content selection, but it looks the same to you. Somebody else is providing you with a menu, and then you pick off that menu.",
  "Mr. Frederick, why isn't it sufficient to create a line such as the one Mr. Clement said, which said, you know, do you on the one hand supply or provide the content, that puts you in one box; on the other hand, if you are not supplying or providing the content, if the user is supplying and providing the content, and you are just providing the space, a kind of platform for them to do that and for them potentially to share the content, that puts you in another box?",
  "Can I ­­ can I ask, Ms. Harrington, in the 11 circuits that follow what you think is the right approach, what actually happens? How often do courts ask IRS agents to come in and to give testimony about why they're ­­ why they've issued a summons?",
  "Ms. Harrington, can I go back? You said it's rare. Does that mean it's really ­­ it never happens?",
  "So could you say a little bit more, Ms. Harrington, about what ­­ what kind of evidence would overcome the presumption in a particular case?",
  "Why would it have wanted to do that and not also get rid of the statute of repose? I mean, presumably the idea is you should have some chance to sue after you've discovered the injury and the cause of the injury. And if here, the statute of repose is preventing that, why would Congress have wanted to modify a statute of limitations but not get rid of the statute of repose?",
  "But, Mr. Murray, in Justice Scalia's example, what in the text would prevent you from treating that ­­ the single statute, which is written as a statute of repose, what in the text is preventing you from saying that the statute applies to it?",
  "Right.",
  "But I think you're ­­ you're messing with the hypothetical now. I mean, assume that the statute of repose is all there is. Now, in fact, you're not going to get any suits because nobody is going to know that they're injured until they know that they're injured. But why wouldn't that be the commencement date is the thing that triggers the statute of repose, the last act or omission, and ­­ and the applicable limitations period is the 10 years?",
  "Well, but in general, Mr. Murray, I think Justice Scalia is right, that, in general, Congress hasn't made this distinction. In general, this Court has not made this distinction. In general, I think this goes back to ­­ to Justice Ginsburg's point. The purpose behind this law, clearly, it doesn't matter either ­­ I mean, either way. If Congress wanted to make sure that people could sue after discovering their injury, a statute of repose prevents that, as well as a statute of limitations does. And yet you are asking us to imagine a Congress that has this very much in ­­ in its head, both the difference between these two things, and you said the reason that they wanted only to alter the one and not to alter the other is because they thought of the statute of repose as impinging on a State's constitutional prerogatives. Now, that's a very legally sophisticated Congress you're asking us to imagine.",
  "You know, to understand this distinction and then to say, oh, yes, look, the statute of repose is really an interference with substantive liability in a way that the statute of limitations is not and that might raise constitutional avoidance issues. I mean, I think that's ­­ that's ­­ that's pretty sophisticated stuff.",
  "I think what ­­ at least what I take from Justice Scalia's question is that if you think of the ­­ if you imagine ­­ and you're quite right that this doesn't exist in the real world ­­ but if you imagine a statute of repose existing independently, it actually would fit the language of this statute quite, you know, fine. The commencement date would be different. It would not be the date of accrual. It would be the date of the defendant's last act, but still the statute would work perfectly well. And I suppose if you think that, then ­­ then in a case in which there was both, the question would be why wouldn't you just apply this statute to both?",
  "Mr. Palmore, what do you think the commencement date in this case was?",
  "But how could that be the beginning of the period during which his suit may be brought? I mean, he couldn't bring suit on that date.",
  "It seems something sort of internally contradictory in your interpretation here.",
  "Do you ­­ is your understanding of the operation of this statute is the applicable limitations period ­­ do you see the statute as applying seriatim first to the statute of limitations and then to the statute of repose, or is the applicable limitations period the period that you can sue when you combine those two?",
  "No, here.",
  "Yes, I just want to know how do you apply this statute to what we have here?",
  "Is there a single applicable limitations period which represents the period when, given both clauses, you can sue, or are you saying that there are two applicable limitations periods?",
  "But I mean, I take it, Mr. Korzen, that your argument is a little bit different. I mean, it seems Justice Scalia would have a point if it just said if the limitations period. Your argument is that you put in the word \"applicable\" and it actually makes the statute read a little bit differently. It suggests that there are plural limitations period and the one that this provision applies to is whichever one happens to be applicable as you apply the provision.",
  "But it seems an awfully strange way to abolish a repose period, right? I mean, one way to abolish a repose period is just to abolish a repose period. Another way is to say what Congress seems to have said here, which is move the first date of the period of repose up to a new Federal commencement date so that the period of repose wholly ­­ is wholly redundant as to the limitations period. Now, that's a kind of strange way to do a pretty simple thing, isn't it?",
  "The ­­ the quotation that the Chief Justice read to you from the Solicitor General's brief referred to the use of prosecution history. Do you agree with the Solicitor General about that use, about the permissibility of that use?",
  "Why doesn't that ­­",
  "Why didn't the patent provide more specificity as to the exact spacing?",
  "Doesn't Markman exist for a different purpose? I thought that Markman existed in order to explain things to a lay juror or a lay judge. Why should the Markman test be used in this context, where we're trying to figure out a different question entirely?",
  "What do you think of this Chevron analogy, Mr. Gannon? Because sometimes we do say something close to it's a tie. We say there are a couple of reasonable constructions or a number of reasonable constructions. We could pick one, we think it might be better, but it's all close enough that we don't think we ought to pick one. So similarly, it's all close enough that the definiteness requirement has not been met. Is that a good analogy?",
  "No. I'm not sure I quite got that. It's just that anything that would flunk Chevron step one and would go on to Chevron step two, you would say that that kind of ambiguity, the kind of ambiguity ­­",
  "­­ that would get you to Chevron step two ­­",
  "­­ is also the kind of ambiguity that would fail to satisfy the definiteness ­­",
  "Well, why should we get to that question? It wasn't decided below. It's their law. Why shouldn't we kick it back to the Eleventh Circuit?",
  "My mistake.",
  "But if the subpoena is not to the government and if the subpoena is just to the particular person? What are the ­­ what's the context in which that person should not receive a minimum of protection subject to Pickering balancing, but that that should be ­­ why not consider that protected?",
  "Well, Mr. Gershengorn, could I ask the question that I tried and failed to ask Mr. Singh? Because Justice Breyer is, of course, completely right. This footnote 2 doesn't really answer the question. It answers it on a hypothesis that the constitutional issue came out in a certain way, and then it said, a fortiori there is immunity. So it didn't really ­­ if there was a different decision as to the constitutional question, it didn't answer the question of qualified immunity. And, of course, it's Eleventh Circuit law. Why would we be deciding it.",
  "But are you suggesting that when somebody learns something from his job, that that means it's not speech by a citizen?",
  "No, but when he's using factual matter that he only knows because he's an employee in a particular branch of government.",
  "But then, I mean, we've said several times things like this: Government employees are often in the best position to know what ails the agencies for which they work. In other words, expecting that people will know things because they work in a place and that they can take what they know as a result of working in a place and go out and be a citizen.",
  "But if I could just understand what you're saying. Are ­­ are you saying that, no matter what the employee's official duties are, as long as he gets information because he is a public employee and he is in a workplace, that that's what matters? I mean, I know all kinds of things about a workplace that go beyond exactly what my official responsibilities are. So if I communicate things that I learn in a workplace, but, you know, I have nothing to do with prosecuting corruption or with investigating corruption, do I count as an employee, or do I not count as an employee in that context?",
  "Mr. Fisher, would there be exigencies that would allow police to look at cell phones? And if so, what would those exigencies be?",
  "Mr. Dumont, on your argument and on the government's ­­ the Solicitor General's principal argument, too, a person can be arrested for anything. A person can be arrested for driving without a seat belt. And the police could take that phone and could look at every single e­mail that person has written, including work e­mails, including e­mails to family members, very intimate communications, could look at all that person's bank records, could look at all that person's medical data, could look at that person's calendar, could look at that person's GPS and find out every place that person had been recently because that person was arrested for driving without a seat belt. Now, that strikes me as a very different kind of world than the kind of world that you were describing where somebody has pictures of their family in a billfold. Doesn't it strike you that way?",
  "I don't know why this is a marginal case.",
  "Your argument and the arrest. And it applies to everything on a cell phone. People carry their entire lives on cell phones. That's not a marginal case. That's the world we live in, isn't it?",
  "Well, Mr. Dumont, I guess what I'm trying to suggest to you is that you call it marginal, but, in fact, most people now do carry their lives on cell phones, and that will only grow every single year as, you know, young people take over the world.",
  "I mean, that's not a marginal case. That's what ­­ they're computers. They have as much computing capacity as ­­ as laptops did five years ago. And ­­ and everybody under a certain age, let's say under 40, has everything on them.",
  "Well, suppose I'm carrying my laptop in my backpack.",
  "Well, I don't understand that, Mr. Dumont. Everything ­­",
  "Mr. Dumont ­­",
  "Mr. Dumont, I guess I just don't understand. You said if it could be. I mean, everything could be reduced to a piece of paper. All your bank records, you could have them on you. All your medical records, you could just happen to have them on you. I mean, that would be so of absolutely everything, wouldn't it?",
  "Well, I think that the notion that you could get them legally in some other way has never justified an illegal search otherwise.",
  "Mr. Dumont, is ­­ are you saying, essentially, that nobody has any expectation of privacy, or that somebody has a dramatically reduced expectation of privacy in anything that the person actually wants to keep on them at all times? In other words, one has to keep one's cell phone at home to have an expectation of privacy in it?",
  "Can I ask you a question about that, Mr. Dreeben, because given the variety of things that these cell phones have in them, it seems as though that's ­­ you know, it sounds good as a limiting principle, but it ends up you can imagine in every case that the police could really look at everything. So I'll give you an example. It's sort of like this case. Somebody is arrested for a gun crime and now we're going to look at all the various things that might be related to a gun crime. So whether he's bought guns, whether ­­ you know, what ­­ what ­­ whether he's done searches for gun stores. His e­mails might something say something about gun possession or gun purchase. He might have photographs of him with a gun. You know, the whole range of things could relate to that crime, couldn't it?",
  "Well, they would be looking at the same things, but the whole idea of a warrant is that a neutral magistrate tells you that you can look at those things and has an opportunity to limit it in whatever way the neutral magistrate feels is appropriate ­­",
  "­­ and that's a protection.",
  "But I thought the whole ideas of smartphones, Mr. Dreeben, and increasingly so, was that even the user doesn't know what what's on the cloud or not.",
  "And, Mr. Panner, if they did reach it a second time around and they decided well, now that this inducement theory is not available to us, we think that there is a real problem here, that there is a kind of end run around the patent law and so we're going to change what we think on the 271(a) question, if they did that, would be right to say it would render our opinion on the 271(b) question a nullity?",
  "Yes. I guess the question I'm asking ­­ I mean, I can't think of a way in which our decision on the 271(b) question would be relevant for any case if the Federal Circuit on remand goes the opposite way in a ­­ on the 271(a) question. But maybe I'm not thinking more broadly enough.",
  "Yes. I suppose I just couldn't think of a place where somebody would make the 271(b) claim if the 271(a) claim were available to it.",
  "But I suppose, Mr. Panner, what might make this a little bit different is that notwithstanding what you said about 10 of 11 judges, it was clear that the judges thought that there was a real problem here in terms of an end run, and that they looked at this and said, well we could do it under 271(a) or we could do it under 271(b), and 271(b) seems a lot more natural and better for various reasons. But your sense in reading the opinion that all those judges who did it under 271(b) are just going to go back and do the exact same thing under 271(a).",
  "But in some ways that's why the Federal Circuit did what it did, right? I mean, you can look at the Federal Circuit's ruling and say it makes no sense. How can you induce infringement if there's no infringement in the first place. And that's a very strong argument. But the reason they put this under 271(b) rather than under 271(a) is because of what Justice Scalia said, that 271(b) is not a strict liability offense, and so that you can say, you have to know and you have to have instructed the ­­ the person. So, you know, they thought that they were being very clever by putting it into a 271(b) box and avoiding the strict liability consequences of what they were doing, but also avoiding the possibility of an end run of the patent law.",
  "There is that problem. There is ­­ There is that problem.",
  "And ­­",
  "But, Mr. Waxman, if ­­ if ­­ if we say something about the 271(a) question here, I mean, it does seem as though it's sandbagging Limelight. Limelight did not brief this until you briefed it, so we have part of Limelight's reply brief. None of the amicus knew ­­ the amici knew that it was in the case until you briefed the 271 issue. So that would seem a real problem in getting to the 271 issue here.",
  "That ­­",
  "Mr. Waxman, I think it's a very different situation. I mean, in that case it's clear that there was a kidnapping. It happened to be a kidnapping done by four people rather than a kidnapping done by one person. But there was a kidnapping. Now, in your case, I don't think you can say the same thing because the question is: Is there an infringement? Under Federal Circuit law, there is no infringement when different people do these different steps of the process. That's just the fact of the matter.",
  "But I think again, Mr. Waxman, what ­­ what ­­ what your argument just glides over is that you need the infringement. And the question is whether, under substantive law, you have the infringement when different people do different steps of the process. And as I understand the Federal Circuit's law in this area, it's that you don't have any infringement when different people do different steps of the process. So that takes you back to the 271(a) question, which you think is wrong, but if it's right, you just don't have an argument in the 271(b) question.",
  "Do ­­ do you think that it's the same test? In other words, is the test a specific jurisdiction test here, based­on, arising­from, that we are basically asking the same question as we would be asking if this were a ­­ a foreign corporation?",
  "Well, but why ­­ I mean, it doesn't seem to me that that wording is very different from the wording that we've used in specific jurisdiction cases. The wording here is \"based on\" ­­ we've used \"arising out of.\" Sometimes we've used \"related to.\" In some respects ­­ I mean, it's pretty clear that the FSIA is meant to ensure that when a foreign government is acting as a commercial actor, it gets treated like a foreign corporation. And the language here is very similar, right? There's the insistence on a sufficient contact, a minimum contact, and then there is the insistence on a particular kind of relationship between that contact ­­ contact and the claim. So it seems ­­ I guess the question is: Why should we think of these two questions as at all different? And I don't know, by the way, I mean, that it would hurt you if they were the same, because it might just be there would be no specific jurisdiction here, you know? But I guess I'm having trouble of thinking why it is that there ­­ that there would be a different test.",
  "Would ­­ would you agree and ­­ and, as you've been doing, take out the agency question ­­ but would you agree if ­­ if what had happened here was that the ticket was not honored. You know, the plaintiff bought a ticket, and the ticket was not honored, and ­­ and the suit was where the ticket was purchased, would you agree that that's based­on?",
  "Just a breach of contract case.",
  "In Austria, even though she bought the ticket in the United States? You think even the breach of contract case could not be brought in the United States?",
  "Could you go back and explain to me what ­­ I'm sorry.",
  "Because ­­",
  "But not general jurisdiction.",
  "I was really talking about specific jurisdiction.",
  "And, of course, Justice Scalia is absolutely right with respect to general jurisdiction, that all you look at is the contacts. But with respect to specific jurisdiction ­­ this is a company that doesn't have pervasive contacts ­­",
  "­­ it's critical to the due process analysis that there be a relationship, and a real relationship between the particular contact with the United States and the lawsuit in the exact same way that this statute focuses on. And so, again, I don't know if it hurts you. It might be, as Justice Ginsburg says, that there wouldn't be specific jurisdiction here for a corporation. But ­­ but ­­ but why shouldn't we treat those two things exactly the same way?",
  "Yes. Well, that's an answer for why there is no specific jurisdiction here.",
  "And you can make the exact same answer in the completely private context. And you ­­",
  "­­ could well be right. I'm want to ask Mr. Fisher about that.",
  "But it's not an answer for why the tests should be different.",
  "Well, but how is based­upon different from the language we routinely use in specific jurisdiction cases? In other words, it just seems as though Congress, in line with its objective of treating foreign government engaging in commercial activity in the same way as they would be treated in the foreign corporations case, in line with that objective, used language that's virtually synonymous with the language that we use in specific jurisdiction cases.",
  "So Mr. ­­",
  "In ­­ in my contract hypo, if the ­­ if the suit was a breach of contract action, do you think it would be based­upon? Just a straight, like, you don't ­­ you didn't honor my ticket?",
  "Mr. Kneedler, how about ­­ there is a contract claim in this lawsuit, so there is a ­­ is a kind of warranty of fitness kind of claim. How ­­ how about that? Why ­­ if you think that the ­­ let's assume that the contract claim, which is like you didn't honor my ticket, that there would be personal jurisdiction over, how do we separate out the warranty of habitability or fitness claim?",
  "Is ­­ is that a typical thing ­­",
  "Is that a typical thing or an unusual thing to do in jurisdiction cases? In other words, to say, we're just not going to look at this claim by claim, we're going to ask about the whole gist of the lawsuit.",
  "No, but not for everything. I mean, let's assume this. Let's assume that I get a brochure from the Vienna Opera Company, and I send back the order form, I'd like to buy tickets, okay? Now, for sure, if the Vienna Opera Company refused to honor my tickets, I have a claim, and it arises out of the fact that they have marketed my tickets in the United States. But now they honor my tickets, and I go up the stairs, and I slip in a puddle, and I injure myself. What does that have to do with the only contact that they've in the United States? I mean, at that point, you're just saying it's a but­for test, and everything would be included. But I don't know of a sensible specific jurisdiction analysis that would ­­ that would run like that.",
  "Yes. But in point of fact, that's all OBB does. So, effectively, your argument is an argument that OBB is subject to jurisdiction in a general jurisdiction kind of way with respect to everything that they do. And, you know, I think what the Chief Justice is suggesting is, like, that seems wrong.",
  "Well, if ­­",
  "But if that's true ­­",
  "If that's true, I don't understand why you answered my hypothetical question the way you did, because in my hypothetical question I thought you said that there would not be jurisdiction to sue in the United States when I slip and fall in Vienna. And ­­ but you could make the same argument. Well, there was a duty created in the United States, and that's what I'm suing on.",
  "Well, there's ­­ I mean, the only thing that's happened in the United States is that I've purchased a ticket there. That's ­­ that's what I've done.",
  "So I take it that your argument is that purchase of a ticket gives rise to a duty which is then violated when I slip and fall in another country.",
  "But you also have to have a relationship.",
  "Well, let's say that I don't accept that argument, okay? Let's just for a moment assume that on a straight negligence claim, the idea that a negligence claim arising from an accident in Austria arises ­­ let's say I think it arises from the accident in Austria. It does not arise from the purchase of a ticket in the United States, okay?",
  "Now, I guess there's still a question as to whether your warranty claims ought to be treated differently. And I take it what Mr. Kneedler has said about that is, no, they shouldn't be, that's just fancy pleading, it's just a way of converting a negligence claim into a contract claim. It's the same kind of thing that happened in Nelson that we refused to allow. Why isn't that right?",
  "Why does it matter, if there's always somebody to bring a claim? In what set of cases does the answer to this question matter?",
  "Mr. Fletcher, in ­­ in some ways, the Agency itself has admitted that this is not the most natural reading of the term. When the Agency explained why it was articulating this rule, it said, well, the problem is that Section 706 of the Act confers standing to sue only upon an aggrieved applicant. And so we have to come in and kind of fix that. And ­­ and so, too, the regulation itself talks about applicants and additional parties as though the two are different. And then the regulation, as I think Justice Scalia said, says, well, this ­­ this is our definition of applicant, but it's really only for this purpose, not throughout the statute. And all of those, it seems to me, are quasi­admissions that this is not the most natural way to read the word \"applicant.\"",
  "One of the things that Judge Posner said against your interpretation is that this actually creates liability on a scale that Congress wouldn't have expected because if you are right, the guarantor can come in and ­­ and declare the entire loan invalid, and ­­ and the damages would be much higher than it is for the borrower himself. I mean, what's ­­ what's the answer to that?",
  "Is there an answer? It's just like, well, that's what it is.",
  "Mr. McAllister, I take it if there were two borrowers, you would include both of them, both would have a cause of action?",
  "They're joint applicants.",
  "How about if they're cosigners? I take it that ­­ is ­­ a co­signer is somebody who's jointly and severally liable, but is not himself ­­",
  "­­ receiving the money.",
  "You would ­­ you would count that out.",
  "And this is so even if the cosigner had to file the exact same kind of papers and do everything else that the borrower himself had to do?",
  "So suppose ­­ suppose that I have a credit card, and now I get married, and I'd like a secondary credit card for my spouse, and I apply to the credit card company for a secondary credit card. Who's ­­ who's the applicant there?",
  "So even though I receive no direct benefit, the credit is actually given to my spouse now?",
  "They would effectively become a joint applicant, even though I'm the only one who's filling out the ­­ the ­­ all the papers.",
  "I guess ­­ I guess ­­ you know ­­ and this is a ­­ a functional point for sure. But it doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense that suppose a lender doesn't want to provide credit to a married woman because it has all these sex, gender stereotypes in the lender's head or ­­ and the lender couldn't require that the ­­ that the husband be listed as a ­­ a joint applicant, but could require that the husband be listed as a cosigner, even though the effect of those two things are exactly the same, which is that it's a requirement that the spouse essentially become joint and severally liable for the loan.",
  "Mr. ­­ Mr. McAllister, in Corbin on Contracts, when they talk about guaranties, they say, in most cases of guaranty contracts, the offer comes from the guarantor requesting the giving of credit to a principal debtor. So Corbin on Contracts is ­­ clearly thinks that the guarantor is a requestor, is an applicant for credit, and just to a third­party, to the principal debtor. But why ­­ why ­­ I mean, that's a pretty, you know, credit­specific definition of what it means to apply for credit. And including, pretty clearly, guarantors.",
  "Well, do you think that it's really contingent on that, on exactly which contract you signed? I mean, these folks give you a lot of information, they sign their names to a lot of information, and ­­ I mean, unlike the usual guarantor case where the guarantor is only liable if there's a default, here the guarantor is jointly and severally liable, much like a cosigner is. Or at any rate, cosigners are jointly and severally ­­",
  "And you want to put them in the same box, too. So it doesn't really matter ­­",
  "It doesn't matter.",
  "No. They certainly wouldn't say a borrower is equivalent to a guarantor. But the question is whether an applicant is equivalent to ­­",
  "The entire idea of a guaranty contract, right, why is a guaranty agreement even enforceable? Is it there is consideration, and the consideration has to do with the fact that credit is going to a third­party, right? And so the guarantor is stepping in and saying, I'm asking for something and I'm getting something when I enter into this contract, and that's the credit will go not to me, but to a third party. So the question I think is, like, why should that be, you know ­­ just because it's to a third party, the appeal, the request to the application is as to a third party rather than to yourself, why that should make any difference if the question is just what does applicant mean? Applicant doesn't have to be for yourself.",
  "Well, why isn't that test satisfied here, because the shop owners agreed that Mr. Ocasio would commit every element of the substantive offense?",
  "Well, the ­­ the ­­ Mr. Ocasio is committing every element of the substantive offense. He is obtaining property from another; that is, he's obtaining property from the body shop owners. And the body shop owners agreed that he would do so. So it seems to me that in the normal way that conspiracy law works, there is a conspiracy here.",
  "They only need to agree that he should obtain property from another, and that is exactly what they agreed to.",
  "Well, they're two different words, but the syntactical problem seems to me to be identical, which is that it's just not natural to say that the transported woman is herself transporting any woman, right? I mean, the transported woman is not transporting any woman. But the reason the Court said that a conspiracy was possible there was because the transported woman could agree with another person, let's say, the man, that the man would transport any woman, namely, herself. It's ­­ it's an almost identical syntactical issue.",
  "No, I don't think that's right. The \"from another\" is clearly an element of the substantive offense. But you're saying it should also be a freestanding limit on the conspiracy offense, and there's no reason for that to be true. It is, of course, right that somebody has to obtain property from another, but the conspiracy offense is made out if two people agree that somebody should obtain property from another. And that's exactly the situation here.",
  "They intended and they agreed that Mr. Ocasio should obtain property from another. And that's all they have to do.",
  "It's a statute, and the statute just says the other has to be somebody different from Ocasio himself. So in this particular case, the somebody other is the people who are in the agreement. In another case, the somebody other might be somebody who is outside the agreement. The statute just ­­ the ­­ the substantive law says it has to be from another. The conspiracy ­­ and this is just ­­ it's consistent with Salinas, it's consistent with Holt, it's consistent with everything we've ever said about conspiracy law ­­ is that it just has to be an agreement for somebody to do that substantive offense even if the people agree and can't do it themselves. And it's true, the people agreeing can't do it themselves. They can't obtain property from another. But Mr. Ocasio can, and they're agreeing that he should.",
  "Mr. Davis, if you could go back to what you just said about the consent. I mean, look, I mean, Evans makes perfectly clear that bribes and kickbacks are included in this statute. And ­­ and there is a difference between ­­ there ­­ there are cases in which somebody participates in a kickback scheme and does not consent. I mean, suppose some public official comes in and says, in order for me to give you a license to do something, to be, you know, a member of some profession, let's say a cosmetologist, you need to pay me $20 as a kickback. And the person, you know, pays him $20 because you've got to get your license. But there's no way in the world in which that would count as a conspiratorial agreement. It would count as consent under the Hobbs Act. So there's a big gap between consent and a conspiratorial agreement, even in the context of bribes.",
  "But I ­­ I ­­",
  "So if ­­",
  "If ­­ if I could just understand what you're saying, you think active participation is more than an agreement along the typical conspiracy lines.",
  "Right. But ­­",
  "­­ this does sound more like an aiding and abetting standard than it does a conspiracy standard, because typically in conspiracy we say it doesn't really matter if you actively participate, as long as you reach an agreement.",
  "Now that agreement is more than acquiescence, right? It's more than I reluctantly give you the bribe that you're demanding of me.",
  "But ­­ but I guess I'm with Justice Scalia that I don't really quite understand how to get from the typical real agreement that we require in conspiracy cases to some higher standard with respect to this crime of active participation.",
  "You had no other substantive crime to charge against the brothers?",
  "And, indeed, isn't it right that what Justice Breyer is saying was the very theory behind Evans, why this was extortion, is because the real crime was to the public at large, not to any particular customer. But yes, there was a crime to the ­­ the general public.",
  "Mr. Davis, I don't think you need to add words. What you need is to shift perspective. There is a difference here, but that's the difference, that the government is insisting that you look at it from the perspective of the person who, in this case, is doing the acts of obtaining property from another. And you are insisting that it be looked at from the perspective of the person who has agreed to help him do that. But there's no reason under standard conspiracy law that we would use the perspective of the agreer rather than the perspective of the perpetrator.",
  "There absolutely is a unity of purpose, that one person should do the crime.",
  "So, Mr. Landau, let's assume you're right, that this is a really bad mistake when it comes to arbitration. So just to take you back to Justice Alito's point and Justice Scalia's point, you know, usually we don't fix bad mistakes ­­",
  "­­ when State courts interpret State law. I mean, there are a lot of mistakes when it comes to interpretation of contracts, including arbitration agreements. So, again, what's the standard? There's nothing on the face of this opinion that indicates hostility to arbitration. To the extent that you can find reasoning in this opinion, which you have to search to find, but to the extent that you can find reasoning, it's about interpreting form contracts, interpreting ­­ whenever you see an ambiguity in a form contract, you interpret it against the drafter. And that's a principle of contract interpretation that, as far as I can see, has been used hundreds of times in California. It appears to be a very common principle of contract interpretation in California whenever California courts look at a contract of adhesion. So why isn't that just what they did, and is what they did?",
  "Mr. Landau, I completely take your point as to what the parties must have wanted, and it does make this State court opinion unsatisfying, would be a kind word for it, but ­­ but, you know, in fairness to the State court, part of the problem was the way this contract was worded. Everybody else finds ways to word contract provisions like this so that there isn't a problem. If the contract had said, you know, if class action waivers are invalid in your State, then Section 9 is unenforceable, there would have not have been this problem. This is ­­ it's a very unusual contract provision. Most companies use very clear ones. This one did not. And so the ­­ the State court had to sort of puzzle over what it meant and, as you say, probably got the answer wrong. Strike the \"probably.\" Got the answer wrong. But, you know, wrongness is just not what we do here.",
  "But the ­­ Volt says the law of the place interprets the law of the place exactly in the way ­­ or allows that interpretation exactly in the way that this State court interpreted it. The law of the place was just the law of the State unmodified by any possibly preempting Federal law.",
  "I guess I just don't understand, then, Mr. Goldstein ­­ and maybe it's the same question that Justice Scalia asked ­­ I don't see why it's better somehow to discriminate against arbitration by declaring arbitration agreements unenforceable writ large than it is by narrowing the scope of arbitration agreements unfairly.",
  "Well, sure. The parties can do anything they want. But the question is, did the parties do what they want ­­ did the parties do that here?",
  "But what do you think about a case, whether or not this is that case, in which it is quite clear to a judge that each of two defendants is just going to be pointing to the other person and saying, that was the bad actor. He is why these terrible crimes committed. And you know that ­­ you know, each of them is going to be doing that. Should a judge separate the penalty proceeding in that context?",
  "Well, I guess I am asking you in what kind of factual circumstances you would find that standard met?",
  "When you said it the first time, you had \"deprived of a fair trial\" and then something about individualized sentencing; is that right? Is that supposed to indicate that this is deriving both from the Due Process Clause and from the Eighth Amendment?",
  "Sorry, but I'm not ­­",
  "I think I missed something you said, but ­­ forgive me. But the constitutional standard that you're proposing, is that a constitutional standard for both the guilt phase and the sentencing phase? And is it also for both non­capital and capital? Are you drawing no distinctions among those four things?",
  "So it seems a little bit counterintuitive to me, the idea that, you know, the guilt phase in a very minor crime would have the exact same standard applicable to it as the guilt phase of a capital crime and then as the sentencing phase of a capital crime.",
  "But, Mr. Liu, I mean, given the kind of evidence that was presented in this case, the idea that somebody was a lousy big brother seems pretty small on ­­ in the ­­ in the scale of things.",
  "Mr. Liu, could you, for me, just tell me what is the specific prejudice you're alleging here? In other words, tell me more than just, oh, he was a corrupting influence. What evidence particularly came in ­­",
  "­­ and why do you think it might have mattered to the jury? Just give me your, like, best shot.",
  "Maybe I'm missing something, but if ­­ if your client's strategy was to make Reginald as bad ­­ the bad actor in the case, why didn't that evidence actually go hand in hand with your client's strategy, which was to say it's all on Reginald?",
  "How ­­ how was the change to the pattern instructions made? Who made it?",
  "Is it approved by the Supreme Court or is it divorced from the Supreme Court?",
  "You believe it's correct, that it is approved by the Court.",
  "Okay.",
  "Sorry. What does that mean, a \"catch­all instruction\"?",
  "Didn't the Court ­­",
  "But General, if I can understand your argument, you're saying not only that that analysis would come out the State's way, but you're saying this ­­ the lower court really never did that analysis at all, right? It didn't think that it was doing that analysis. It didn't think that that analysis was necessary because it thought that there was just a per se rule that one had to give this instruction; is that correct?",
  "I find that a little bit confusing. It just ­­ it sounds like they just sort of cited Boyde but failed to pay attention to anything Boyde said about what the analysis ought to be and instead substituted their own analysis, which was a per se rule deriving from the Eighth Amendment.",
  "You're not saying that that's required by the Eighth Amendment; is that right? You're not advocating a per se rule that such instructions are necessary.",
  "So could I ­­ could I talk about the circumstances of this case?",
  "Which is, you know, you have an instruction here that is unfortunate in its juxtaposition of the reasonable doubt standard and the reference to mitigating circumstances. And, you know, it is unfortunate, and I can see why they changed their pattern instructions. But ­­ but we've said that the analysis is a holistic one. We look at everything. You also have this mercy instruction. You have a catch­all instruction. You have, in both cases, arguments by the prosecutors that indicate fairly clearly that this is really all up to the jurors in Gleason. It says, \"Mitigating circumstances are every juror's individual choice.\" In ­­ in Carr, the prosecutor says, \"Anything in fairness may be considered as extenuating.\" So I guess the question is, even if this is a really unfortunate wording in the reasonable doubt/mitigating circumstances juxtaposition, why doesn't all of this other stuff indicate that no juror was likely to be confused?",
  "But that's ­­ that's not what is happening here, Mr. Bernstein ­­ I mean, if you assume the premise of Justice Breyer's question, which is that there is a Constitutional violation in keeping somebody in prison for some conduct that can't be criminalized. The State has set up a collateral review mechanism. We're not asking it to set up a new mechanism that it hasn't had before. It has a collateral review mechanism, and the only question is whether it's going to comply with Federal constitutional law in that collateral review mechanism.",
  "But Mr. Plaisance, I think what people are saying to you is that this is different from your standard Michigan v. law question ­­ Long question. It's a different question. It's a State that says, we're not bound to follow Teague, we know we can do something different, but we want to follow Teague. That's what we want to do. And then in ­­ in all its particulars. All right? And then the question is: If the State commits to following Teague, it's not ­­ it doesn't think anybody else has committed it. It self­commits to following Teague and to following Federal law. Then what happens? Is there enough of a Federal question to decide this case? Now, that's not a Michigan v. Long question. It's more like a Merrell Dow question or something like that, where Federal law is ­­ the State has chosen it, but it's just part and parcel of the claim, because the State is so committed to following Federal law in all its particulars.",
  "And Mr. Duncan, isn't it quite similar when Justice Scalia used this \"controlled\" language? The Louisiana Supreme Court has used similar language. It's dictated by Teague. Now, it's only dictated by Teague because they've chosen to make it dictated by Teague, but once that choice has been made, all outcomes are dictated by Teague. It's the same issue.",
  "Mr. Duncan ­­",
  "­­ can I give you just a hypothetical? I mean ­­",
  "­­ suppose that there is a State and it has a ­­ a mandatory minimum for a theft. It says the mandatory minimum for theft is 20 years. And suppose a court looks at that and says, you know what? That's incredibly disproportionate to a lot of theft, and so strikes the mandatory minimum. Says, you just can't have a mandatory minimum like that; make it lower. Would that be a substantive ruling?",
  "It does not go to the manner of imposing. It says nothing about the manner of imposing. What it does is it just increases the range of sentencing possibilities. It actually leaves it to the ­­ to the courts. It says absolutely nothing about what factors ought to be taken into account. Nothing about that at all. All it says is, you can't have a mandatory minimum of 20 years for theft; make it lower.",
  "But I think ­­",
  "So if you're saying, no, that's different because there was something else in Miller ­­ there is something else in Miller. There is a bunch. There ­­ there is ­­ there is a process component of Miller, no question about it, where the Court says what courts are supposed to look at is ­­ are the characteristics of youth and are supposed to try to figure out whether these terrible crimes are functions, in part, of immaturity or ­­ or ­­ or not, whether you ­­ you really are looking at an incorrigible defendant. So there is that process component. But that process component does not take away the fact that there is a completely separate, self­sufficient component as to what the range of punishment has to be. That's completely on all fours with the hypothetical that I gave you.",
  "No, you're exactly right. It did not take the LWOP punishment off the table. But similarly, in my hypothetical, a 20­year sentence for theft has not been taken off the table. What the Court has done is to say, there have to be other options. There has to be an option of ten years or five years or two years, whatever it is. So they've expanded the range of possibilities. They've just made the sentence different, because a sentence is defined both by its upper end and by its lower end.",
  "And so they've made the sentence different.",
  "Mr. Duncan, I ­­ I ­­ I think not. I think by your own definition this fits on the substantive side. You said you ­­ you categorically remove a certain outcome. And ­­ and ­­ and that's exactly what Miller does. If you ­­ as long as you understand a sentence, which I think you agreed with, as defined both by its upper end and by its lower end, effectively what the Court said in Miller was that that sentence, which was the mandatory LWOP sentence, cannot control for juveniles.",
  "There has to be a different sentence, one that includes other punishments.",
  "That ­­ that increases the range.",
  "It allows something within the range, but it has ­­ it has completely changed the range that's ­­ that is ­­ that is given for any juvenile defendant.",
  "The range is important. It's not just the top end. This is what we said in Alleyne, that you can't think about a sentence without thinking about both parts of the sentence, both the maximum and the minimum. And when you decide whether a substantive change in that sentence has been made, you look at both the maximum and the minimum.",
  "But this is what we ­­",
  "Which is what we said last year. We said, it's impossible to disassociate the floor of a sentencing range from the penalty affixed to the crime. And similarly, we said criminal statutes have long specified both the floor and ceiling of sentencing ranges, which is evidence that both define the legally prescribed penalty.",
  "That is the penalty ­­",
  "­­ is the range.",
  "Well, but I think that you yourself cabined it when you said that the difference is one ­­ there is some category of cases which do refer to process, to how a decisionmaker makes a particular result, and another category of cases which refer to what we've called substance, which is: What results are on the table? What category of punishment is on the table? And that's the difference between this and all the other kinds of things that you're mentioning.",
  "This is not about the how ­­ or it's partly about the how, but there's also about what punishments are on the table.",
  "Mr. Waxman, can ­­ can I give you a ­­ a hypothetical State system? And this is a two­part question. You tell me if it is consistent with the Sixth Amendment. And if it is, what makes this case different. Okay? So my system is that a jury, whether in the penalty phase or in the guilt phase, has to make a determination of an aggravating factor. Okay? But once that's done, once the jury decides on an aggravating factor, the judge can do whatever she wants. The judge can add aggravating factors. The judge can reweigh the aggravating factors as compared with the mitigating evidence. The judge can do any of that stuff. But the judge has to leave alone the aggravating factor that the jury finds. So, in other words, the judge can't give death when the jury finds life, and the judge can't throw out the jury's factor. But ­­ but as long as that jury makes that aggravating factor determination, the judge can do anything. Is that consistent with the Sixth Amendment?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, is that what ­­ is that what makes a difference, then, in the end, that ­­ that ­­ that you're saying that the jury has to be specifically told that that's what it's doing? That ­­ and you're saying ­­",
  "­­ the necessary part of a constitutional system for the jury to be instructed that it has the responsibility to find the aggravating factor that serves as a precondition to death.",
  "But ­­",
  "Well, you're saying it couldn't happen consistent with Ring, meaning that there are certain applications of the Florida law that would be unconstitutional even in your view.",
  "Could I give you another hypothetical scheme, notwithstanding that we don't sit in judgment of hypothetical schemes?",
  "Suppose that the ­­ the ­­ the jury finds an aggravating fact, but then, you know, the judge has this whole separate hearing ­­ right? ­­ in which other things are presented to him. And the judge says, you know, I don't actually agree with the aggravating fact that the jury found, but I have my own aggravating facts, and now I'm ­­ I'm doing all the weighing and I come out in favor of death. I ­­ I assume that you would say that also would be an unconstitutional application.",
  "Yes. Quite ­­ quite right. But I'm ­­ I'm hypothesizing a case in which the jury finds that death­eligibility marker ­­",
  "­­ right? If ­­ but the judge throws that one out and substitutes his own. That ­­ you think that would be constitutional?",
  "No, he does throw it out. He just says, I don't agree with that. I'm ­­ but I'm substituting my own. Would that be all right?",
  "But I have to say that answer surprises me because the death sentence there is not at all a function of the jury's eligibility finding. The judge has tossed out that eligibility finding and substituted his own, which then leads to the death sentence. So how can we say that that's possibly constitutional under Ring?",
  "The judge has said that that jury finding is utterly irrelevant to his decision about whether to impose death. That he's imposing death based on something that the jury has not found.",
  "But the thing is you can't really tell whether that happens in a wide variety of cases. And this is actually ­­ this goes to this question of because the jury doesn't actually have to find specific things, only the judge has to find specific things, you often are not going to be able to tell whether the judge's sentence is based on the same aggravating facts that the jury has found.",
  "Which honestly sounds the same.",
  "Can ­­ can I go back to the kinds of hypotheticals that Justice Kennedy and I were ­­ were proposing? So let's say that there is a jury, and ­­ and it's been presented with evidence that the murder was for pecuniary gain, which is one of the aggravating factors. And the ­­ the ­­ the jury comes out with a recommendation of death. So you ­­ and that was the only thing that was presented to it. So you know that the ­­ the jury has made a death eligibility determination on pecuniary gain. Then it goes to the judge. The judge says, you know what, I don't really think that there's enough evidence of pecuniary gain, but I've had this whole hearing, and I find that the thing was ­­ that the crime was heinous and whatnot. And now I'm going to sentence the person to death. Now, you say that that's fine; is that right?",
  "Well, you know ­­ no ­­ he's ­­ well ­­ he's heard more evidence because, you know, there's a whole new hearing that he has. And now he's considered it more thoroughly, and he thinks, no, I don't agree with that anymore, but I think it was heinous. So that would be fine.",
  "Yes, yes, yes, it's not this case.",
  "I'm throwing out ­­",
  "­­ the jury's aggravating factor, but I'm substituting my own. I thought that that was what you told me that that was constitutional under Ring.",
  "This wasn't at the guilt phase; this was just as a matter of sentencing. Let me get on with my questioning ­­",
  "­­ because I think you answered this one already. Then the appeal that's taken, right ­­ the appeal is focusing now only on what the judge has found, isn't that right, under Florida law? The appeal ­­ if the person came in and said that there was insufficient evidence, the appeal would only be as to the judge's finding and not at all to the jury's.",
  "And ­­ and he says there was just not enough evidence of all these aggravating factors, so ­­ but that was ­­ would only be as to the judge's aggravating factors. It couldn't possibly be that he would challenge the jury's.",
  "I mean, I'm just suggesting that the whole appeal process suggests that the crucial death eligibility determination is being made by the judge because that's the only death eligibility determination that the appeals court is ever going to review.",
  "Yes, look, they have something to review. The problem is it's the judge's thing to ­­ that they're reviewing, not the jury's, and that's a Sixth Amendment problem.",
  "No, all there were meant to be was three examples, and I don't know how good they are, but they come to mind.",
  "Mr. Clement ­­",
  "Do you mind, Justice Kennedy, if I ­­",
  "Yes? I mean, I take it that the ­­ the implications of your argument is that FERC can't do anything with respect to demand response; is that right?",
  "And so this sort of practice, though ­­ so I'll just narrow the question ­­ where it's retail actors who are bidding into a wholesale market.",
  "I take it that there, there would be a regulatory gap. In other words, FERC can't do anything nor can the States do anything.",
  "It ­­ it is an odd result, given this Energy Policy Act which made it so clear that Congress liked demand response that it wanted FERC to lower barriers to demand response, to then say, well, FERC has no jurisdiction to do exactly what the policy that Congress articulated is.",
  "But that's a merits question as to whether they're entitled to attorneys' fees. If the question is complete ­­ you know, \"complete relief\" means what the plaintiff has asked for. The plaintiff has asked for attorneys' fees here.",
  "But if I could go back a little bit, Mr. Garre. And this is, I think, the question that Justice Scalia started with. There are a number of things that you've said, well, he asked for it, but he's not entitled to it. He asked for attorneys' fees, but he's not entitled to attorneys' fees. And he asked for an injunction or declaratory relief, and he's not entitled to that. And he asked for class certification, but he's not entitled to that, and so the case is moot. And the \"so the case is moot\" seems to me to be a non sequitur. In other words, he's asked for these things, you haven't offered these things, and there's a dispute about whether he's entitled to these things. Now, you might be completely right as to that, \"He's not entitled to attorneys' fees.\" But that has to be adjudicated. You can't ­­ a court can't just say, oh, you've offered complete relief, because in his view you haven't offered complete relief, and that's what the litigation is all about.",
  "A court can absolutely make that determination. But the question is: Does the court make that determination in the guise of a mootness motion?",
  "But Mr. Garre ­­",
  "­­ and this is very much along the same lines ­­ you know, you ­­ you have an old English case. You have these three cases in the '90s, 1890s, which were really about liabilities had ­­ that had already been satisfied, and the court said, it's already been satisfied, payment has already been made. But there's really no history at all ­­ and tender offers have existed for a long, long time. There's no history at all of ­­ of saying that a tender offer moots a case, as opposed to the classic understanding, the common law understanding, of tender offers was that it created an incentive for parties, and that that was their purpose and that was their effect, was to incentivize parties to do something, but not to ­­ for ­­ not to provide a mechanism for a court just to throw out a case when a party decided that, for whatever reason, he thought that the tender offer was not good enough.",
  "Well, but I ­­ I said that mootness is not the appropriate remedy in that case. The appropriate remedy in a case where it's absolutely clear that ­­ that the ­­ that the defendant has given ­­ has offered the plaintiff everything the plaintiff has asked for, which it's not in this case, but where it's absolutely clear, where the defendant has offered everything that the plaintiff himself has asked for, the appropriate thing to do, in order to prevent wasteful litigation, is not to dismiss the case for mootness, but to grant judgment in favor of the plaintiff.",
  "Well, it doesn't become moot. It's just been decided. It's ­­ there's been an adjudication at that point.",
  "There's nothing to dismiss.",
  "Mr. Garre, both sides have these class action policy arguments, but it's important not to let those drive this pretty technical mootness question. So if we could just take the class action arguments out of it. Just let's say that there's a plaintiff, and he claims 10,000 ­­ he wants $10,000 plus attorneys' fees, okay? And the defendant says, I'll give you And the plaintiff says, no, I really want attorneys' fees, too. And the defendant says, no, you're not entitled to attorneys' fees. Plaintiff says, no, I think I am. I'll ­­ I think I ­­ I'm going to reject your settlement offer. So you say at that point the court can come in and say, oh, the case is moot. Now, how is that possible?",
  "There's a ­­ there's a contested question as to what one person owes another. The ­­ the defendant has said he doesn't want to accept this offer because he doesn't think it gives him everything that's entitled ­­ he's entitled to. And the measure of complete relief has to be, at this stage, about what his complaint asks for.",
  "Well, then you would reject the case ­­",
  "­­ on the merits.",
  "There's a very ­­ there's a very easy response to this, which is: If it's frivolous, if it's trivial, you dismiss the case on the merits.",
  "And I take it that this judgment that you're talking about would be: He offered this. It's everything that you asked for. We are ordering that he pay it. And ­­",
  "­­ and ­­ and now the thing is dismissed.",
  "Why is it you think ­­",
  "Let's say I agree with you that there needs to be a concrete injury; that Congress needs to have recognized something that looks like a concrete injury. But why isn't that exactly what Congress did here? So let me just frame it in a hypothetical. Suppose that there's just a statute ­­ it's a little bit of a simpler statute, and you can argue with me or tell me why it might or might not be different, but I just want to understand your position. Suppose that there is a statute that just says that one of these credit reporting agencies shall not disseminate inaccurate information about people, or shall ­­ shall not do it willfully or negligently or what have you, but shall not disseminate inaccurate information about people. And then there's a cause of action that says if they disseminate inaccurate information in a credit report about you, you can sue. All right? Is that enough of a concrete injury for you?",
  "Okay. But let me focus on what seems to be ­­",
  "­­ the gravamen of the claim. And why isn't the dissemination of false information about you in a credit report, why isn't that ­­ why isn't it ­­ it perfectly sufficient if Congress says that's a concrete injury?",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "You said that there were reasons why that was not a concrete injury ­­",
  "­­ the dissemination of false information about a particular person. Why? Because to me, I'll just say, seems like a concrete injury to me.",
  "You know? If ­­ I mean, if somebody did it to me I'd feel harmed. And I think that if you went out on the street and you did a survey, most people would feel harmed. Most people would feel as though they had some interest that had been invaded. And Congress recognized that, thought it was a significant problem, passed a statute to deal with that problem.",
  "That's quite right. It's not ­­ it's not completely in the common law tradition. But we've said many times that Congress gets to look beyond the common law tradition and gets to identify real world problems out there in the world, harming people in real­world ways. And that, it seems, is what Congress did here.",
  "These are not ­­ these ­­ these are not unimportant details. This is a ­­ they basically got everything wrong about him. You know, they got his marital status wrong, they got his income wrong, they got his education wrong. They basically portrayed a different person than ­­",
  "Here's the thing, Mr. Pincus. It seems to me that the ­­ the one thing that we have to say Congress is better at than we are is identifying concrete harms. I mean, it's perfectly fine, and I agree with very large portions of your brief when you say they have to have identified a concrete harm. It's like, fine, yes, they do. But now the question is, did they identify one? And it seems pretty clear what they wanted to do here; that this statute is entirely about preventing the dissemination of inaccurate information in credit reports which they seem to think is both something that harms the individual personally and also harms larger systemic issues. And then they gave the cause of action to the people it harmed personally. And I guess ­­ I mean, don't we owe them a little bit of respect that they've actually identified a real­world harm that it ­­ that's out there?",
  "But that's a really hard thing to do, Mr. Pincus.",
  "People get these reports, and you don't know what they're doing with these reports. They might have not given you a job for that reason, or they might have not given you a job for some other reason. They might have not given you credit for that reason, or they might have not given you credit for some other reason. I mean, it's actually the quintessential kind of injury that you will never be able to detect and surely not to prove.",
  "No.",
  "Well, I agree with you entirely on that.",
  "Go ahead.",
  "Congress does it by doing it, you know? Congress doesn't announce exactly ­­",
  "­­ here we are, we're just going beyond the common law. It just does it. And ­­ and it does it ­­ and it did it here. It said, you know, what are we concerned about? We're concerned about following the kinds of procedures that will make sure that there are accurate credit reports. And then Congress told you exactly why in the purposes section of the statute. And my gosh, it's all over the legislative history. The most serious problem in the credit reporting industry, Congress says, is the problem of inaccurate and misleading information.",
  "And ­­ and so Congress has clearly done that here. And I guess I ­­ if you want to just explain to me why it is that Congress can't do ­­ I think we've said that Congress can do that, can go beyond the common law, and certainly can go beyond anything that we've ever said is a concrete harm as long as they've identified a concrete harm.",
  "Of course, harms can arise in the world, and can be identified in the world even though they haven't arisen before, or been identified before.",
  "If you're saying that, I agree with you.",
  "But why did Congress do that, Mr. Pincus? Congress did that ­­",
  "­­ Congress did that as a safe harbor. We are not ­­ it's a kind of industry­friendly act that Congress did. It said we're not going to punish any old inaccuracy. We're giving you a safe harbor. If ­­ as long as you followed a certain set of procedures, don't worry about it. But did that procedural requirement ­­ this is ­­ this is exactly what Lujan says, \"It's a procedural requirement, the disregard of which could impair a concrete interest of the plaintiff.\" And we distinguished that from procedural requirements in vacuo.",
  "And that's what this is. It's a procedural requirement, the disregard of which can impair your interest in being represented accurately in credit reports.",
  "No.",
  "Well, but, Mr. Pincus, the gravamen of this claim, as I said, and as more importantly, as ­­ as the ­­ the Respondent has said, is in 1681(e), which does talk about accuracy. And it makes it clear that the procedures are linked to accuracy. And I totally take your point that, well, how about the person who there's ­­ there's been no inaccuracy. Well, that person does not have standing. That person cannot come in and say that he's suffered a concrete injury. But the person who has been inaccurately represented can come in and say he's suffered exactly the concrete injury that this statute is designed to protect against.",
  "Well, was this ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "No. But would this man be able? I mean, this is very much in line with the Chief Justice's. Would he be able to sue based on the fact that there was inaccurate information about him?",
  "I guess ­­ I guess what I ­­ that's okay.",
  "That's ­­",
  "­­ that ­­ that's ­­",
  "Mr. Consovoy, can I just make sure I understand? You said you ­­ you need for the information to be inaccurate to have standing here. That is going to mean that the class, as you've defined it, is not going to be certified. And I think that that's the right answer, but I just want to make sure that we're on the ­­ we're on the same page here.",
  "And one very quick thing. You said in your brief you're really only suing under 1681(e)(B).",
  "Can I understand that to be that you're waiving all claims of other things?",
  "And ­­ and Mr. Stewart, if I could just ­­ I mean, the ­­ maybe this is the sentence that you're talking about. At one point the Court says, \"the interests protected by the statutory rights at issue are sufficiently concrete and particularized.\" Now, look, it's not a good opinion, and then it doesn't tell you why it is that they're sufficiently concrete. But they clearly held that they were sufficiently concrete. They understood that as part of the test.",
  "But ­­ but you're saying in that case or in other cases? And if so, which other cases that, in that situation, we, nonetheless, addressed the reasoning of the intermediate court? Is that what you're saying?",
  "And Mr. Bright, just to make sure I understand, all the notes in the prosecutor's files were new; is that right?",
  "Yes. Okay.",
  "And has the Georgia Supreme Court ever ­­ ever said anything one way or the other as to whether it's discretionary or not?",
  "But ­­ but I ­­ maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're saying. You're saying there is no such uniform determination that they will exercise their discretion in a certain way, that they are insisting upon their discretion being discretionary. Is that correct?",
  "Can I just ask one more quick question about this.",
  "You ­­ you made reference ­­ this is an issue that's being litigated in the Georgia courts, is that right, in the Eleventh Circuit?",
  "This precise issue?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Well, I'll ­­ I'll ­­ am I right that the issue that is being litigated is whether the Supreme Court review, in cases like this, is discretionary or not discretionary?",
  "Me too. Can I ­­ can I go to the merits? Is that ­­ is that all right?",
  "Okay. Unless other people ­­ Okay. Look. You have a lot of new information here from these files that suggests that what the prosecutors were doing was looking at the African­American prospective jurors as a group, that they had basically said, we don't want any of these people. Here is the one we want if we really have to take one. But that there ­­ the ­­ all the evidence suggests a kind of singling out, which is the very antithesis of the Batson rule. So, you know, I mean ­­ well, isn't this as ­­ I'm just going to ask you: Isn't this as clear a Batson violation as a court is ever going to see?",
  "But ­­ but Ms. Burton, I mean, wouldn't you agree, in a lot of these Batson cases, you'll have purported justifications, which they could support a valid peremptory strike, right? But that the question for a court is, well, but did they support this valid peremptory strike? In other words, what was the prosecutor thinking? Batson is a rule about purposeful discrimination, about intent. And so it doesn't really matter that there might have been a bunch of valid reasons out there, if the ­­ if it was clear that the prosecutor was thinking about race. You agree with that, right?",
  "Yes, if his intent was to strike based on race, it doesn't matter that he could have had a different intent that would have supported a good peremptory strike. And so the question of whether, you know, someone or other might have been properly struck by ­­ by a prosecutor isn't really the question. The question is on the total amount of evidence before us, including all these prosecutors' notes, what was going on with respect to each of these peremptory strikes. And then you have to deal with not just, oh, it could have been this or it could have been that, but you have to deal with all this information that what it really was, was they wanted to get the black people off the jury.",
  "Well, but that's ­­",
  "And Justice Scalia raises, of ­­ of course, a good point in the mine run of cases, but not in a case where all the evidence of intentional discrimination was not before the judge at the time.",
  "Yes, I mean, I think that that's exactly how the decision is framed, right? Because the decision talks about claims that are not reviewable due to res judicata. It lists many, many, many claims, and then it lists a whole bunch of claims that are procedurally defaulted. And then this is in a separate section, the Batson issue, and it's in a section that's with ­­ with all the other claims that there are merits determinations being made about. And the court is very clear, first sentence, last sentence. First sentence: \"The court finds the prosecution did not violate Batson versus Kentucky.\" Last sentence: \"On the merits the person, the\" ­­ \"the\" ­­ \"the Petitioner loses.\" So ­­",
  "­­ it is ­­",
  "No. But that ­­",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "What your ­­",
  "What your theory does is at least create a world in which some things are included and some things are excluded in a way that appears not to make much sense. Now, you've said no, there is a reason for doing this with arson to limit it to the Federal offense. But I mean, there are a lot of things, a lot of things on that list that have jurisdictional hooks in them. So you would be excluding ­­ in addition to arson, you would be excluding the child pornography crime. You would be excluding a kidnapping crime, excluding felon and possession, excluding receiving explosives for the purpose of killing somebody. So you would be excluding all of those. And then on the other hand, you would be including some things that seem a lot more minor that just happen not to have jurisdictional hooks, like operating a gambling establishment. So you create a world in which the exclusions and the inclusions seem not to match up with anybody's view of ­­ of a sensible categorization.",
  "Mr. Guadagno, this is along the same lines as the Chief Justice's question. I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, but jurisdictional elements are different in one important way, which is that we don't require mens rea as to jurisdictional elements. So that's a pretty critical distinction that we've made. Are you suggesting that jurisdictional elements are different? You know, you have to prove them, but you don't have to ­­ the ­­ the defendant doesn't have to have mens rea with respect to them. Why doesn't that suggest that there is a real distinction here between jurisdictional elements and substantive elements that can come into play in this context as well?",
  "But ­­ but that ­­ the mens rea example is also an example where ­­ where basically State and what we think Congress meant. And we're saying, you know, Congress could not have meant to require mens rea for a jurisdictional element. Notwithstanding that there's not language in a statute that says, and there shall be no mens rea for a jurisdictional element. So why not the same here?",
  "Is that really, Ms. Goldenberg, the only textual basis for your position? You know, your brief does a good deal about the difference between \"described\" and \"defined,\" which the Petitioner has suggested is ­­ is ­­ is not a very good distinction, because the \"defined\" only refers to actual statutory definitions. So are you still relying on that? Are you relying on anything else in the statutory text beyond the penultimate sentence, or is the penultimate sentence really the statutory basis for your argument?",
  "But I believe that Mr. Guadagno's point was that this is ­­ it's a reason why Congress may have used the language that it did, rather than, say, just arson. Right? That it wanted ­­ that it understood that there was a wealth of very minor arson crimes out there in the States, that it wanted to exclude those. And the way it excluded those was essentially by saying, no, it's got to be the Federal offense.",
  "Are there State or foreign RICO offenses at all?",
  "Mr. Zas, is it possible when you read these three terms, as you say, Congress might have meant to be just trying to pick up every conceivable State statute it could think of. But it's possible also to think of these as the aggravated sexual abuse is the worst offense; the sexual abuse is the medium offense; and the abusive sexual conduct is actually somewhat a more minor offense, in other words, might include things that are not sexual abuse themselves. Let's say indecent exposure or something like that. And if you understand the provisions in that way as sort of going from the top to the bottom and meant to pick up everything, then it would seem that the involving a minor or ward really ought to refer to all of them. Right? That there's no reason why the involving a minor or ward would ­­ would refer only to the most minor offenses as the others.",
  "Maybe I said that wrong. I think I said the exact opposite of what I meant.",
  "What? If you read ­­ if you read them going ­­ going down, right ­­ well, what do you think would follow? What do you think would follow from that understanding of this list?",
  "But just presume with me that abusive sexual conduct is supposed to be ­­ is supposed to include some things that sexual abuse would not. What do you think follows from that?",
  "But why would they be focused on Federal sexual abuse involving adults but not State sexual abuse involving adults?",
  "No, but the ­­ the Federal predicate, the Section 109, I believe it is, does apply to adults as well. So why would they be focused on adults with respect to Federal offenses but not with respect to State offenses?",
  "Ms. O'Connell ­­",
  "Well, could I ask about your ­­ your basic theory as to that, which, if I understand it, says the reason why we shouldn't worry about the redundancy you create is because Congress just wanted to make absolutely clear that the sexual abuse was also sexual abuse involving somebody who couldn't consent. That's basically your theory. And there is a very easy way to do that, and it would have completely made this ­­ I mean, made this a hundred percent clear. Congress would just have said aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual abuse involving a minor or ward. And just by using the exact same language, it would have been clear, but the distinction was between sexual abuse and sexual abuse involving a minor or ward. But Congress doesn't do that, right? Congress changes the language of the third noun. And that's what creates the puzzlement. And ­­ and so it seems to me that your theory doesn't really cohere with the fact that this third term ­­ although, nobody can say exactly what it means that is different ­­ the third term is linguistically dissimilar from the second one.",
  "You're not suggesting this is just a scrivener's error, are you? That it was meant to be contact?",
  "Well, can I go back to the ­­ to the language? You know, it's confusing language. And I showed it to all my clerks and ­­ and basically said how would you read it. And two came out on one side, and two came out on the other side. But ­­ but I'm sort of left with this feeling that it ­­ we're not in ­­ in a situation where there are dueling canons. We actually might be in a situation where one canon trumps the other. I mean, you have this last­antecedent rule, and it's an important rule. But it gives way when a certain ­­ when there is a certain quality to all the antecedents when they're all parallel and when the last modifier equally sensibly refers to them all, right? And that that's a situation, so that series­qualifier rule is in some sense a rule about when the last­antecedent rule doesn't apply. So I guess I would ask you to comment on that.",
  "Mr. Shelley, can we go back to the sentence that you're relying on, because I have to admit I don't understand your reading. The ­­ the sentence says ­­ and I'm taking out some unnecessary words. It says, the agency shall forward payments to the clerk, singular, until the filing fees are paid. Now, that makes perfect sense if the filing fees are all in one case, going to a single clerk. But if you're right and what they mean is the filing fees are in multiple cases, then it doesn't make sense to say that the agency shall forward payments to the clerk. The only way to make that sentence makes sense, if the filing fees are in multiple cases, is for Congress ­­ is for the statute to have read, the agency shall forward payments to many clerks or to several clerks seriatim. And that suggests not the per­prisoner approach, but the per­case approach.",
  "But then ­­ so that ­­ that seems right, to make the sentence work the way you want it to work ­­ and this is the sentence you are relying on. To make it work the way you want it to work, you have to add language to it.",
  "Yes, I'm going to say, you know what, even as I look at that, even if you add that language, it still doesn't make sense. \"The agency shall forward payment to the relevant clerk until multiple filing fees are paid.\" It's just ­­ it doesn't ­­ the two halves of the sentence don't connect there.",
  "Well, but Congress doesn't know that. Congress just thinks fees in a case, fees in a case. So then it makes perfect sense. Give the fees in a case to the clerk. But you're saying give fees in multiple cases to the clerk, when it's not. It's give fees to ­­ in multiple cases to multiple clerks.",
  "Ms. Saharsky, can I get back to the $10 rule and the BOP policy with respect to this? I think it was the Chief Justice who said that he didn't really understand. And I share his lack of understanding about how the BOP is actually doing this, given the language of the statute. The statute says, you know, \"shall forward payments each time the amount in the account exceeds $10.\" So that suggests to me that if you're looking at an account with $10 and 1 cent, you make the next payment. And I understand from your brief that that's not what the BOP is doing. And how can the BOP be not doing that?",
  "But that does raise ­­ I mean, as Mr. Shelley says, using that exact $50 number. If you have $50 and you have five lawsuits, the $50 is gone, assuming that the BOP's policy is not uniform and maybe is not statutorily authorized.",
  "Am I right that Goosby thought of that as part of the jurisdictional question?",
  "In other words, it's an application of Bell v. Hood ­­",
  "­­ which suggests that if something is so obviously frivolous, then the Court has no jurisdiction on it at all?",
  "Well, why do you ­­",
  "In reality, on the ground, what percentage of cases is there a request for a three­judge court?",
  "Litigants want this?",
  "Are there any litigants that say to themselves, I'd rather have a one­judge court, thanks?",
  "Can I make sure I understand what you're saying, because what you're saying now is different from what I had thought that your briefs were saying? I had thought in your briefs that you were relying on changes in the law that ­­ that Congress made in ­­ I think it's 1976; is that right?",
  "But now you're suggesting that you're not relying on that, that you're saying that before that, we ­­ we viewed as acceptable a ­­ a one­judge court dismissing a case. Is that now what you're saying, historic practice favors you as opposed to the ­­ the 1976 amendments favor you?",
  "Mr. Sullivan, I ­­ I ­­ I guess I'm ­­ I'm not so inclined to think that. We always have had this very narrow category of cases which we say we're dismissing on jurisdictional grounds that sound kind of merits­y. But ­­ but we've cabined that. You know, we've basically said that's only when it's completely ridiculous. And so there's no case at all. It's just a laughing stock of a case, given our precedents. And that's a very different kind of inquiry than the typical 12(b)(6) inquiry.",
  "And ­­ and this $200,000, did he put it in a general account or was it set aside in a specific account?",
  "Mr. Stris ­­",
  "Ms. Anders, could I ­­ could I shift gears a little bit and ­­ and just ask: The test that we've set up is whether a remedy is typically available at equity. And there's been some back­and­forth, I think, about what that means. What does it mean?",
  "But it seems, Mr. Katyal, that you are relying on remedies that really developed very late in equity's life. In other words, you know, equity was going along, and there were these very formal rules distinguishing it from the legal world. And then as it progressed, there were ­­ people thought we need some cleanup authority, or maybe even people just thought these rules aren't working in the way that we want them to work. So equity got a little bit less equitable as it approached the merger with law. But that, I think, is not really what we've meant when we've said we're looking to things that are typically equitable. You know, not like the last throes of equity as it was becoming a legal system.",
  "Well, you take the ­­ the deficiency judgments, which, I take it, was a rule was needed to give equity that authority, because everybody thought equity didn't have that authority.",
  "Mr. Phillips, you say the question is whether it can proceed as a class. But it seems as though that's really not the question in this case because of Mt. Clemens; and what Mt. Clemens does is to suggest that certain kinds of statistical evidence are completely appropriate in FLSA cases generally, even if they're brought by the government, or even if they're brought by a single person. And so the question that you really are putting before us is not a Rule 23 question, it's a question of whether this sort of evidence complies with the Mt. Clemens standard; isn't that right?",
  "But the Rule 23 inquiry, Mr. Phillips, is always dependent on what the substantive law is.",
  "That was true in Halliburton where we said, look, if we didn't have the basic presumption, we would think of this as very individualized.",
  "But we have the basic presumption, so the proof is not individualized. And the same thing, it seems to me, is true here because of the Mt. Clemens inquiry.",
  "Where it says if the employer hasn't kept the appropriate records, even a single plaintiff can prove the amount of work done through the use of statistical ­­",
  "I can't see how that account of Mt. Clemens would make most ­­ much sense. You're suggesting that a person past 40 can produce the statistical evidence, but if I worked 39 1/2 hours and all of this overtime is going to push me over 40, the Mt. Clemens presumption wouldn't be available to me?",
  "And now that has to be distributed. So there are going to be further proceedings to distribute that lump sum judgment.",
  "Mr. Phillips ­­",
  "But there ­­",
  "But, Mr. Phillips, there is a way.",
  "If I could go back to Justice Kennedy's question at the start, because it really was your decision not to have a bifurcated proceeding, where it would have been clear ­­ it would have been proved separately in a highly ministerial way which employees worked over 40 hours. And having made that decision, you're in a position now where you're saying, oh, there's one sum ­­ there's one lump judgment; we don't know what to do with it. But, in ­­ in essence, what's going to happen is that it's going to go back in remand, and the judge is going to do something that looks an awful like ­­ lot like the bifurcation that you rejected, which is, the Court will say, now we figure out in this highly ministerial way who worked more than 40 hours, and so who is entitled to share in the judgment.",
  "But it ­­ it absolutely helps with the question, your second question presented, which is this point that you are making that there might be some people who didn't work 40 hours, who would nonetheless get money. And it absolutely helps for that. It takes care of the entire problem. That leaves you with only your first question presented ­­",
  "­­ which is this question about was the class too varied. And on that, I have to go back to this ­­ to this issue of, it's not a class issue. It's an FLSA issue under Mt. Clemens as to whether this kind of statistical evidence could have been presented.",
  "But, Mr. Srebnick, I mean, compare two situations. One is the one that Monsanto talked about where, yeah, a bank robber goes in and he has a pile of money now. And Monsanto says, you know, even though he wants to use that money to pay for an attorney, too bad. Now a bank robber goes in, he has a pile of money, he puts it into a separate bank account, he uses that bank account to pay his rent, to pay other expenses, and he uses the money that would have gone for the rent and other expenses to pay a lawyer. Why should the two cases be treated any differently for Sixth Amendment purposes?",
  "Mr. Srebnick, this goes back, I think, to the Chief Justice's first question. It seems that the distinction that you're making is one that the Court explicitly rejected in Monsanto. In other words, the Court said the Sixth Amendment here is the exact same thing as the First Amendment. It even used that example that Justice Scalia gave, or that general example. And ­­ and so it goes back to the Chief Justice's question in ­­ in the sense of there's a very powerful intuition behind your argument, but it's a powerful intuition that was explicitly rejected by us. And ­­ and this case doesn't seem to present any different circumstances than that one.",
  "I might just be repeating myself, but ­­ but I thought that, again, that distinction was the one specifically rejected in Monsanto. I mean, Monsanto could have said Caplin & Drysdale is different because it's postconviction. But Monsanto refused to say that. Monsanto said the same rule that applies postconviction ought to apply upon a finding of probable cause.",
  "Mr. Dreeben ­­",
  "Mr. Dreeben, I think, you know, in essence your argument goes like this: You have Monsanto, you combine Monsanto with a ­­ a simple factual acknowledgment that money is fungible, and it gets you to a judgment in this case. You win, the petitioner loses. And ­­ and, you know, that's a fair, strong argument, if ­­ if one is comfortable with Monsanto. I mean, there is ­­ so I think I would just ask you, I mean, suppose the Court is just uncomfortable with the path we started down the road on in Monsanto? And you might be right that it just doesn't make sense to draw a line here, but it leaves you with a situation in which more and more and more we're depriving people of the ability to hire counsel of choice in complicated cases. And so what should we do with that intuition that Monsanto sent us down the wrong path?",
  "Mr. Dreeben ­­",
  "Mr. Dreeben, if I could go back to Justice Alito's questions about your interpretation of the statute, I think what Justice Alito was suggesting was that (a)(2)(A) would be completely subsumed by (a)(2)(B) on your interpretation, and I don't think that you got around to answering that question.",
  "No, but in ­­ in just saying that, you're essentially saying, yes, (B) expands it out, meaning it covers everything that (A) covers and some more.",
  "Do you think that there's any ­­",
  "Do you think that there's any way to read this statute such that it applies to people who wish to retain counsel as opposed to make other expenditures?",
  "If I could go back to your main argument. You seem to be suggesting that the inquiry that we should be undertaking really focuses on this jury and how this jury made its decision. But I had thought that some of our prior cases, in particular, Jackson, suggests that that's not the correct inquiry. That the correct inquiry really is ­­ is as to a hypothetical jury, any jury. And so your focus on, well, the way that these instructions might have affected this particular jury just really isn't the right one at all.",
  "I ­­ I would have ­­ the ­­ the most recent case that we had, which was Wong, makes clear the statute of ­­ of limitations generally are not jurisdictional, and I would think suggests that you really have to have language saying it is jurisdictional to overcome that presumption. In other words, just a strong­sounding statute of limitations wouldn't cut it according to Wong. That's the way I would read that.",
  "But are you saying that we should adopt a different interpretive rule in the criminal context? Is that what I understood you to say?",
  "That suggests that you wouldn't even look to the indictment. That you would just look to the statute.",
  "So Mr. Martinez, just ­­",
  "I'm sorry. Just going back to this question of whether it's the statute or the indictment, you think you just look to the indictment to tell you which statutes to look to, but if the indictment would, let's say, add an extra element, that doesn't matter? You should ­­ you should look to the statute in the ­­",
  "­­ in the same way that you're suggesting here we shouldn't look to the instructions?",
  "But ­­ but I guess I ­­ it is ­­ that does seem a little bit troubling to me just because of the function of an indictment is providing notice, that if the indictment gets the statute wrong, that ­­ that the government should be stuck with that because that's what ­­ you know, that's what the defendant now thinks is the charge.",
  "Suppose you took a converse case where the instructions favored the government and the defendant didn't object, is convicted, then brings a sufficiency claim. Do you again say it really is measured as against the statute? It has nothing to do with the instructions?",
  "Well, that might be true sometimes, but it doesn't seem as though that's the ordinary case. I mean, why would you have ­­ you could ­­ you can make an exception for cases in which there really ­­ the government has ­­ is able to come in and say, we really need to develop the record. But where that's not true, why wouldn't you decide this as quickly as you could?",
  "Mr. Wolfman ­­",
  "If ­­ you might be pulled in two different directions here but you don't have to accept what Justice Sotomayor is saying to win this case; isn't that right? In other words, one could say, yes, if you had discriminatory acts language, that might point to the last predicate discriminatory act as opposed to the resignation, it might or it might not, but here that language doesn't exist. Here the language is discriminatory matter. That refers to the entire claim. And when you refer to the entire claim, it's clear that the resignation is part and parcel of that.",
  "And it at least creates ambiguity, such that the default rule would operate.",
  "So you don't have not to go to that ­­",
  "Do the predicate acts have to be independently actionable or not?",
  "Well, you just sort of made those two synonymous. But they don't have to be synonymous. A matter might mean the claim, not the particular discriminatory conduct that's the predicate for the claim.",
  "I mean, this is an unusual kind of claim, and it's an unusual kind of claim because there are predicate acts and then there is also a resignation which clearly has to occur before the suit can be brought. And when there is this, you know, this composite set of things that has to go on before a suit, it seems to me that it's at least approaching the kind of possible ambiguous ­­ ambiguous stage to say, yeah, that's a matter, that's a practice that both of those things have to be part of it.",
  "There's something more than just simplicity, which is, you know, suppose you had a case where somebody is first demoted and then somebody is fired. You would never say, oh, he was demoted. He suffered the injury then, it just raised the stakes. You would say, no, there's two independent things and now he can bring a termination claim.",
  "And the power of the constructive­discharge claim is to say the exact same thing really has happened here, that once you lose the job, it's more than the stakes have been raised. It's that there is a separate injury that then becomes legally actionable.",
  "But if we're going to say, yes, these are different and for some purposes we're going to look to the fiction and for other purposes we're not going to look to the fiction, it seems to me as though here it makes sense to take account of the fiction in the sense that the person cannot bring a claim until the resignation has happened. So that's the kind of paradigmatic case in which, boy, there is something really powerful pushing that, yes, you can ­­ you should recognize the constructive discharge as a discharge in this case.",
  "Mr. Hacker, just looking at the language, I mean, I understand your interpretation of it, but it seems to me that there's, you know, a ­­ just as good interpretation which says the opposite. In other words, you know, what does it mean for a suit to be brought to enforce a liability in a kind of circumstance you're talking about? In the circumstance you're talking about, the suit is brought to enforce State law. Now, it's true that State law might look to Federal law; State law might incorporate Federal law in certain ways; State law might have some kind of relationship to Federal law. But what's the suit brought to enforce? The suit is brought to enforce State law.",
  "But State liabilities.",
  "But then you're going to be in a situation where the judge is going to have to try to figure out whether State law exactly mimics Federal law, or whether there are minor deviations from Federal law. And that can't be a good jurisdictional test, can it?",
  "I don't think this is a marginal question. I think this is kind of a, you know, pretty ordinary question of like, well, what is the State law doing? Is it exactly ­­ lots of State laws exactly mimic Federal law, and lots of them don't.",
  "And you think we can reach that interpretation, even as to the Natural Gas Act consistent with Pan American?",
  "Why do you think, Mr. Stris, this different language was used in these ten statutes?",
  "I ­­ go ahead, please.",
  "Can I ask you to describe your complaint? In other words, Mr. Hacker has a certain characterization or description of your complaint, and the ­­ and the ­­ the role played in your complaint by the regulation. So if you had to describe your complaint, and particularly, what role does this regulation play in your claims under State law?",
  "Mr. Stris, I guess I don't understand why you're resisting just say saying this language ought to be interpreted in the same way as arising under jurisdiction is interpreted. And it's true they're different words, but it's at least as good an interpretation of these words that they essentially refer to what the arising under test refers to, which after all ­­ I mean, the arising under test doesn't really have a whole lot to do with the language arising under anymore.",
  "So ­­ so why isn't that just sort of the simplest thing to do is, we have a test, it's a four­part test, and this language seems to fit that test pretty well, and that's what we should do, we should just have one test.",
  "But it has not been found by a single district court, right? I mean, you're saying that that single district court should have had such power in the Tribe's mind that they didn't do the presentment. And that ­­ that seems an extraordinary thing. It's just a single district court. A single district court has no controlling authority over anyone or anything other than that particular decision.",
  "Why isn't there also a requirement that the law just not be burdensome over a certain level?",
  "Then why hasn't that burden been shown?",
  "There's something very intuitive about their argument, and it's ­­ it's essentially what Justice Kennedy said. It's ­­ it's when 50 States devise 50 different requirements for this, different formatting, different particular information requested, that just all adds up to a lot of hassle, which all adds up to a lot of money.",
  "Mr. Waxman, why was it that you introduced absolutely no evidence of burden in the lower courts here?",
  "Well, that sounds like a one­size­fits­all solution, and there's some value to States being able to think about their own health care needs.",
  "And to think about what things they want. So I mean, just again, let's go back to this burden because it is a very intuitive idea that you have on your side: 50 different States; that's a lot of money. But I guess I wonder why it is a lot of money. I mean, as I understand what's going on here, that all the data that's being requested is data that Blue Cross Blue Shield generates anyway. That all the data that's being requested is data that Blue Cross Blue Shield reports for other people. That really this is a formatting question, even with respect to the wide variety of States, that the States have started getting their formatting more uniform. So I ­­ I mean, you know, it's ­­ you can say it's 93 million people, but, you know, in the end what's the cost?",
  "And why don't you have it in the record?",
  "Mr. Waxman, I guess I just don't understand this argument. I ­­ I ­­ I mean, I ­­ I understand completely that there should be some restriction on overly burdensome State regulations of whatever kind. You know, it could be taxes, it could be day care, it could be anything. Right? But why is it that this regulation falls in a different category than taxes or childcare or anything else? Because the State here clearly is not attempting to, and is not regulating, payment of benefits. It's doing something that has an effect on your operations, no doubt, but the State is operating in a completely separate area for completely separate purposes in a way that does not trump or conflict with, or anything else, the choices that ERISA has made as to payment of benefits.",
  "Mr. Waxman, could a State pass a tax law that requires information about ­­ about pension disbursements, about claim payments, about assets held in trust? Could a State do that?",
  "A tax law that requires information of various kinds.",
  "Not impose a tax, that requires information in order to ensure that the State is taxing the right things.",
  "Do you think that a State tax law can't require any information about any of the things that ERISA does, that the plans do, pension disbursements, assets, claim payments, nothing?",
  "Well, Mr. Goldstein, you could have done that, too. The contract can go either way. The question is what's the default rule when the contract doesn't say anything.",
  "No, but remember, this is ­­ there's ­­ this is an exception for consent. The ­­ the company would have ­­ the store would have an extremely good argument that it didn't consent if it had signed a contract with anybody, with the Tribe, not just with the individual person. If it had signed a contract with the Tribe, saying we insist on a State forum, they clearly haven't consented.",
  "Well, it does when the Montana exception relies upon a consensual relationship.",
  "All of these arguments, your arguments ­­ let me figure out whether this is right. Your arguments about it's ­­ it's a nonneutral forum, it's an unfair forum, we don't know whether they have the same procedures that ­­ that are commonly ­­ that commonly exist in Federal and State courts. Those arguments have nothing to do with tort claims versus other claims; is that right?",
  "It's a bit of an odd argument, isn't it, Mr. Goldstein, that there's less of a sovereign interest in protecting your own citizens than in enforcing your licensing laws?",
  "There is one ­­",
  "There's one ­­ there's one significant difference there, Mr. Clement, which is that States are on a par with each other. So there's a kind of mutuality. So if one State does something to you that you don't like, you can turn it around and do it to them. And that mutuality also makes it less likely that the State will do that thing to you in the first place because they know that. So ­­ so I think what Mr. Farr says is the fact that there was this outrage with respect to a Federal court might not have registered in quite the same way when States were aware that they were on a par with each other and that they had many weapons that they could use against each other.",
  "Well, for sure, Mr. ­­ Mr. Clement, you know, you couldn't go to war with the neighboring State anymore, and that's a difference. But you could say, if you're going to treat me like that, I'm going to treat you like that. And ­­ and you have other ways of dealing with ­­ with a State that you wouldn't have with the Federal government.",
  "But ­­ but that does raise ­­",
  "But, Mr. Clement, Justice Scalia's question does suggest that there are sovereign interests on both sides of this. Right? There's ­­ one is I want to have sovereign immunity. I want to avail myself of sovereign immunity. And the other is I want to subject another State to my court system when I feel like it, and I want the choice of doing that or reaching an agreement with another State that we should all treat each other nicely. So on your view, the States are giving up some significant sovereignty interest. They're keeping one, but they're also giving up one. And the question that you have to answer is why ­­ why is it so obvious that the States would have made that choice rather than the other choice? Which is, hey, it's been working out for us just fine to have the choice and to deal with our States on a going­forward basis on principles of mutuality.",
  "Well, I think Mr. Clement says that there are two answers to that. One is that they actually never exercised that sovereign interest, so it didn't mean very much to them. And the other is that in exercising that sovereign interest, they would be violating norms of international law, so that they wouldn't have really thought that that was a significant and exercisable interest. But those are his two arguments against that.",
  "So Mr. Farr, Mr. Clement suggests that it's unthinkable that a State would be so concerned about being haled into Federal court but not just as concerned or even more so about being haled into suit of another State. What is the response to that?",
  "Mr. ­­",
  "You know, can I just ask you to ­­",
  "On that last point ­­ I think this is a very hard case straight up. But it's not straight up, right? You need a special justification on your side. So what is your special justification?",
  "Just to pin this down a ­­ a little bit, Mr. Hearne: You ­­ you are not contesting the factual finding that the predominant motive was to comply with the Voting Rights Act; is that right?",
  "Well, you keep on saying mixed motive, and I guess people keep on coming back to you and just trying to figure out whether you are, in fact, or are not, in fact, contesting that ­­ that the predominant motive was the Voting Rights Act.",
  "Was the attempt to comply with the Voting Rights Act?",
  "And this ­­ and the ­­ and the court found, and it is a factual finding, that that's the predominant motive? And I don't mean to harangue you on this. I just want to understand what your argument is.",
  "But I ­­ I thought ­­ I ­­ I thought, Mr. Hearne, that you were saying that the ­­ that the thing that you had presented had to do with an impermissible motive, and the impermissible motive was that they didn't have to do all this for Voting Rights Act compliance; is that right?",
  "Right. But that's the very thing that you said, you weren't challenging the factual finding, that that was a subsidiary part of the redistricting.",
  "The dominant part was the voting rights compliance, and I take it you want to undermine the voting rights compliance rationale. But then I'm stuck on the same question that Justice Scalia is stuck on, is what evidence did you present that ­­ that there was an impermissible motive with respect to that, as opposed to different views as to what the Voting Rights Act compelled.",
  "I guess I'm not sure what that means.",
  "Can you explain ­­",
  "I guess I'm just not really sure. Let's ­­ let's say that there's a policy that says we want to respect county lines. And we also know that we want to do one­person, one­vote, but we think we have, basically, some leeway up to 10 percent. And ­­ and there's a policy. We want to respect county lines, even though that's going to cause a little bit more deviation on the one­person, one­vote metric. Are you saying that that's impermissible?",
  "It's a policy. I mean, it's an intentional policy.",
  "Even though it just, say, takes you from 4 to 5 percent, or from 7 to 8 percent. You're not crossing the 10 percent threshold. But as long as you're going up, and you're doing it purposefully ­­",
  "­­ in the sense of we have a policy to maintain county lines, that's impermissible?",
  "Ms. ­­",
  "I thought it was because they wanted to make super sure that they complied with the Voting Act. I think ­­ I think that that's why they said they kept going.",
  "If I could ask the ­­ the question that Ms. Harrington left with, was that ­­ I'm sorry.",
  "Even ­­ if ­­ if you're saying that even within the 10 percent, you know, to go from 1 percent to 2 percent, or from 2 percent to 3 percent, and then somebody can come in and say that's partisanship, it means that every single plan will be up for grabs in every single place, doesn't it?",
  "Mr. Consovoy, of course it's true that when we apportion House members, we use total population as the metric. And the question that's raised by your position is why it would be the case that the Constitution requires something with respect to one apportionment that it prohibits with respect to another.",
  "I'm ­­ I'm sorry. Did I just understand you to say that you think that the ­­ the House apportionment rule is not clear?",
  "Well, Mr. Consovoy ­­",
  "Mr. Consovoy, could I go back to the question that Justice Breyer raised and can ­­ stripped, if he'll permit me, of the Guarantee Clause, because the Fourteenth Amendment is actually quite ­­ you know, the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment explicitly considered this issue, and, you know, made a decision. So Senator Howard, who introduces the Amendment on behalf of the joint committee that drafts it, talks about these deliberations. And he says the committee adopted numbers as the most just and satisfactory basis, and that's the principle upon which the Constitution itself was originally framed, referring back to the original drafting. And then he says numbers, not voters; numbers, not property; this is the theory of the Constitution. Now, this is the theory of the Constitution as to one thing, which is not the thing that you are talking about. This is the theory of the Constitution as to House apportionment. But again, I'll go back to this question. This is such a clear, explicit choice that was made about what it meant to ­­ to have equal representation with respect to that area. And how you go from that being mandated to it being prohibited in the State context is something that I still can't quite work myself around.",
  "That's a good person to be on the side of.",
  "I hear you as to that it does not apply. I mean, I guess I can ­­ I can understand. I might not agree with, but I can understand the position that says that the requirement might not apply. But you are suggesting that we go beyond that, and to say, not only does the requirement not apply, but that States have to do it the exact opposite way.",
  "What is the ­­",
  "Well, one of the points of your public employee cases generally, Mr. Carvin, is essentially to ensure that when the government acts as an employer, that the government be put in the same position as a private employer; in other words, that the various constraints that would constrain the government when it's acting as sovereign fall away and a different and lesser set of constraints apply that are meant essentially to ensure that the government doesn't use its position as leverage over things it oughtn't to be able to control, but that the government can do the same things that a private employer can. And so why doesn't this fall within that category of things? In other words, you've just said private employer can decide to do this. That's not a constitutional problem. So too with the government employer.",
  "As I said, Mr. Carvin ­­",
  "But there's a lesser set of constraints. And ­­ and the lesser set is basically to draw a line and to ensure that the government doesn't use its position as employer to do things it oughtn't properly to do. But the ­­ the government, when it's acting as an employer with respect to its employee workforce, really ought to be able to do the same things that a private employer can.",
  "Well, that sounds ­­",
  "­­ like you're drawing a distinction between restricting speech and subsidizing speech. And I had always thought that these were two sides of the same coin, that compelled speech is ­­ is no less and no greater an offense than compelled silence.",
  "Mr. Carvin, you come here, of course, with a heavy burden. That's always true in cases where somebody asks us to overrule a decision. It seems to be particularly true here. This is a case in which there are tens of thousands of contracts with these provisions. Those contracts affect millions of employees, maybe as high as 10 million employees. So what special justification are you offering here?",
  "You say this a lot in your ­­",
  "Excuse me.",
  "You say this a lot in your briefs. But I ­­ I ­­ I guess I found it hard to understand that the idea that every time we deny a claim of right, whether it's the First Amendment or the Fourth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment, that that denial of the claim would not have any stare decisis effect. I mean, we do that constantly. We do that tens of times every year.",
  "Yes. And your answer is essentially you don't need a special justification if the initial decision improperly denied a claim of right.",
  "I guess I'm saying that I find that an extremely difficult concept to understand. It would take away stare decisis effect from numerous ­­ I mean, just hundreds, thousands of our decisions.",
  "Well, Mr. Carvin ­­",
  "­­ remember, one, you're assuming that these provisions are completely severable, which I imagine depends on the contract. But number two, even suppose that they are severable, these provisions are bargained for benefits. The contracts would read differently. The unions would have gotten different things if that provision had not been there. So you're essentially saying that the exact same contract should go forward, notwithstanding that the union has given up things, or has not gotten things, because the agency fee provision is in the contract.",
  "The unions have ­­",
  "­­ for ­­ for ­­ for ­­ many ways of dealing with their need for adequate funding in order to perform their collective responsibilities ­­ collective bargaining responsibilities. They asked for this way and not for other possible ways of achieving adequate funding. And you would be essentially stripping them of this way, and not giving them anything to replace that with.",
  "Mr. Carvin ­­",
  "I mean, it seems to me ­­ I guess we have one disagreement, which is how well Abood fits with all of our other employee speech cases, because I think Abood fits pretty well. It didn't cite Pickering, but it essentially had the exact same concerns as Pickering, which was the employer's interest, the ­­ the government's interest as an employer, and how that related to an employee's speech right and ­­ and basically arguing for a ­­ a balancing test. So ­­ so really what your argument comes down to is two very recent cases, which is Harris and Knox. And there you might say that Harris and Knox gave indications that the Court was not friendly to Abood. But those were two extremely recent cases, and they were both cases that actually were decided within the Abood framework. In the Harris case, the parties came here and explicitly asked us to overrule that case. Almost all the briefing was about overruling that case, and the Court decided not to overrule that case and instead to say that ­­ that the employees there were ­­ were simply not public employees at all. So taking two extremely recent cases, which admittedly expressed some frustration with Abood, but also specifically decided not to overrule Abood, I mean, just seems like it's ­­ it's nothing of the kind that we usually say when we usually say that a precedent has to be overturned because it's come into conflict with an entire body of case law.",
  "Those cases ­­",
  "­­ start with Abood, Mr. Carvin. Those cases say Abood is the framework, and those cases decide the questions that they decided specifically within that framework.",
  "It's not a cite. It's a ­­ this is the way we look at mandatory fee cases.",
  "Bar associations do things all the time that lawyers disagree with. They engage in certain kinds of litigation and not other kinds of litigation. They take public policy positions on certain issues and not other issues. I mean, I ­­ I think it would be impossible to make a distinction along that score.",
  "Do you think bar associations do, now, nothing that ­­ that ­­ that members of the bar could disagree with and find hostile to their own views?",
  "Sorry, Ms. Shapiro. Could I ­­ could I take you back, because I just didn't understand ­­ and I'm sure it was me ­­ the ­­ the answer that you gave to Justice Sotomayor's first question. And I think it's important, because it focuses on what the actual issue is here: How much is at issue between the parties? If you had a judge that said, I don't think the evidence is up to snuff here, and then said, the thing that takes me over the line is what I think about the defendant's motive, and that's what allows me to say that the defendant is guilty, and that had not been proved, that had ­­ the State had never offered that into evidence. It really just came out of the judge's head for whatever reason. Right? Do you think that that would be a due process violation?",
  "Yes. Okay. But then ­­ so the first alternative that you gave, and you said it's not the claim here, but I would have thought it was the claim here because you ­­ there is obviously a dispute about how to read these words. And we can talk about the ­­ how to read these words. Right? But once you say, as I think you said, and I think you properly said, Look, if what the ­­ the judge's various comments on motive was basically taking him over the line, was ­­ that that was the basis for the verdict of guilty, that he didn't think that all the evidence, the other evidence was enough and that that was crucial to his finding, then, if I understand you right, you would say that's a due process violation because at that point the verdict of guilty is based on evidence that was never presented.",
  "Well, the judge is just saying it's not ­­ you know, this is not enough, and it's necessary for me to think about motive as the missing piece.",
  "Oh, I see. So you think that it doesn't matter if the judge thought that the evidence was insufficient as long as the evidence was, in fact, sufficient.",
  "Yes. The judge says, you know, all of this evidence, it's not enough. For me, motive is critical to a finding of guilt here.",
  "Okay. I mean, so maybe I'm putting words in your mouth, and so tell me if I am. But what I just heard was, look, if he's just telling a story to himself and he basically believes that the evidence that was presented is enough, but he wants to tell a story about some other things that make this all make sense, that's one thing. But ­­ but if he's really filling in the pieces and deciding ­­ and ­­ and determining guilt based on something that was never in the record, that's another thing entirely, and that that would run into all our statements about one accused of a crime is entitled to have his guilt determined solely on the basis of evidence at ­­ introduced at trial and so forth.",
  "Okay. So now I'm going to go back to Justice Sotomayor's second question. And ­­ but, I mean, just take a look at what he said here. All right? His first sentence is, all of the witnesses skirted the real issue. All right? So all of the witnesses ­­ there's something wrong with what we've heard from all of the witnesses. They all skirted the real issue. Okay. So what was the real issue? What was the real issue? And then he says, the issue to me is that you have a drug dealer on a bike who Larry Owens, the defendant, knew was a drug dealer, and Owens wanted to knock him off. That's the real issue. And then he says, the State's evidence has proved that fact. What's that fact? Well, that fact is the same thing that he's just said is the real issue, that there was a drug dealer on the bike who knew ­­ and the defendant knew he was a drug dealer and wanted to knock him off. And then he says, okay. Finding of guilty. I mean, to me, I ­­ I guess with all the deference in the world, it's just this judge saying, there's something wrong with all the evidence that's been given to me, and here's what's really moving me to find him guilty.",
  "But that ­­",
  "Well, I guess I ­­ this goes back to Justice Kennedy's question, I guess. We have these statements repeated over and over again. One accused of a crime is entitled to have his guilt or innocence determined solely on the basis of evidence introduced at trial. And what I hear you saying now ­­ and tell me if this is not what you're saying ­­ but what I hear you saying now is well, that's true as to real things that are extraneous to a proper factfinder's role, all right? But it's not true, as to ­­ I mean, I'm just going to say ­­ this made­up facts. It's not true as to made­up facts; that's different. You can make up facts, and ­­ and made­up facts don't come within this rule. Is that what you're saying?",
  "It's not just ­­ it's ­­ it's not just like so I feel good about the case when I go home at night. I mean, this is a factfinder who has a ­­ a very clear role, which is to adjudicate guilt or innocence. And motive, although not an element in Illinois, motive is relevant to identification, which, in this case, was all about identification. Everybody said that this case was about identification. So when the judge starts making up things about motive ­­ and I thought that the State really did not contest that this was all made up, that none of it was in the record that got ­­ you know, who knows how he got this. But he starts making up these things about motive, and then indicating that these things about motive are relevant to his adjudication. To me, I mean, clearly established or not, that just fits under this Taylor principle.",
  "I agree with you that there's a question of interpretation. So, I mean, it seems to me like everything comes down to that. Like, if you thought that this judge just made up facts and ­­ and then said, this is critical to my finding of guilt, I mean, I just think you'd have to say that that's a due process violation under Taylor. That ­­ that what you do have is you have the ability to come back and say, but that's not what the judge meant. That's not what the judge said, right?",
  "Okay. So ­­ so that narrows the issue. But then it's just like what was he saying, if that wasn't what he was saying?",
  "But they didn't conclude that. I mean, Justice Breyer has asked ­­ you have to give deference, I would think, on the ­­ the Brecht question, the question of harmlessness. But why would you have to give question on the merits ­­ on the merits issue? There was no merits determination. I mean, there are two ways to read this opinion, and neither one indicates that deference ought to be given on the merits. One way to read it is that they said it was error, but that it was harmless error. The other way to read it is that notwithstanding the fact that they said it was harmless error, they didn't really mean that. They didn't reach a decision as to the question of whether it was error. But even if that's the case, there's still nothing to give deference to on the merit side.",
  "Well, on harmlessness grounds.",
  "Whose adjudication on the merits?",
  "We might be going in circles, but I thought you just said if ­­ even if we ­­ we view this opinion as not reaching a determination on the merits.",
  "Harmlessness, you get deference on. There's no question. Harmless, you get deference on. The question is whether you get deference on the notion that this surmising about motive was not error. Because ­­ because to me, I read this opinion and I say they ­­ they never say it's not error. Quite the opposite. They declare it harmless error.",
  "Okay. So harmlessness, I think you're right, is entitled to deference. But assume if you think that this judge unconstitutionally convicted somebody on the basis of evidence that had never been introduced at trial. If you think that, how could that not be harmful? That's ­­ I mean, it's almost tautological. If the error is that he convicted somebody on the basis of evidence that was not proper to think about, well, of course, that's harmful. That's why he convicted him.",
  "When ­­",
  "Mr. Levenstam, I ­­ I guess I don't understand why you're ­­ I would have thought that the answer to Justice Alito's question was that you're not saying that what happened here ­­ what went wrong here, you're not saying, is that there was a superfluous finding of fact.",
  "You're saying that there is a superfluous finding of fact that actually went into the judge's ­­",
  "­­ final determination.",
  "It was not just any old superfluous finding of fact.",
  "It was not superfluous. It was a made­up finding of fact that created the judge's final conclusion that the man was guilty. That played some role in that final conclusion.",
  "But, Mr. Crooks, if I could take you back to your answer to Justice Kennedy. I take it that you don't need to use the word \"presumption,\" right? You're ­­ you're ­­ the burden that you have to carry in ­­ in a ­­ in plain­error review is you have to show a reasonable probability. And your argument would work just fine if you dropped the word \"presumption\"; isn't that right? And you just said that the anchoring effect of the Guidelines creates a reasonable probability that the outcome would be different in a case in which the Court initially thought that the range was different from what it turned out to be. Sort of the end. Who needs the word \"presumption\"?",
  "So I would think that the answer to Justice Kennedy's question is if the court of appeals really thinks it's not going to give relief because of the fourth prong, why would you bother remanding it?",
  "Why would ­­ why would the court of appeals bother remanding it? They could legitimately say it doesn't matter. We're not going to remand it because whatever happens on remand, we're not going to give relief based on the fourth prong. And if that's the case, why would the court of appeals remand it at all?",
  "But let's say that's right: Yes, the burden is on the defendant. But does the defendant meet that burden by saying, look, there was a mistake in the Guidelines; we know that there's an anchoring effect. That's what the Court said in Peugh. That anchoring effect creates a reasonable probability that the Court would have done something differently.",
  "Well, haven't we already answered that question in Peugh? In Peugh, the question was whether the likelihood was going to rise to the level of a significant risk. And we said yes. If you're using the wrong range, there is a significant risk that you would have made a different decision. So significant risk actually seems higher to me than reasonable probability. At least it's not demonstrably lower. So I would think that we've already said, if you're using the wrong range because of the anchoring effect of the range ­­ an anchoring effect that is kind of mandatory. It's ­­ you know, we say that these Guidelines are advisory, but we insist that a judge begin with them. So if you're using the wrong range, there is a significant risk. I would think so too, a reasonable ­­ of reasonable probability. Why ­­ why ­­ why is there a difference?",
  "What if there were 19 cases, Mr. Lamken, and Congress specified them all?",
  "Well, I guess what I'm asking ­­",
  "I guess what I'm asking is what that means, \"a limited category.\" Is the number irrelevant if Congress specifies them? I mean, Congress could specify a hundred. Congress could ­­",
  "Could Congress do it ­­",
  "Could Congress do it the day before a lawsuit is filed? In other words, Congress knows that a lawsuit is going to be filed on a particular subject and just creates the rule for that lawsuit, but the lawsuit hadn't actually been commenced yet?",
  "Suppose it weren't. Supposed it was like Congress amends the law so that assets held in Clearstream Citibank account is subject to execution by Deborah Peterson, before Deborah Peterson brought suit.",
  "But that seems silly ­­",
  "­­ Mr. Lamken, and that's why you've been saying that the number doesn't matter, and it doesn't matter whether it's the day before or the day after suit, and it doesn't matter if Congress has specified the docket number because any of those limitations, you would say, well, Congress could do, you know, pretty much the exact same thing except it would be in two cases, or except it would be without the docket number. And your answers suggest how, you know, a little bit nonsensical those distinctions would be.",
  "Why doesn't it make a difference that this is in the area of foreign affairs? I had thought that our cases were pretty clear that the political branches ­­ especially the executive, so I concede that there's a difference there ­­ but that the political branches have a great deal of power in this area, even when it comes to very particular controversies.",
  "Suppose there's ­­ suppose Iran were holding a great many American hostages, and Iran said, we'll release these hostages if you stop execution in a suit like this. And suppose Congress thought that that was a good deal and ­­ and said exactly that.",
  "I'm not quite sure I understood that answer, and ­­ and you're ­­ you're suggesting that if Congress has a good reason to extinguish these claims, then Congress can do it, but if not, not.",
  "No. I said Congress passes a statute that basically ­­",
  "­­ affects this deal.",
  "Does that mean, Mr. Olson, if I could, you're conceding that Congress could not say, we have a particular case, Smith v. Jones, Smith ought to win? Congress cannot say that, right?",
  "No, just under the straight separation of powers argument, that would be adjudicating if Congress said Smith wins in this case?",
  "I was giving you a simple hypothetical. I thought that you already answered this, but maybe not. Congress says, we see this case, Smith versus Jones. Smith wins.",
  "That's no good.",
  "So if that's right, now Congress takes a look at this case and says, we can't just say Smith wins. And then we just ­­ we take a look at the case and we say, oh, if you just tweaked the law in this particular way, Smith would win. So we tweak the law in this particular way for this case only. But we don't say Smith wins. We just say we're tweaking the law in this particular case for this case only. Is that all right?",
  "But usually when we say that, we're talking about amending the law that has effect beyond the particular pending case. And there we say, yes, absolutely, Congress can amend the law. Congress knew that it would affect these pending cases. No problem because Congress passed something, you know, that was within the scope of its legislative powers to amend law affecting this case and others. When you take out the \"and others,\" that seems to create a different kind of problem, one where Congress is doing our job rather than its own.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, do you ­­ do you agree with what Mr. Olson said, that Congress can't just pick a winner in a particular suit? Congress can't say Smith wins in this case ­­",
  "Okay. But then ­­",
  "The question that I gave Mr. Olson ­­ and I ­­ I'm searching here for an answer ­­ is ­­ is what happens if rather than just picking the winner, Congress amends the law, tweaks the law, modifies the law in such a way ­­ as to only this case ­­ in such a way that it's absolutely clear that the effect of that will be to pick a winner?",
  "And when you say, dictates the outcome, what do you mean by that phrase?",
  "Well, I don't understand how that helps you, Mr. Landau. You're saying that the test is what the source of authority is, and you're saying that the source of authority here is the Puerto Rican people.",
  "But that seems to be just ­­ you're not taking another step back. What's the source of authority of Puerto Rican people? The source of authority of Puerto Rican people was a Congressional act. If you go back, the ultimate source of authority is Congress.",
  "Well, but Congress today, if it felt like it ­­ and of course it won't. But if it felt like it, could Congress go back on that decision?",
  "Right.",
  "Even in saying that, Mr. Landau, you're putting Congress in the driver's seat here: It was done at the invitation of Congress. Congress approved it. Presumably Congress can unapprove it if Congress ever wished to. So if Congress is in the driver's seat, why isn't Congress the source of authority for the purposes of our Double Jeopardy jurisprudence ­­",
  "­­ which seems to make that the issue? I mean, you can imagine a different Double Jeopardy jurisprudence where the issue was who just exercises authority in the real world? But that seems not to be what we ask.",
  "It does seem, Mr. Unikowsky, as if Congress has given Puerto Rico as much authority as it possibly could have short of making it a State itself. Do you disagree with that?",
  "Mr. Unikowsky, it sure seems as though in the early 1950s, Congress with respect to Puerto Rico, said we want to give it some sovereign authority. We want to give it an enormous amount of Home Rule authority, basically everything, and we also have some idea in our heads that Puerto Rico ought to be a sovereign with all the things sovereigns have like a Constitution and a \"We the People\" clause. And ­­ and why isn't that something ­­ it's ­­ it's an unusual idea, to be sure, a ­­ a sovereign territory. But Congress seems to have wanted to do exactly that.",
  "Mr. Unikowsky, you ­­ you said before that Congress didn't mean to confer sovereignty here. Do you think Congress could do that?",
  "Do you think it's not possible, Ms. Saharsky ­­ I mean, putting aside whether Congress has done it here, but you think it's simply not possible for Congress to confer sovereignty in the sense that would matter for the Double Jeopardy Clause?",
  "Yes.",
  "But ­­ but ­­ but not short of that.",
  "So just to make sure I understand what you're saying, suppose there's somebody who comes into office, and it's a Democrat. And he says I want as many Democrats as possible in my office, no matter what jobs they're doing. Now, what you're saying is he can't demote or fire Republicans. He can't remove, demote, or fire people who have other political views, neither Democrat or Republican. But what he can do is he can get rid of anybody who is just politically apathetic. Is that your view?",
  "See, I ­­",
  "See, I had always thought that the ­­ the idea behind those cases is a different one. That the idea has to do with why the government acted. And once we say that the government acted for an impermissible purpose, which is to ­­ let's say in my hypothetical, get as many Democrats as possible into the government, once we say that's an impermissible purpose, it matters not at all whether the person is a Republican, an ­­ an independent, or somebody who has never thought about politics in his life, because the government is acting in a way that's wrongful, irrespective of that.",
  "So does that mean that the government can compel speech of a person if the person really just doesn't care one way or the other?",
  "I guess I'm not sure how that works. It just seems to break down very easily, if you can't have a broad rule that says that you can fire everybody but Democrats. But you're saying that you are going to allow somebody to come in and fire people one at a time.",
  "But you're saying ­­ and ­­ and I think you said this straight out ­­ you're saying I can come into an office ­­ I'm a Democrat. I can ­­ I can identify every person without a well­known political view, every couch potato out there, just fire one after another, after another, after another. Replace them all with Democrats, change the entire character of the office, do it for a reason that I prefer one political view to any other, and that that will not be a violation of the First Amendment.",
  "See, I had always thought that the First Amendment running through all our cases is an extremely strong strand. That part of the reason we have these protections is because we worry that government is doing things for impermissible reasons. That the government wants to create a world of speech in which everybody agrees with it and nobody opposes it. And that's a fundamental tenet of what the First Amendment and all our cases are about. And you're saying, oh, no. The government's motive doesn't really matter as long as you can't point to somebody who is holding up a sign.",
  "And the ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "Mr. Goldstein, I mean, if somebody had come in to me before today's argument and just said, does the First Amendment prevent the government from punishing a person because that person does not share the government's views, I would have said, why, yes, of course the First Amendment protects that. That's the whole point of the First Amendment. And now you're telling me, no, the First Amendment does not prevent the government from punishing a person because that person doesn't share the government's views, unless that person is actively opposed to the government's views. But if that person just really could not care less, which a lot of people in this country could not care less; they don't vote, they don't pay attention, they wouldn't know who was running. But the government can punish that person because that person doesn't share the government's views. And I would have said, that is one strange doctrine.",
  "I thought that one of the virtues of Carden was that it just set up very categorical, bright­line rule. Everything that's an artificial legal entity that's not a corporation ought to be treated in the same way. Doesn't matter what you call yourself; you can put trust in the title, or not put trust in the title. If you're an artificial legal entity that is not a corporation, that's subject to the rule of Carden. And there's something, too, just doing that in that bright­line, categorical way, so that we don't have to look at the thousands of different variations among legal entities and decide which fits in which box.",
  "But that's true of partnerships; it's true of LLCs; it's true of a wide variety of legal entities.",
  "Mr. Duggan, do you think it's possible that we took a bit of a wrong turn in ­­ in Carden? In other words, that, in fact, all of these entities should be treated like corporations and that the strongest arguments on the other side, you know, are really those arguments. And those arguments fly in the face of Carden but that ­­ but they're really arguments about why ­­ why not treat these just like a corporation?",
  "Mr. ­­ Mr. Findley, can I ask two quick clarifying questions just so I understand what's at issue here? Your argument applies to the navigable rivers generally; is that right? In other words, to the navigable rivers running through the federally owned land as well as to those running through the inholdings?",
  "And is there any information in the record about whether your client actually was running his boat on the portions which were ­­ are within the federally owned parts, or instead it's the inholdings? Is that what you called them?",
  "Yes.",
  "Was Federal ­­",
  "Was Federal public land?",
  "Okay. Thank you.",
  "Well, Mr. Findley, I mean ­­",
  "­­ whether or not that's true, agencies can change their mind about things. And I think that the question that Justice Breyer is putting to you is this question about what this provision means: \"Shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely to public lands.\" I mean, \"solely\" is a very purposive word, you know? I mean, Congress drops lots of words, but you put \"solely\" in a sentence when you mean \"solely.\" And this does not apply solely to public lands.",
  "Maybe ­­",
  "I guess maybe ­­ maybe you can explain that to me. But it seems to me that if you took it out of the statute, what you would have was to something that says no private lands shall be subject to the regulations applicable to public lands. And that's what you should want. If ­­ if it had said that, no private lands shall be subject to the regulations applicable to public lands, you wouldn't be here. You would have won your case already. But it doesn't say that. It says, \"No private lands shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely\" ­­ exclusively, only ­­ \"to public lands.\"",
  "So you're saying that the word \"solely\" distinguishes between statutes like the Clean Air Act and park land statutes?",
  "Because I understand why Congress might have wanted to distinguish between, like, the Clean Air Act and park statutes. But putting the word \"solely\" in, I got to say, does not do that for me.",
  "Well, tell me the imperfect way.",
  "Well, no. How does that do that? No, seriously. How does that distinguish between two different kinds of generally­applicable statutes, one generally applicable in applying to park lands and not park lands, and another generally applicable in the sense of applying to both public and private lands within parks.",
  "If I understand what you're saying, you're saying with respect to a river that's smack in the middle of federally owned lands, okay, a river that's in the middle of federally owned lands, what cannot happen is that the EPA can't come in and say there's some terrible pollution in this river, and we need to address it. That would be off limits?",
  "The Coast Guard can do it. The EPA can do. It's only the Park Service that can't do it?",
  "And I guess part of my question about this is, I look at that map, you know, and that map of this area has all this green land, which green represents real Federal park land, and there's a river that runs through it. And ­­ and you're saying that that river that runs through the park land, and nobody can do anything on ­­ or the Feds can't do anything on? I mean, this isn't the inholdings. I mean, I can understand the argument with respect to the inholdings and the rivers that are running through the inholdings. But this is the rivers that are running through the park land. Now, it seems to me a very strange thing that Congress would have created Federal lands in a Federal park land but said that the Federal Park Service can't have anything to do with the rivers. The rivers are like an important part of the park, aren't they?",
  "And if I'm looking at the right section, I mean, I would have thought that that was key to your argument, because it says in these management plans what you need is a ­­ is a \"description of privately owned areas which are within such unit.\" So it's clearly contemplating that there are these private areas that are within the unit.

  "Mr. Smith, can ­­ can I take you back to Justice Scalia's question? You know, because usually, at least now, we don't think much of subsequent history of any kind. Now, maybe they thought a little bit more highly of it in the days when Solem was written, but now it would ­­ it's ­­ it's pretty much of a stretch to use subsequent legislative history or subsequent history generally when we're dealing with interpreting a statute. And I'm just wondering: Is there a reason why it should be more credited here than in any other context?",
  "Mr. Smith, I ­­ I can understand why people might be concerned, for all the reasons that you're talking about. We do have pretty clear and settled law in this area with respect to diminishment, that we've said only Congress can diminish, that the idea is that we're supposed to look to congressional intent. And you say Congress didn't really think in these terms. And there's something that's fair about that. But Congress did use very different language in different ones of these acts, and we've looked to that language as a pretty good guide to suggesting which ones diminish and which ones do not. And it seems as though the language here in ­­ in the act in which we're concerned ­­ it's ­­ it's none of the language that would suggest that Congress diminished this act. So I was wondering if you could talk to that. Is there anything in the language of this statute that suggests a diminishment? Any of the usual kind of we cede everything, we relinquish everything? Like, what's the best you can do on that?",
  "Mr. Smith, on the City of Sherrill point, the Chief Justice asked you before do you agree whether this was ­­ whether this is waived. And you said, well, we cite City of Sherrill on page 25 or something like that. Below, what was the status of the City of Sherrill argument in the lower courts?",
  "I'm not sure quite what that means. Does that mean de facto diminishment under Solem, or does that mean ­­ Solem ­­ or does that mean that you talked about City of Sherrill as an independent ground?",
  "But I assume, Mr. Green, that there are a variety of circumstances in which police officers would really like to talk to somebody and really like to search them but don't have reasonable suspicion. And I think that the question that Justice Sotomayor is asking is if you're policing a community where there is some significant percentage of people who have arrest warrants out on them, it really does increase your incentive to ­­ to make that stop on the chance that there will be a warrant that will allow you to search and admit whatever evidence you gained in that search.",
  "Well, but this is an officer who ­­ you say this is a close call. So let's say that there are close calls. But you don't think you have reasonable suspicion, or you think you maybe do if you find a good judge out there, but ­­ but you ­­ there is a reason why you want to talk. So this is not a flagrant violation. This is not a dragnet search or something like that. But you ­­ if ­­ if ­­ I mean, it does change your incentives quite dramatically, it seems to me, if you're policing a community where there is some significant percentage of people who have arrest warrants.",
  "That's the only way they can be absolutely sure. But ­­ but here, there's ­­ there's some chance that they're going to find the arrest warrant and then they're going to be able to admit the evidence that they're going to get, whereas before, there was none. And that some chance is not like a once­in­a­blue­moon kind of chance. In these very heavily­policed areas, it's ­­ I mean, I was staggered by the number of arrest warrants that are out on people. So it's, you know, a significant possibility that you're going to find an arrest warrant and be able to admit whatever drugs or guns or whatever it is you find.",
  "So what is an intervening circumstance, in your view? What is your test for what it is?",
  "Okay. And your view is that we should look at the question of whether something is an intervening circumstance through the deterrence lens. That makes a lot of sense. We look at everything through a deterrence lens with respect to the exclusionary rule. And that, you know, what we're supposed to say is this ­­ does this appreciably increase deterrence or not; is that correct?",
  "And I ­­ so I guess, then, I'm back to my question. In a world in which finding somebody with an outstanding arrest warrant was an extremely low probability, you would be right. In a world in which it was an extremely high probability, you would be wrong. Then it seems like, where is this on the spectrum? What do we know about that? It sure seems ­­ I mean, again, I will come back to this. I was surprised beyond measure by how many people have arrest warrants outstanding, and particularly in the kind of areas in which these stops typically tend to take place. So that, it seems to me, you know, is a pretty strong argument for why this will increase deterrence.",
  "But I guess ­­ I ­­ I take the point, Mr. Bash, but I guess I just don't understand. Of course, this is a nationwide rule that we would be setting. But most Terry stops do not happen in most neighborhoods. Most Terry stops happen in very high­crime neighborhoods ­­ appropriately, but where people have lots of arrest warrants. And ­­ and you might be right about the specific Ferguson case, but I still have my question, which is why doesn't that dramatically change the incentives for police officers in deciding whether to search somebody? If you know that there is a significant possibility that somebody you stop is going to have an arrest warrant, that's another reason to stop them.",
  "But does that mean that we're going to have to, in every single case, explore the officer's subjective motivations? Because that sounds like the kind of inquiry that we've tried to stay away from in the past.",
  "How is it apparent that a particular veteran's business can perform a particular contract? I mean, what in the database shows you, yes, this veteran's small business is capable of performing this contract in a reasonably effective way?",
  "Well, what Justice ­­ what ­­ Justice Breyer raised a question about the way this statute is worded because it says, \"For purposes of meeting the goals.\" And the goals are very low; the goals are 3 percent. So it seems odd for a statute to say for persons of meeting a 3­percent goal, you should do the following, which will lead to 90 percent.",
  "How high?",
  "That could be four percent.",
  "No, it sounds like the government did very badly in meeting its goals. And you can understand why Congress would have done something to say the government ­­ and specifically the VA ­­ has to do a lot better toward meeting its goals. But the goals are still, you know, pretty far down compared to what Justice Breyer was indicating is the natural tendency of this system that you're describing to produce ­­ you know, almost everything is given to a veteran.",
  "Mr. Tripp, I guess I'm not sure I understand. I mean, I understand your policy concerns and ­­ and the way you think this will damage procurement practices. But the statute just seems pretty clear. Once you say that this is a contract, what you've said in your brief and right now. And once you say that, it just ­­ the statute says, \"A contracting officer of the department shall award contracts on the basis of competition restricted to veterans' small businesses.\" So that seems to kind of answer the case, whatever the policy identifications are.",
  "Well, it's your own understanding of contract. You just said this is ­­",
  "­­ contract.",
  "But as I understand it, all of those contracts have a \"may\" in there.",
  "Or almost all of them do.",
  "Yeah, but ­­ but most of them have a \"may.\" But here you have ­­ and ­­ and the \"shall\"s, the one or two that there are, have really never been adjudicated by ­­ certainly by this Court.",
  "So the question is, well, there we are. We are, you know, for the first time deciding what this language means, and this language means that you shall award contracts on the basis of this restricted competition. And you say this is a contract, so you know, end of case.",
  "One of the amicus briefs suggests that the VA is now doing increasingly complex procurements by way of the FSS. That we have it in our heads that this is all about, you know, staples and paperclips, but that, in fact, the FSS is being used to do things that would previously have been done on the open market.",
  "Mr. Tripp, can ­­ can I ask, what effect would this statute really have on your view? As I understand it, the government does have to use the Rule of Two on all open­market purchases; is that right?",
  "Above, like, a very low threshold? Is it 3,500, something like that?",
  "So ­­ so if you're right, what did this statute actually accomplish? In other words, you already have to use the Rule of Two for open­market purchases, or almost all of them.",
  "What does the statute do?",
  "What are the kinds of things that aren't done under the FSS? Like, what's the remaining 80?",
  "Can I ask ­­",
  "Can I ask: If you were doing this just on policy ­­ very odd, but you know, we have a text that everybody's off of at this point. And ­­ and maybe some viewed that what happened in 1952, for some of the reasons that Justice Breyer gave, is perhaps not the most relevant thing. If you were doing it just on policy, would you come up with this same test?",
  "But I don't know how far that gets you, Mr. Phillips, because Mr. Martinez just told us that he'd be happy to call willfulness his test. And willfulness has meant different things to different people here.",
  "And there's nothing that Congress did that suggests that, when it used that word \"willfulness,\" it really meant the Seagate test.",
  "No. But take a case where ­­ take a case where there's somebody who absolutely wants to copy a product. He says, Mr. Jones ­­",
  "A patented product.",
  "All right? So same thing, let's call it. Mr. Jones sells a product that involves a patent, and it's selling very well. And Mr. Smith comes along and says I want to copy that patent and that product and sell the same thing so that I can reap those profits too, and ­­ and does that. Now, the Seagate's test says that as long as his lawyer can come along at the end and raise some kind of doubt about the patent's validity, the fact that ­­ I forget whether it was Mr. Smith or Mr. Jones ­­ but the fact that ­­",
  "The fact that he went and said I am going to copy this patent so that I can reap the benefits of some other person's work, that doesn't make a difference. And that's, I think, the question that Justice Kennedy was asking. It seems to stick in the craw a bit.",
  "Right. But that's not enough. Because, you know, if I'm Mr. Jones and I'm saying is it worth my while to go copy this patent, and I think, you know what? A lot of patents are not valid. I'll take this risk. I will ­­ I will make a lot of money selling this patented product, and if somebody calls me on it, I'll go hire myself a lawyer, and that lawyer will come up with some kind of argument about why the patent is not valid after all.",
  "That seems like it's a bad ­­ that seems like a bad incentive.",
  "Well, Mr. Jones, suppose you had been able to show this. Suppose you had been able to show that it was a dealer who dealt in intrastate marijuana exclusively. What difference would that have made under the terms of the Hobbs Act?",
  "Well, you see, that's the thing. I mean, I don't think that the Hobbs Act requires the government to show an effect on interstate commerce. As you said in your opening statement, the Hobbs Act only requires an effect on commerce, and then commerce is defined: Commerce means all commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction. Now, for sure the United States has jurisdiction over interstate commerce, but under Raich it also has jurisdiction over intrastate drug trafficking. And so if you just sort of put the pieces of the statutes together, it seems to make it completely irrelevant whether the drug trafficking was intrastate or interstate, because in either case, it was commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.",
  "But ­­ but doesn't the Hobbs ­­ doesn't Raich say that the government has ­­ the United States has jurisdiction over intrastate drug trafficking?",
  "So why isn't that enough? Because this statute, again, does not require that there be an effect on interstate commerce. It ­­ it affects ­­ it requires that there be an effect on commerce as defined in the statute. And as defined in the statute, all it says is that the commerce has to be one of a kind over which the United States has jurisdiction. And Raich says the United States has jurisdiction over even intrastate drug dealing.",
  "Well ­­",
  "Mr. ­­",
  "Mr. Jones, I guess I'm trying to figure out what we're disagreeing about. So let me give you a proposition, and you tell me whether you agree with it. The Hobbs Act prohibits robberies that affect marijuana trafficking, whether the marijuana trafficking is interstate or intrastate. Do you agree with that?",
  "But why is that? Because that's what I was saying at the beginning, that it seems clear to me that under the terms of the Hobbs Act, the Hobbs Act does prohibit robberies that affect commerce. Raich says commerce includes both interstate and intrastate marijuana trafficking. So the Hobbs Act prohibits robberies that affect marijuana trafficking generally, whether it's interstate or intrastate. What's there to disagree with in that?",
  "Well ­­",
  "Well, but I said ­­ I used the word \"affects.\" I didn't use the word \"regulate.\" I said the Hobbs Act prohibits robberies that affect commerce. Commerce is either interstate marijuana trafficking or intrastate marijuana trafficking under the definition in this statute. So you ­­ the government has to show that a robbery affected some kind of marijuana trafficking. It doesn't matter what kind. Wouldn't you agree with that? I mean, it just seems ­­",
  "­­ it's the current of the statute plus Raich.",
  "Well, I guess this goes back to Justice Kennedy's question. I mean, seems to me pretty self­evident that a robbery of a business affects a business. Wouldn't you think that that's right?",
  "I mean, I don't think that the word \"affects\" is doing a whole lot of work here, because of course a robbery of a business affects a business, right?",
  "Okay. So ­­ so it's not really \"affects\" that's the problem here. The problem seems to be that you're resisting the notion that the business could be entirely intrastate. But what I'm suggesting is that the terms of the Hobbs Act itself, given Raich, make clear that the business can be intrastate, because the definition of commerce here doesn't say \"interstate commerce.\" It says \"commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.\" And because of Raich, we know that the United States has jurisdiction over even intrastate drug dealing.",
  "Well, that seems to me a different kind of argument that you're making now. Now you're not saying that the question is whether the marijuana that was being dealt was intrastate or interstate. Now you're suggesting that what you really wanted to prove was that this person wasn't a dealer at all; is that correct?",
  "But ­­ but if ­­ if ­­ if I can make sure I understand. The jury is told that you have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant affected commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.",
  "Is that right?",
  "Does that have ­­",
  "­­ to be found beyond a reasonable doubt?",
  "But whether the United States has jurisdiction over the marijuana trade, be it inter­ or intrastate, has already been decided by Raich.",
  "Is it ­­",
  "But that's the question, Mr. Yang: From marijuana dealers. I mean, it seems to me the defendant could say, no. I was targeting a home grower. You know, the kind of person from Raich. I just ­­ I was growing this marijuana for myself. I had no intention of ever selling it. At that point, you wouldn't be robbing somebody who was engaged in commerce, right?",
  "There are ­­",
  "Well, maybe the person wasn't a dealer.",
  "You said it was a very different thing.",
  "And it would be a much harder thing.",
  "And it would be at least an awfully good argument by the defendant that if the person was not a dealer, it's not affecting commerce in the regular ­­ in the relevant way?",
  "I'm not sure why it is that when you say it was subject to FERC's jurisdiction, that doesn't end the case right there against you, because if it's subject to FERC's jurisdiction, that means it's a wholesale sale. And that's for FERC to do is to set the rates and other terms of wholesale sales, and that's not for the States to do. So that means you're preempted.",
  "Are you saying that Maryland didn't set the rates just because they use an auction? Is that what you're saying?",
  "That's true of FERC itself. FERC doesn't set rates anymore, either. It allows an auction to set rates, but we would never say that that doesn't mean that they are FERC rates, that they are FERC­approved rates. And so here, the fact that Maryland decided not to set rates directly but to allow an auction to do it, I mean, that's just a mechanism that Maryland chose. They are still Maryland's rates.",
  "Mr. Strauss ­­",
  "If I understand what you just said, you're not relying on Mr. Strauss's argument. Mr. Strauss said that this wasn't a ­­ setting a wholesale rate because Maryland did it by auction. But you're saying that's irrelevant; that Maryland could have just picked a price, and ­­ and that that would have been fine so long as at some point FERC had the power to review and veto it. Is that what you're saying?",
  "Well ­­",
  "I guess I ­­",
  "­­ I don't understand that. I mean, just take a hypothetical case where ­­ where Maryland said to all its utilities, this is the price and this is the only price that you will pay for electricity.",
  "Are you ­­ are you saying that ­­",
  "­­ Maryland could do that?",
  "Okay. Then you are saying that everything's dependent on the difference between picking a price and letting an auction pick a price. But I guess I ­­ I'll repeat the question that I made to ­­ to Mr. Strauss. I mean, we know that one of the ways that you pick a price is by letting an auction determine that price. That's exactly what FERC does.",
  "Mr. Clement, it ­­ it does seem to me important what the kind of State action is. And this goes back to the question that the Chief Justice raised with you. If the State had just said we need another power plant and had delivered a load of money to CPV and said go build a power plant, you're not saying that that would be preempted, are you? If it's not at all, it ­­ it ­­ you know, that's going to have an effect on the kind of bids that CPV is going to make. But the State is not itself changing the outcomes of the auction process. You wouldn't say that's preempted, would you?",
  "Ms. O'Connell, you ­­ you have both arguments field and conflict. If ­­ if you were to win this case, would you rather win it on field or conflict?",
  "And why?",
  "Well, why do you even need the sort of change­in­incentives language? Why isn't the field preemption argument more that this ­­ this ­­ this scheme essentially takes the rate that the auction produces and changes that rate for CPV and for all the utilities in Maryland?",
  "No, but that's ­­ but that's ­­ when Mr. Clement said that there's a real difference here between voluntary agreements ­­ you know, if there's a contract for differences, fine, but that this is Maryland coming in and effectively forcing the LSCs to enter into such a contract, and by doing so, changing the wholesale rate.",
  "See, when we ­­",
  "Well, but I don't see how that could be true. If FERC could, in fact, get rid of the problem, then it leaves you with no conflict.",
  "Can I ­­",
  "Ms. Villa, can I understand what you said? You said you're relying primarily, then, not on the common­law history but on the ­­ the ­­ just the language, \"use... of physical force\" and what that means, the ordinary meaning of those words, is that correct?",
  "But why isn't ­­ any of these examples that people give about the reckless behavior? Why ­­ why couldn't that be a use of force? I mean, Justice Sotomayor said throwing a plate against a wall. You say, well, I have a better example. It's driving a car really fast in a way that will endanger all the inhabitants. But, of course, we've said a number of times ­­ I mean, we said it most recently in the Sykes case that a car is ­­ is an instrument of force when used recklessly in that way. So why aren't all of these kinds of examples consistent with the ordinary meaning of use of force?",
  "Of course, you're ­­ you're adding language to the statute now because you said against another person, and that is indeed the language in Leocal. But in Leocal, we said we're not going to decide the question here, which is just the phrase \"use of physical force,\" not against another person, just the phrase, \"use... of physical force.\" And tell me ­­ I mean, I guess your car example doesn't move me very much, so see if you can give me an example which would be reckless behavior under a battery statute but which you think would not involve the use of force.",
  "You just said it. He closed the door very forcefully behind him.",
  "That's the ­­ that's the use of physical force.",
  "I know. And that's why it's reckless and not knowing or whatever the other term is. But ­­ but you're still using physical force. And that's the ­­ that's the term that has to be interpreted here, is the \"use... of physical force.\"",
  "Well, quite right. But the language ­­ I feel like I'm repeating myself a little, so I'll just try it one more time. The language is just the use of force. And what we are trying to decide is whether that includes use of force that indeed is carried out without an intent to harm, but is carried out with an understanding that there is a risk of harm. That's what recklessness is. And ­­ and, you know, doing something like driving a car 200 miles an hour, or throwing a plate, or slamming a door when somebody's hand is in the vicinity, all of those things involve the requisite risk and all of those things involve the use of physical force.",
  "But we wouldn't think that the common law has some great definition of the word \"use,\" would we?",
  "Yeah.",
  "I mean, I hear you today as basically making an ordinary meaning argument, which I think is a good thing because all the briefing on both sides of this has been talking about the common law until it's coming out of your ears, and it's not clear to me why the common law makes any difference at all here. I mean, you know, Congress was operating against a backdrop. It was not the backdrop of the common law; it was the backdrop of 50 States having battery statutes. There's no word in this statute which is a defined ­­ you know, which is a ­­ a settled common­law term. So the question is, what was Congress doing? Congress, we said in Castleman, wanted to basically capture the set of battery statutes in which ­­ which were used for people engaged in domestic violence. Almost all of those statutes use \"recklessness\" within them. Why isn't that the proper place to look rather than the common law?",
  "You're saying that the signature would not be enough because that could be pro forma? Is that what you're saying?",
  "So I'm ­­ I guess I'm ­­",
  "I guess I'm a little bit unclear as to what you're arguing. I mean, one rule could be did the judge have some significant involvement in a critical trial decision as a lawyer. Is that your rule, or are you adding something to that rule?",
  "There's something ­­",
  "Well, do they have to hear ­­",
  "Excuse me.",
  "There's something unsatisfying about the remedy that you're requesting, right? Because if the idea is that one judge can affect a whole panel, which seems right to me, but presumably that effect doesn't go away the moment that we send it back and they have to deal with it again, so aren't ­­ don't they continue to be tainted in some way?",
  "What is the standard on rehearing? Is ­­ is ­­ it must be a very different standard, isn't it?",
  "It's ­­",
  "Mr. Eisenberg ­­",
  "If I understood your answer to the Chief Justice, you said significant involvement in a critical trial decision would be a critical factor in deciding when a person had crossed the constitutional line. You then simply said that there's kind of a statute of limitations on it, and because this is 30 years ago, that makes a difference. Am I understanding you correctly?",
  "I'm not sure I understood the difference there. You mean you have to be in trial in the courtroom as opposed to in the office making critical strategy decisions about how to prosecute a case?",
  "Well, just ­­ I mean, just go back to what the test is. So it's significant involvement in what, at what time?",
  "And what time is the critical time?",
  "Is it six months? Five years? Ten years?",
  "But as I understand you, the one factor that seems to be controlling here is the time limit. And other than that, there's ­­ everything points to due process demanding a recusal, except for the time limit.",
  "He made the most important decision that could be made in this case.",
  "I'm sorry. Isn't there a difference between those two things?",
  "Do you think he didn't take that decision extremely seriously?",
  "Suppose this case were exactly the same, except he had done it three years ago. What would your answer be to that?",
  "What would your answer be?",
  "Are you piercing the corporate veil as to the first company, or as to the transferee companies?",
  "Right. Because ­­ because I understood your whole brief to be pursuing this on a recipient theory.",
  "And your brief, you know, makes some sense as that. But then when you look back to your complaint, it suggests that the veil­piercing actually was attempted as to the transferor company, which doesn't do you any good under your theory.",
  "It does make the language \"false pretenses\" or \"false representations\" completely superfluous, yes?",
  "Ms. Murphy points out that there are lots of other provisions in 523(a), which have a lot of overlap on this provision on your reading. And then also the fraudulent conveyance provisions, if you would talk a little bit about those.",
  "Well, you just said you're not contesting that fraudulent conveyance is a form of actual fraud; is that right?",
  "So, now, this language ­­ I mean, the language just seems a lot more simple than you're making it, because you add inducement to the language, you add from the creditor to the language. But the language doesn't say any of those things. It just says is there a debt? And we know that there is a debt here. The debt is for money. The language says, well, what has to be true of that money? It has to be obtained by actual fraud. And here, the money, the allegation is, was obtained by fraudulent concealment. So whether or not the creditor has been induced and whether or not the money has come from the creditor seems to be irrelevant under this very simple statutory phrase.",
  "The transferee ­­ the transferee obtains the money by way of the fraudulent conveyance, right? How else does the transferee obtain the money?",
  "Through a fraudulent conveyance.",
  "But it would be a very strange thing, Ms. Murphy, if ­­ if I agreed with you, if I were Congress and I said, I want to make it really clear that this should be only intentional, false pretenses and false representation. There are a gazillion ways to do that, but starting with the simple one, saying intentional false pretenses and an intentional false representation. But the one thing I wouldn't do, I think, is to say actual fraud. Because actual fraud is not synonymous with ­­ with intent. Actual fraud refers to ­­ to conduct that's done with a certain kind of intent. And that conduct, as you just said, includes more than false representation and false pretenses. So I wouldn't use a term that had to do with conduct just to state a mens rea requirement.",
  "But if I have that case right, that case is actually a case about a fraudulent conveyance. It's not a case about a false representation. So they said, look at this case. It's a case about a fraudulent conveyance that suggests that there's more fraud in the world than just misrepresentations. And we want to make clear that that's going ­­ that that's supposed to be a part of this.",
  "But it is current.",
  "It is current at all the time in which he resides there.",
  "Well, then, you're just reading pursuant to subsection (a) out of the statute.",
  "Excuse me, Mr. Gannon. It tells you exactly what it means to be a jurisdiction involved. It means a jurisdiction involved pursuant to a particular subsection which focuses only on his current residence. And all the time he was a current resident of Kansas, the registry was accurate.",
  "Mr. Gannon ­­",
  "It seems to me that what you're saying is that each of those offenders is supposed to recognize the underlying purpose of the law, which is to have accurate registries, and to do everything he can to serve that underlying purpose. And we would ­­ you know, it would be good if everybody did that. But the text of the law is something different. And if you look at this text of the law, there's just no way that a reasonable reader reads that text and says it requires me to provide departure notification when I leave to another country.",
  "So you can say well, he's supposed to keep it current, and ­­ and that's right. He is ­­ he should keep it current, because we would all like sex registry. But the statute provides very specific details about what it means to keep it current, and it seems to me he has conformed with every single one of those requirements.",
  "You know, he could have, and he should have.",
  "But he didn't have to under ­­",
  "­­ this statutory language.",
  "It ­­ it says he has to have informed at least one jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a), and subsection (a) makes clear that the only jurisdictions that they're talking about are the jurisdictions in which he currently either lives, works, or is a student.",
  "And that morning ­­",
  "That morning, everything was current. And then when he left Kansas, he's not subject to this statutory provision anymore.",
  "That ­­",
  "That is 16921(b)? Is that the one you're referring to there?",
  "But 16921(b)(3) is specifically an obligation that's placed on officials. It has nothing to do with any obligations on offenders.",
  "So but an offender is supposed to look at a statute that places only an obligation on State officials and to say, really? That obligation applies to me as well?",
  "Could I ­­ could I ask a question, Mr. Gannon, of absolutely no legal significance? Chalk it up to curiosity. Does the Federal government bring many of these prosecutions? Because I might have thought that when sex offenders leave the country permanently, the attitude might be like, good luck and good riddance?",
  "But you're not ­­ you're ­­ as I understand the requirement that even you say he's subject to, it's just a requirement that says he's leaving the State. It doesn't ­­ he's not required to tell you where he's going in the world. He could be going to the Philippines or any other country. So it doesn't really help us in terms of, you know, helping our allies deal with sex offenders. I'm just curious why it is that people ­­ why DOJ makes the decision to bring sex offenders back to this country in such circumstances.",
  "I am right, right, that when you say he had the responsibility to keep the registry accurate, that's just to say he had the responsibility to tell Kansas he was no longer in Kansas.",
  "Even on your view, he had no other responsibilities.",
  "Right. And I completely understand that, Mr. Gannon, but even your own interpretation doesn't get you the information ­­ (Lights out.)",
  "My red light on the bench is still working.",
  "­­ does not get you the information that you need in order to tell the Philippines, look, you have a sex offender in your midst.",
  "Ms. Toti, could I ­­ could I just make sure I understand it, because you said 11 were closed on the day that the admitting­privileges requirement took effect; is that correct?",
  "And is it right that in the two­week period that the ASC requirement was in effect, that over a dozen facilities shut their doors, and then when that was stayed, when that was lifted, they reopened again immediately; is that right?",
  "It's almost like the perfect controlled experiment as to the effect of the law, isn't it? It's like you put the law into effect, 12 clinics closed. You take the law out of effect, they reopen.",
  "Mr. Keller, the ­­ the statistics that I gleaned from the record were that 900,000 women live further than 150 miles from a provider; 750,000, three­quarters of a million, further than 200 miles. Now, that's as compared to just in 2012, where fewer than 100,000 lived over 150 miles, and only 10,000 lived more than 200 miles away. So we're going from, like, 10,000 to three­quarters of a million living more than 200 miles away.",
  "Well, can the legislature say anything, General? I mean, if the legislature says we have a ­­ a health­related abortion regulation here, we've looked around the country and we think that there are ten great hospitals in the country, you know, Massachusetts General, Brigham and Women's, and we're going to make all our abortion facilities conform to the standards of those hospitals, and that will ­­ you know, that will increase medical care. Now, it's true we don't make anybody else doing any kind ­­ other kind of procedure conform to those standards, but we think it will increase health benefits if abortion facilities conform to them. Would that be all right?",
  "So every abortion facility has to hit the standards of MGH. That would be all right?",
  "I'm sure that there's medical evidence that if every hospital, if every facility was as good as Massachusetts General, they would be better facilities. I'm sure that you could find doctors to say that, because MGH, it's a great hospital. But that would be okay, even though it's not applied to any other kind of facility doing any other kind of procedure, even though we know that liposuction is 30 times more dangerous, yet doesn't have the same kinds of requirements.",
  "General, could ­­ could I ask ­­ could I go back to a question that ­­ something that you said earlier? And tell me if I'm misquoting you. You said that as the law is now, under your interpretation of it, Texas is allowed to set much, much higher medical standards, whether it has to do with the personnel or procedures or the facilities themselves, higher medical standards, including much higher medical standards for abortion facilities than for facilities that do any other kind of medical work, even much more risky medical work. And you said that that was your understanding of the law; am I right?",
  "And I guess I just want to know why would Texas do that?",
  "No, I know, but ­­ but the assumption of the question, and I think you haven't challenged this assumption, is that there are many procedures that are much higher risk: Colonoscopies, liposuctions, we could go on and on. And ­­ and you're saying, that's okay, we get to set much higher standards for abortion. And I just want to know why that is.",
  "But, of course, the ­­ I mean, Texas's own regulations actually have made abortion facilities such that that can never happen, because you have continual inspections, I mean, to your credit. So that was really not a problem in Texas, having a kind of rogue outfit there. Texas has taken actions to prevent that. So, again, I just sort of ­­ I'm left wondering, given this baseline of regulation that prevents rogue outfits of ­­ like that, why it is that Texas would make this choice. And you say you're allowed to make this choice, and we can argue about that. I just want to know why Texas would make it.",
  "Are you ­­ are you in ­­ you're not really contesting that there are greater complications in abortion facilities than there are with a great deal of medical procedures that do ­­ that are not subject to the same standard of regulation.",
  "So, Mr. Carvin ­­",
  "­­ let's assume that that's true and that that is ­­ counts as an injury­in­fact. We also have this other requirement in the law, which we talk about a lot less, but it seems to be quite well established, which is that there needs to a kind of legally recognized interest. So it's not just that you have to have an injury­in­fact, although you have to have that, but that there needs to be an injury to a legally recognized interest. So what is the legally recognized interest here that the ­­ the legislators are banking on?",
  "No, that's ­­ that's ­­ that's, you know, he wants to be elected. He has been injured­in­fact in the kind of practical ways we can all understand for the injury. But this other part of the test really suggests that you need a kind of legal recognition of your claim, and that's what I'm searching for here.",
  "Are you saying that that part of our standing doctrine which does look as to whether there is a legally cognizable right is only good for plaintiffs, and that once the inquiry shifts to the defendant, it just completely drops out of the picture?",
  "I wasn't ­­ I wasn't ­­ I wasn't contesting the injury­in­fact requirement. I think I was ­­ I was asking about ­­ and it really is a question ­­ how this other separate requirement, which is that the invasion of ­­ that has to be to a legally protected interest applies in the context of a defendant. And you're just suggesting it drops out entirely. And I guess I'm suggesting ­­ I mean, I might be right, but it seems odd that a plaintiff would have to show it, and a defendant, it ­­ it just disappears from the inquiry.",
  "So the legally cognizable interest is ­­ just finish the sentence for me.",
  "That just ­­ that just makes the legally cognizable interest the same as the injury­in­fact requirement.",
  "Mr. Carvin, can I ­­ can I take you back to the merits? Let me give you a hypothetical. It's not this case. It's a different case.",
  "Let's say that there are some racist mapdrawers, and ­­ and they say, here's what we're going to do. We're going to set districts, and we really want to segregate African­Americans. And so ­­ and they say, that's our ­­ that's our first aim. But we also have a second aim. It turns out that African­Americans vote in a particular way. And so our second aim is that we are going to achieve some kind of partisan advantage as a result of this segregation.",
  "Now what should be the right answer to that question? Is there strict scrutiny in such a case?",
  "You're making ­­ you're making my hypothetical more complicated than it is. We're just ­­ this it one district, we're just going to segregate all the African­American voters in this district. We're doing that primarily because of racial reasons. We don't like African­American voters, and we're just going to keep them all in one district. And secondarily, that has politically­beneficial consequences for us.",
  "Is ­­ and ­­ and so the question is, is that unconstitutional, because you know, if I look at that, I say, okay, that's ­­ the race was your primary motivation. That triggered strict scrutiny. You failed strict scrutiny; you're out of the ball game. But you suggest that you're not out of the ball game because you have this secondary interest which coincides with the clearly racist conduct. And that's the question that I want you to answer.",
  "Okay. So then ­­ then you're ­­ then it seems to me you're changing your argument because in my hypothetical, both of these things run together. They're not in conflict with each other.",
  "So you're saying the ­­ the critical question is not conflict. I had thought that you thought that the critical question was conflict. Rather, the critical question is which is the primary motivation or which is the but­for purpose, and which is the secondary motivation, even if both run in line with each other. That's a different kind of test.",
  "This is ­­ this is ­­ it's very clear, just as it is in this case I have to say, they have a list of criteria, and number one on the list is race. And then we have a lot of direct evidence in my hypothetical that this is for the most heinous racial purposes imaginable.",
  "And the question is, does the fact that it also has political benefits, does that insulate these line drawers from what you would think is the obvious conclusion, which is this is unconstitutional conduct?",
  "Well, he says, this is our first priority.",
  "But in my hypothetical ­­",
  "­­ it's his first priority because he is a racist line drawer.",
  "That ­­ that sounds to me as though it's a harmless error rule for racial discrimination. And we've never had a harmless error rule for racial discrimination. What we've said is, look, we just found racially­discriminatory purpose, end of case.",
  "Yes, but ­­",
  "Well, the first seven words of that quote are \"in a case such as this one.\"",
  "And the question is what did they mean by that? And one understanding of what they meant when they said \"in a case such as this one\" is in a case in which there was no direct evidence of racial motivation but only circumstantial evidence, and ­­ and the ­­ and the absence or the presence of a map was indeed relevant to the question of whether that circumstantial evidence added up to the conclusion that race was the motivator.",
  "No. It's just in a case such as this one, the case before us.",
  "Well, why didn't we ask for a map in Alabama?",
  "Is that what you're making it right on? Do you agree with the Solicitor General that a simple statement from the line drawers that they were trying the best they can to comply with the Voting Rights Act, that that is not sufficient to ­­ to have strict scrutiny apply?",
  "Yes. No. I got that. I'm saying assume a different ­­ a different set of facts where they weren't just saying we have to stick at 53.1, or we have to go at 55.55 percent. Assume a different state of facts where line drawers simply say of course our first priority is to comply with the law. Do you think that that itself triggers strict scrutiny?",
  "So what you think triggers strict scrutiny is essentially the use of a mechanical target here?",
  "It's not related to the ability to elect?",
  "But if you ­­ yeah, I ­­ I'm sorry. I ­­",
  "I guess I find this a little bit harder than you just suggested, because this is not Representative Forbes saying, I want to choose exactly the set of voters that's going to increase my own electoral chances. This is Representative Forbes saying, look, there has been an act of the legislature, and the ­­ the act of the legislature has given me a certain set of voters, and why don't I have a legally cognizable interest in relying on that legislative judgment when some court has taken it away?",
  "Well, I take the point, Mr. Carvin, but isn't that really exactly what we confronted in Alabama, which is ­­ you know, the number one priority was the VRA, but then it turned out that they had misunderstood the VIA, so it turned out that the number one priority was a racial quota, which had nothing to do with the way the VRA is really supposed to operate?",
  "Mr. Katsas, can I ask a question that ­­ this is an analytical question, not necessarily at all an argument that your result is wrong, but I ­­ I guess I'm confused by what you said now and what you say in the briefs that this is a matter of looking to the focus of the statute, because my understanding of Morrison is that this whole focus inquiry came in at the second step of the analysis. In other words, once the Court had decided that the presumption against extraterritoriality had not been rebutted, then there was an additional argument that had been made like, oh, this really does involve domestic conduct. And so the Court used this focus test to decide whether it was the domestic conduct or the extraterritorial conduct that was the focus of the statute. But that doesn't seem to answer the question whether the presumption is rebutted at all, and it doesn't seem to answer the question that I think you're trying to get at, and it's an important question, as to whether we look at that presumption question section by section or for the statute as a whole.",
  "I ­­ I guess I just would have thought that the question is whether these are discrete provisions in some way such that a conclusion is to the extraterritoriality of one doesn't really effect ­­ doesn't tell you anything about the extraterritoriality of the other. And it seems much less important as to what the focus of the statute as a whole is even if, you know, one could ­­ if one could answer that question.",
  "Well, that may have been true, or largely true at the beginning, but how about all these amendments that happened after 9/11 which clearly seemed focus on foreign conduct, foreign organization, foreign harm?",
  "Well, possibly they have some domestic application. But if you ask, but why did Congress pass this amendment at this particular moment in time, what was ­­ I mean, recognizing that it's sometimes hard to figure out what was in people's heads, I mean, don't you think that what was in Congress's heads at that moment in time was foreign terrorist organizations committing terrorist conduct on foreign soil?",
  "Well, this just means ­­",
  "­­ foreign organizations, even as to that.",
  "That at least suggests foreign organizations.",
  "Well, the ­­",
  "I mean, the whole point of RICO is that it does both. It says \"a pattern of conduct,\" and it links that pattern of conduct to the enterprise. And it seems to be, you know, a little bit of a fool's errand to decide which the focus is, when ­­ when RICO is clearly something that melds the two and says there is a pattern of conduct and it relates in various kinds of ways to an enterprise.",
  "Well, the fact that some things can be separated doesn't mean that everything can be separated. And the question is, how is it possible to understand RICO except as something in which these things are intermelded, and at the very least that ­­ one is not prior to the other or more important than the other. I mean, if we are going by our cases, we've said about a hundred times that it's the predicate acts that are ­­ that are the foundation of RICO.",
  "Ms. ­­ please. Sorry.",
  "Well, then, can I interrupt and talk about your comity concerns, because I understand them. I mean, they seem very important. But once you say that the presumption against extraterritorial is rebutted, on both the pattern of racketeering and the enterprise, once you say that, then drawing the line where you draw it seems to be very policyish. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of law behind it. So I want to give you an opportunity to make it as law­like as you can, drawing the line here.",
  "Well, Mr. ­­ Mr. Frederick, I understand that argument with respect to what's the ordinary remedial provision of a statute. But this is something a little bit more than that, right? Because this statute also ­­ this provision also includes substantive elements that don't apply except in the civil suit for damages. Isn't that right?",
  "So why doesn't that make the difference?",
  "Mr. Martinez ­­",
  "If I could ask you about the ­­ what I take to be the Respondent's primary argument in the case now, which is the meaning of this phrase \"the provisions of this chapter in Section 1346(b) shall not apply\" ­­",
  "­­ and of course, that would include the judgment bar. So if you take that provision for all it's worth, it says that the judgment bar shall not apply. So what is your response to that?",
  "That really does make the ­­ the language something it's not. Instead of the provisions of this chapter in 1346(b), that's what the provision says, you're essentially reading it to say Section 2674 of this chapter and Section 1346(b). So that's a real shift in what the language actually says.",
  "That's a ­­",
  "No, no, no.",
  "We're all being so polite today.",
  "2679 is different, though, right? Because 2679, the text of it, says that the exceptions shall be applicable to FTCA actions. So although the Court didn't directly confront this issue, what it might have said, if it had confronted the issue, was something like, well, 2679, which comes along later, and says all the exceptions are applicable to FTCA actions, essentially says ­­ creates an exception to the general rule of inapplicability.",
  "That's slicing the bologna pretty thin.",
  "I mean, you know, they're trying to set up language that applies to a whole bunch of different provisions and saying, you know, all of these provisions don't apply in the context of lawsuits, basically.",
  "Now that's where the Respondents use an argument very much like the one you just used. They say definitions don't apply to claims; isn't that right?",
  "It's a wash.",
  "But presumably just then the normal appeals provisions would apply. You would still be able to appeal a case; you just wouldn't have this special court of claims option.",
  "Before ­­ if I could just interrupt very quickly.",
  "Of the other three, which ones are still current today?",
  "Could I take you back to the \"shall not apply\" language for a second? When ­­ when you were speaking to the Chief Justice, you said, well, the definitional section will continue to apply because definitions apply to terms and not to claims. But then Mr. Martinez said something very similar to that. He said the judgment bar applies to judgments, not claims. So if you're right as to that, why isn't he right as well? And the consequence of his being right was ­­ is that he would have taken the judgment bar out of that sweeping \"shall not apply\" language as well.",
  "Mr. Landau, could I ask you to focus on the text here a little bit? Because this gateway theory of yours, I'm not sure it matches up with the text very well. I mean, you could have a gateway provision which said something like, Puerto Rico is a State for all purposes except Chapter 9, or except for any provision in Chapter 9, or something like that. But Chapter 9 ­­ but this provision, 101(52), is written much more specifically. It says except for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under Chapter 9. So it's not any provision in Chapter 9; it's just for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor.",
  "So, Mr. Landau, I ­­ I think I get what you're saying now, which I didn't when I started with. You're saying they couldn't just say it's a State, except for purposes of Chapter 9, because, in fact, there's something that's outside of Chapter 9 that determines who gets into Chapter 9. So what they did was they said it's a State, except for purposes of this gateway, and then they assumed that that meant that all of Chapter 9 wouldn't apply either. That's your basic argument.",
  "So ­­ but before 1984, before this amendment, this 903(1) did apply to Puerto Rico; wasn't that right?",
  "So you're saying that the really super significant change, which is 903(1) applies to Puerto Rico before 1984, and then doesn't apply after 1984 because of this definitional move that they made here in 101(52). What you have to admit is ­­ I'm not quite sure what the ­­ the word ­­ I mean, it's a ­­ it would be a mysterious way, it would be an extremely kind of cryptic odd way to make such a major change.",
  "I mean, it's almost like somebody doesn't want everybody to recognize what a major change is being made ­­",
  "­­ and figured out this way that is ­­ where nobody would understand that that was happening, including the judges who would have to decide what this meant.",
  "Please.",
  "Mr. McGill ­­",
  "Can I talk to you about Mr. Landau's textual argument? Because I came in here thinking that your best argument is straight on the text. It's not about purpose, because I don't know what Congress's purpose here was; it's not on policy. It's just straight on the text. But I now have a better understanding of Mr. Landau's understanding of the text, and so I just want to engage you on that, which is: Look, Congress couldn't have just said \"except for purposes of Chapter 9\" because of this flukey thing, which is that the gateway provision is outside of Chapter 9. So if it had just said \"except for purposes of Chapter 9,\" somebody could have said, oh, well, look, I am entitled to be a debtor under Chapter 9, whether or not I'm thought of as a State. And so they did it this other way, which said ­­ which attacked the gateway provision particularly. And then in doing that, they assumed that all of Chapter 9 would follow in its wake. Once you're not eligible for Chapter 9, none of the provisions of Chapter 9 apply to you. That's basically Mr. Landau's provision ­­ argument. So tell me why that's wrong.",
  "Well, Mr. ­­ Mr. McGill, if I could go back to Justice Breyer's question, because Justice Breyer gave you a view of the way to read this text, which is built on Mr. Landau's view, and said, what's wrong with that? And you ­­ you go with the gateway provision, and then even if not all of Chapter 9 follows in its wake, at least all the provisions in Chapter 9 that refer to debtors follow in its wake. And Justice Breyer said, what's wrong with that, as a way to read this text. And then you answered him, I think this is fair to say, by giving a ­­ a story about what Congress meant to do in 903(1) in the wake of Faitoute. But, you know, both of you have stories about this, and it's not ­­ just not clear which of you is right. And I guess what I most want to think about is this text. Why isn't Justice Breyer's, Mr. Landau's view of the text just as good, if not better, than yours? And I didn't come in here thinking that, but now I kind of am thinking that. So talk to me about the text, why that's not just as good a view of the text?",
  "But that's ­­ that's a purpose that tells you whether you're now in Chapter 9 as a debtor.",
  "So what Mr. Landau is saying is once you say you're ­­ you're ­­ you're not a State, when it comes to who may be a debtor under Chapter 9, that it's a pretty natural thing to say, and that means that any provisions about being a debtor under Chapter 9 don't apply to you.",
  "Well, Mr. Clement, that might be so. But what happens if somebody did just object to objecting? It seems all your arguments would apply the same way. In other words, somebody comes in and says, I do object to objecting because objecting will make it easier for the government to fill my slot. That's a perfectly understandable thing to say. And that's part of my sincere religious belief. And you say the sincere religious belief is what controls. And there too it would seem under your very theory you would have to say that that's a substantial burden, even if it's objecting to objecting.",
  "Yes. Yes. I mean, we have the same penalties that we have here, and the person is just objecting to objecting. And that's part of the religious belief because that will make it more likely that the government will be able to fill the slot and to take efforts to, you know, to ­­ to provide contraceptives.",
  "Well, it's a hypothetical that's directly implicated by your very theory of the case, because your theory of the case says that everything depends on a person coming in saying this is against my religion, and that being the end­all and the be­all.",
  "You're just not answering the question.",
  "So if I understand that answer, it's that if a person had a sincere religious belief that objecting to objecting was a form of complicity, then that would control, and you would have to go to the second part of the analysis, which is to say, is there a compelling interest test? Has the government's response been narrowly tailored? But essentially, the objecting ­­ the difference between objecting to objecting and your clients' position is not a difference at all with respect to the burden analysis.",
  "I guess what I'm saying, Mr. Clement, is I understand the factual distinction that you're making, but the factual distinction doesn't matter given your own legal analysis.",
  "I thought there was a ­­ a very strong tradition in this country, which is that when it comes to religious exercises, churches are special, and that ­­ you know, we have said this most recently in Hosanna­Tabor, but it's a long line of cases which says that there's something very special about churches themselves. And ­­ and if you're saying that every time Congress gives an exemption to churches and synagogues and mosques, that they have to open that up to all religious people, then the effect of that is that Congress just decides not to give an exemption at all. And that's why there are some people who are extremely strong RFRA supporters who have deserted this cause right here, Professor Laycock among them, because of the mortal danger that it poses to churches.",
  "Mr. Francisco, I have to admit to not quite understanding this argument, that ­­ it seems as though the most important laws, the laws that serve the most compelling interests, are ­­ often have exceptions in them. There are often small business exceptions. There are often transition rules, like the grandfathering provision here. And if, every time that existed, somebody could come in and say, well, the government must not really believe in this law because there is an exception to it, state ­­ allows some people ­­ then, I mean, we might as well pack it all in. There's not a law in town that doesn't have exceptions like that.",
  "It's lower and lower every single year.",
  "Here is the deal you would put in place, Mr. Francisco. You would be saying to Congress, Congress, next time you pass a law, don't put in an exemption for churches; you're going to get in real trouble doing that. Don't write transition rules that will help people adjust to a new legal regime; you're going to get in real trouble doing that. Don't write exemptions for small businesses, even though there are very particular concerns that small businesses face; you're going to get in trouble for that. Now, those are terrible incentives to give to a legislature, are they not?",
  "Mr. Francisco, may ­­ may I ask a question? Is there any accomodation that the government would offer that would in fact result in women employees of your clients, or students of your clients, getting health care as part of an employer­based plan or a student­based plan, getting contraceptive coverage? Is there any accomodation that would be acceptable?",
  "No, no, no. Through ­­ in other words, is there ­­ is there any ­­ you object to this notification. Is there any kind of notification that would be acceptable?",
  "No. The religious employers, their employees do not get contraceptive coverage through the employer­based plan. I'm suggesting ­­ I'm asking whether there's any accommodation that would result in the women employees getting contraceptive coverage seamlessly through an employer­based plan that you would find acceptable.",
  "Well, what might be acceptable if it puts enough distance?"
