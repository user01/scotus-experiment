  "Mr. Olson, are you giving up on your earlier arguments that there are ways to avoid the constitutional question to resolve this case? I know that we asked for further briefing on this particular issue of overturning two of our Court's precedents. But are you giving up on your earlier arguments that there are statutory interpretations that would avoid the constitutional question?",
  "Mr. Olson, my difficulty is that you make very impassioned arguments about why this is a bad system that the courts have developed in its jurisprudence, but we don't have any record developed below. You make a lot of arguments about how far and the nature of corporations, single corporations, single stockholder corporations, et cetera. But there is no record that I am reviewing that actually goes into the very question that you're arguing exists, which is a patchwork of regulatory and jurisprudential guidelines that are so unclear.",
  "But the facial challenge - -",
  "Going back to the question of stare decisis, the one thing that is very interesting about this area of law for the last 100 years is the active involvement of both State and Federal legislatures in trying to find that balance between the interest of protecting in their views how the electoral process should proceed and the interests of the First Amendment. And so my question to you is, once we say they can't, except on the basis of a compelling government interest narrowly tailored, are we cutting off or would we be cutting off that future democratic process? Because what you are suggesting is that the courts who created corporations as persons, gave birth to corporations as persons, and there could be an argument made that that was the Court's error to start with, not Austin or McConnell, but the fact that the Court imbued a creature of State law with human characteristics. But we can go back to the very basics that way, but wouldn't we be doing some more harm than good by a broad ruling in a case that doesn't involve more business corporations and actually doesn't even involve the traditional nonprofit organization? It involves an advocacy corporation that has a very particular interest.",
  "But what if the court doesn't, as Justice Scalia has posited? The court here could do the same thing, depending on the secret being disclosed. It could set up any number of protective mechanisms. The issue is broader than that, which is: Why is the public policy of anti-disclosure any more important in the attorney-client privilege than in the trade secret context?",
  "Ah. Are you sure?",
  "But isn't the role - - the central role -- role, is to encourage the frank and open communication between client and attorney? That's the purpose of the rule, isn't it?",
  "All right. If that is the purpose, the very existence of exceptions infringes that purpose. The minute you create an exception, you are placing some sort of limitation to the frank and open discussion that you are permitting, so the damage is already done. The further disclosure doesn't really serve the purpose -- or help the purpose in any meaningful way. The fact that an erroneous decision on attorney-client disclosure is not going to stop people from talking to lawyers if they really need to and they are staying within the rules.",
  "Well -- but that's what I'm trying to figure out, because you are positing that erroneous decisions on disclosures are being made routinely by the lower courts. Assuming, as I do, that there are some erroneous disclosures, but that that's not necessarily the majority, why is there an incremental erosion significant enough to overcome our interests in the finality rule?",
  "What is the use -- I'm -- I'm sorry if I cut you off. But what is the use by the adversary lawyer that you are worried about? That the lawyer is going to used information against your client, correct?",
  "So there is a remedy. After final judgment, if the information was disclosed erroneously, the court sets aside the judgment, sends it back, and says, you can't use it in the future and so make your case without it.",
  "Why isn't that an effective remedy for the harm that you are claiming exists in the disclosure?",
  "You have to a right to choose your lawyer and not to be -- and not to be represented by a -- by a different lawyer, and yet we don't permit that to be interlocutorily appealed.",
  "Why is this any greater in terms of the harm that your client suffers?",
  "I understand what the court below did. I'm just following up on your point about the importance of this privilege and why it's critical that it be subject to interlocutory appeal as opposed to the final judgment ruling.",
  "Are you -- just so I'm clear about your position, are you arguing that all issues related to attorney-client, whether they are waiver, crime or fraud, scope of the privilege, et cetera, that all issues are immediately appealable because the public interest is the same in all cases related to the attorney-client privilege, or are you wanting us to limit this rule only to the waiver cases?",
  "So -- but your position logically would apply to everything, wouldn't it?",
  "Otherwise, how do we distinguish or make a difference in your analysis?",
  "No one is doubting its importance. The issue is whether or that importance outweighs the finality rule. That's a very different thing for you.",
  "That is in the Third Circuit.",
  "Ms. Resnick, can you go back and articulate what you see as the rule that we have on what is important enough? Because that is what really is at question. So how would you articulate a rule that would apply both to the cases in which we have granted interlocutory appeal and to those that you are advocating we don't. Because it's not just freedom from suits like qualified immunity or double jeopardy. We have granted interlocutory appeal in other cases, including in the Cohen case.",
  "But it's only going to jail that gives you criminal intent.",
  "That's immediately appealable.",
  "What if asks for a lawyer. He said: I don't want to talk to you without a lawyer, correct?",
  "And the State doesn't provide him with a lawyer, correct?",
  "All right. So what gives him an understanding that one will be provided the next time he's questioned?",
  "No, because we tell the police they have to stop.",
  "So presumably they wouldn't re- engage until the lawyer is present, correct? That's what Edwards tells them not to do.",
  "Well, this is a different part of your argument. This is not the custody or break in custody. This is the time and the fact that such a prolonged period of time has minimized any coercive effect, correct?",
  "Catch and release then no longer -- catch and release is unimportant to you? There is no meaning to Edwards in that situation, because every prisoner, because he is a captive, is questioned in a place and then told to go back to his room. His room happens to be a locked cell. So he doesn't have the freedom to leave and he doesn't have the freedom necessarily to make calls to discuss his choice with anyone.",
  "This is a very different situation then someone who is free to go home.",
  "Because he is not in custody, when he is in jail.",
  "When he can't leave - -",
  "What -- there is no small - -",
  "Counsel, the hypothetical you are positing is an investigation about unrelated crimes. We are talking about, and I think it's what Justice Ginsburg was pointing to, it was an invocation on this crime, on this criminal activity, not one in another State or another police department. And so that's a substantially different question.",
  "What is the shortest time period that any circuit court has found a break in custody in a similar situation?",
  "Between the invocation of counsel and a requestioning. You said a number of circuit courts have recognized this break in custody theory.",
  "Which are days?",
  "Any are days?",
  "I don't want to interrupt that, but there were two aspects to Edwards. One was the coercion, but the other was the respect for the advisement of counsel. And so the test that you are proposing only addresses the coercion prong of it, not the respect for the invocation of counsel.",
  "Can I ask something? What does that have to do with the hypothetical Justice Alito gave you, which is the person is not in custody, right?",
  "He is arrested for joy riding; he is let go; and you are saying that for 20, 40 years he is now immunized from being reapproached by the police under the Edwards rule?",
  "So you are advocating that no break in custody ever stops the Edwards clock.",
  "But you are now -- you are now accepting your adversary's point that somehow a -- a change from a locked room in a prison to a different locked room is a release from custody.",
  "If we don't -- if we don't accept that proposition, isn't there a clear break when someone is let to go home? When someone is released and permitted to go home?",
  "Counsel, we - -",
  "We don't have a case. None of the cases in this area, where we have applied Edwards, has dealt with a situation with -- where a prisoner has been released from custody, in any sense of that word, i.e., sent home. In all of the three situations that I am aware of, in which the Edwards rule has applied, the prisoner has stayed in jail -- some form of jail. Correct?",
  "Well - -",
  "Could I have a clarification of the facts for a moment? In 2003, he was in one State facility, a sentenced prisoner. Correct?",
  "And he was just moved from one State prison to another. He wasn't in pretrial detention in either of these timeframes. Correct?",
  "We are just talking about a change in facility, not in status?",
  "What were the circumstances? I don't recall the case.",
  "Was the prisoner in a prison the entire 24 hours? Or was the individual released home, that sort of - -",
  "Your adversary says that they -- he can't change his mind. It has to be a spontaneous, you know, somehow they have to be in a room together that wasn't planned and he has to come up and say, I am confessing out of the kindness of my heart. The police can't even approach him, according to you, once he has invoked counsel, to ask him whether he wants to change his mind.",
  "That's the point.",
  "So there is no termination point, really?",
  "But -- but there was no difference in those cases, as I understand it. Each of the prisoners was in a particular room being questioned, and then he was released into a more general room later.",
  "And brought back.",
  "There is no difference between that and a holding cell, a maintenance room, and being put back into general prison to go sleep.",
  "Can I ask you something? In your definition, you appear to hinge it on the fact that the force used has to cause injury of some type, that. That appears to be the only definition you can give. But the use of physical force means just the use of force, strong force, violent force, aggressive force, but it doesn't mean that it necessarily has to cause injury. Would my rearing back and slapping you? In those instances slapping doesn't cause physical injury as that term is defined in the common law, which is an injury of lasting effect. You may have some redness for a second, but that's all. Would that qualify as a crime of violence?",
  "Well, but violence has a broader meaning. It generally means a strong force or a strong -- physical force generally has some relative degree of -- of impact. I agree with you, the common definition talks that way. Why should we read something more into it, like physical injury?",
  "Many will, but don't - - serious use of force doesn't necessarily always.",
  "Counsel -- I'm sorry. Please finish and then I will - -",
  "Counsel, you see that you don't have the inquiry. The issue is not whether it causes serious injury or not, the issue is whether the nature of the force used is physical force. And, so, if you look at the common definition of \"physical force\" in the dictionary, which your adversaries did very well in their brief, physical force has in its ordinary meaning the use of some strength, of some power, and generally kissing doesn't require that strength or power, touching someone on the shoulder, doesn't. All of these activities are prohibited by this statute if they are unwanted. So the question is not whether or not they present the risk of physical injury, the issue is whether in all applications or in a substantial number they don't require the use of strength to -- in its application. That's a different question.",
  "Mainly because -- now we are getting to Judge Easterbrook's argument about the dime -- you know if I touch myself, I have now used force.",
  "How -- I'm sorry. Before you go on, your adversary claims you waived by not raising this as an -- as an alternative in the sorts stage. Could you fold that into your continuation of this answer?",
  "Shouldn't we be looking - -",
  "Counsel, at the time that (h)(1)(C) -- or (D) was being looked at, wasn't it a fact that some circuits had reviewed the prior exclusion as applying only to the date in which there were actual hearings before the court?",
  "So isn't it -- shouldn't we be looking at what you did with respect to this time period in light of the need that it was addressing?",
  "Well, what's wrong with the logic of district courts who have ruled in this - - in the government's favor, that say Congress was only looking at that particular part of the proceeding - - what related to the hearing, the filing of the motion, its actual adjudication -- but they weren't considering a motion by the defendant for time to investigate, and that can be another proceeding? Can you imagine a situation in which a court grants that adjournment to a defense attorney where we would reverse that finding by the court?",
  "But -- it would seem to me that if a defense attorney comes to a court and says, I need an adjournment, and the Court says, you can have it, isn't that implicitly a proceeding in which the court is saying there is a need for this?",
  "\"Proceeding\" doesn't mean an act -- it is an act before the court. The entire action is before the court. But it is a proceeding in which the defense attorney is looking at whether there's anything to file motions about.",
  "Well, the Senate did.",
  "Wait a minute. If a defense attorney comes in to you and says -- I'm a district court judge -- I need time to prepare; granted, I am excluding time under (7)(A). You are saying that is insufficient?",
  "But it's not okay for a district court to say, you tell me how much or you have 21 days to prepare motions and I'm excluding time because of that?",
  "Local rule from a district court judge: Defendant is arraigned; you have 21 days to file motions.",
  "Could you finish answering one earlier question. You said that there is no statute of limitations problems if we rule in your favor. Could you explain why?",
  "Could under that retrial provision the court begin excluding time?",
  "That's what I mean.",
  "Do you have any idea how many convictions would be at risk for reversal under this rule, that would be currently pending and subject to a ruling in your favor now?",
  "In a timely manner.",
  "Counsel, do you disagree with your adversary, that there is no statute of limitations problem if we rule against you?",
  "But is it superfluous? Because what your adversary is saying is that Congress wanted district courts to think about why some things were being -- additional time was being requested. Not all motions by defendants would a district court actually feel were warranted and might say to that individual if they came in: Look; that shouldn't take you three weeks; that should only take you a week.",
  "But that doesn't answer my point. Without a requirement that the judge actually has to make a finding in the interest of justice, once the defense attorney comes in and says, I want a month, and isn't the judge required to give him the month because it's automatically excludable? What, otherwise, forces the judge to look at the request and say, no; is it really in the interest of justice for me to give you that month?\"",
  "So what -- so what additional requirements are we imposing on the judge that the statute itself doesn't command?",
  "If the judge always has to listen to the reason, weigh it, determine whether or not it is in fact in the interest of justice or not, how much more burden are we putting on a judge than to say, look, you are right, you need a month; I will exclude it under (7)(H).",
  "We have never required the judge to give a litany of each of the factors under (h)(7). We have never required him or her to do a detailed finding. We've just required them to say there's some reason for it.",
  "That's what Zedner seems to suggest.",
  "Is that a normal course of practice? I've never quite heard of other - -",
  "But then the Court's view a decision or statement that no motions are going to be filed as a request for a waiver of that obligation?",
  "Intent to waive.",
  "Well, I didn't see it as a motion. It didn't move to waive. It said, \"I waive.\"",
  "Do you have any idea of how many, if we rule against you, until we -- speaking hypothetically, how many convictions would be at risk for - -",
  "But it's -- it's not everybody who invokes a Speedy Trial Act violation objection.",
  "I would have been -- I would have been interested in knowing the effects of Zedner.",
  "And how -- what kind of burden it placed.",
  "But that's true of all Speedy Trial Act actions by the district court. They always run the risk of forgetting to make a finding. That's why you have two attorneys, presumably - -",
  "-- to remind them.",
  "What record do you have of that fact?",
  "Yes.",
  "That I understand, but crush videos is only one species of cruelty to animals. What evidence was there that, for example, dog fighting had as large and robust a market or that hunting videos in those States in which hunting was illegal had a robust market, et cetera?",
  "Could you -- could you tell me what the difference is between these video and David Roma's documentary on pit bulls? I mean, David Roma's documentary had much, much more footage on the actual animal cruelty than the films at issue here, greater sections of the film, and more explicit. In this film, the -- the Respondent didn't let the video show the actual tearing of the jaw. David Roma's did much more than that, showed much more than that. So isn't -- doesn't there have to be a judgment inherent in this statute?",
  "But it's not in child pornography because, there, Congress says the very act -- it doesn't matter how artistic it is. That very act of child pornography is illegal.",
  "What do you mean by \"even-handed,\" please? I'm not -- you are using those words. What do you mean about \"even-handed and narrowly tailored\"?",
  "I don't understand -- I don't understand that point at all. If you thought that he didn't have standing to challenge the cross at all and that the injunction itself directing you to cover up the cross was wrong, you should have come to the Court. It was a permanent injunction. You were told you have interlocutory appeal rights, you have final judgment rights. At any point you could have come and said: The order for us to take that flag -- to take that cross off this land was just plain wrong.",
  "But interlocutory appeal or finality doesn't matter what you are going to do to get away from the injunction. The issue is did you give up any rights to challenge any of the issues embodied in that injunction and you haven't answered why not. You may have a right, and you do, to challenge a modification of that injunction. That's what you are here to do, to say the Ninth Circuit erred in modifying the injunction and stopping the transfer. Perfectly legitimate point, because the injunction has been changed. But you can't go back and relitigate whether he had standing to challenge that -- the presence of that cross.",
  "Isn't there legislation that requires the original plaque to be reinstated, the plaque recognizing the donation and what it means?",
  "This would be on government land, that sign? It wouldn't be on the acre that you transferred. I'm a little confused.",
  "You are talking about putting - -",
  "Would go on the cross?",
  "The larger sign you're talking about that you are willing to do is a sign that you would put on government land.",
  "Did you raise that alternative with the Ninth -- with the district court and the Ninth Circuit?",
  "Can -- can -- what, what -- let's start from the beginning. Can -- would it be proper for the government or would the government be alleged to have violated the Establishment Clause if on another ranch that cross -- a cross went up?",
  "All right. So really your argument is that the reason this Court -- this cross on private land, if it becomes private, is offensive to the Establishment Clause is because of the government's prior history with respect to that cross, correct? That's -- that's your argument?",
  "So are you alleging that doing that violates the Establishment Clause, passing or designating a religious symbol as a national memorial, that that violates the Establishment Clause?",
  "Does that apply to all lands in this preserve?",
  "Does the reversionary interest apply to all of lands on this preserve? Maybe your adversary has to answer that instead of you, but all of the other private property owners.",
  "No, no, no. Are all of the private owners on this preserve required to give the land back to the U.S. if they put it to some different use?",
  "Counsel, the circuit court did things in an unusual order. Instead of reaching the statutory question, it reached the constitutional question, in par, because it viewed the two as intertwined. Why isn't its judgment that there's a statutory violation what's at issue before us, because that's what they said?",
  "Why not?",
  "No. It's an award that is contrary to the act.",
  "That's the - -",
  "Well, I saw it in their brief to the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit analyzed the requirements of the act and of circular one and said the board's ruling is not based on those.",
  "That's true generally, but if the board believes that as a matter of law it can't hear this dispute and consider normal grounds for excusing a failure to include something in the record because, in its own language, we can't do it, the law doesn't permit us to do it, we have no jurisdiction to consider matters outside the record, we don't apply normal rules of waiver or forfeiture or any of the other rules that attend themselves to a failure of a party to immediately raise a defense like you could have done and waited two and a half years to do, doesn't that suggest that the board is not reaching -- merely resting its decision on a merely procedural rule, it's resting its decision on its erroneous view that the law deprives it of jurisdiction to hear the case?",
  "No, but that -- this is not merely a question of law. This is a question of jurisdiction: Is it entitled to hear a dispute by law?",
  "Don't you think there is a big difference between the adjudicator saying: I could, but I choose not to because there is no reason for your failure, from: I won't because I can't.",
  "Those are -- those are two very different concepts.",
  "Can -- can we -- I'm sorry. Let's assume that in a published opinion there are two procedural defaults. One, the union does; the other, the railroad does. The board says, you know, I am resolving this dispute. I'm not forgiving the union's procedural default, but I will forgive the railroad's procedural default, because they're an important lifeline business for America and we've got to make sure that they're protected at all costs, and union members are just not important enough to that scheme.",
  "In your theory, there is no due process violation in that case? They have heard the arguments, they have given you a full opportunity to make your point about the procedural default. They are announcing a new rule. It's okay. So what's wrong with that?",
  "Under what theory?",
  "Why?",
  "Well, point me to any rule, that --- you know, anybody could point to a rule and says it commands a result. They -- there are rules here that say disputes should be submitted to the board and resolved. And they are resolving the dispute, the dispute, and they are saying, you have defaulted, you didn't.",
  "But they can do that. That's what -- that's what the circuit said.",
  "They could have passed a rule that told people, warned them, and said this is a procedural rule we are going to apply.",
  "At what point does the interpretation of rules that don't command a result become improper, outside the board's jurisdiction? According to you, never.",
  "But there is a difference between governmentally ordered arbitrations and private contracts. In private contracts the parties negotiate the rules and they set them forth, and the arbitrators then follow - -",
  "Is it your position that if you go through the first phase and as everybody is walking out the two adversaries in the first investigative space say this is never going to be settled, this is the most important case in the history of this -- the railroad system. Let's go take it to the board.",
  "That they can't waive the grievance procedure, that they just can't go straight to you?",
  "But we disagree with you. You say if the board was just plain wrong. If we look at the Act and circular one and say we can't find what they said anywhere in there, does that doom your argument? Have they asked -- acted outside, has the board acted outside its jurisdiction?",
  "Counsel, a plea is something more than “I'm guilty.” It is a strategic decision not to put the government to its burden of proof. Your definition of voluntariness suggests that there is only one component to it, do I know what my rights are, as opposed to, do I know what they are and am making an informed decision to waive those rights. Your articulation of the rule leaves out the second component: Am I making an informed decision to waive those rights?",
  "But how do you do that? I mean, your adversary's argument is, in their particular case -- and I know that you dispute this –- there is a defense that could win at trial. And the defendant comes in and says: Okay, what are my choices? I go to trial and I may serve a longer sentence, but I don't go to trial, I may serve that -- I do go to trial and I serve that longer sentence, but it's here in the U.S. and not in my home country, where I might starve to death. I think I’ll stay here and take that risk. You're -- you're sort of ignoring that component of information in terms of informing the strategic choice of whether to take the risk and go to trial.",
  "Well, then that – that goes to the Solicitor General's position, which is: You may be right, an attorney doesn't have to give more information than what's necessary. But doesn't the calculus change when the defendant says, this is important to me; give me accurate advice, if you are going to give me advice?",
  "Why? I -- I have been trying to figure out why the State court would know in its decisionmaking that Mills commanded a different result when Mills was issued after the State denied its petition for rehearing.",
  "Well, finality in that sense is generally looked at in terms of AEDPA statute of limitations. Why should the same rule apply to the question of whether a State has acted contrary to or unreasonably in light of Supreme Court precedent when the precedent didn't exist at the time it was rendering its decision? How can a court act?",
  "We don't have to go any further if we simply address the question, at what point in time are we talking about a State court's decision, correct?",
  "Isn't your adversary's position -- I'm sure they will speak for themselves, but their position would be that this is a step further than Jones or other cases because if in fact -- what you are tilling us is that if the jury hangs, the court will have to impose a life sentence or some form of it. But the jury could believe that they could -- that it's either death or life, and one holdout juror would say: Well, I don't want to let this guy out; because those are the only two choices and 11 people want to go for dead -- death and I'm the only holdout, I have to vote for death to make sure that he is restrained in a way that I find acceptable.",
  "Counsel, there are two extremes. One is no defense whatsoever, Justice Stevens' hypothetical. The attorney just comes in and says, kill him, okay? And then there is another, which is your very eloquent explanation of this attorney's strategy. If he had done what you did here, we may not be having this appeal. But at some point you can have a strategy and execute it so poorly, so incompetently, that you're providing ineffective assistance of counsel. You are not accepting that that can occur, you are saying the minute an attorney says, I had a strategy, that that is effective counsel, regardless of how that attorney executed that strategy. That appears to be your argument.",
  "Well, he actually did say that.",
  "Well, but, pretty much, he said, no one's going to fault you if you impose the death sentence.",
  "Counsel, I don't know that you've actually addressed the operative question of what amount of discretion, if any, are we going to give to special masters to determine when they require the presence of a party to do equity, which is what I read the Special Master to be suggesting. These are the three biggest users of water, at least one of them straddles both States, another has a potential license. And so that each of them has a different situation than a normal water user. So, you're -- all you're begging is the question of whether we just say you can't. But why is the \"you can't\" compelled, either by our case law or by any original jurisdiction principle?",
  "What happens to North Carolina if it has less water? What does it do with respect to Duke?",
  "But tell me what she said that makes them helpful. What can they provide that couldn't be done by merely an amici submission?",
  "Well, your adversary has just said none, according to the terms of the license and what the FERC has said. So why is -- why don't we just take what FERC has said --",
  "-- at face value?",
  "So how does that get us to avoid involvement in interstate -- intrastate disputes over water use? That just drags us right into your problems among your water users.",
  "You are advocating a rule that says, almost, you have a right to intervene because you have an interest that won't be adequately represented.",
  "Is that your position? Then what happens to the Special Master who says, no, I don't want all you guys here? How do we say that that master abused his or her discretion by saying no?",
  "So you see the issue before us as being was she right or wrong, even though Nevada said -- I'm sorry -- that North Carolina said that it was going to adequately represent each of these interests, but that just wasn't correct?",
  "That North Carolina is not telling us the truth?",
  "Why?",
  "But you are going to defend all of their interests as it affects North Carolina, right? You are not incapable of protecting their North Carolina interests.",
  "Isn't it your interest to -- to resist that?",
  "And your interest is to defend the CRA, right?",
  "You haven't answered my question.",
  "Is it in your interest not to support the CRA?",
  "You would like -- you would like, in this litigation against the two States, for the Special Master to undo the -- your obligations under the CRA?",
  "So you are prepared to tell us right now -- this is what you are saying to us: We will not represent the interest of Duke?",
  "Are you prepared to say the same thing with respect to your city?",
  "And to your -- and to the CRWSP?",
  "Are you --",
  "Are you prepared to say that you are not adequately defending the interest of the CRWSP?",
  "You haven't answered my question. You said, with Duke, that you won't support --",
  "-- them. Are you not going to support this -- the joint venture in property?",
  "Tell me, are you seeking injunctive relief out of any of the three intervenors?",
  "Are you willing to concede that if whatever you ask for here affects that license, once its issued, that then Duke's intervention is proper?",
  "Is there any other area -- is there any other area of law where we permit a prejudgment attachment and/or seizure of property without a neutral magistrate reviewing the reason for that seizure? We don't permit a pretrial attachment, do we, except in some narrow circumstances?",
  "But that's --",
  "I don't deny that there's a State interest. The question is who tests that interest? In what time frame? Meaning you can assert an interest, but someone has to determine whether it really exists or not.",
  "So am I forgetting, but didn't this start out as a class action and wasn't the claim -- wasn't the class action denied?",
  "And you didn't appeal that?",
  "What did the Illinois court do? Didn't it remand for an appropriate hearing to be given?",
  "I'm sorry. You take the car and then you investigate?",
  "But -- but you are –- but you’re sort of begging the question. You are saying to me that initial period is for the government to figure out if it made a mistake or not, and we're entitled to that time. You're not entitled, meaning you, property owner, to go to a neutral magistrate who will make that decision without a personal interest in the outcome, because the person who seized does have an interest of some sort. Many local police departments do in seizing property, because they keep the proceeds. So what you're saying is that constitutionally it's okay for the party holding on to property without a warrant to decide whether or not it wants to give something back, whether or not there’s -- there’s a viable defense. I'm a little confused.",
  "No, it wasn't. The appeal in Geraghty included an appeal of the denial of class certification.",
  "So both issues – both the merits and the denial of the class certification –- were still active before the Court. Here you didn't appeal the dismissal of the class certification or the mootness of it.",
  "But -- but in many appeals parties plead in the alternative and say, if you -- if we win on the merits, reverse the dismissal of the class certification because we still want to proceed as a class. You didn't do that. You waited for the merits to be adjudicated and then filed a new class action. It's a very different procedural step.",
  "Counsel, can you unpackage for me this hearing? Because there is a confusion in it that appears, both in your papers and in this argument. There’s a probable cause component, which is the police coming before a neutral magistrate and saying, this is the reason I seized; I have probable cause to believe that this car was involved in an illegal activity, and this is why. And then there is what sounds like, to me, a sort of remission-type component to the hearing you are looking at, which is a magistrate saying, okay, you have probable cause, but there's no reason for the seizing authorities to keep the car because you can post a bond instead, or something else should be done to mitigate the damage to you during this process of forfeiture. Am I correct that there are two components to your request? And if there are, I understand the probable cause component, but I'm not sure how you get to the second component of how and why due process would require the State to have a -- I'm calling it remission -- but a remission-like proceeding? Am I correct? Am I understanding what –- what it is you're --",
  "Can I just get clarification? Under your State law, there is no way for an owner to come in and challenge probable cause to seize?",
  "Not a defense --",
  "-- but the examples Judge Breyer said: My car was just sitting there.",
  "All right. And, second, is there any procedure under your State law to do the second half of what your adversary said he was looking for, a remission-type proceeding that would balance the government's need to hold the property and the individual's need for it, and whether there is a bond that could be posted or not?",
  "Well, that may be part of the Mathews issue, that once you prove probable cause, giving away -- giving back money just never would probably be rational to hold a hearing about, but that might not be true for real property, correct? Under -- even under Mathews, under -- in a Mathews analysis.",
  "If you apply a Mathews analysis --",
  "-- the multifaceted item would say for the seizure of cash, maybe only the hearing has to address probable cause, but for real property it has to go further. Not real property, in the sense of real personal property. It has to go further, because there has to be some sort of protection of the interest of the individual, pending --",
  "I'm sorry. Could you repeat what the market was? Was it the market for all attorneys or only for attorneys doing this type of work?",
  "How about you get a second-year associate whose billing rate for 2 years of experience is $200, and a partner's rate is $500, and a judge says: This individual didn't perform like a 2-year associate; he did the quality and kind of work of someone far superior in years in skill and experience. That would not, under your argument, entitle the court to give an enhancement?",
  "But you haven't dealt with my hypothetical. He didn't perform like a second-year associate. He performed like a 15-year lawyer. The difference is not with respect to skill and experience. It's with respect to performance. And so what Justice Ginsburg was asking is, what you are basically saying, the quality of that representation, even though it reflected more than the market one would look at objectively on the basis of the years of experience, that judge can't enhance, even though someone performed far above whatever else the market would consider his or her skills at the moment.",
  "That's not true. Law firms get bonuses from clients all the time. They get negotiated. Some of the amici gave examples of what's happening in the -- what happens in the marketplace.",
  "So why can't the judge determine a reasonable fee in the same way the market does? Which is --",
  "No, but the -- but the Congress didn't use the per-hour lodestar --",
  "-- as the method. If that's all it wanted, it could have, and there were suggestions that it consider limiting the -- the award to just a lodestar calculation. So obviously Congress was thinking of something broader than just that.",
  "That part of the market anyway.",
  "Well, but that's why we have held in our cases that it should be a rare and exceptional circumstance. The difference that we are engaged in is whether the quality of performance can ever constitute that rare exception that would justify a district court saying, you performed greater than what the market would have valued you at before your performance. That's really what the issue is.",
  "One of the purposes of Congress -- one of the purposes of Congress was to ensure that litigants under these fee-shifting statutes could attract competent counsel, correct?",
  "If the market doesn't give them attorneys to start with because there are so many risks involved in this process and it sets a reduced fee because of those risks, how do you attract competent counsel? How do you attract counsel that is better than the norm in that field to pursue as private attorney generals cases that Congress has determined are worthy of being pursued, unless you have a quality adjustment factor?",
  "That doesn't mean Dague was right, right?",
  "No one is arguing a different point?",
  "Aren't you -- most of your arguments are suggesting that the counter -- that your adversary is now limiting, that the adjustment should be made -- tied to something, and that something would be the actual rate. And most of the factors you are talking about -- whether the person's a national attorney with overhead or whether that person's a -- has done better work -- the example I used, a second-year associate, could be adjusted just in the rate, and that would give you a grounded place to make a judgment about the exercise of a court's discretion. Why isn't that a more structured, more --",
  "I'm sorry. Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical was you are entitled to $100 as a statutory penalty but only if it's an individual claim. If you -- if this is brought as a class action, you don't get the statutory penalty. I thought that was the substance of her question. Now, are you saying that also is merely procedural and -- and pre-empted by Rule 23?",
  "Counsel, you get $100 or you don't get $100. How can you be any less substantive than getting the $100 or not getting the $100?",
  "Then under your view, there is absolutely nothing, no law that the State could pass that would not conflict with Rule 23 --",
  "-- as it -- as with respect to class actions?",
  "You mean the State could do.",
  "But isn't Rule 23 a judgment by Congress that class actions that meet the criteria of Rule 23 are fair and efficient, correct? That's Congress's judgment?",
  "Under your theory, any State could pass a law that says no cause of action under State law can be brought as a class action ever. That would be your theory because it's substantive, if it's an Erie choice.",
  "You haven't quite answered my question.",
  "Your State can come in and say, no State cause of action will ever be subject to class treatment. And you would say there is no conflict between that and Rule 23?",
  "No. No State cause of action can be brought as a class. You're saying there is no conflict with Rule 23's judgment about efficiency of Federal court litigation?",
  "Just what it's doing here. There are some things -- we make a policy choice, the State, that, contrary to Rule 23, that there are some causes of action that are not fairly and efficiently brought as a class. That's what the State has said as a policy choice, correct?",
  "It's a policy choice.",
  "So you have answered my question. Under your view, a State could say, no class actions.",
  "And -- and a Federal court, sitting in diversity, could never aggregate those claims, those State law claims?",
  "Counsel, how can you say that? The case itself says: We read the language of the statute; Congress didn't say this was to be a class action; we are not permitting it. I understand the difference, and it could have argued or analyzed the case the way you said, but the appellate division there did exactly what your adversary said it did.",
  "Counsel, can I unpackage your argument a little bit. Because using the word \"fair fee\" in my mind is meaningless, because it has to be fair in relationship to something. And so what is your definition of what that something is that it's fair to, and -- or unfair against? And start from there, because I understood the Seventh Circuit to be saying: Look, a fair fee is paying market value. If one takes a sort of reading -- whatever negotiation goes on between the two, as long as there has been full disclosure as required, that's the market. So that's fair. You're saying it's something else. What's that something else?",
  "All right. So you start there.",
  "All right. So let's stop confusing this -- the articulation of the standard, which is -- that's fair. What would an arm's-length transaction produce? And let's go to what seems to be part of your argument and sort of what everyone's skirting around, which is what's the proof that a particular transaction is not arm's-length? The Seventh Circuit appeared to be saying, it's arm's-length when the parties have done all of the disclosure that is required, because then the buyer can decide whether they want to pay that fee or not, and once they choose to it's a fair price. It's an arm's - length transaction. You are saying not, and that's what -- that's where I am trying to get to the nub of why not? Why is - -",
  "That's -- now, that's begging the question, because Congress hasn't said a reasonable fee. It did say fiduciary duty, but it didn't -- there is a subtle but very important difference between reasonable and -- a reasonable fee and a fiduciary duty with respect to fees.",
  "I'm still begging the question, fair against what.",
  "Even if they agree to pay double the price?",
  "That -- that's what - - are you advocating that there is a stand-alone cause of action or breach of duty when there isn't full disclosure, even if the fee is within arm's length - - normal -- begging the question of what's normal, but assuming that it's within an arm's-length transaction range in the market?",
  "Well, how much deviance, and what is the scope of the range?",
  "Let's assume -- let's assume that all of the independent board of director members vote for a particular fee, but the fee is negotiated by an insider, and the insider is the one who does the evaluation, looks at them and says: I think this is really a great deal, guys. And they just fell for it. Is that a process that would guarantee an arm's-length transaction in the sense that Congress intended in this act?",
  "Which cause of action - -",
  "-- under what?",
  "So, then their process is part of your definition of \"fiduciary duty\"? A court has to look at the nature of process?",
  "Now -- now you are adding what has been added, which is outside of the range, correct?",
  "All right.",
  "All right. But what you are -- but what you are arguing is, if the process is fair, even if the fee is outside the range of an arm's - length transaction, there is no cause of action?",
  "Except that they claim that you were receiving additional payment for the services, or some or at least a substantial number of the services, that you claim are attributed by the difference. So they're saying if you compare apples to apples, you are charging twice the amount. If you compare apples to oranges, there are differences because the oranges were different, but you were getting paid for those oranges separately. I think that was their argument.",
  "Well, that's the issue of disputed fact. So let's go back. Are you disavowing the Seventh Circuit's approach? Because I read your brief and it doesn't appear as if you are defending their market approach that says so long as the process was fair, any fee is okay. That's how I thought they had reached their conclusion.",
  "That's what I'm talking -- I am using his words in terms of case - -",
  "And you're disavowing that?",
  "Your positions is no different than the solicitor general's, that there has to be some measure of fair process and some measure of a fair fee, at least within -- in terms of it not being outside the range an arm's length transaction?",
  "But this wasn't the ruling by the court in analyzing your cases and saying -- you know, in six out of the cases -- six out of the ten cases, discretion was exercised, in four it wasn't, and so it's not firmly established because the numbers are skewed. Justice Ginsburg -- you pointed Justice Ginsburg to page 23, and the Court very directly there says, look, we are rejecting the State's argument that the waiver rule was mandatory.",
  "And so it characterized your argument that way, that you were saying the district court had no discretion.",
  "Well, whether you think you did or didn't, that's how the court described it, so it understood you to be taking a different position. Are we going to correct it because it misunderstood you? Or - -",
  "What court has said? As I read the Third Circuit, it says: A procedural rule that is consistently applied in the vast majority of cases; even if State courts are willing to occasionally overlook it and review the merits of a claim, that that's okay.",
  "So what other circuit has said that any measure of discretion or even a lot of use of discretion bars deference to the State rule?",
  "How many of those cases resulted in the overturning or the grant of habeas - -",
  "But do we -- what - - what does that tell us about us establishing the rule that you propose?",
  "But you are asking us to take away a part of the inquiry.",
  "Your notice -- your notice and an opportunity to comply doesn't address a repeated statement by us, which is that whatever test is applied has to get to whether the State court is attempting to evade Federal review of constitutional questions.",
  "All right. And so your test does nothing to inform that question, for example, the Flowers situation. There was a clear rule, there was more than an adequate opportunity to comply, and yet we said it didn't qualify for deference because it was clearly, given the circumstances of the State application of the rule at issue, an attempt to evade a constitutional right.",
  "Counsel, I don't know how you say that. Yes, it was clearly established that the district court had discretion -- none of the justices below disagreed with this -- to dismiss post-verdict motions on the basis of flight. The courts below themselves said: What we don't have a rule about is what we do with respect to a post-judgment motion to reinstate or how we the appellate court will treat that waiver once it comes before us. Will we apply it to the appellate process as well? I understood the Third Circuit to be saying that it was those two latter components, which the courts below themselves identified as new questions, that it was resolving, that involve new rules.",
  "That's as simply as I thought the issue was. Maybe your adversary will dissuade me and concede your point that what the court was saying, the discretionary application, is what was at issue, but if as I've described things is correct, how does your position continue to be sustained?",
  "So what you are disagreeing with is the Third Circuit's conclusion of what the status of Pennsylvania law was?",
  "Well, Doctor dealt with what will the court do with respect to, not post-verdict motions, but with respect to appeals that are raised before or after flight.",
  "And that's what Doctor said?",
  "So now the only other -- Kindler now raises a new question: What are we going to do -- according to the courts below, what are we going to do with post-verdict motions to reinstate and to appeals that result after flight and after waiver; correct?",
  "That's where the disagreement lies: Did the Third Circuit get Pennsylvania law wrong on this issue.",
  "All right. Let's assume the Third Circuit, that we take the hypothetical that they were right. How do you still win?",
  "What rules -- I'm - -",
  "What is -- what is your position as to what the Third Circuit was saying or holding? Are you saying, like your adversary, that they were saying because it was discretionary and there were a lot of exceptions to it, it wasn't firmly established? Or were you -- or do you read it as saying, now that you have made it mandatory, that's a new rule -- the waiver mandatory, that's a new rule?",
  "It's not what you are saying. What do you think the Third Circuit said?",
  "What was the change - -",
  "-- that you think the Third Circuit was identifying?",
  "Let's assume that a lower court in this case had said: You know, we have discretion, but we're not going to exercise it because you escaped twice and were away much longer than most fugitives. There is a presumption that witnesses' memories fade, that it's harder for trials that are so distant from the event, that distant from an event. We are not going to exercise our discretion. Is it your view -- because that's the undertone I'm hearing -- that under firmly established ground that the court would have still ruled that that exercise of discretion was not adequate under - -",
  "Yeah.",
  "Sure, it is. But what you -- there is a tone to the way you presented this case that says because they chose often to exercise discretion in the past, if they choose not to in any case, it's no longer an independent State ground. That's what -- is that the point you are arguing?",
  "Because that's the question presented.",
  "Well, that begs your adversary's question, which is every case has one or more differences in it. At what point does a lower court have to -- can it say, you know, yes, because they exercised discretion sometimes but not others it's still an independent State ground to find forfeiture?",
  "By whom?",
  "No, no. Stop. Is the relaxed waiver rule one that applies to district court consideration or appellate court consideration or both?",
  "At all levels. What is your reading of what the new rule that the State was announcing was announcing? That it was doing away with the State court's relaxed waiver rule? Was it doing it away with its own relaxed waiver rule? What's your position in this case?",
  "None of them, including the trial court?",
  "By the trial court and by us, is that what you're - -",
  "Has that happened in the two circuits that apply a rule similar to this, the Sixth and the Third?",
  "Now, under your rule, the trustee has 30 days to get this good faith basis. Does that mean that he or she has to get a valuation on everything that's listed at full value, that that is really the burden we're talking about? It's not the burden of filing a piece of paper that says I want an a exemption, or even one that says I have an objection. It's what it takes to support that objection and how much effort goes to that activity.",
  "No, there's a huge difference between a rule that says you don't have to actually go after this information in a formal way. If someone's claiming only the exempt amount, then I'll go ahead and I'll administer the estate, and over time I'll talk informally to people and get a sense of whether the valuation is right or not, but I won't actually -- actually have to get a formal appraisal because I'll just use my judgment. Your rule would require something else. They would have to get the appraisal to lodge the request for an extension or to lodge the request for an objection.",
  "Counsel, in -- what's interesting is that all of the circuits or most, the majority, have not announced the fixed rule. The rule they’ve said is: It depends on the circumstances. And so it appears to me that most of the courts are saying to us: We don't want a default rule, because we have to see what has happened and see what has happened between the parties to determine in one situation rather than another what the intent was. It's not an irrational rule. Why shouldn't we be considering that as an alternative? Because once we make an announcement like the one that you're proposing, it is an inducement to undervalue your property, for a debtor, because -- in the hopes that an overly worked trustee won't have either the time or opportunity or wherewithal to understand that the value is off and that they're going to lose something that the estate is entitled to.",
  "No. There are comparable circuit court opinions and situations very analogous to this one, where the circuit courts have looked at what the trustee and the debtor have done during the process. And if the debtor has not made it clear that they're seeking the full value of the property, as happened here, there was a conversation that the value was off, the debtor did not tell the trustee that she was claiming the full amount of the property. And there are analogous situations where the circuits have said, no, that doesn't show your intent because you didn't articulate it to the trustee in the informal meetings. That's not an irrational conclusion by those circuits.",
  "No. What it says is, if you're engaged in good faith negotiation over a value or over the claimed exemption, you should -- both sides should be open about it.",
  "Most of these cases, the objections are -- the discussions are not at the time of objection. They are at the time of the creditors’ meeting. It is part of the discussion. That's what the courts are looking to. What's happening between the parties? Have they made their intent clear, and what does that intent reflect?",
  "Does it matter who is the challenger? Are you in a different position than the other parties to this action? You're a third party who is being bound to a particular rate. The others do have a different interest, or they're in a different position with respect to their challenges, correct?",
  "So aren't you in a different position than those other challengers?",
  "So why doesn't that difference do what the D.C. Circuit said?",
  "No. I do understand that, but that's what I'm trying to get to. The D.C. Circuit Court's reasoning was very simple: You're a contracting party; you're bound to it. Why should the others who didn't agree to this term be bound by Mobile-Sierra? That's the essence of their holding.",
  "So then does that bind all types of third parties?",
  "But you just said to Justice Scalia that the court below didn't find that this was a contract rate.",
  "It assumed it, so you're asking us to assume the same thing and announce --",
  "-- an advisory opinion that if these are contract rates, they're bound by Mobile-Sierra; and if they're not, what are we supposed to do?",
  "Is there -- what would happen in a situation in which there's a tariff price instead of a contract price? In those situations, the buyer could come in, presumably, and say: It's not a fair and just price vis-à-vis me; I didn't agree to it; it's not. In a normal situation with a contract price, third parties, many not -- not the main -- main parties, like the Maine Public Utilities Commission, could come in and say what? It's not fair to the public in general?",
  "Yes.",
  "Could they come in and show that between the contracting parties the price is unfair? Is that what this is about, that they would try to come in and somehow define the public interest as being informed by the unfairness to the individual parties?",
  "Well, but that's the question before us.",
  "The D.C. Circuit said they shouldn't be bound by that determination, and you're arguing that they should be because --",
  "So it goes back to my original question with your adversary, which is: Is there a difference among the objectors here, between those who are objecting to the terms between the two contracting parties as outsiders, as members of the public, and those who are objecting because this settlement agreement does something different? It binds them personally to a buying price, and so why shouldn't there be a different approach to those individuals?",
  "I agree.",
  "And so the question is: Should there be a distinction?",
  "And that's what the Third Circuit -- I'm sorry, that's what the court below didn't --",
  "Well, they can self-supply, can't they?",
  "Can I -- can I go –- stop you there, just so that we're all on the same page? If this were, hypothetically, a contract rate -- some of the transition fees appear to be. The parties to that agreement are saying, we're going to pay, in transition fees, X amount. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the transition fees are contract rates, are you disputing the circuit court's analysis that the Mobile-Sierra doctrine applies to those contract rates and binds third parties who are challenging that particular rate between those two parties?",
  "Well, that -- you can't because that's the doctrine. Okay. Under what circumstances could a third party challenge that rate as not fair and reasonable, as opposed to being contrary to the public interest?",
  "You haven't answered my question. Under what circumstances -- I've given you the absolute minimum example.",
  "There’s a rate set between two parties, what third parties -- under what circumstances could a third party come in and say -- on some standard different than contrary to the public interest, how could they prove other that that rate's not fair and reasonable?",
  "What does the word \"directly affected\" mean to you?",
  "No. Now, you're trying to confuse the issue. Yes, that's the auction question and whether that auction is a contract price subject to the Mobile-Sierra doctrine at all. That's a different issue. I've given you the simple hypothetical. Could all of those other respondents -- except NSTAR -- come in and say that it's not fair and reasonable to me because, at the end, I'm going to pay more; I'm going to do something -- it's going to affect me in some indirect way. Are you taking the position that there's something else that FERC must do when those third parties come into -- into that simple situation?",
  "You want to keep going back to the facts, and I'm dealing with a hypothetical.",
  "So you are taking the extreme -- you are accepting that -- what the lower court said? Under every circumstance, if it involves a contract price, fair and reasonable being something other than contrary to the public interest?",
  "So your adversary's arguments that what you're really saying is you can never have finality to a contract agreement between parties because any third party can come in and raise -- stand in the shoes of the contracting parties and argue the rate's not fair and reasonable?",
  "But that makes no sense because, if you go down that road, then what you're saying is that neither the -- neither a police officer or a different prosecutor who fabricated evidence could be liable, either, because the only person who causes the deprivation is the prosecutor who uses the false evidence at trial.",
  "Now, the Second Circuit in its decision, Judge Newman, looked at it and said there are two causes to the injury here. One is the fabrication, joint tortfeasors. There are two people who can cause any injury and the prosecutor who actually puts the evidence in at trial. That's how you hold police officers and different prosecutors liable because they are assisting in the violation that is occurring.",
  "Why doesn't that theory fit the same prosecutor who commits two different acts?",
  "One commits the direct violation, and the other act, the investigatory act, contributes to it, leads to it as a joint activity with it.",
  "You're confusing -- the constitutional injury is the deprivation of liberty. That's the injury.",
  "What causes that injury is not an element of the crime. It is -- the question is have you proven the violation, have you proven the injury.",
  "So why does the use define the scope of the injury?",
  "A prosecutor is not going to flinch when he suspects evidence is perjured or fabricated? Do you really want to send a message to police officers that they should not merely flinch but stop if they have reason to believe that evidence is fabricated?",
  "Am I right that none of the -- neither of the two prosecutors in this case were sanctioned in any way for their conduct?",
  "But you have no reason to dispute the numerous studies we were provided that show that as a matter of routine prosecutors are not sanctioned for improper prosecutorial conduct in the investigatory stage, are you?",
  "Could I take you back to Justice Alito's question? As I read the lower court decision, it was saying counsel made a strategic choice not to pursue any further investigation with respect to mental health, correct?",
  "All right. And they made it on the basis of a number of factors, including the fact that there was testimony that the two senior attorneys said: It's not going to help us if we do or not. You may disagree with whether or not a strategic decision was made or not, but if one can view the evidence in any way as the attorney having made the decision, isn't your argument that that decision was unreasonable?",
  "But isn't that what Justice Alito asked you? That's not a dispute with the factual finding that it was a strategic decision. That's a dispute with the legal -- the legal -- whether that strategic decision met the legal standard of Strickland.",
  "All right. So we're back to Justice Alito's question, which is, isn't that a (d)(1) instead of a (d)(2) argument, and we -- the question presented only addressed the strategic decision. It didn't address or present the question of the Strickland question of whether that would have been a reasonable strategic decision.",
  "It might be your alternative argument, but it's not the question presented.",
  "Can I go back to - - just to -- so that we're on the same page in my own mind, what constitutes the State record? Because one of the State amici posited situations in which the record before the State court on the issue that it made its determination would be one subset of evidence, and that, perhaps as the State process developed on another issue there was another record developed, and you're pointing to that evidence in your argument of unreasonableness as a reason for the lower court's decision being wrong. So your use of that other evidence, does that go under (d)(2) or (d)(1)?",
  "Does that seem -- does that seem reasonable, meaning the State court is making a decision based on what's before it. Can't -- it can't foretell unknown evidence and bring it into its equation. So one has to presume that its finding based on the evidence before it is correct. If there's additional evidence, whether it's part of a record that's developed elsewhere, not part of what it based its decision on, and if you look at the language of (d)(2), it talks about the record on the fact determined. It doesn't talk about on the - -",
  "So you're changing your earlier answer to me? You're going closer to what the amici were suggesting, which is that record has to be defined narrowly, it has to be the facts before the court?",
  "I'm not sure I understand that, meaning often a trial court is presented with evidence that determines something. This was a strategic choice. It may be that later the State court has a hearing on that question, but it may be that it has a hearing on a different question altogether.",
  "And you're using the evidence on the other question.",
  "Counsel, you don't really want us to say that, because unreasonable, as we've defined it in (d)(1), means it could be wrong, but still not unreasonable.",
  "So if we say that proof of a -- by clear and convincing evidence that a decision by the State court was incorrect, you can't equate - - you don't really want us equating that with (d)(2), do you?",
  "That's why he -- that's why he starting - -",
  "-- from, I think what he's saying is, what your adversary responded to Justice Ginsburg, unreasonable really is much broader than clear and convincing - -",
  "-- evidence on correctness. You don't need it because whether the decision is right or wrong is not the issue. Even if it's wrong, it could still be reasonably wrong.",
  "I mean, one could quarrel with that proposition, but that's the state of the law. So, why do you need (e)(1)? That's -- that's Justice Breyer's question, as I understand it.",
  "But work it out in theory, okay?",
  "Work it out in theory. There are -- you see, the difficulty with this case is - -",
  "-- one factual matter, was a strategic decision made?",
  "There are a bunch of subsidiary facts that -- that were made.",
  "If you're applying (d)(2), the Court would look at all the subsidiary facts and decide not whether they were correct or not, but whether they were unreasonably incorrect, okay? If they weren't unreasonably incorrect? So you don't have to get to the correctness question by clear and convincing evidence. If they're -- if they're not unreasonably incorrect, the four subsidiary facts would then support the fifth general question, correct?",
  "Either we agree it does or it doesn't, but -- I -- I -- I don't understand why you need (e)(1) because you never need to get to the correctness of the finding.",
  "Can I stop you just for a factual clarification?",
  "Did the defendant's prior history with his other girlfriend come into the penalty stage of the trial?",
  "So this was a wise strategic decision, perhaps, with respect to the penalty phase?",
  "It did come in at the trial -- at the sentencing phase, correct?",
  "In front of the jury.",
  "We're not arguing about the penalty phase. The issue is if the trial judge at sentencing did hear about the prior assaulted behavior anyway, what would have been the strategic decision not to pursue further evaluations because they -- there's no likelihood in my mind that similar assaultive behavior was ever going to be kept out of the sentencing phase. That's true, isn't it? That's one of the strongest aggravating factors that you could prove, correct?",
  "The sentencing - -",
  "-- jury. Not the penalty phase?",
  "So that's really -- I think that was Justice Stevens' question, which was, what was the strategic basis of a decision not to pursue mental health information when everything you wanted to keep out of the penalty phase would be coming at the sentencing phase anyway?",
  "That's the question.",
  "But you haven't answered Justice Alito's point, which is: What's the difference a month before he's 18 and a month after? What makes us more capable at the 18th birthday to --",
  "-- to affirm a judgment that someone can't be -- can't be -- can’t be rehabilitated?",
  "Well --",
  "Counsel --",
  "Do you think that it categorically violates the Eighth Amendment for a 10-year-old to be sentenced to life without parole?",
  "So once it matters, the question for me is -- help me draw the line -- if 10 is in my judgment too early, why isn't 14, 16, or 18? Meaning why should a -- someone below the age of 14 be sentenced to life without parole? That's the -- that's the Sullivan case --",
  "-- but it begs the question, which is age is -- matters a lot. And so, take on your adversary's argument that it matters a lot because this is a less culpable person.",
  "Is that because judges haven't chosen to impose it or because your legal system doesn't permit it?",
  "How young could the youngest person in Florida be to be prosecuted as an adult and be eligible for life --",
  "-- without parole?",
  "So a 5-year-old could be put away for life?",
  "You are not seriously suggesting that the crimes at issue here are comparable to a rape or a permanent infliction of serious disability or any of those other very violent crimes that are close to homicide that Justice Alito spoke about? There is a quantitative and qualitative difference between those, isn't there?",
  "Well, if we -- if we have already said that you can't impose death on an adult who hasn't committed a homicide, an intentional death, and so for an adult the most serious sentence that we can give them is life without parole, why should that same sentence be given to a juvenile who we have recognized as being less capable than an adult? And why should we permit it for a crime that's not comparable to a homicide and/or something akin in seriousness to that?",
  "But isn't it true -- and I think one of my colleagues already questioned you -- that the prosecutor didn't think that this merited life without parole. Didn't the parole supervisor say that this young man, Mr. Graham, was compliant with other conditions of his probation? He went to school. He did other things. It does suggest some hope for him.",
  "Except the court there applied 39(a) and said: Yes, it's a change in law, but it hasn't been made retroactive.",
  "But isn't that what the court said here? It said, first of all, Roper doesn't command the results you are seeking; and, second, it didn't make its application retroactive. So wasn't it really consistent with 39(a), the Florida court?",
  "No, that's an unfair characterization. What the judge said was Roper didn't say that it applied to life without parole. That's a very -- vastly different thing than saying that the reasoning shouldn't be applied. It said that we are not choosing to, but that's not what Roper said.",
  "Can I --",
  "Could you go back through the statistics for me? For children under 14, how many are in prison for life without parole for homicide and non-homicide cases?",
  "There’s a certain number of States that didn't respond at all.",
  "What do you mean it was done twice? I thought he raped only one person.",
  "So your adversary provided statistics to show that other people who have committed rapes have gotten much smaller terms of imprisonment, the average being, I think we were told, 10 years. So explain to me why someone who commits a rape is getting 10 years and this 13-year-old -- it’s the most heinous crime for a 13-year-old that justifies life without parole.",
  "What did the Florida -- what do the Florida courts do with that series of cases in your footnote, in the yellow brief, where it did apply Apprendi after? Did it rule that it wasn't retroactive? What did it do in those cases --",
  "-- to consider the Apprendi challenges?",
  "If you are wrong and they did do exactly what your adversary said and considered the issue of the legality of the sentence under Apprendi, does that vitiate your argument here? Is your -- does that make your adversary's argument correct?",
  "You are missing the point. What Florida says and what your adversary is saying is -- you’re absolutely right, if you win under Graham, you could go under 39.a -- if you win under Graham, and Graham makes its rule retroactive, that fits right into (b)(2) directly, and so those cases you have no problems with. What he is saying, however, is you can't go in to Florida and ask them to announce the constitutional rule under a case where it hasn't been already held.",
  "So how do we limit it to something that’s reasonable? Meaning, if we don't limit it to inventions or to technology, as some amici have, or to some tie or tether, borrowing the Solicitor General's phraseology, to the sciences, to the useful arts, then why not patent the method of speed dating?",
  "So why are human activities covered by useful arts?",
  "Well, you are saying they are covered, but why should they be?",
  "Do you think that there is some benefit to society from patenting a method to cure someone that involves just human activity, as opposed to some machine, substance, or other apparatus to help that process?",
  "Do you believe that that was the intent of the patent law?",
  "Are you suggesting they didn't exist because we didn't give them patents 100 years ago?",
  "Or they exist because computers have increased –-",
  "No, but a patent limits the free flow of information. It requires licensing fees and other steps, legal steps. So you can't argue that your definition is improving the free flow of information.",
  "Well, isn't the manipulation of electronic signals a substance that’s different in kind from just a method of how to go about doing business or a method of how to approach a particular problem? Isn't there -- isn't that what the Federal Circuit was trying to explain, which is that there has to be something more substantive than the mere exchange of information; that it has to involve -- it used the word \"transformation.\" It hasn't defined the outer limits of what it means by that.",
  "But it doesn't, because we don't work in a vacuum. We work in a context.",
  "And so it begs the question, because we go around in a circle: What does \"process\" mean in a patent law that was passed in 1952 that had one set of manufacturing and other items that are technologically tied and this is not? So how do we discern Congress's intent, other than by the use of the word \"process\" in context?",
  "But the word \"knowledge\" is not used in the act. So it's not just useful knowledge.",
  "It's useful knowledge in relationship to something.",
  "Well, if that’s --",
  "Morse's code was not obvious.",
  "Morse's code was not obvious, and yet --",
  "As I understand that case, the only thing patented was the use of his code with respect to the telegraph machine that he proposed. The Patent Office rejected -- maybe I am reading the case wrong, but it rejected all of the claims except those that related to the use of the code with a particular machine.",
  "Of his claims --",
  "-- that was the only one that was accepted, correct?",
  "The same thing with -- well, Bell's patent was --",
  "Let's not skip over that, because the rest of the claim in Bell related to how to transmit over the wire, correct?",
  "And that was what was rejected.",
  "How about if we say something as simple as patent law doesn't cover business methods, instead of what the Federal Circuit has begun to say, which is technology is tied to a machine or a transformation of the substance? But I have no idea what the limits of that ruling will impose in the computer world or the biomedical world. All of the amici were talking about how it will destroy industries. If we’re unsure about that, wouldn't the safer practice be simply to say it doesn't involve business methods?",
  "No ruling in this case is going to change State Street --",
  "-- because it wasn't looking at process or the meaning of \"process.\" It was looking at something else.",
  "Now, if it veers the other way, which is by saying that we exclusively rely on the machine-or-transformation test, that we're precluding applications of the patent law in those fields, the things we can't imagine. Once you announce an exclusive test, you're shoe-horning technologies that might be different.",
  "All right. So help us with a test that doesn't go to the extreme the Federal Circuit did, which is to preclude any other items, something we held open explicitly in two other cases, so we would have to backtrack and say now we are ruling that we were wrong, and still get at something like this?",
  "Well, but that –- that goes back to, not 101, but 102 and 103. That goes back to obviousness or the standard weeding mechanisms for patents.",
  "Counsel, the problem with every test is that you can find an exception that makes the application ridiculous. Let's assume that we accept that headquarters or nerve center may have some applicability to a corporation that has a business in a variety of different States.",
  "All right. That's - - your situation is perhaps the most attractive - -",
  "-- because whether California has 20 percent and Florida 14 or 15 percent, to me the differences are not terribly substantial. I can imagine McDonald's having 1 percent in every part of the world, and how do you choose then? California would say, then you -- you go back to headquarters. But I don't know why you start there. But let's posit the simpler situation. Headquarters in New Jersey, but everything else is in California. Your test would ignore completely that - - and it depends on how you define \"headquarters.\" If they have three corporate executives, that's the entire extent -- or let's say one corporate executive who started the company and who lives in New Jersey, and he flies out to California half the time and runs the business from there but happens to live in New Jersey. Then you would say diversity is still New Jersey, correct?",
  "But you have not articulated a -- at least to me, a meaningful principle in which to set that exception. It has to be tied somehow to the test and why the test in some situations would have applicability and others may not.",
  "Because I don't know the difference between one headquarters and two places to do business or three, but I can still see that some factoring has to be done when the places of business are more limited.",
  "So what constitutes headquarters?",
  "How many executives have to live there? What else has to exist there? And then what is the default rule if those things don't exist?",
  "Counsel, all you are talking about is not necessarily nerve center, because in reading the examples in your brief, what you are talking about is: Where is the place where they have the most important, significant, influential contact? Now, the Ninth Circuit has defined that as the place where business is done; you are suggesting that it's the place where the nerve center is. But it goes back to begging my question: Why -- just simply their declaring it on a tax form doesn't make it important, influential, or significant contact. There has to be something more to the test, and it can't be just what I declare my headquarters to be. There has to be some form of activity in that place.",
  "That's -- that's the point.",
  "Is there -- is there something to a rule that says headquarters is presumptively the nerve center, but a challenged party, whoever that is, can rebut it?",
  "Well, that's the point that I raised, which is that the headquarters is not an important, consequential, or substantial. You can rebut it if you can show that it is a shell headquarters.",
  "Well, but - -",
  "That's the problem, which is, the party comes in, alleges by summary judgment that -- in a summary judgment motion: This is my corporate headquarters. The other side's going to have to come forth with evidence that shows something.",
  "So that it's always a rebuttable presumption.",
  "I actually do not know whether public filings define what \"headquarters\" mean. Is there a -- I know you have said it in your brief, but what I didn't know is whether those public filings define the activity necessary to designate a place as \"headquarters.\"",
  "Why -- why didn't they say place of doing business? That's not the terminology that they used.",
  "That would be more consistent with an aggregation of -- of all of the factors the Ninth Circuit starts with.",
  "Counsel, what's very clear from all of the articles I have read in the lower court decisions is that Congress may have thought it was picking a well-defined phrase, but, in fact, it wasn't, that the Courts below are confused about what they were doing before the statute. So I don't know why importing the belief that something was clear into a reality that it's not helps us.",
  "So why do you -- why do you think that the circuits courts -- the vast majority of them, the third, the first, the second, the fifth, they all start with the proposition that, if a place has far-flung businesses, then the nerve center test should start the inquiry and control it more than in a situation where there are lesser places of business?",
  "Well, that's a big difference.",
  "I -- you know, to me, the word \"substantial\" usually means closer to 50 percent. I'm having a hard time understanding what the appreciable difference is between 20 percent and 14 and the balance being spread over so many other places. What -- that seems very arbitrary in terms of the place that generates the most money. That's it. That's the place you are at home.",
  "Well, but that's what - - but that goes back to the point, if we are talking about shields or swords, Congress had before it a provision that would say, anywhere you do business, you are not a foreigner, because you are there. The people are going to perceive you as a business -- the local business that is doing business in that location, and Congress rejected that. So foreign has to have a meaning that was somewhat different. And you don't think the corporate headquarters where management is, where the direction for the operation of the business is coming from, is the place that needs the most protection in this system because they are the ones making the decisions, and so aren't they the ones who need to be protected from local bias?",
  "That's the very first little shop was there.",
  "Can you tell me what 100 percent means? Are the number of workers in Seattle inconsequential? Is there one worker there or are we talking about 1,000 in - -",
  "Isn't that important? As Justice Scalia said that per capita California is going to dwarf anybody anywhere if you are going to have a multi-location place of business. So don't you have to know the raw numbers?",
  "But that provision came after the original jurisdiction stripping, a number of years after. So why should we look to that to inform what Congress intended at an earlier time with respect to judicial review --",
  "-- or the scope of it or --",
  "You’re talking about --",
  "You’re talking about us acting as policymakers. The question is: Why should we be looking to that to define what Congress intended then, when it --",
  "-- stripped jurisdiction earlier or granted it?",
  "Well, couldn't we look at the fact that when Congress was considering whether to put back into the jurisdiction-stripping statute an exception for constitutional claims, it then knew, because the courts of appeals except for the Seventh, who just recently did it, were routinely taking jurisdiction over motions to reopen? Don't you think that was the time for them to tell us: Hey, you guys got it wrong; we are going to make motions to reopen statutorily discretionary, so if there’s any doubt about this, let's clear up what our intent is.",
  "Wait a minute, you’re -- you’re arguing from a real negative, because some courts had said that other statutes were covered by the jurisdictional bar. You’re arguing that they knew that no court had held that motions to reopen -- that there was no jurisdiction for motions to reopen, that somehow it should have --",
  "How will that happen? Meaning, how will they know, A, that the investigation is occurring; and second, what can they do under Federal or State law to require the disclose of ongoing investigative materials? I don't know -- mind you, I haven't studied them -- but the ones that I am familiar with never permit the public -- none of the Freedom of Information Act-type legislation, never permit the disclosure of ongoing investigative material. So I am a little bit confused by how that would happen.",
  "But Congress obviously wanted more than that, because if Congress's intent was the one that you are announcing then it should have just permitted original sources to sue. But that's not the choice it made. It broadened the scope of qui tam actions to include more sources or more reward for individuals who don't have original information.",
  "But why can't it -- why can't it protect itself if these reports are in its possession? How are they any more in the -- or less in the government's possession than articles in the news media, than State, criminal, civil, and administrative hearings? You, yourself, make it very clear that the government -- it isn't keeping track of all of those other sources.",
  "Isn't that argument suggesting that the court didn't even need to reach this issue, even assuming that the State administrative reports are included in the bar?",
  "Well, aren't you arguing that what was in this audit report wasn't sufficient to show the fraud? That's not your argument?",
  "In which way?",
  "Which way? All it said was that this person wasn't chosen by bidding. But aren't there situations in which non-bids are permitted?",
  "Counselor, that presumes that then Congress is using unnecessary words when it differentiates in a statute between discovery of facts constituting a violation and a different statute, like section 13 or 77m, however you want to call it, when it says \"due diligence.\"",
  "So are we supposed to presume that they like using unnecessary words?",
  "So you're answering me yes, it's unnecessary.",
  "Can you tell me --",
  "Can you tell me what that investigation would entail? Meaning, you started by saying, go talk to experts, but I'm not sure what talking to experts would have added to the market mix of information. You either pick one expert who said the theory was sound or one who didn't. Outside of publicly available information, what -- and finding it -- what other inquiry could they have made that would have led them to discover sufficient information to file a lawsuit?",
  "Assuming they had talked to those lawyers, is there anything to suggest that those lawyers had more information than the ones they included in the publicly available lawsuit?",
  "You haven’t answered my question. Is there some information in some publicly filed lawsuit up until the time of the filing of this lawsuit that disclosed more information about scienter than existed?",
  "Could you -- could you tell me what the difference is between actual knowledge and constructive knowledge? Because as I read the amici who have submitted briefs arguing that actual discovery should be our standard, they appear to say that actual discovery or actual knowledge includes anything that’s in the public domain; that parties are presumed -- and we have plenty of cases that say that -- to know what's out there. So outside of that, how would constructive knowledge or constructive discovery be any different?",
  "It would require the shareholder to find the guy in Burma? Or to go and attempt in every case to engage employees in dishonorable conduct by talking about their business in private, company business -- as I understood it, we were asking employees to engage in potentially fiduciary breaches?",
  "Well, that's going further than the amici are suggesting. The amici are suggesting -- and assuming we accept their suggestion -- that it should be everything that’s in the public domain, which seems reasonable to me.",
  "What, in addition, do you think constructive knowledge would include that the actual knowledge standard doesn't?",
  "Putting all of that --",
  "-- what in addition to that would it include, in your mind?",
  "So -- so you are conceding amici's point that actual -- an actual knowledge standard is the same as a constructive knowledge standard?",
  "Can -- can you tell me what you see as the difference between the two? I keep going back to what the amici has argued, which is actual knowledge that includes knowledge of what's in the public domain, under the theory that every shareholder is presumed to know what's in the public domain because that's what they buy with and that's the market theory of securities law. So, what do you see as a difference between the two?",
  "But I -- it sounds right, but give me a practical -- give me a practical example --",
  "-- of what you are talking about, where -- where an individual investor would have something that's not in the public domain.",
  "Well -- but actual knowledge would include anything the investor had in their possession because that's what actual knowledge is; I have it in my possession -- or I have it in the public domain. You start it from there.",
  "The -- the only difference then would be information the individual would have been able to get that wouldn't have been in the public domain?",
  "I -- so we are in agreement that on a fraud-on-the-market case, it might have a different -- they would be identical?",
  "You are suggesting that, in an individual fraud case, the inquiry has to be constructive knowledge because there could be things that --",
  "So you are admitting that you filed an improper complaint, that you didn't have a basis -- a good faith basis for the complaint you filed?",
  "So, if you had a good faith basis, what was -- what was in your possession that gave you that good faith basis?",
  "Counsel, I -- whether it's a legal nullity or not, answer my question which is: You had to have a basis for your complaint. What was in your possession or in the public possession that gave you that basis?",
  "Well, you think there was, because you filed suit a month after that study in 2003.",
  "Is there a -- is there a difference between unethical and illegal advice?",
  "As an attorney can you under -- give unethical advice?",
  "Under the State rules you can give unethical advice as a lawyer?",
  "So if you are not permitted to do so, what in the First Amendment would otherwise give you that right? I mean, this is a commercial transaction of sorts. It's a fiduciary duty, but it's a commercial transaction. They are coming to you and they are paying you for certain advice, so why would the person then protect your right to give unethical advice.",
  "We are assuming that it's not read with a limitation with respect to abusive conduct.",
  "Assuming that is read into the statute or is viewed as part of \"in contemplation of bankruptcy,\" what in the First Amendment would make that be?",
  "Which doesn't explain why.",
  "You don't understand what it means as a lawyer?",
  "Before you go on on 528, could you clarify for me: What is your challenge to 528? Is it a normal - -",
  "Is it a normal facial invalidity? Is it an overbreadth invalidity? Is it an as-applied challenge? What exactly are you claiming with respect to that - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Can you tell me how you have an as-applied challenge when I don't even know what ad is at issue?",
  "I -- I have scoured the record for a handbill, meaning -- an advertisement - -",
  "-- by you that I could look at and say, you know, I'm looking at it and it's not misleading. So where is it in the record?",
  "I -- I truly have never heard of an as-applied challenge when we don't know what it is being applied to. But putting that aside, so you have an as-applied challenge; do you have a facial challenge or an overbreadth challenge?",
  "Did the government bring this lawsuit below?",
  "So what, were they supposed to scour your advertisements to find the violation? Was that it?",
  "Could I ask you something? When you are an attorney advertising as an attorney who gives advice on bankruptcy, why aren't you a debt release -- relief advisor?",
  "That's -- that's the clear case. How about the person comes in, shows the attorney his or her financial state. There is no money to pay the fee. The attorney simply gives a bill and says, \"I need it by Friday.\" No self-respecting person would believe that the individual is going to pay that bill without borrowing money from somewhere, if you have looked at their financial statement and there is no money to be had. Would the attorney have violated the statute there?",
  "Just one. So, basically, your bottom line is any advice to incur debt to pay an attorney is illegal?",
  "Perhaps I am being - - not quite understanding you. You are underscoring the more debt, that is going to always be additional, if the advice is to incur it. So what meaning are you giving to more that I am missing?",
  "How about a law firm that represents the biggest companies in the world? And so they are never going to consciously, intentionally seek out or represent a person defined with the financial limitations of this category. But it so happens that one of their very rich clients comes in and says, I have a small -- my brother-in-law is running a small business; help him or her. Is that firm in violation now because their advertisements did not include what 528(a) required?",
  "So they have to -- for this one brother-in-law, they have to amend -- they're now violated the statute ex post facto somehow?",
  "It was wrong. Let's assume --",
  "-- the circuit -- the district court judge, the bankruptcy court judge, got it wrong, legal error. Should not have been discharged, a given. Neither -- the confirmation plan should not have been approved, neither should the discharge order have been entered. We will go back to what was entered and -- and -- and the effect of that, because I'm not sure of it -- it's an error. How does that give you a right to undo that judgment 7 years later -- was it 5, 6, 7 years later? That's the question here. Why is something that's in error become a void judgment?",
  "But so does -- most error committed by courts, inadvertently or otherwise, are in contravention of some statutory command. This is no different. Voidness, as I've heard it described by many others, appears to mean that the court is acting either without jurisdiction over the people, and that's not at issue here -- there was jurisdiction over the parties here -- or without jurisdiction over the res. But the bankruptcy court does have jurisdiction, albeit in some -- in all circumstances, it had jurisdiction over the student debt. The issue is what could it do with it. But this is not a case involving a lack of jurisdiction by the court over property. So why is this more than mere error?",
  "But that -- that goes back to something more fundamental. There’s no issue here that the court had jurisdiction over these parties, unlike the insurance company. And there’s no issue that the court didn't have jurisdiction over this res. They could decide that a student loan was dischargeable. They just had to follow certain procedures. It's a very different set of circumstances in that case.",
  "So it's not -- it's not that it is not dischargeable. It's only dischargeable under certain conditions.",
  "All right. So -- so you’re almost begging the question, because it's possible to argue that if a debt is not dischargeable at all under any circumstance, your argument might have more legs because then the court has no jurisdiction over that property.",
  "But that's not the case with these exceptions. They can all be discharged. It's just a matter of whether the conditions have been met or not.",
  "Could I --",
  "Counsel --",
  "Counsel, may I interrupt for just one moment, because I -- there is something niggling at me that I do need an answer to before you sit down --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Counsel, if they had come to the court at the time the discharge order was about to be entered and said we object, there has been no undue hardship found, would the court have been obligated to alter the plan at that point? The confirmed plan proposed a discharge, but at the time that the discharge order was being entered, there’s an objection.",
  "What would have happened?",
  "So that's the question. What's final? Is it the plan that’s final or is it the discharge order that’s final?",
  "Well, but -- but here we have a discharge order that on its face appeared to be proper. It excepted out the student loan from the discharge.",
  "And your other -- the other side has sort of given up on that as a --",
  "-- as a point, because that, interestingly enough to me, would have been the stronger due process argument, whether the Ninth Circuit and the district court could have amended that discharge order illegally to except something it didn't except, that was -- shouldn't have been excepted to start with. But that argument seems to have been put aside.",
  "But -- so, it might have been the stronger due process argument. But having put that aside, then your belief is that there is no point in time between the confirmation in the plan and the discharge order in which a party can object for -- to an error --",
  "-- except as permitted by 60(b) and 1330?",
  "Which order could they have -- they could not have appealed --",
  "They could not have appealed the discharge order?",
  "Well, going back to Justice Kennedy's point, I mean, some people are listed in discharge orders that were never discussed in the plan, or otherwise some people are excluded that should have been included. Those people can't appeal?",
  "Could you go back to the fundamental part of my question to your adversary? The plan order included a discharge of the student interest -- of the interest on the student loan.",
  "It just proposed a discharge of a certain amount lesser than the principal plus interest.",
  "Right. That's the plan. And then you have a discharge order. And the two are not congruent. So what's the final judgment?",
  "No, no. Is it the confirmation order or is it the discharge order? Are they different judgments? What -- what controls? And what were you --",
  "Counsel, before this legislation, in the seaward side of the land that belonged to the State, from the mean high-water mark, a hot dog stand could have sat in the water, correct?",
  "And someone could have stood there, a boat could have docked there, assuming that it -- it was a shallow boat. You had no control over anyone placing anything on the seaside submerged lands that belonged to the State, outside of whatever regulations the State decided it wanted to impose?",
  "The ECL that has been created by this legislation -- you gave up any challenge to it -- it was established at that mean water mark, wasn't it?",
  "So, right now, we just have to assume that it was -- that it -- it has established the line at a point where the State owns all the land seaward of the ECL, correct?",
  "So after this project finishes, that hot water -- that hot dog vendor will be on stateside land, correct?",
  "No different than what exists today, before the legislation, which is if the hot dog vendor wanted to sit in a foot of water, it could have?",
  "All right. So none of your actual use rights, pleasure rights, or anything else has been changed. What you're arguing is that -- and what the Florida State Supreme Court described as the contingent future possibility that the high-water mark might change and you could push that hot dog vendor back another foot or two.",
  "Counsel --",
  "Would you have answered Justice Scalia's question that there's a common -- a generally understood common law right, littoral right, to contact with the water? Would you say there is not?",
  "One of your amici -- one of the amici suggested that the Florida courts cannot read the Florida Constitution more expansively than the Federal requirements. Are you rejecting that proposition?",
  "And it's a different question. One of the amici suggests that the Florida Constitution and Florida case law says that they can't read the Florida Constitution more broadly than it is read under Federal law.",
  "So this could be a first, if we were to start from the proposition that Justice Ginsburg did?",
  "Do -- do you see a conflict between the language of our decisions where we often say that Miranda rights have to be clear and those decisions that say that whatever is said has to reasonably convey the essence of the Miranda warnings? Is there a difference between those two statements, and which of our cases or statements would control?",
  "So you would suggest that if something is not clear and it's ambiguous, that that's enough? Or -- or is there a difference between reasonable and clarity? That has to be read in a certain way; otherwise an ambiguous warning --",
  "I have a difficulty in terms of this argument about burdening law enforcement. This is a preprinted form that the police made up, correct?",
  "So what's the added burden by making the form absolutely and abundantly clear or conforming the form to the statements in Miranda? What's the cost to the State? They’re going to print the form anyway. They are telling their officers to read from the form anyway. What's the added cost?",
  "Well, there is a question about how much the subjective intent of the questioner should be involved in this process or not. There are cases where it appears the plurality of our Court has said it should always be an objective standard, and others where certain members have expressed a question about subjective. But if we are dealing with a printed form, why wouldn't the intent of the entity at issue be placed in question? Meaning, you could have -- the police here could have chosen to be explicit, but instead they chose to be -- to obfuscate a little bit and be less explicit. Shouldn't we assume that that’s an intent to deceive or perhaps to confuse?",
  "But why? The -- the easy solution is to do what 90 percent of the jurisdictions are doing: Copy Miranda.",
  "Except that Justice Scalia just pointed out, if we approve the language of this, then -- of this particular warning, it becomes the new sort of floor. And if we make it the new floor, it -- doesn't it provide an incentive for police departments to move away from the explicit warnings that say “during and” -- “before and during” interrogations; now we're saying -- you know, generalize them more.",
  "Aren't we encouraging that?",
  "How many after Duckworth? Do you know?",
  "So we don't know how many --",
  "What -- how do we deal with the fact that, if the purpose of Miranda is to give clear warnings, and your adversary says -- not your adversary -- your co-counsel -- Petitioner's counsel says that means -- \"clear\" means does it reasonably convey? We've got a split of circuit courts and State courts on whether this reasonably conveys or not. Shouldn't that be enough of an ambiguity for us to conclude it can't reasonably convey, if there's this many courts holding that it doesn't?",
  "Are you calling the Florida State Supreme Court majority unreasonable jurists?",
  "What happens now is that we are dealing with the exception rather than the rule, and -- but this was the rule, meaning this was the form that they were reading. And if it has some significant ambiguity in it, sufficient for at least one court to say it wasn't sufficiently clear, it wasn't explicit enough, should we worry about the exception as an exception?",
  "Just so I get the bottom line -- if all this warning had said was, you have a right to a lawyer before questioning --",
  "You have a right to a lawyer before questioning --",
  "-- it would be your position that standing alone that would be enough?",
  "The bottom line in my mind -- the question is, whether these warnings are substantively or otherwise different than the FBI warnings that some believe were approved in Miranda. Are these equivalent?",
  "I don't disagree with you, but that wasn't my question. My question was, did the FBI warning at issue or --",
  "Not at issue because it wasn't at issue.",
  "But that was reviewed and approved in Miranda, did it give that --",
  "They can't pass rules?",
  "What -- what is the difference between what you are talking about and an employer who says: Look, I can't stick my nose in every bit of business that goes on in my office because that's impossible; otherwise I’d be doing all the work and I just humanly can't. I'm delegating to you the responsibility to do X, Y, and Z according to these rules of conduct.",
  "What's the difference between that and this scheme?",
  "Well -- let's break down each part of your argument, please. You are suggesting that Congress doesn't have the power to determine that a particular principal or agent of the government doesn't have certain responsibilities?",
  "But you just --",
  "Is it unconstitutional for the President not to be able to appoint an inferior officer?",
  "Assuming we don't accept your characterization of them?",
  "But that's because the statute required it.",
  "I understand them to be saying nondisclosure of a conflict of interest, so they are a little bit more --",
  "So why don't you take them at their face, which is, they are saying it has to be a nondisclosure of a conflict of interest that's material?",
  "I think that's what --",
  "So let's take it from there.",
  "Why is that --",
  "-- not a limiting principle?",
  "It's -- it's much easier in the public sector, I agree with you, to --",
  "-- to talk about it in the -- I'm sorry. In the private sector, it's easier to talk about.",
  "I’m not sure that -- that whether he did it with disclosure or nondisclosure, what would make the nondisclosure more meaningful? Meaning, it's taking the bribe, whether he discloses it or not --",
  "-- and if he gets up on the floor of -- of the legislature and says: You know, I am going to vote for this bill because somebody paid me money, he disclosed it. It doesn't make it any better.",
  "What if he had voted against the legislation?",
  "So it's not merely the taking official action; it's taking official action that benefits him?",
  "Please articulate it again for me. I -- I am -- I don't think I'm being thick. I’m trying to understand exactly what that duty is, because I think I just heard something that doesn't make sense to me. You are saying if there’s a State duty to disclose, a Federal duty to disclose, if they are legal duties, that would violate it, and now something else?",
  "I don't know what's so discretionary and harmful about a bribery or kickback case. Let's take just the limiting principle of the trunk. Whether it's in the private or the public sector, why would, offering, there be any discretion or any sense of vagueness about saying: It's illegal to give a bribery?",
  "To get a contract, to pass legislation, it's illegal to take a kickback. There is nothing seemingly vague about that or seemingly troublesome about prosecutorial discretion in those - - at least those two situations. We could then go to the self-dealing question.",
  "Counsel - -",
  "-- does Skilling -- I'm sorry.",
  "Directly answer this question: Does Skilling present the pure question or not?",
  "We don't know if that's going to be - -",
  "Then what's the source -- and I think that's inherent in the Chief Justice's question -- what is it -- where did he draw the line and where do we go to look to where you draw the line on what information needs to be disclosed? Because if it's not a niece, my best friend is going to get a 1.4 million on this deal. Where is the line drawn, and what is the source of the law that we look to to figure out where to draw that line?",
  "So you are talking about private gain? Do I gain something as opposed to - - because that -- I know that is the Skilling case. But if - -",
  "No, but that's -- you have to, because you have to tell us what draws -- you have to give us the source or some source of limiting, of limitation. And that's what Justice Breyer has been talking about.",
  "But defined how? That's what I'm -- I'm trying -- material in what way? Because if you don't how by an economic loss to the victim or by private gain to the -- to the perpetrator, then you are left with what substance to the issue of materiality?",
  "What becomes important?",
  "That the -- for an auditor on April 14th his guy -- or April 1st his employee goes off to a ball game? It could be a huge economic loss to that employer by that employee's decision at that particular moment to go to a baseball game as opposed to working.",
  "But the Second Circuit said economic loss - -",
  "-- that there has to be the risk of economic loss - -",
  "-- in the private sector.",
  "But is the problem the nondisclosure?",
  "Or is the problem the - - the self-dealing itself, the fact that the person is receiving a gain? There's where I'm trying to draw the line because I keep going back to -- what is the source of information that would put a limitation on how much you disclose or don't disclose? It has to be -- the issue has to be looked at differently, which is the evil is the self-dealing, the gain the person's receiving. I know, you don't want me to go there because of Skilling, but I'm troubled because the issue of disclosure creates a Federal common law of what's important to tell either the public or a private employer? And I don't know how to define that issue of importance - -",
  "-- other than to say that it's a gain that the individual's receiving or something the individual's doing.",
  "I'm sorry. You're - -",
  "-- I know you are running out of time, but you are speaking so fast I can't even follow you anymore.",
  "The State court has interpreted their provision to give the defendant the choice of subpoenaing the witness or asking the State to bring in the witness. Why is that overruling Melendez-Diaz?",
  "Well, how is that different from a notice statute? If --",
  "If we take the statute as the State supreme court has read it --",
  "-- they say: In my mind, it's a notice statute; tell the prosecutor you either want them to call the witness or you subpoena the witness. That's what the State court has told us. Whether or not you had notice of that interpretation is a separate question.",
  "Let's separate out the two questions.",
  "So that's our first question --",
  "Does the Confrontation Clause require, not just the ability to cross-examine --",
  "-- but an affirmative obligation to place the witness on the stand?",
  "Could I just ask you one --",
  "Would swearing the witness in and saying to the witness \"Is this your report?\" and the witness saying \"Yes\" -- what would be unconstitutional about that, given our case law that says that any prior statements by a witness are admissible once the witness is on the stand or constitutionally admissible once they are on the stand?",
  "No, no, no. \"Should\" is a different question than the one I asked.",
  "Do you have anything historically or in any case that would suggest that that is a constitutional requirement? I mean, I do accept that there is plenty that says you have a right to be --",
  "-- to confront the witness.",
  "But what would require the prosecutor to actually do more than I just suggested? \"Is this your statement? Is this your lab report?\"",
  "It's not terribly persuasive. I don't disagree with you.",
  "It’s a matter of trial tactic, but I'm not talking about trial tactic.",
  "Well, but -- so what difference? That's because there’s nothing in evidence about the incident, correct?",
  "And that was a --",
  "Those were found -- I don't -- were those found as violations of the Confrontation Clause?",
  "Or due process?",
  "On the past recollection recorded, the witness doesn't stand by the statement. The witness says: I made the statement, have no current knowledge; I can't stand by it or not stand by it.",
  "You are asking us now to state something that you admit is in really no constitutional case or historical case, that says the right to confrontation means that the witness has to tell the story, and the form of telling that story has to be a verbal recitation; it can't be past recorded recollection because you just said they have to tell the story. It can't be based on official documents or anything else, because it has to be their story. Am I hearing you wrong?",
  "Why -- and -- I trust the trial process, and much of your brief was talking about that process --",
  "-- and the fact that it's much more effective when the witness tells their story and you get a chance to cross-examine than if you have to start from the platform of cross-examination. Once a defendant makes it known that a -- he's going to cross-examine a lab technician, don't you think that in the vast majority of cases the prosecutor is going to put that witness on?",
  "And if he does or doesn't, why shouldn't we leave it to the normal trial strategy and practice to leave to that prosecutor the burden of non-persuasion, which is what confrontation was about?",
  "Which is --",
  "Well -- well, I was starting from a different proposition than you did --",
  "-- because I think that’s a question for your adversaries: How could you have known --",
  "-- that you should have asked the State to bring that witness in? But putting that aside --",
  "-- assume we are reading it the way the Court has now.",
  "It goes -- that goes to the waiver question.",
  "How did they know at trial that they were supposed to say to you: I don't want a subpoena; you bring them in.",
  "But you're -- you're still begging the question. How -- they did what any reasonable defendant would do and say: I object to the admission of this lab report; I have a right under the Confrontation Clause to have the -- the lab technician here. And the Commonwealth court said, no, you don't.",
  "And so did the court on appeal. How did they know that this was a notice­ and-demand statute as opposed to a subpoena statute?",
  "Could I ask you: If we were to -- how do we articulate a rule, or do we need to, that would take care of the fears of your adversary that trials would become trials by affidavit, that the -- that prosecutors will choose to put all witnesses on -- by videotape, by affidavit, by deposition, whatever mode they choose except bringing them into court -- and forcing defendants then to call the witnesses and do a what's -- what I call a cold-cross? What rule would we announce in this case --",
  "-- that would avoid -- what constitutional construction of the Confrontation Clause would we issue that would protect against that?",
  "No, no. Forget the practical. Talk about the legal, constitutional.",
  "Could you -- are you suggesting or are you saying even a trial by affidavit is okay under the Confrontation Clause? Is that your position?",
  "So you are absolutely saying that, under the Confrontation Clause, trial by affidavit of any witness would be okay.",
  "So are you -- are you then saying that there is some other constitutional limit to that choice, outside of the Confrontation Clause? And if you are, what would be that other constitutional limit?",
  "So do we say to them, contrary to what Melendez-Diaz is, that subpoena statutes -- when you read the statute, it says the defendant has to subpoena the witness. On its -- on the face of this statute, without the Commonwealth court's gloss on it --",
  "At what cost?",
  "What the Special Master said was, I believe, that there was never an obligation to do it at all costs. They didn't have to bankrupt their treasury to do this; is that correct?",
  "Do you accept that as a working proposition?",
  "Well, I think there was certainly a significant amount of evidence that the cost of completing this project was way above any reasonable expectation of the parties at the time of contracting, correct?",
  "What -- what do you believe the evidence shows with respect to the reasonable cost of completing this project?",
  "And about a -- an additional 34,000 to get the license?",
  "So -- I'm sorry. I misspoke. So over $100 million?",
  "An amount equal to what they had already -- everybody had already put in?",
  "And about how many times greater than the initial estimates?",
  "I thought it was about 20 or 30 million dollars was initially estimated to ­ - to do this project.",
  "I -- I'm only going through these to try to get a sense from you of at what point did North Carolina have a right to claim impossibility? You are saying that --",
  "Well, it did by saying, we can't complete this project.",
  "Could I interrupt just a moment?",
  "Let's assume they hadn't taken the 80 million. Let's assume they had sunk all of that money themselves --",
  "-- and they looked and said: It's going to take us another 120 million to complete this; we just can't. What in the compact stopped them from withdrawing? Because the only provision I see in the contract about withdrawing is the one that says once the facility is completed --",
  "-- you have to keep -- you have to give notice, four-year notice.",
  "Right, okay. So assuming they are acting in good faith, I still don't quite understand what the difference is except the fact that they took what you’ve described in other counts as an unjust enrichment. You got us to give you some money to help you along in this project. But the situation hasn't changed. We can't spend more money. We certainly can't spend the amount of money it will take to complete this project. I'm not sure what turns that into bad faith, other than your claim that they --",
  "Well, but the hypothetical I gave you before you described as good faith: Just too much money.",
  "What turns it into bad faith?",
  "My -- my problem remains --",
  "-- with that answer, is that you earlier said that they could -- forgetting if they didn't take any money -- under the terms of this compact -- and Justice Scalia has been noting this repeatedly -- have withdrawn at any time because they didn't want to sink any more money into this project; is that correct?",
  "Well, let's put aside that duty of good faith --",
  "-- because with that duty of good faith, you're suggesting that merely because they took a million -- that's what the Chief Justice is asking you -- or 80 million, that that somehow converted or changed the express terms of the contract and bound them in some way to find funding that they chose not to. That -- that's really the argument I'm hearing you make.",
  "May I ask you just one question on the sovereign immunity issue?",
  "Is there any factual development that needs to occur before the Special Master to address the legal questions that have been presented? And I see the legal questions as whether or not, in fact, the claim belongs to the Commission or to the States for the $80 million and the $10 million in lost revenue.",
  "Is there any factual development that needs to occur, or is that a pure legal question based on the arguments that are contained in the briefs before us?",
  "But isn't there an obligation before we exercise original jurisdiction to ensure that there is at least a potential viable claim by the States that they have a cause of action? I mean, that then becomes a legal question. Is the compact -- is the Commission an agent?",
  "Do the States own these revenues?",
  "You are suggesting that --",
  "But we do that all the time, for example, with -- with sovereign immunity. We --",
  "We tell district courts when there is a sovereign immunity issue, do the -- whatever discovery you need on the question, but address it, because it's jurisdictional.",
  "There has to be a basis for the claim.",
  "I'm not -- I'm not --",
  "I don't question that the States may have some legitimate claims. The question is do they have legitimate claims to what the Commission is seeking. I think that's the question.",
  "Can I ask you, what is the policy advantage of the rule you are proposing with respect to the first question, the joinder of the Commission in this original action, of us proceeding to answer substantive questions about the interpretation of the compact, et cetera, without addressing initially the right of the Commission to bring this action as an original action at all? It seems to be putting the cart before the horse, or -- because I'm not sure why we should be reaching the merits, deciding the merits, before identifying which are the parties and what claims they have before us.",
  "But this one won't.",
  "How did that help the other compacting States, giving them the $80 million and North Carolina walking away?",
  "I'm hard-pressed to understand where that comes from. Under the terms of the contract -- the compact, the compact expressly says that none of the contracting States have any liabilities with respect to this --",
  "Exactly.",
  "What --",
  "Could I ask you a question? Is all of this money that has been spent or was spent up until 1999 -- has it been washed away? Meaning -- and this may be what remains for the unjust enrichment claims, but is there any value left to what occurred?",
  "There’s no facility --",
  "That provision just says the States don't have to give anything more than that, that that's what satisfies whatever obligations they may or may have. But where does it say that money belongs to them?",
  "Could I just understand -- and I don't know if I am missing something -- your theory that this belongs to the States relies exclusively on either an agency or an ownership theory as alternatives?",
  "There's nothing else that would make it --",
  "That's -- that's -- if we disagree with that --",
  "All right. And then we have to address that. Is there any other theory that would give the States the right to make the claims the Commission is making?",
  "For the return of the $80 million.",
  "If we don't do that, what are you left with?",
  "I already posed a hypothetical. Don't -- if we don't, what is left of this case?",
  "Under your theory -- under the theory that you are proposing, then, any dangerous person, whether it's because of mental illness or any other reason, could be held indefinitely --",
  "-- under a civil commitment statute, because what you're saying is that the Federal Government, merely because of their -- their time in control of the individual, has an unlimited constitutional power to then civilly commit this dangerous person.",
  "Well, what -- what constrains the government under the Due Process Clause from invoking a dangerousness merely because someone has a long history. We have many criminal defendants with long histories of violent behavior. Many of them continue that violent behavior in prison, and some of them at the end of their term are let out, because their term has been completed. So what -- what in the Due Process Clause protects --",
  "But that's where I'm trying to understand --",
  "-- the connection between the nature of the mental illness and the constitutional power that you are claiming. What -- what is it that gives you that power?",
  "But that's -- but that's an easier case, because at least you have an interstate connection to the offensive conviction and the ground for future commitment. But these statutes don't depend on that element being a part of the commitment process. There's no -- there's no congressional -- there's no tie to a congressional power that justifies the commitment other than that the person is sexually dangerous.",
  "It's that special relationship.",
  "But that doesn't take care of the fact that the prisoner would be released before there was a cure found for the alleged mental illness, meaning supervised release generally has a term limit.",
  "Could -- what would happen if Congress said, as part of a sentence, a judge could incorporate a civil commitment finding and say: You are going to serve X amount in jail and Y amount, and then we are going to civilly commit you indefinitely, because as of today, I am finding you a sexual predator subject to a mental illness. Would that be constitutional, and if not, why not?",
  "Well, I -- let's assume it incorporates all the protections of -- of this statute with respect to periodic review.",
  "So it's constitutional because it's part of the sentence?",
  "All right. Because it’s --",
  "Well, so that would be true whether or not you were convicted of a sex crime or a tax crime or any other crime, so long as the judge was making a finding that this was necessary to protect the public?",
  "All right --",
  "But what you’re saying is, then, that the nexus is -- the nexus with the need for the criminal justice system or the proper and necessary power to address this problem ends at the point of sentencing, is what you’re saying?",
  "Well, it says that it exists as a result of its control over this individual, its special relationship, and the fact that at the end of the sentence, it has an obligation to the public.",
  "There is an alternative, isn't there?",
  "For the woman to go to the Chilean court?",
  "Ms. Anders, that's the point, isn't it? The purpose of the convention is which court will decide the life of that child, correct?",
  "And to avoid, as I understood the convention structure, this flight from court to court and this long, drawn-out process from country to country over who's going to make that choice, correct?",
  "And so the idea is, whether it's one custody right -- correct me if I am wrong -- whether it's one custody right or many, which court is going to decide what's in the best interest of that child?",
  "Counsel, you said in your brief that this position by the Solicitor General is long-standing. I’m quoting. What do we look to, to see how far back and under how many administrations this position has been taken and in what form?",
  "But we have been a part of the Special Commission since 1989, correct?",
  "Is there anything in the history of the negotiation and passage of the -- of the treaty that -- that reflects what the U.S.'s position was on this particular issue?",
  "Let's assume there’s a law that says joint custody; mom can determine the place to live; mom can determine the education of the child; dad can visit when he wants; dad can review choices but not veto them. But we consider this joint custody. Under your view, what defines custody under the convention in a way that would justify an American court saying, that's not a custodial right; even though the law of that domestic jurisdiction defines that and says, that's our terms of joint custody, but we create this kind of joint custody?",
  "Right. Regardless of what the terms of that right are, so long as the domestic law deems it such, correct?",
  "Well, except the -- the convention doesn't define custodial rights, correct? It doesn't give them meaning except in one way, the right to determine a place of residence, correct?",
  "Now, that's a little tough, because parents provide care in so many different ways. And weren't the convention members very cognizant of the fact that in different countries that has different meanings?",
  "That's not the word they used. They used \"custody rights including determining the place of residence.\" So they didn't give any greater meaning to the word \"care\" than that.",
  "The convention article 13 starts at 14, right?",
  "Is Mr. Abbott still in Chile?",
  "And at the time when the child was removed, there was ongoing custody motions before the court in Chile?",
  "Counsel, if the district court were to say: You violated the act; this was a mistake of law not covered, but I'm not awarding statutory damages because - -",
  "-- in this case, just for the reasons here, you did something the Sixth Circuit -- or that the circuit law said was permissible, so you didn't do it -- you did it intentionally because you did the violation of the act, but it was based on a mistake of law.",
  "Congress wrote this statute to -- to have a cottage industry of litigation. These were attorneys - -",
  "Do you think before our Heintz decision, that they intended for debt collectors to have an automatic defense if they just called up a lawyer? And so a lawyer's opinion would give them absolute immunity from liability?",
  "No, I think part of the difficulty in this case, isn't it, is the -- is our Heintz decision which made lawyers debt collectors, and so now we are in this quandary about a lawyer's good faith. But -- but if we start with what was understood at the time, do you think that this language was intended to give debt collectors immunity by simply calling a lawyer?",
  "Call a lawyer.",
  "Call a lawyer.",
  "Just have a lawyer sign off.",
  "Even if the lawyer made a mistake, if the debt collector relies, you know, I have a reputable law firm, they are well educated, they tell me they do legal research, that -- I can assume that, so why don't I have a \"get out of jail\" card?",
  "Were there any district court decisions, of any kind, reading bona fide errors to mean legal mistakes under any of the other statutes?",
  "The ones that were not changed, the ones that Justice Ginsburg is -- is describing.",
  "Under TILA, that's why Congress may or may not have acted - -",
  "I'm talking about under this statute, under any other statute that uses similar language.",
  "Were there any district court cases that were reading those statutes to include mistakes of law?",
  "But that was after the TILA amendment?",
  "I was talking about the time that Congress was look at amending the statutes.",
  "But there was no joint venture with respect to the television rights, meaning there was no separate activity, other than the televising of the shows at issue. Here, the Solicitor General is saying there is a joint venture, and it has to do with the licensing of trademarks, with their quality control, et cetera. Isn't that a substantial difference?",
  "They couldn't -- they couldn't stop that team from joining another league? Let's assume -- and I -- you know, I don't know enough about football, but let's assume there are two leagues playing. One of them plays on Saturday and the other plays on Sunday. You’re suggesting that the venture couldn't stop their members from joining that other league? What's the purpose of being in a venture if -- if you are free to reject it and go to somewhere else?",
  "Counsel, you -- the Solicitor General is asking us to remand under his new test to find out whether you are challenging the joint venture or challenging simply the licensing to one individual or one entity. What are you doing? Do you have an answer to that?",
  "Meaning -- I don't --",
  "Could -- using your example, could you tell me what the different questions would be under the single control theory you’re proposing and a rule of reason application in its normal course? So, what are the questions you would ask under your theory, and how do they differ from what would happen under a rule of reason analysis?",
  "Let's -- let’s not go into this case. Let's -- let's stay with your single commissioner.",
  "Well, how does that stop any group of competitors from coming in and saying: Gee, I want to sell my gas; I'm going to let this single commissioner decide how much my gas will sell for, and if he chooses to sell it at the same price to everybody, both gas products, that's okay. How do you get to that?",
  "Excuse me. Did the teams -- did the NFL Properties or some centralized entity always exploit the trademarks of all the franchises, or was there a long period of time in which they each individually franchised their products?",
  "But there was some, and that was done by the individual teams?",
  "What decision could the sports teams make that would be subject to the antitrust scrutiny under your definition of the permissible range of the joint venture activities? It seems to me that if the venture wanted to make sure all the teams hired secretaries at the same $1,000-a-year salary, that under your theory, that's okay, because it's a joint venture.",
  "So the answer to my question is there is -- you are seeking through this ruling what you haven't gotten from Congress: an absolute bar to an antitrust claim.",
  "So -- so answer my question. What decision --",
  "The -- if the reasonableness of this decision, that T-shirts promote the game, is so self-evident, then why wouldn't the rule of reason control completely?",
  "Why do we need to even go to the single-entity question when, by your own answer, it is undisputed, so abundantly clear, so reasonable?",
  "What's the need to -- to label it “single entity,” as opposed to label it what it is, reasonable?",
  "But is not the whole purpose, and I certainly sympathize with that argument. But isn't the proposition of antitrust law that we have a reason for worrying about concerted activity? We have a genuine concern as -- well, Congress does -- about independent entities joining together and fixing prices. And we permit them to do so, as Justice Breyer indicated, when the venture has a purpose that’s independent than -- from the individual interests, but we say, when it doesn't, we have to ensure, under the rule of reason, that what they are doing is reasonable. I'm -- I’m very swayed by your arguments, but I can very much see a counterargument that promoting T-shirts is only to make money. It doesn't really promote the game. It promotes the making of money. And once you fix prices for making money, that's a Sherman Act violation.",
  "But they own the trademarks, so they could.",
  "You are not arguing us creating Federal common law for tortious interference. You are saying they’re the actual party to the contract. So which theory are you -- are you arguing?",
  "So you've given up the agency argument?",
  "How is that issue still alive? Wasn't there an NLRB order in May of '06 that said -- or directed that the contract become effective as of July 2nd?",
  "Did anybody appeal that order or challenge it?",
  "So did -- but how -- if you lost in your appeal to the Ninth Circuit and the contract is effective July 2nd, what issue remains for anybody to decide with respect to contract formation?",
  "Because there has been a final adjudication of the question of the effective date of the contract.",
  "So now the only question that appears to be extant in my mind is whether or not there was a breach of the no-strike clause. So why isn't that subject to arbitration by the very terms of the arbitration clause?",
  "But I keep going back to: That issue was decided. It was decided by the NLRB, and that was affirmed by a court of law, and so -- by the Ninth Circuit. I don't understand what the extant issue is. The -- the -- now what's left is applying that in arbitration to the question of the effectiveness of the no-strike clause. But it has nothing to do with whether or not the issue of ratification has been decided and by whom.",
  "I thought you answered Justice Alito \"no,\" but I thought his question was a very simple one. You’re taking the position, I think, that there’s no dispute that on -- in December a contract was formed.",
  "It was made retroactive to a date before July. It started in May --",
  "-- and it covers a time frame.",
  "The dispute between the parties is what that retroactivity under the contract means and which provisions are in effect or not. Isn't that what your argument is -- that this is not contract formation; this is a question of -- of the applicability of individual provisions to a set of facts?",
  "So your answer to Justice Alito should have been: We are arguing that the no-strike clause was not in effect, but we do take the position that the arbitration clause was --",
  "-- made retroactive.",
  "What remedies -- I'm sorry.",
  "Do you seriously think that if that becomes a problem, that the NLRB won't declare it an unfair labor practice, or if they don't, that they won't go to Congress and say: There is a no-man's land; now give a remedy like you did in 301? You’re -- you’re begging Justice Breyer's question, which is: If the law pre-empts this claim and it's doing so unjustly, who should make that determination? Should it be you in a State court, you in a Federal court, or should it be in the first instance the NLRB who says this is or isn't an unfair labor practice, and if it rules it's not because the law doesn't cover it, or it's not authorized to issue this --",
  "When would you -- when would you measure your constructive termination? At what point would the statute of limitations begin to run or stop under your definition?",
  "So you -- you would say that the franchisee in this situation would have had to say: I can't pay the increased amount of rent without the subsidy; I'm going to stop.",
  "I'm going to leave the premises.",
  "And what about the statutory right for a preliminary injunction? When would that right kick in, in this situation?",
  "Because the preliminary injunction stops the change of a contract price -- of a contract term, obviously, or it continues it. So when -- at what point would --",
  "And for -- if for whatever reason the judge says no at the preliminary injunction stage, that's the end of it; the franchisee just has to leave the premises?",
  "Can we -- can -- perhaps to bring this to more practical terms, you can walk through with me. I'm going to assume that if a franchisor changes a rent term and the franchisee refuses to pay, wouldn't the franchisor at some point give a notice of termination? What franchisor is going to sit through months and months and years of waiting for payment before kicking someone out? Is it -- is that rationally going to happen in any situation?",
  "Or -- or, so that in almost all situations, at least with respect to the leased premises, in a breach of the leased premises, the termination would be -- would have to happen.",
  "So why do we need to make a constructive eviction theory when, on a practical basis, there always in this situation has to be a notice of termination, at least with respect to the premises part?",
  "I know. But at some point the franchisor is going to have to take over the premises, either by trying to evict the person or locking them out. No -- no rational franchisor is going to raise rent, not have the franchisee pay, and fail to terminate the agreement.",
  "But the franchisee could always just stop paying the rent. He doesn't have to leave the premises.",
  "Counsel, can I ask you, have you accepted the majority's reasoning in the Dersch case, the Seventh Circuit case, with respect to 2805(f)? You haven't raised that argument in your brief, so obviously, you have accepted their view that 2805(f) doesn't apply to the right to preserve your claims of improper --",
  "The Seventh Circuit said there’s no implied right of action under 2805(f).",
  "Well, I would have thought your strongest argument would have been that, if we have a statutory right not to waive any of our Federal or State rights, if there has been a non-renewal on reasonable terms, there has been a breach of that obligation under the statute, then you had a right to be renewed under reasonable terms, and if they are giving you unreasonable terms -- \"unreasonable\" being defined within the statutory constraints -- they impose conditions that were imposed in bad faith to drive you out; those are the two conditions -- then you had a right to sue for that, non-renewal, because you had a right to renew on reasonable terms.",
  "Well, but why didn't you make the argument in your briefs? That's why I was asking you whether you agreed with the Seventh Circuit's reasoning, and that's why you didn't raise it or -- what am I missing, that's making that argument not -­",
  "-- one that you relied upon?",
  "You would suggest that in a population that has 9 percent of any group, protected group, that if they didn't have one person serve on a jury per year of that group, that that would not -- under an absolute disparity test using the 10 percent figure, that would not give rise to any kind of suspicion?",
  "It would not meet the Duren's second prong.",
  "Does that make any sense to you?",
  "Well, I don't think that -- that any court has suggested that the complete absence of the protected group in that kind of number wouldn't give rise to a fair representation claim. That's why this Court, the Michigan court, and many others have said that the absolute disparity test just can't be used in every circumstance.",
  "I don't. The question I have you for you is -- that's what you have been advocating, or at least your brief suggested we should. Wouldn't it be better for to us leave this in the hands of the courts to sort of figure out what test is better under what circumstances than us announce a flat rule that would lead to a result like the example that I just used?",
  "Well, I agree that if a protected group is 1 percent of the population, that it’s not likely that their absence is going to give rise to any flags.",
  "But I think there is a difference. I don’t -- I just don't know statistically where. And we have to leave this in the judgment of the lower courts as to where between 1 and 9 or 1 and 10 a difference makes sense. And that's what the courts are saying, is: We can't use one test to determine that.",
  "And so, what -- what did it result in? It resulted over a 6-month period and a difference between 18 percent underrepresentation and 15 percent. And your adversary says that's not statistically meaningful difference, that 3 percent, because it only takes a difference of a couple of people to change it from 18 to 15.",
  "What's -- what's unreasonable about that argument?",
  "You can't -- you are comparing apples and oranges, because your pre-spike was over a year and your post-spike was over 6 months. We don't know what would have happened -- or didn't have statistics of a year or longer.",
  "Could you tell me what would motivate the government to agree to give to a lawyer a piece of a recovery that it, the government, thinks it's entitled to? I mean, it's one thing to work a repayment plan. That starts on the proposition that the individual can only each week or month or whatever give a certain amount of money over. But what --",
  "The problem with your argument is this pot of money is actually not going to -- it's going to the debtor, according to your argument, because in theory the debtor is the prevailing party and is entitled to get the award. But the money is not being paid to the debtor. It's for the benefit of the lawyer who has done the work that Congress wanted done.",
  "I don't know what the -- I don't know what the motivation would be for a lawyer to undertake to represent the meritorious claim when they have to not only do the work in the case, but now have to do the work for the government in getting their client to negotiate an agreement with the government on something that's completely unrelated to the claim.",
  "It's -- it's sort of --",
  "-- illogical.",
  "Is it --",
  "Just so I'm clarifying, is it your position -- and this is something I want to ask the government as well -- that once the EAJA fee is awarded, the attorney couldn't sue the client later even in an offset situation for repayment, because by statute you view them as blocked from --",
  "-- from seeking anything other than the EAJA fee or the 406 fee?",
  "So that once the offset happens, the attorney, under -- even if the client had other money, the attorney would be blocked from going after it?",
  "Because by the terms of the statute they can only seek the EAJA fee?",
  "Either the EAJA fee or the 406 fee.",
  "Counsel, is your adversary correct that under 406(b) --",
  "-- (b)(2), that if these attorneys -- if any attorney attempts to collect from a Social Security or Veterans client any fees outside of those granted --",
  "Counsel, the language of the statute of 703 is to \"limit, segregate, or classify.\"",
  "So is it your position that the violation occurs at the classification that’s announced and that every subsequent hiring has limited someone's opportunity so that they -- there’s a violation subsequently under the limit clause as opposed to the classification clause, or it's each event is a classification violation?",
  "So why don't we look at subsection (h) --",
  "-- that says -- and it's an -- \"it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to give and\" -- conjunctive -- \"and act upon the results.\"",
  "So when you hire, aren't you acting upon the results? And how are you acting upon -- you may be acting upon it, as Petitioner argues, when you classify, but why aren't you acting upon when you hire?",
  "I -- I go back to Justice Breyer's point. Isn't it, in the very act of hiring, you are using the test results and saying -- each time you do it, you’re saying: I'm going to cut off at this limit, and I'm not going to consider someone outside of this limited tier.",
  "But isn't that what \"practice and policy\" means? Meaning that each time, as you continue forward, you are using a particular practice, a particular policy?",
  "So could you answer Justice Stevens's hypothetical? What is the difference between those people and each person who does not have a high school diploma is not -- and is not hired? Does that mean that the moment that they announce the high school diploma requirement, that everybody who had already received one, whether they wanted to work at this job or not, had to sue, and it's only those people who just received the high school diploma who can sue 10 years later?",
  "So what is the difference between the policy announcement that each time I hire, I'm not going to use a high school -- I'm not going to look at people who don't have a high school diploma, and I'm not going to look at people who don't have a test score above 89. What's the difference between those?",
  "So why can't there be --",
  "Could the government stop you from meeting anywhere with the terrorists?",
  "Just meeting, traveling to one of these countries to actually do your teaching to a terrorist -- let's say the law said you're prohibited from traveling to meet any of these individuals. How would that be different than the Cuba situation?",
  "But it's no different than the Cuba situation.",
  "Mr. Cole --",
  "When -- but the way you define the speech that you want protected is speech that is advocating some lawful activity.",
  "So what’s unlawful about teaching people medicine and how to cure people from infection?",
  "So you see no difference -- you’re not advocating a difference in this case between training that could reasonably be used in terrorist activities, because teaching people how to care for the ill could be used to teach people how to care for the wounded.",
  "All right? And the political speech that your group is advocating, i.e., the petitioning -- you’re not willing to draw a distinction?",
  "You are saying to us the case stands and falls on whether or not we accept that this statute regulates conduct as opposed to speech?",
  "No, it regulates training. And what -- the question I asked you --",
  "-- was whether there was a way in your challenge, or whether you are advocating any difference in the nature of the speech, that it's -- this is an as-applied challenge.",
  "And so the question -- because the only answer you have given us is if it's lawful speech, it's protected.",
  "So give me an analytical framework to address that question.",
  "The government says under O'Brien even the speech that you want -- forget about the tsunami aid speech. Let's just talk about the political petitioning speech, the petitioning for --",
  "Is there a difference and under what analytical framework would we reach it?",
  "If a terrorist was arrested in the United States from one of these groups, would they be barred under the statute from serving as their attorney in a U.S. court?",
  "Isn't that material support under the definition that you have been advocating?",
  "No, but I'm asking you why.",
  "And so can I -- can I ask you something? I mean, part of the First Amendment is the right for the -- to petition the government for redress of grievances. Putting aside all of the other aid they are claiming, the tsunami aid, the training and other things, can the statute constitutionally be read to bar them from petitioning legitimate agencies, legitimate government agencies, to peacefully, using the words of the Constitution, to effect legal change?",
  "And that -- that's part of what they’re claiming their speech involves --",
  "-- training and doing that.",
  "But that doesn't --",
  "-- answer -- what is the right of the people peaceably to assemble? Now, mind you, I understand this is the right of U.S. citizens in the United States. But what in the First Amendment or even in this statute could justify Congress from barring individuals to petition peacefully United -- world agencies or even U.S. agencies --",
  "-- for the recognition of a -- of a legitimate goal?",
  "How about training to --",
  "General, I understand, I could be wrong, that many petitioners or respondents go out to the industry and say we need some amicus briefs, and they flood in from all sides. Would that be illegal? Because the -- the organization --",
  "-- came out and said we need a brief -- amicus briefs from law professors? From --",
  "Without pay.",
  "How can we can ever separate --",
  "Under the definition of this statute, teaching these members to play the harmonica would be unlawful. You are teaching -- training them in a lawful -- in a specialized activity. So how do we -- there has to be something more than merely a congressional finding that any training is bad.",
  "If O'Brien applies, what remains of your case?",
  "That analysis of the activities that you are proposing has not been done by the lower courts, correct?",
  "They -- they haven't -- they struck it on vagueness grounds, but none --",
  "-- none of the courts either subjected this to strict scrutiny or the reasonable fit --",
  "Mr. Cole, there were congressional findings that money is fungible first for terrorist groups, like -- that if you give them money for legitimate means, that it's going to be siphoned off and used for illegitimate means.",
  "So, why isn't that enough, either under strict scrutiny or a lesser standard, reasonable fit standard, to say that you can't teach these groups how to get money?",
  "No, one of your -- one of your stated aims, at least of one of the groups is to teach them how to get aid for tsunami relief.",
  "No, but you’re forgetting the words of this subsection. I mean --",
  "-- the subsection would be (B) itself. If you're convicted of carrying a machinegun, you get -- I'm sorry -- a short-barrel rifle, et cetera, you get 10 years. If it's a machinegun, you get 30. What's -- what's irrational about reading the statute that way when it uses the word \"subsection\"? It didn't use \"subparagraph.\"",
  "But it didn't. It kept in (A) the subdivisions of use and brandishing, which we all agree are elements of the crime. So I don't know what it means to say that it moved it away from the elements. It mixed up in (A) elements and sentencing factors, and so what we have to discern was, did it intend to make (B) sentencing factors or not? And I think what Justice Breyer was asking you: What in the legislative history shows that? Where do we read, outside of Castillo, a conclusion that somehow Congress radically changed the assumptions we identified in Castillo, which is historically it's not a sentencing element?",
  "Is there a Sixth Amendment problem with reading a statute this way, with -- with reading a statute to provide for an unlimited maximum when Congress hasn't specified it, and now you’re going to have the judge find the minimum and the maximum?",
  "But isn't there a Sixth Amendment problem with not knowing what you are exposed to? And then doesn't the minimum in that case sort of become de facto the maximum?",
  "Isn't a minimum always a maximum?",
  "In -- to the person who would otherwise, in the judge's discretion, qualify for a lower sentence, doesn't it become that person's maximum once you have indiscretion?",
  "What you can rely on in an indeterminate sentencing regime without a minimum is that you’ve got a statutory maximum, whatever it may be, but a judge's discretion to start from zero. If that judge was inclined to give you zero, isn't the minimum then your statutory maximum? You're -- because that's what the judge has to give you.",
  "How do we find it with this statute, if there’s a 10-year minimum/maximum under (A) subdivision (iii) if the firearm is discharged, and it's 10 years; and if it's a short-barreled rifle under (B), it's also an equal amount, of 10 years? I think that's what Justice Ginsburg was pointing to. So the question I have for you is: How do we find substantive unreasonableness?",
  "Unreasonableness, that there was an act of manipulation here, or intent to manipulate.",
  "Exactly.",
  "That begs the question. They were concerned with people who had disappeared, but why is it logical for them to be worried about people who disappear prospectively as opposed to the people who have already disappeared and have failed to -- that's basically the -- the government's argument, which is: One of the main purposes of the statute is to capture those people who have disappeared. And so why limit it?",
  "The problem is that the people who had traveled previously and failed to register would no longer be subject to any -- either any registration process or presumably any punishment either, because they were no longer in the State in which the conviction occurred, so any change in that statute wouldn't affect them.",
  "I -- I think that I remain a little bit confused by the question one of my colleagues answered, and I'm not sure if this last answer by you is helping me understand it, which is if SORNA now -- if every State is supposed to pass legislation which requires sex offenders who have been convicted elsewhere and moved to their State to register, why do you -- I think that's what you -- that you answered affirmatively for Justice Kennedy, correct? SORNA requires every State to pass laws that obligate people who have been convicted in other States to register, correct?",
  "All right. So why do you need SORNA? Why can't those States that the individual has moved to simply prosecute the person for a failure to register? Why do you need SORNA?",
  "-- understand some of the delay Congress may have in passing a law with specifics about how things are done. Are you worried at all under Lambert whether or not there might be a due process violation in all the indeterminate provisions of this law? Where do you -- yes, you’re supposed to register, but States don't have a place for you to register, and now you are supposed to know that you are supposed to register under the old systems, and you don't know how much time to do it in.",
  "Absolutely --",
  "-- but they don't have a SORNA place to register.",
  "What do we take from trial counsel at the end of the voir dire process announcing that if he had had extra preemptory challenges, he would have used them only against 6 of the 12 people that were finally selected? If that's all he would have ejected, why couldn't a fair jury have been found?",
  "That's a different -- that's a different question.",
  "You are taking a broader proposition and saying that the presumption could not under any set of circumstances be overcome, and that's what I'm trying to probe.",
  "I'm sorry. There was only one juror that had been challenged for cause against -- for which a preemptory challenge wasn't used. I thought that every other for-cause challenge ended up being excused on the basis of a preemptory challenge.",
  "But that means that there were six that were okay.",
  "Tell me what in the process itself, outside of your general proposition that no process could find fair jurors? What else in the process was deficient?",
  "See, the problem with --",
  "No. Finish Justice Breyer -- you might feel, which is that that language may not be self-evident as to the circumstances in which a deeper inquiry is --",
  "Can I look at --",
  "Is there any place in the record I could look to see questions that you would have posed absent the judge's limitations?",
  "I'm sorry. Repeat that.",
  "Can you tell me of any other high-profile case comparable to this in which the voir dire lasted only 5 hours?",
  "Are you aware of any that's been reported where the selection was 5 hours only?",
  "How -- but is it occasional or accidental? I think that’s what Justice Breyer is getting at. With such a truncated voir dire and one in which the judge basically said to the lawyers, I'm not giving you much leeway at all, how can we be satisfied that there was a fair and impartial jury picked when the judge doesn't follow up on a witness who says, I'm a victim of this fraud? I don't know -- I would find it strange that we would permit jurors who are victims of the crime to serve as jurors.",
  "Well, but -- but the judge didn't strike her for cause. So isn't that symptomatic of not following through adequately?",
  "Could I -- the following hypothetical: I'm a councilperson in a jurisdiction that’s considering a tax increase or a tax break, and I vote for the tax break, and I happen to have property that qualifies. Is that a breach of the statute?",
  "Please tell me what I look to, to discern -- if I'm a councilperson, to discern what needs to be disclosed or not disclosed?",
  "So could --",
  "Could you tell me without more detail, which is what the circuit court said, about what the limited responses -- I'm using your word -- were. How do we -- how can we imply waiver?",
  "Meaning if all he said was, yes, I want them in, that's much different than saying, if someone had asked him, do you want to leave, and he shakes his head no. The latter might imply to me that he waived, but the former certainly would be neutral.",
  "So what do we do with our case law that says that you can't infer waiver simply from the confession?",
  "I mean, we have said that. So that’s pretty clearly established statement --",
  "-- by the Court.",
  "Well, I think certainly in -- in Butler, if someone in their confession says, I know I don't have to talk to you, but I want to, that that would be using those words.",
  "So how can you say --",
  "How can you say that an appeal to someone's religious position after 2 and a quarter hours is a voluntary waiver?",
  "You want to change the Miranda rule to say: Tell someone their rights, and unless they explicitly say \"I don't want to talk to you,\" then they implicitly under virtually any circumstance haven't. That's what you believe the rule in Miranda and Butler and Davis sets forth?",
  "There wasn't -- there wasn’t silence in Butler. There was an express \"I want to talk to you.\"",
  "My -- but we go back to the point you made earlier. Your position is the moment that someone confesses, that's an implicit waiver.",
  "Excuse me. As I read this transcript, the police's tactic, by their own statement, was to approach him and say: This is our evidence. Explain yourself -- that's the words the officer used -- but he's entitled to an alternative explanation. Tell us. What's clear is that at no point did he answer those questions, because nothing about the nods of the head or anything else showed a willingness to confess. And even in the responses he gave, he answered a series of questions with a “yes,” but not with an explanation, which was what was being requested. So my question is, how does one infer a voluntary statement from a situation in which someone's really not talking? I've never understood how a yes or a nod to questions that don't -- that's what the circuit said, to questions that we don't know what they were about -- do you want a mint or not, I don't even know that -- can reflect voluntariness? And I understand that in Butler when someone says I don't want to sign that, but I'm going to spill my guts now, and does, that's a course of conduct one could view as voluntary.",
  "Could you tell me when the police have to stop? They read somebody their rights; the person says nothing. Are you saying at that point they have to stop?",
  "How do -- what in the record shows us that the failure to tell him that by the lawyer was anything other than negligence? What in the record suggests that the lawyer, just as many lawyers do, forgot to call the client, forgot to send him something? What shows that this is more than negligence?",
  "Well, I'm trying to find the basis for that finding.",
  "But -- but --",
  "That's what his intent was.",
  "People say I'm going to do something, and they fail to do it often because something else comes up, because something has happened. That doesn't show intentionality in -- the failure to act doesn't necessarily prove that it was intentional.",
  "Are you -- are you suggesting that there should be a different standard for those habeas petitioners who are -- whose counsel is appointed for them by the State or by the Federal government, as opposed to just a lawyer they hire? That's what I'm hearing you say.",
  "All right. So if the standard is going to be the same -- I -- I go back to Justice Alito's question, which is, the Eleventh Circuit is saying negligence/gross negligence, the line is too fine to draw. But there is a difference in a line between negligence, however one defines it, and an intentional, bad faith, dishonest, conflicted malfeasance.",
  "All right. Why isn't that a more workable line, given that you can't have equitable tolling without exceptional circumstances?",
  "You haven't argued why not, is what I'm saying to you. If exceptional circumstances has to mean something that really makes something exceptional, why is negligence of any variant exceptional?",
  "I don't -- you say -- you say “complete abandonment.” But this lawyer filed a whole lot of things on behalf of this client. He missed a very critical thing, the Federal habeas filing. But it's not abandonment of a client in the sense of not doing anything for the client. So it goes back to my beginning question, which is, where is the line drawn between the types of negligence and what the circuit suggested, which is some sort of intentional malfeasance?",
  "Can we go back to just --",
  "I -- what I worry about is that you’re confusing the -- or perceive -- confusing the fact that lawyer negligence may not be the type of situation that Congress was looking at. With the hypotheticals that Justice Breyer listed, which are a different kind of situation, and you are trying to pigeonhole both and say Congress didn't intend for both to be covered. And yet you suggested a little later that they may have intended what Justice Breyer was thinking about. I -- I don't see anything in the structure of the statute that would preclude what Justice Breyer listed.",
  "So what can we read to suggest that -- forget about the lawyer malfeasance; let's talk just about equitable tolling",
  "-- in its traditional sense. Most of the cases in equitable tolling, by the way, have to do with court errors.",
  "Do you have any idea, before the Eleventh Circuit announced its standard, how many habeas petitions were tolled by district courts in that -- in your -- in Florida, on the basis of equitable tolling, that -- that they permitted petitions to go forward after the statute of limitations?",
  "What injustice has -- has been caused by it that we have to remedy? Meaning States have relied on having no grand juries; States have relied on not having civil trials in certain money cases; they have relied on regulating the use of firearms based on us, the Court, not incorporating the Privileges and Immunities Clause in the way that you identify it.",
  "What -- in which ways has ordered liberty been badly affected?",
  "Mr. Feldman, our selective incorporation doctrine under the Due Process Clause does suggest that there are some rights that were fundamental enough to be incorporated and some that are fundamental, but not fundamental enough to be incorporated. We’ve drawn a line. Is it the ordered liberty concept alone in our jurisprudence that you are relying upon, or is it any other articulation of our incorporation doctrine that supports your view?",
  "The Chief says: Yes, if we look at it, we have to look at it in the context of our history, our structure. So address his question as to why --",
  "-- in our structure or our history, it's not fundamental enough --",
  "-- to incorporate.",
  "Would you be happy if we incorporated it and said reasonable regulation is part of the incorporation? And how do we do that?",
  "Counsel, our job is to determine Congress's intent when it passed 233(a). What we do know is that there was no Bivens immunity at the time; the FTCA had only a limited application under certain driver-related accidents. So we really don't have anything to tell us, because they didn't even know that there was a constitutional claim that could be raised, what they would have intended or not intended. And I thought that Justice Ginsburg's point would be that the Westfall Act tells us what they intended, because by its nature it applied to all employees and didn't differentiate among them, and copied 233's immunity, so that one can look at it and say, ah, that speaks of Congress's intent.",
  "Is there any other Act besides 233(a) that is similar --",
  "-- that gives separate immunity? Which are those?",
  "Can you tell me how many PHS personnel work in settings outside custodial settings?",
  "Custodial settings.",
  "I'm sorry. For the Indian --",
  "And is there a reason Congress would want to immunize PHS personnel against Bivens claims in a custodial setting, but not immunize Bureau of Prison personnel?",
  "But not every doctor -- if they come under the FTCA, they -- their -- constitutional claims are not immunized against them --",
  "-- unless they are PHS personnel.",
  "Right.",
  "So how is the inquiry any different than the one that would go under the common law head of state inquiry? What would be different in the two?",
  "So your --",
  "Wait a minute. Why -- why -- that doesn't make any sense to me. Why would we have had the creation of all of these common law immunities attached to foreign individuals like consular and diplomatic and heads of state if state sovereign immunity was going to cover them naturally?",
  "I'm trying to go before the Act, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, before it was passed, because that was Congress's first statement, and we have to figure out what they intended to replace or not replace. Before the Act came in, what activities of a consular office would not have been covered under the foreign sovereign immunity of a state? What activity could a diplomat have engaged in or a consular officer have engaged in that state immunity, as it was understood at the time, would not have given him or her?",
  "Is there any case by us in which we -- prior to the FSIA, where we recognize that an individual was immunized in the way that the state was, if he was acting as an agent of the state? Or were all of our cases having to do with other common law doctrines?",
  "Could you --",
  "Mr. Kneedler --",
  "Could you -- I'm --",
  "I’m sure one of my colleagues --",
  "-- will get you back. Could you address the practical implications of your position? And by that I mean, it took 2 years for the State -- for the government to respond to the district court in this case. Tell us why your reading of the statute would not grind the courts to a halt. What happens when Justice Breyer's situation arises? Someone takes a complaint against the state and just substitutes the names of the persons. What -- why wouldn't the courts come to a grinding halt?",
  "Could we go back to the practical --",
  "Wouldn't that be the same question that you would ask invoking a common law protection like head of state or act of state? Isn't it -- whether it's under the FSIA or under a common law theory -- the identical question?",
  "Isn't that the very point? If the inquiry is the same under the FSIA and under the common law, and we’re unsure what Congress intended in the FSIA, because it certainly doesn't explicitly say it covers individual acts, shouldn't we defer to the Executive's decisionmaking in what is -- has been, for centuries now, within its jurisdiction? Why should we take that power away when the inquiry would be the same under either doctrine?",
  "What do you -- what do you do with the contention that the court is bounded by other requirements such as the timing of the meeting of creditors and the plan confirmation, that that binds the district court from resetting it?",
  "Counsel, why -- what commends going through all these machinations, all of these alternative ways of avoiding absurd results? Isn't the answer simply that we just narrow the circumstances in which a court can deviate from the statutory formula? I mean, it's not -- even before this change, it wasn't that the district courts could at whim change the projected income. They have to have a clear ground to do so. Why is that inadequate to protect the interests that Congress had in creating this new formula for income and expenses?",
  "There was a formula before. It was somewhat ambiguous, and that's what led to the more defined terms for income and expense. But that says nothing about changing the court's power to act in a situation where the formula's clearly not going to work. That was the standard before.",
  "How do you file an amended plan and have the court restart the clock, when 101(10A) says only if the debtor has not filed a schedule of current income? If there's been a plan confirmed or a plan proposed, then the income schedule had to have been filed.",
  "You don't do one without the other.",
  "Forget about 1329. I'm going to the situation where the plan has been proposed, let's say. The courts -- if a schedule of income has been filed, then it's without any jurisdiction to change the 6-month lookback period, correct?",
  "Well, it can't under",
  "His words were \"known to a virtual certainty,\" which are -- likely to happen is different than likely to happen.",
  "-- State law is unclear here that would require Federal interpretation?",
  "So why can't the Pullman doctrine or the Burford doctrine, abstention doctrines, be enough to counsel Federal abstention in this case? Why do we have to create another exception to Hibbs and not go to another established abstention doctrine?",
  "So why did you -- did you argue Pullman in the court below?",
  "No, no, no, no. Did you cite Pullman and did you argue it on a Pullman abstention basis?",
  "Let's assume that States have a law that said, we are going to do different tax schemes for African Americans than from whites. And they do exactly what is done here. They are going to tax on one thing but not on another. They are going to give an exemption in one area, but not another. Is that a case that would have to be -- an equal protection challenge that would have to be decided in State court?",
  "I don't know if that is an answer to my question or not. I -- I -- the only thing I changed in the hypothetical was that the challenge was an equal protection challenge race -­ based on a suspect classification. But the credit system is no different. Would or would not that require -­",
  "So you are claiming that the Federal court could only power -- only power would be to declare it unconstitutional and send it back the State legislature to decide what to do? Or you are claiming the Federal court has a power the State court doesn't have, which is to order the exemption to be rescinded? I'm not sure what your point is.",
  "And you don't think that the very question of what taxes you compare and don't compare is a matter of interpreting State law? You don't think that the meaning of State law in terms of what is comparable or not, is not implicated by any of these questions?",
  "When you say that there is no impeding of State court process or taxes, because neither a Federal or State court could order the reduction of the exemption -­",
  "That is -- even though the practical consequence is that that is a remedy that the State could choose, or must consider.",
  "That wasn't an issue, however, in Hibbs.",
  "Could you answer your adversary's point that neither the Federal nor the State courts would have the power to -- to order the reverse, to order the exemption to be eliminated vis-à-vis -- or to order them to have the exception? They are claiming that's a -- even in State court, that would not be a remedy that could be ordered.",
  "Can you -- can you give me the cite for that case?",
  "But isn't that tied to a quorum for the board as a whole to act? Once it's delegated a responsibility to a three-member board, it's already said, unless it takes another vote, that it's going to let those three people decide. It has -- I understand the word \"delegated\" to mean it's given over its power to a subgroup. If it wants to take it back, it needs a quorum to do that. That's what I understand.",
  "But the problem is that that exists whether we read your rule or not in the way you want. You have -- you've conceded that a three-member board could lose a member, a three-member group could lose a member and its acts still be binding, as long as you say there is -- there is three members on the full board. But this lack of opportunity for dissent exists any time there is a vacancy. You just don't like the system.",
  "I'm sorry. You are now saying that the group always has to be three members?",
  "That somebody can't die, leave, recuse themselves from that group without invalidating the actions of that subgroup. Where in the statute do you read that limitation when it says a quorum of two is okay to act?",
  "No, I am talking about the group.",
  "So the group is not defined as three or more people. It's defined as three. The board is defined as three or more. The group is defined as three. So I'm -- I'm a little confused.",
  "I see.",
  "Are you taking -- are you taking a position different than the U.S., that it applies to exports but not imports? I think the -- the Solicitor General's position is that it doesn't apply to any import or export. Is it yours that it doesn't apply to imports?",
  "Could you tell me something? Is there -- do you know if there’s a railroad line from the U.S. through to -- through Mexico? I know there is one from New York to Canada, a freight line.",
  "There are?",
  "So your -- I'm sorry. I'm a little confused. Your position is that \"K\" Line -- you’re representing whom here?",
  "You have a bit of a --",
  "-- conflict, don't you? Because isn't \"K\" Line taking the position it's not a rail line? And who are you speaking for when you say it's --",
  "If it's considered what? If it's considered --",
  "Where is that defined in Carmack? Where in the pre-1978 provisions or in the current statute is that to be read?",
  "I -- I’m trying to find it, statutorily.",
  "And what case says that?",
  "What case of ours defines a -- a receiving carrier in that particular way?",
  "The only one who’s in --",
  "The only one who has -- the board has jurisdiction over is the railroad. It doesn't have jurisdiction over the ocean carrier receiving.",
  "And so you are the -- you have to be the person -- the railroad has to be the person receiving the goods, correct?",
  "But you’re not reading the language. Doesn't the language say the person who receives under the jurisdiction of the board?",
  "I -- I keep going back to: What language tells me that particular point in the statute?",
  "That's my problem.",
  "I -- I always thought that the purpose of Carmack was to ensure rail responsibility, rail carrier responsibility, so that it was one bill of lading with respect to all railroad connections. If that was the purpose of Carmack --",
  "Okay.",
  "But on the rail line.",
  "On rail -- on the rail transportation.",
  "Historically you say that?",
  "In the pre-1978 Carmack, there is a -- if you want to take a look at it.",
  "It is in page 99a of your petition. It reads: \"If the loss, damage, or injury occurs while the property is in the custody of a carrier by water, that liability\" -- \"the liability of such carrier shall be determined by the bill of lading of the carrier by water and by and under the laws applicable to transportation by water.\"",
  "So --",
  "So explain to me what happens in domestic water cases. It says that you can have a different bill of lading for the water transport. That bill of lading controls your damage on the water, and it separates that out from damage on the rail side?",
  "And the railroad is covered by any damage that occurs on land?",
  "So there already is domestically two different forms of liability protection?",
  "Excuse me. Can I go back to Justice Breyer's question?",
  "And perhaps -- as I understand this, I think we are all forgetting that none of these liability provisions come into play until there is proof that an incident has occurred somewhere, either on a railroad or on the ocean, correct?",
  "And so the issue becomes which set of rules governs that particular incident --",
  "-- where it happened.",
  "I think Justice Breyer asked you why it made sense that there would be two rules in effect for what happens on the ocean and what happens on land; and if we had it, wouldn't it create great difficulty? I think -- you may correct me.",
  "Is your case -- does your case end if we hold that \"K\" Line is not a railroad carrier?",
  "All right.",
  "As a delivering carrier.",
  "Could I just -- just briefly before you answer the Judge --",
  "The Justice -- the Chief. In what capacity -- \"K\" Line is the contracting party with Union Pacific. Under what contract could the shipper sue Union Pacific?",
  "If \"K\" Line is -- is the shipper --",
  "Regardless of whether the shipment was by them directly or not?",
  "I -- I am a little bit confused now. Now, back to being confused. You’re suggesting that from the landing -- it's an ocean carrier -- and the minute that the containers are unloaded from the vessel and put on land, it becomes a railroad carrier, even though its delivery contract may have ended at that point?",
  "No. Right. So what about --",
  "So what about -- what is it that you're arguing makes them a railroad carrier once they put it there. Let's assume the reverse of the hypothetical that you -- that you posited. They deliver to the dock, and Union Pacific is the one that owns those 3 to 6 miles of connection to its main railroad. It's the one who’s going to provide the motor carriage. It's the one who’s going to take it from the -- the dock and bring it in.",
  "So it's not merely that it has possession of the container that it has dropped somewhere. It has to transport it in some way in relationship to the railroad?",
  "When you say \"engaging in,\" are you talking about vis-à-vis this shipment?",
  "Or is it just in general? Vis-à-vis you?",
  "I'm sorry. Wouldn't collateral estoppel block the relitigation of all sentencing -- resentencing issues that were decided that were identical?",
  "Can we go back to Justice -- to the Chief Justice's example to you at the very beginning of your argument?",
  "To the Chief Justice's argument.",
  "There is an order to resentence, to reduce a sentence from 10 to 8 years. The prior sentence was vacated. There is a new proceeding, a new Booker type 35538 proceeding where the judge is thinking about everything, and he says I am going to reduce it from 10 to 8 years. I am leaving everything else the same, because there was no arguments about it; there is no anything about it. Does your rule then mean that that petitioner can come back and say, my fine was wrong, my supervised release was wrong, other convictions, other sentences that were consecutive or concurrent are wrong?",
  "Excuse me. The content of the first note was a query of the court. And that query was: \"What happens if we can't reach a verdict?\" Isn't that substantially different? Doesn't that suggest that the jury is trying to figure out what are the consequences of its actions and whether reaching a consensus is possible?",
  "Excuse me. How long before that last note was that?",
  "Did anybody hear the voices?",
  "Could you tell me what facts found by the lower courts or the trial courts show that the Court acted, quote, and this is from our earlier Perez case, the very first in this area, \"deliberately, responsibly, and not precipitously\" in declaring a mistrial. What in the facts you have recited -­",
  "-- show that activity?",
  "What is the factual finding that you think we have to give deference to? I know the facts you've recited. There don't appear to be any of the facts with respect to what occurred during the activity. So what factual finding do we have to give deference to?",
  "But I'm not sure how that finding supports the finding, or a finding, that the Court was acting deliberately, responsibly, and not precipitously.",
  "Have you found any case where a judge has declared a mistrial without conferring with counsel, where the declaration was upheld?",
  "Well you can't read from that one, because in that one it was -- the mistrial was held, not because of a jury deadlock, but because of improper prejudicial actions during the trial.",
  "Those are different questions.",
  "Could you -- yes, but that doesn't mean none. What -- other than we have cases where judges have declared mistrials because they are going on vacation. Those are easy, okay? But somewhere the word \"abuse of discretion\" means that someone has discretion, but is improperly exercising it. What facts would it take for you to believe that that would have been the case? What do you have to take out of this case to say, ah, that was -­ that would have been an abuse of discretion? What point? If he got the note and declared a mistrial, that would be enough, right? Or would it?",
  "Why isn't that this one, meaning the jury doesn't say, we are deadlocked, hopelessly deadlocked, we cannot reach a verdict. It asks: What happens if we don't? And the foreperson hasn't conferred with the jury to determine whether or not as a group they believe they are hopelessly deadlocked. Why isn't this precipitous action?",
  "You can't say, can you, that every time the jury records that it can't reach a verdict or it hasn't reached a unanimous verdict, that that's a legal deadlock requiring a mistrial, can you?",
  "So obviously the word \"deadlock,\" and as I read the judge's questions, he defined it merely as a disagreement as to the verdict. And later he uses \"hopelessly deadlocked,\" but changes the question when he asks the foreperson to respond. Isn't there a difference between hopelessly, i.e., no further deliberations is likely to reach a verdict, as opposed to you can't ever reach a verdict?",
  "Counsel, there is no case in our jurisprudence with identical or nearly identical facts, so this is not under the \"contrary to\" prong of 24 -- of 2254(d)(1). So it has to be under the \"unreasonable application.\" Particularly for me, what Supreme Court precedent do you think was unreasonably applied, and explain how and why?",
  "Are you suggesting that you need a precedent overruling a lower court decision before we could declare that something was unreasonable -- that our precedent was unreasonably applied?",
  "But that could also be consistent with the fact that Perez was clear enough that judges have to act slowly and --and with thought, and that lower courts are catching those when they are not. I mean, I don't know how it cuts, is what I'm saying.",
  "Counsel, I'm -- perhaps I can, if you will permit me, rephrase Justice Alito's question in sort of the more simplistic way I looked at it. Why is it that we have to do the calculation that you're talking about, which is start at 311 days and take back days, which makes no sense to me, or their very complicated ten-page number? Why can't they just take 54 days at the end of every year that there is actual service, and that the time served, plus whatever number of days have been earned, you subtract it from the term of imprisonment? So if he was imprisoned for 10 years, he got 540 days for whatever it is. At the end of the 9th year, he made up whatever -- you added up 9 times 54, and you took it away from 10. He serves 9 and that. That would make sense of \"beyond the time served\" language that's in this provision.",
  "Well, do you do it if you take (a), and (a) says: A prisoner shall be released by the Bureau of Prisons on the date of the expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment -- 10 years, we are assuming, an imprisonment -- less any time credited towards the service of the prisoner's sentence, as provided in subsection (b).",
  "So each year that he served, you add up the number of days he has served, the good time credit, and you subtract them from the 120 months that you have given him, and you figure out when he's going to get out. You work backwards, not forward, the way everyone seems to be doing.",
  "But that's the way the language is written. So I mean you may want the greater opportunity, but it says by its explicit phrase: Terms: At the date of the prisoner's -- expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment, take that day and subtract from it time credited towards the service of the prisoner's sentence.",
  "And then what do -­",
  "So the next year -­",
  "-- you start it at 311?",
  "And he now serves another year and you back him up again at the end of that year? To 300 -­",
  "And you -- and you think that their system is easier?",
  "That their system is -­",
  "There is a premise flaw there. And that premise flaw is that you have told us that you don't earn the credit until the end of the year.",
  "So your answer about this probation is not an answer, because it's -- your premise is not the same.",
  "I'm not worried about sentences that are more than 2 years. I'm worried about the prisoner who is sentenced to a year and a day. How does that proration help that individual, since they are not going to get the good time credit until they've served a year?",
  "Counsel, I -­",
  "That's what I'm saying to you. The whole brief says to us, they measure the entitlement to good time credit at the end of the first year.",
  "He is not going to get 54 days? He's going to get -­",
  "I just want to make absolutely sure because I hadn't done the math forward; I did the math backwards.",
  "Which was the one that Justice Breyer and Justice Alito set forth -­",
  "Which is 54 days are earned back for each year, and you take it off the full term of imprisonment. The -- you are representing to me that the math that is in your program statement is accomplishing that result?",
  "Counsel, this explanation that has been given in your brief and the one you are giving to us now as to why BOP chose what it did, is there any statement outside of the penned affidavit that explains why this choice was made?",
  "But in each one of them they have taken the position that the statute was unambiguous. Assuming that that is not accepted by us, that it's ambiguous, what and where are we giving Chevron or Skidmore deference to what set of facts or to what -­",
  "Well, did they exercise discretion when they took the position that it was unambiguous?",
  "We have never given deference, have we, to an affidavit submitted in litigation to explain something that on its face is not explained either in an agency's regulation or in its policy statement that -- that -- this is giving deference to an affidavit.",
  "Just so -- in your system they do the measurement at the end of the 365 days. He misbehaves on the 340th day. And they say for that reason, I'm only going to give you 10 days of full time -- of good time credit.",
  "So now your year starts at 350?",
  "No, they said they are only giving you 10 days of good time credit. Because at the end of -- 355.",
  "That was pretty bad.",
  "355. Now, your year starts again on 355 days -­",
  "What is the constitutional difference that would inure a Sixth Amendment right in the resentencing by the court that doesn't when it's a resentencing or a modification of a sentence by the Bureau of Prisons?",
  "But is this truly a new sentence, meaning a person serving a sentence? This is an act of clemency. Whether the Bureau of Prisons does it or the court does it, why should we introduce a different binding or non-binding constitutional limit on one body rather than the other?",
  "But that means it --",
  "Under your theory, there’s no bar to an upward sentence by the -- by the judge, because if it's a brand new hearing subject to Booker, which mandates complete discretion under 3553, the judges define the sentence that fits the crime and the defendant. So you don't mind an upward --",
  "I know you want --",
  "You only want part of -- the statute, not the whole statute?",
  "If you want the whole statute, then it's a new sentence. You can't beg and say the statute limits up and down, but I only want the",
  "-- and I want a new sentence. It doesn't make sense.",
  "Well, that gets tied up, doesn't it, to your argument that this is not a part of the criminal prosecution, that this is a -- not a Sixth Amendment proceeding, but -- not a Sixth Amendment proceeding, so it doesn't require constitutional protection?",
  "Excuse me. We have plenty of plea agreements jurisprudence that say if the Southern District of New York prosecutes someone and they sign a plea agreement and say, we're not going to prosecute you for further crimes, we read that to mean that the Southern District of New York won't prosecute you for further crimes. We don't read it that no other government agency is bound, who has jurisdiction over that criminal activity, that they are equally bound. So why isn't this case the same? Assuming -- that you're making a broad statement, that this has to be brought in the name of the government. Assuming that's correct, does that mean that -- why does that mean that both the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Attorney General's Office, which appear to be two different entities enforcing two different sets of law, why would both be bound?",
  "Or just to say the lower court was wrong -­",
  "-- on that premise.",
  "We have another option, once we say they were wrong on that premise, to send it back and let them look at the second question, which is whether or not a private party can bring an action in the name of the sovereign.",
  "I -- I'm not sure I understand your point. Yes, the caption doesn't have to be styled in a particular name -­",
  "But the prosecuting person -­",
  "-- the person whose name is listed is acting for someone.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Can you define what you see as that issue? What's the issue that you think -­",
  "I'm sorry, repeat it for me. I sort of -­",
  "On whose behalf? That's the issue that I'm trying to -­",
  "Okay. Are you saying that it's out of the case that if we say it's on behalf of the United States, they are not challenging that they can do that?",
  "That's so -- so if we say they can act on behalf of the United States, you -­",
  "So your client has to provide the -- her husband a lawyer? Who has to provide a lawyer in this criminal contempt proceeding?",
  "I don't know if you have answered the Chief's question. He has asked to have a lawyer; is there a Brady obligation? What are the constitutional entitlements -­",
  "I'm not sure why -- how we can avoid it.",
  "Well, this case properly presents the argument that a private party can't bring a criminal prosecution on their -- in their own -- perhaps their own name, they can, but on their own, in their own interest. It always has to be a government interest. That's what the argument is.",
  "You are saying the answer to that is, no, they can bring a claim in their own name?",
  "No, no. But the last question is the one that they are disputing; it can't be in their own interest.",
  "And you are saying it can.",
  "Answer why.",
  "But a specific country -- this is the point Justice Scalia was making -- the rest of the country, it's a state system.",
  "And -- and there -­",
  "Well, but that's -­ that's the question. That's the question that I don't know that we have enough information in the record about. Is this really -- is this prosecution like a state? That's the Solicitor General's position, which is, it's on behalf of the local government, not on the behalf of the Federal government as a sovereign. I think that's what this case speaks to.",
  "Whose state power was she acting on behalf of?",
  "What elements would a State conviction have to contain to qualify as a finding of recidivism in your view?",
  "Yes. What would have had to have been determined in a State conviction for you to recognize, under your argument, that it would qualify as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act?",
  "Do you know of any State law that is analogous to the Federal law, precisely analogous?",
  "That's what I'm trying to -- to get to. What are the elements of that finding? What exactly -- because different labels are attached to different crimes that qualify you for recidivism under some State statutes, et cetera. I'm trying to get you to articulate what finding of recidivism counts, what are the underlying --",
  "Which court now, the State court?",
  "So are you arguing that a State court has to make a finding of a valid prior conviction; is that it?",
  "Could I --",
  "But it has --",

  "So something's not a Federal felony and it's now subject -- because he hasn't been convicted in Federal court of recidivism -- now he's being punished under the INA or removed under the INA for what is not a felony under Federal law?",
  "Could I just ask you one --",
  "Under the Federal --",
  "Under the Federal statute, it's only punishable on -- for recidivism purposes if the prior conviction was valid, because, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the statute permits a defendant to object. Who has the burden of proof of proving validity is irrelevant. was valid, constitutionally valid. So why isn't that same standard or proof thereof required either in the State conviction under your -- under any theory, or by the IJ? The IJ fails to make that finding, how has he and on what basis has he ruled that there was a valid prior conviction?",
  "But only under a process that requires notice --",
  "-- And --",
  "Counsel, you would suggest, then, that even if a prior State court conviction was secured without the advice of counsel, that would qualify as a Federal offense of recidivism. So let's assume this case, that in neither the conviction for the one marijuana stick or the conviction for the one sleeping pill, that if those convictions were secured without the advice of counsel, that would be enough to qualify him as a recidivist under the Federal law.",

  "And one of the chiefs, out of salacious interest, decides: I'm going to just go in and get those texts, those messages, because I just have a prurient interest. Does that officer have any expectation of privacy that his boss won't just listen in out of prurient interest?",
  "But if in fact -- and whether we agree with this conclusion or not, we accept the lower court's views that there was an expectation that the chiefs were not going to read these things, some expectation of privacy --",

  "So is this an exception that you want to talk about as it is applied to religious groups, or are you suggesting that if a group wanted to exclude all black people, all women, all handicapped persons, whatever other form of discrimination a group wants to practice, that a school has to accept that group and recognize it, give it funds, and otherwise lend it space?",
  "So then, what is -- what is wrong with the purpose of a school to say we don't wish any group that doesn't -- that discriminates?",
  "But this sounds like a debate over whether the policy as the school believes it should be implemented is not a good one. But isn't that their choice? Don't we give deference to an educational institution in terms of the choices it makes about effecting its own -- its purposes? And the purpose here is we don't want our students to discriminate.",

  "You keep talking about being forced to let people in. And this is where I'm a little bit confused by your yellow brief. The school has taken the position that any group can apply to use its facilities; priority and funding, et cetera, will only go to recognized student groups. But your group is not being excluded or ostracized completely from the school. Presumably, you can meet in the cafeteria. You can meet in open spaces in the school. You can apply like everyone else, any other nonstudent group, recognized student group. But you have been saying repeatedly in your presentation that you're barred from the campus.

  "What do we do with the selective application argument, which is what Justice Alito referred to and Justice Scalia, which is it is troubling that some of these bylaws do limit their groups? La Raza limited it to people of Hispanic descent, and the Lawyers Guild to people who adopt its -- its beliefs. What are we going to do with this selective application argument?",
  "It's in the case, isn't it? And if it is, what does it do to your policy?",
  "Excuse me. Is your argument that if the district court -- for whatever reason, unlikely as it may be -- starts a hearing the day after the rest of the sentence was imposed and has to continue that hearing for 91 days before it can render a judgment --",
  "-- that it's now barred from entering that judgment?",
  "I -- I'm not sure I understood your response to my question. It must impose that restitution order, complete all its proceedings within the 90-day period?",
  "So it can't hold a hearing over from the 90th day to the 91st day?",
  "Is there any circuit court who has addressed this issue of when an appeal is timely, in a situation in which a restitution order has not been entered at the initial sentencing?",
  "Under your view of things, however, that's fortuity that the underlying conviction was still in the appeal process, because there is no statute of limitations under your reading. A victim could come 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 100 years later and say: I'm entitled to restitution.",
  "And absent prejudice to the defendant, that would be okay?",
  "I'm sorry, that's 60 days after the restitution order has been issued. Am I --",
  "That 60 days says after there has been an -- a restitution order. I'm positing the situation where the victim comes 10 years later.",
  "That says there’s no restitution order. It's the initial action. And you’re saying that's okay? It's an endless statute?",
  "Except that that was a bail question, where there's not issues of finality at play, and bail is a question that repeats itself throughout the proceedings. Defendants are denied bail and then make a different showing of other resources or less danger or whatever, and they get out. And vice versa, defendants are out and are put in. That's it. There are no finality questions there. What do you do in this situation when you’re dealing with a criminal sentence where there are finality rules? And I'm going to tie that back to my starting point, which is I’m looking in your brief for the precedent and/or legal basis for us to treat restitution as not part of the final judgment in this criminal action. What -- what other examples do we have in the criminal context?",
  "They couldn't do that until the end of the 90 days. If the judge has 90 days to order restitution, that's a vicious cycle argument.",
  "But that's not true. I don't know if you’ve had time to look at 3582 or 35 --",
  "Those do appear to say that once there’s a term of imprisonment, that that constitutes a final judgment.",
  "Counsel --",
  "-- assume I accept your argument, and I am the cruise operator -- the cruise owner, cruise ship owner, and I look at the complaint, and I say: I think they really meant me, but -- I think. Now, within the 4(m) period, which is the period in which I am supposed to reasonably know that I would have been named absent a mistake, here an answer is filed, and you are told there is a mistake, and you don't correct the mistake. What conclusion would a reasonable person at that second juncture make about whether you made a mistake or not?",
  "And I think that's what the issue is here, which is, assuming the complaint could be read as a mistake during the 4(m) period, wasn't that mistake corrected, and you refused or failed to act?",
  "That makes so little sense to me. Here I think -- and for the following reason: You seriously I don't think could contend that if you had sought to amend a year later, that that would have been timely, correct?",
  "All right. But putting aside prejudice --",
  "-- what the lower court said was because your delay speaks to a choice, that that's the only thing a reasonable defendant would have assumed, that having been told that you sued the wrong party and you continued in that action, that that's what you intended to do, to sue that wrong party.",
  "I'm sorry. You have 120 days to amend, don't you, from the filing of the complaint?",
  "Right.",
  "Complaint.",
  "So why can't Costa Cruise be perceived to hold one of those roles?",
  "That’s not what the rule says. That’s not what the rule says. The rule doesn't talk about what kind of mistake or why. The rule says what the defendant should have known. And so, when you read this complaint, it's very clear you know you’re the carrier.",
  "You know cruise -- the other line, the sales agent, can't be the carrier, correct?",
  "So it's either a factual or a legal mistake. There is no other way to read that other than that there is a mistake.",
  "Because -- then have you to answer Justice Breyer's question, which is: What conceivable reason that is not either negligence or unintentional or inadvertent or just plain stupidity, however you want to define it, that someone who is injured would want to name a party who wasn't responsible for the injury?",
  "But, counsel, don't -- what you’re really talking about is whether once the answer was filed, they were dilatory in making their motion. I don't understand how you can argue that the day you received this complaint, you didn't understand that some sort of mistake had been made. The day that the answer came in, you might start to have a doubt because of their delay in the motion to amend, but doesn't that go to a 15(a) question, whether the judge should have given leave to amend because of dilatory tactics? Isn't that a 15(a) question, not a 15(c) question?",
  "Is there anything in the face of the complaint that would suggest anything but a mistake? Now, forget -- I'm being very specific. On the face of the complaint. You read that.",
  "Where does it say that? Where does it say: \"I know that the carrier is Costa Crociere\"? Where does it say that?",
  "What the complaint says is that Costa Cruise, the operator of the vessel, injured me, correct?",
  "And is that an accurate statement of fact?",
  "So --",
  "What do you define as -- assuming that we go back to our prior language and use -- in Ruckelshaus, \"some success on the merits,\" what's the \"some success on the merits\" that you claim your client reached?",
  "Now, I believe that this circuit said, yes, there are cases where we have so held, but that's because there was a cause of action under the complaint that -- that alleged a violation of the Act. But here there wasn't. Here, there was a claim for benefits only, and you didn't get benefits. That was the circuit's reasoning. So tell me where they erred and how we go back to defining \"some success on the merits\" in light of that position by the circuit?",
  "So what do you think our -- the meaning of our footnote, Chief Justice Rehnquist's footnote in Ruckelshaus, who said a procedural victory is not some success on the merits. How do you differentiate what he meant by a -- some procedural victory is not enough?",
  "How could somebody have some success on the merits if they don't achieve a judgment of some sort?",
  "But under your theory, presumably no relief has to be granted?",
  "But then what -- what's the difference -- is it your theory that if the district court -- for whatever reason, if this wasn't an ERISA case where a remand -- or where the court said they did violate, but I’ve now looked at the evidence that you’re proffering, the new evidence they did not consider, and it's not enough for benefits; you don't get it. Is your argument that you are entitled to fees because they decided there was -- the court decided there was a violation of ERISA?",
  "Going back to Justice Scalia's question, what's the difference between Hanrahan, where there’s a violation of the civil procedure code which is an entitlement to process? Why aren't you successful, if this is a non-ERISA situation, merely for a finding that the district court acted improperly?",
  "Could you tell me whether you differ in your definition of \"some success on the merits\" than your predecessor colleague? Do you define it as in the manner he did, that it's any legal judgment in the Petitioner's favor that another party has done a wrongful act? I think -- I think I’m summarizing his position accurately.",
  "No, that's different than what he said.",
  "All right. Yes, here there was an order of remand. That's clear. And I can understand the difference between an order, because there are many decisions of the court that end up in orders that are not final judgments. But there are decisions, like this one, I think according to him, that if the district court had said there was a violation of ERISA and the parties then settled without a judicial order reflecting that finding and/or requiring a remand, I think according to him he would say this party was entitled to fees.",
  "No, I didn't assume this case.",
  "No order, just a finding.",
  "And then a settlement.",
  "Well, that seems like a catalyst theory, and that was, at least in dicta, rejected in -- in Ruckelshaus. So how do you deal with that?",
  "His point -- your adversary's point -- is the court couldn't effect that procedural move without taking step one in what was requested. It had to find some sort of violation, either to remand or to grant benefits, so that the relief sought, by definition, needed a finding by the court. And your adversary says the court found an ERISA violation. Now, the type of relief it grants is up to its discretion. This is an equitable situation, and it exercised its discretion by doing a remand. Why is that view different than calling it a procedural step? Isn't that a substantive win?",
  "That -- that's difficult. Let's assume that a claims administrator or a plan administrator is not deciding the claim. The party comes to court and says: Under ERISA, I have a right to a decision within X number of days; force them, mandamus them to give me a decision. The court says: Reasonable; you have a right to one. And orders them to. Under your theory, they’ve won nothing?",
  "So you're -- you're -- wait a minute. Then we go back to a question that was asked by one of my colleagues. If a plan participant came in and said they didn't consider evidence they should have; they didn't seek my treating physician's documents, and here they are; they should consider them now, and the court says you're right, enters a remand order, and dismisses the case -- that's enough?",
  "Well, what -- what’s the difference between the first example I gave, a mandamus to issue a decision -- that's not a claim for benefits, either; it's a claim for a decision. What's the difference between that and the second hypothetical?",
  "So what is the difference between prevailing party and some success on the merits for you? The only difference is whether they won on one cause of action as opposed to four?",
  "So under Buckhannon, 51 percent only entitles you to fees. And under your view of this statute, you have -- as long as you get 1 percent order, that's enough.",
  "So you -- you see no difference today?",
  "You have --",
  "Counsel, is your problem with unconscionability being -- as described by the Chief Justice or Justice Scalia, being forced to or coerced into signing something -- that's okay for the courts, but this type of argument that goes to the unfairness of the process, that's for the arbitrator; is that your position?",
  "So why -- isn't that an unwieldy rule? Isn't your quarrel with what the court defined as remissible unconscionability as a legal matter, as opposed to trying to parse out what unconscionability means otherwise?",
  "We just gave you one that didn't: If someone was forced into signing the agreement in an unconscionable way.",
  "Could you describe for us what is unconscionable about this contract? What is your claim of unconscionability? He says it's not arbitration per se; it's just certain of the provisions here; if you change the provisions, I'm happy with arbitration. Is that your position?",
  "Counsel, I think I heard Justice Kennedy's question to be -- let's not confuse the contract as a whole. There’s only one contract here.",
  "It's an agreement to arbitrate.",
  "So an attack on the -- as I think Justice Breyer noted, you -- an argument that it's one-sided goes to the entire arbitration agreement. I don't want to arbitrate because that's not what I chose to do freely. Correct?",
  "That, you say, is for the court.",
  "The difference here is that there are provisions within how the arbitration is going to be held that, standing alone, you think are unconscionable, even though the agreement to arbitrate is not. Am I correct in understanding your allegation?",
  "You see, that's what I'm confused by, because when I first asked you this question, you said: I would be happy to arbitrate if the court struck the discovery provision and, I guess, the fees provision. Which answer are you giving me?",
  "Okay. Let’s assume --",
  "The problem -- I -- I keep going back to my initial question to you, is you want to parse out what making is from unconscionability, and you want us to say, well, if it's too onerous a fee for arbitration, that goes to the making, because you’re depriving the party of -- of an arbitration forum. If it's discovery, that doesn't go to depriving them of anything because the arbitrator could give them more discovery if he or she chose. Am I correct, this is your argument?",
  "However, you haven't in your brief. Didn't you say you weren't challenging the vacating order? You keep saying -- I know you appealed it originally, but the point is that you didn't seek certiorari on that ground.",
  "But whose --",
  "Could you tell me what's the legal error? You started by identifying the first one, which was short-circuiting the irreparable harm. This seems more like factual correction which you're getting into. Put it into a legal box for me. What are your legal claims?",
  "Could you go to the second part of Justice Alito's question, which was the issue of standing, both yours and the Petitioners’. What is it exactly that we’re being asked to review? Obviously, you’re going ahead with the EIS. You haven't sought a stay of that.",
  "All right. So what's the basis of the challenge to the injunction?",
  "Could you have -- let's just -- if this had -- if the order had vacated the deregulation and sent it back to you, what would you have -- the agency have had to do to issue temporary regulations consistent with the ones you proposed to the district court?",
  "But you short-circuited that. Isn't this more akin to you seeking a stay of the vacating order?",
  "The district court vacated the deregulation. No one can plant. You and the Petitioners go into court and say to the court: Stay that deregulation with respect to this kind of planting. Aren't you the one seeking the stay? And if so, isn't it your burden to show that you're entitled to whatever it is you seek?",
  "So that's the legal error you identify?",
  "That's a little different than answering Justice Kennedy's question, which is: Did you preserve the issue that the district court exceeded its jurisdiction in stopping you from further deregulation? That's a different question than whether or not it should have granted your further injunction which is, according to you, a further deregulation. But it's a different question.",
  "Am I factually correct that the harm is that from some seed-grown alfalfa, a bee or the wind is going to take the pollen and put it into a conventional field?",
  "But is that -- am I right?",
  "How many States grow alfalfa to seed as opposed to letting it just grow into hay?",
  "So that handful of States --",
  "-- is that where the risk exists?",
  "You just said the word \"different levels and different degrees,\" but this is an all-size-fit injunction.",
  "So how is that reasonable when the risk is different depending on the place and type of growth?",
  "Could I ask you something? Is that because your farmers -- I understood farmers of hay had huge tracts of land. Do they rent equipment from someone else to do it?",
  "Excuse me, could you tell me, just to clarify one factual matter, the popularity of corn and the other genetically engineered crops, is that from contamination or is it just from -- from consumer choice; i.e., that that's what farmers like because it's easy to grow?",
  "I have a real problem if the whole appeal is over whether or not the district court should have accepted the agency's views. The agency has told us that it has side-stepped going through all of the regular -- all of the administrative steps it was required to. It may not have needed to give notice, but it needed to do some form of an EA and get comments and do other things. And it didn't do that.",
  "So how can we say that the district court acted improperly, when it's the government who is asking the district court to forgive it from doing something it's legally required to do?",
  "No, no. My problem is I don’t see that argument either in your brief or theirs.",
  "I see only the argument that it erred by not accepting something that the government had no power to do outside of the regulatory scheme.",
  "I’m -- I'm trying to separate out the harassment aspects of this case from the working proposition that there’s some sort of freedom of association, of privacy. Your theory, putting harassment aside, would invalidate all of the State laws that require disclosure of voter registration lists, correct? All of those States like New York that permit public review of voter registration lists and party affiliations, et cetera -- that's illegal?",
  "That's unconstitutional?",
  "Explain to me the difference. And -- well, one other aspect of State legislative -- I can only work from New York because I know it intimately, but it is a State that also permits or requires that petitions for candidate listing on the ballot be public as well. New York relies in part, as this State does, on the public reviewing those petitions. Would that be invalid as well, for a candidate's running?",
  "So explain to me what the difference is in those three situations.",
  "With -- with the State's interest.",
  "You don't think that -- putting aside this kind of referendum, just a hypothetical referendum having to do with a certain tax scheme -- you don't think the voters would be interested in knowing what kinds of people in what occupations are interested in that particular tax benefit or not?",
  "Counsel, if we create this right of -- this constitutional right of association in the manner that you are describing it, why is it limited to the voting area? Would we be inviting review if a group of citizens get together and send a letter to an agency that says please pass X regulation, or rescind Y regulation? Would the agency be prohibited from making that letter public?",
  "So you're -- you're suggesting --",
  "-- that when a petitioner or a person engages in political discourse with the government, that they -- when they choose to do it, because the government is not compelling them to write to it; it’s not compelling them to sign the referendum. It's just --",
  "But it's -- but Ms. McIntyre wasn't asking the government to engage its process in her favor. She was asking for political reform, but she wasn't asking to engage the government process on her behalf.",
  "Weren’t two of the Petitioners here -- weren't two of the Petitioners here seeking the list so that they could go over the certification process the State had done to ensure that they had certified all the right people, et cetera?",
  "I'm not going to the privacy questions. You responded to Justice Ginsburg by saying that there was no way to challenge the State's process of validation, and that -- I don't think that's correct.",
  "Oh.",
  "That's assuming the answer, meaning if they don't have the right to access, they can't. But, legally, they can challenge it if they find on the petitions that things were erroneously counted by the State. They can go into court and prove that.",
  "How much time are we talking about in those processes?",
  "Yes.",
  "No, no, no. I'm trying to get the relationship between the disks being made available and the verification process. So is there a time for the public to look through the disks before the people who are sent into the room are sent into the room?",
  "Proposition 8?",
  "I'm sorry. You keep saying that you're not reading anything into the statute under your interpretation, but you are. You are limiting the -- the \"any other provision of law\" to any other provision of law specified in the charging -- in the counts of conviction, correct?",
  "So you -- you said to Justice Alito that you weren't reading anything in, but you are. You're reading into it that the other provision of -- of law to refer to counts of conviction at sentencing, correct?",
  "All right. So why is that read-in logical, meaning it's giving no extra punishment for the possession of a firearm?",
  "Which was, I think, Justice Ginsburg's -­",
  "Explain how, because you just said to Justice Scalia that if the mandatory minimum is in a separate charging instrument, then it doesn't affect you at all. It only affects you if the count is in a count of conviction at sentencing.",
  "So what in the language of 924(c) sets forth that limitation?",
  "But -- but there \"otherwise provided by law\" could be Federal, State laws. It could be in the indictment, not in the indictment. You're proposing that we limit this somehow, but I want to see what the language is that you're relying upon to limit it.",
  "In relationship to what? Isn't that the government's argument, which is that you have to say in relationship to something, whether it's the indictment or, as the government would have it, in relationship to the possession or carrying of a firearm? Why isn't that the more natural reading?",
  "Justice Breyer is reading a bit what your co-counsel is advocating, what Mr. Abbott is arguing?",
  "No?",
  "930(c): A person who kills any person in the course of bringing a firearm into a Federal facility shall be punished as provided in sections setting forth minimums for murder and manslaughter. So it would also have an effect in 930(c), no?",
  "I wasn't sure why it didn't list 930(c), but -­",
  "I know, but its brief does two formulations. It says -­",
  "-- anything that affects 924(c), and then in other places in its brief, it says the -- the \"except\" clause refers to any higher minimum sentence for possessing, using, or carrying a firearm in relationship to a drug or -- drug offense or a crime of violence. Those are two different formulations.",
  "I'm focusing on the second formulation.",
  "Whether charged or not -­",
  "Counsel, could I just ask one simple question, the one I started with earlier, which was, which of the two statements are you advocating? That the \"except\" refers to a provision that imposes a greater minimum sentence for violating 924(c) explicitly, or are you saying the \"except\" clause -- and I'm quoting from your brief, in two different places -- the \"except\" clause refers to a higher minimum sentence for possessing, using a firearm in relationship to a crime of violence or a drug offense?",
  "All right. If that's the case, your adversary just said, Mr. Abbott's attorney just said, that you don't believe that section 924(c)(1)(A) is trumped by 924(c)(1)(B) or by 18 U.S.C. section 930(c). Is his allegation correct or is he wrong?",
  "Okay.",
  "I'm sorry. So that if he discharges a firearm, and it says it is a sentence of not less than 10 years, and he -- and that firearm is also a short-barrelled rifle with a 10 year minimum, does he get 10 years, or does he get 20 years?",
  "How?",
  "So if it was a machine gun, where there's a 30-year minimum, does he get 40 or 30?",
  "What do you do with 930(c)? Don't leave without answering my question.",
  "But your answer to me was you read the \"except\" clause as applying to any higher minimum sentence for possessing, using, or carrying a firearm in relationship to a drug offense or crime of violence. Isn't killing a person a crime of violence?",
  "And isn't the bringing of a firearm into a Federal facility the carrying of a firearm?",
  "No, but I'm still trying to understand your position, which is -- I read what you said to me the \"except\" clause means, and I'm applying it to 930(c), and I couldn't figure out why you didn't list it.",
  "How?",
  "A person who kills any person -­",
  "So how is your reading different than Mr. Abbott's?",
  "Do they apply -- do the courts apply the housing and utilities listed amount whether or not you pay for a house or not, whether or not you rent?",
  "-- food costs, housing costs, utility costs, by getting his parents to pay for those things and still take this deduction?",
  "Your adversary said that only two courts have addressed this issue and have permitted those deductions. So under what reasoning would we apply a different standard to the car costs as opposed to those other costs?",
  "Housing.",
  "Where does it say that?",
  "The debtor's monthly expenses shall be the debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts specified under the national and local standards. So the national and local standards have amounts listed. Where does it say you take only the actual, not the national or local standard?",
  "But that's -- but that's not what the provision at issue here says. It says you use the amount specified under the national standards, and you use actual for everything else. That's what the statute said. So now you're trying to move the actual into the first half of the text?",
  "Why would you even bother? Why don't you -- if -- if what you're arguing is that only actual expenses are -- are what you can claim, you wouldn't need the first half.",
  "So what you would have the statute read is: The debtor's monthly expenses shall be the debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts specified, as a -- as a maximum. You would have to add \"maximum\" somewhere there.",
  "So what you're proposing is that every debtor has to go to the Bankruptcy Court and show what their monthly food bills have been over what period of time, how much their personal supplies have been over what period of time? How can you calculate forward what they are going to spend on a monthly basis for each of those items? Isn't that the reason the tables are used, so that you don't have to do that?",
  "So then you would be comfortable with a person who owns a house outright, who only pays $100 in utilities, taking the full amount of the housing and utilities allowable living expenses because that's the amount specified?",
  "But whose primary purpose is it? I mean, the victim here knew that the incident hadn't happened there. There was nothing he had to share with the police, because they could see he was bleeding from his stomach and he had been shot. He apparently didn't fear any threat, or there doesn't seem to be any circumstances suggesting an immediate threat to him. He had driven away. Rick didn't know where he had gone. So what's the ongoing emergency to the victim?",
  "Well, wait a minute. What is the primary -- isn't -- doesn't -- isn't there a footnote that says the primary purpose of the declarant is what is at issue?",
  "Well, in Davis, the issue is why was the declarant talking? What you were trying to do was to figure out whether the declarant was seeking help or attempting to get someone arrested. That's how I read the situation. The questions provided context for that. Are you seeking immediate ongoing help or are you talking about an event, attempting to get the police to intercede and arrest the person? Isn't that a fair reading of that case?",
  "But what does that have to do -- we're back to the reliability test, really, because they didn't do anything wrong. They were trying to assess the situation. But that's what they do when any report of criminal activity occurs. That's a different inquiry than the inquiry of why should that statement be permitted to be introduced at trial? It goes to the very essence of reliability. Was the statement made under circumstances that would suggest an intent to testify? That's really what you're getting at, isn't it?",
  "Well, you are, because you're trying to pigeonhole yourself into an ongoing emergency that suggests that in those situations, whatever the person is saying is okay because it was done to assess an emergency situation and not done for purposes of catching somebody, primary purpose of catching somebody.",
  "For all crimes, or only for shooting crimes or knifing crimes? For explosions? What kinds of crimes would qualify?",
  "Can he ask the witness -­",
  "You don't think there's a danger implicated by coming onto the lawn of a school and a student is there and says the principal shot me inside? You don't think that that suggests an ongoing emergency, that the principal is still inside with a gun?",
  "Did he shoot you because he had a grudge against you, or is he just shooting -­",
  "-- blindly, and he says he shot me?",
  "Let's go to formality. It can't be that you arrive at a scene of a crime and everything a victim tells you is admissible. There has to be some emergency. That's what we've said.",
  "Correct? So the issue here is how do you define that dividing line between emergency and non, when the police officers are just asking questions that by their nature are always going to be testimonial, because they are going to use or try to use whatever is said later? So, in discerning the primary purpose, I think your adversary is saying you can't go by what the police officers are asking because they are going to be asking dual motive always. You have to look to what the declarant tells you. And is he or she telling you something that suggests an emergency?",
  "That's really the difference between the two of you, I think.",
  "What happens if the individual says I'm going to ignore the injunction? Can you go to the State and force the State to -- in that circumstance, to get someone to issue the license on your behalf?",
  "Or the municipality. I misspoke.",
  "So what you're saying is that a State agent or a municipality can continue to ignore a constitutional violation until, what -- you're denied the license five times?",
  "How many times do you have to show that you're not getting a license you're entitled to?",
  "They wouldn't know that -­",
  "All right. So what do you do with CANRA section 11178(a)(2), which tells you that the municipality is responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and retention of the reports sent to the State? It's not your policy to ignore your obligation and not figure out what to do about the retention of improperly submitted names?",
  "But that's what it's charged with doing. It's charged with the responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, and retention of these reports.",
  "So if you're charged with the accuracy, completeness, and retention of the reports, why shouldn't you be responsible for the failure to maintain accurate reports?",
  "Well, that's your adversary's argument, which is by this lawsuit, you have been told that there's something wrong -- it seems pretty natural -- that a report would be kept on the registry that has been declared just plain wrong. The court has said there's no foundation whatsoever for the accuracy of what's in that report, and you have failed to establish a procedure to remove the name. Why aren't you liable under Monell?",
  "Who would they sue to do that? As I am reading CANRA, it makes the California Department of Justice only the repository of reports.",
  "So who -- who do they sue in the State to -­",
  "Counsel, could you stop talking in the abstract -­",
  "-- and give me an example? Give me an example of a situation where a State official under Ex parte Young has been held to have violated the Constitution where a Monell finding had not been a part of it.",
  "Exactly.",
  "No. MR. PINCUS. No.",
  "I was trying to do just an analogy in terms of -- because one of his arguments has been that -- that Ex parte Young doesn't have, inherently, a Monell requirement.",
  "I -- I -- I'm still -­ I'm sort of asking for a hypothetical and to take it from the abstract. Tell me what's -- here, you define the ongoing violation as the failure to institute procedures, I'm assuming, to remove a name from the registry, correct?",
  "That's the ongoing failure that you're alleging entitled you to injunctive relief?",
  "Or was it that you thought that the city could remove the name? I'm not quite sure what it is that you think -- what was the continuing violation?",
  "So to prove a future violation, you have to show that the municipality can do that, correct?",
  "Right.",
  "So why isn't that a policy, practice, or custom? That's what I'm trying to understand, how -­",
  "-- their failure or omission could be anything but.",
  "Well, they gave you an example. Clerk says: I'm not giving a marriage license to interracial couples; I think that's constitutional. Clerk resigns. And the municipality says: We think he was right, that's constitutional. It's not our policy. We didn't really think about it, but we think it's constitutional. You're arguing that because it was the agent who made that decision, the city had no policy, you can't give injunctive relief ordering the city to give you a license.",
  "Well, how is that different from what the Chief Justice -­",
  "-- proposed, which is, no, we didn't have a policy, but we're going to defend you anyway because we think it's okay. Now you're calling that a policy.",
  "They're not going to say that; they're going to say: Policy, no policy -- we don't even think that way. What he did was okay. We're going to defend it. It's constitutional. And the court says: What he did is not constitutional. X has to be done instead by you, the municipality, even though the agent that you had before was acting on his or her own.",
  "So we're now going to have a situation where what you are proposing is that you have to sue the individual actor, get a ruling on the constitutionality of whatever is being done, and then let that suit finish and ask the municipality to perform or not perform, and if it doesn't, then you relitigate all these issues?",
  "Mr. Katyal, is there any limit to what questions the Government can ask - -",
  "-- an applicant?",
  "What does that mean?",
  "Could you ask somebody, what's your genetic make-up, because we don't want people with a gene that's predisposed to cancer, whatever other -- could you ask that?",
  "We do, because I have to start with the question of what are the limits on the Government, if any? Are you taking the position that, as an employer, there are absolutely none, or are you taking the position that there are some, and what would they be?",
  "So what you are saying is, there's no limit?",
  "Were these two forms approved by Congress?",
  "That's a restriction on disclosure, but the same Congress can change that, correct?",
  "I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand the answer. Only 128 times has somebody identified themselves as a drug user?",
  "So it could be for any other answers as well?",
  "Are you representing to us that every employee who is rejected will know the reason?",
  "So where does the suitability matrix come in?",
  "It doesn't?",
  "And NASA has never used it? You're representing that to the Court?",
  "General -- I'm sorry. Go ahead and finish.",
  "Is your position today that our ruling should say that the Government is free to ask, as a private employer or a contractor -- it is free to ask any question it wants whatsoever?",
  "If you were not saying that, then what's the narrower ruling? Because that's what I thought I heard at the beginning of our colloquy today.",
  "Well, why wouldn't that violate it if the question involved a fundamental right? If you were asking the question that Justice Alito asked, which is, what's your sexual practices in the bedroom, if there are security checks against you disclosing it, you're saying even that would be okay?",
  "Don't -- this is a bit unsatisfying because you start by saying to us, as long as there are some nondisclosure protections, then virtually any question, whether it impinges a fundamental right or not, would be okay, because there's -- I don't even know what the Government's interest is in asking every question it wants to. There has to be a need for a set of questions, doesn't there?",
  "So that right is subject to what level of scrutiny? Is it always strict scrutiny? And how do you square Whalen and Nixon's balancing with strict scrutiny?",
  "So that's all information about yourself?",
  "I think what Justice Breyer is getting to and that I'm trying to figure out is you've used the word \"privacy.\" What does privacy relate to?",
  "No, I'm talking about -- answer his broad question, which is -- you've defined the constitutional right to information about yourself.",
  "Is that all information about yourself, including your date of birth, your Social Security number, your -- where you live, where you've gone to school, who your friends, who your references are? Because as broadly as you've defined that, it would include all of that.",
  "The fundamental rights issue that the Sixth Amendment identified, are those the questions that are subject to that greater scrutiny?",
  "Are you conceding you can't meet that standard, or are you saying that the Ninth Circuit misapplied that standard?",
  "Do you think there's something wrong with the Government having to explain why it seeks information? I mean, I would think that would be fairly simple in virtually every situation.",
  "I ask that question because that begs the question of can you ask anything you want regardless of why?",
  "Counsel, this is a single incident, and Canton said if you know that a tort is likely to happen without training, then one incident is enough. Every prosecutor knows that there can be Brady violations if people are not taught what Brady means, because it's not self-evident in every situation, correct?",
  "All right. So if you know that rookie prosecutors -- and most prosecutors' offices are filled with young ADAs who have just come out of law school. If you know that they are going to meet some situations where the answer is not intuitively known, like that if you get a lab report, you should turn it over, don't you have an obligation, isn't that what the jury said, to train them to turn over lab reports? Now, I know you claim you had that policy.",
  "We can talk later about whether or not there was sufficient evidence for the jury to disbelieve that you had that policy or not. That's a sufficiency of the evidence question. But if you know that lab reports have to be turned over, you've conceded it's a Brady violation not to do it, and there was sufficient -- and you had no policy -- I know you are disputing that -- and you had no policy of turning it over, why aren't you responsible for a Canton-like violation?",
  "Now what you're suggesting is that for certainty you know that a lawyer's judgment is going to go astray because a particular area of law is that complicated. Your people disagreed -- some of your people disagreed or didn't know whether turning over a lab report was a -- failure to turn over a lab report when you didn't know a defendant's blood type was a Brady violation. That has been conceded in this case, so I accept as a working proposition that they should have known that. What you're suggesting is you get a pass because, even though you know that there's an area of law that a young lawyer is not going to be able to figure out on their own, you fail to train them and you're okay.",
  "That's not the Canton example.",
  "That's what you're saying.",
  "Well, then why don't we just - -",
  "But that's - -",
  "I understood -- and maybe I'm confused -- that you were arguing that there was no set of circumstances in which a prosecutor could be handled -- could be liable on a theory of failure to train for one incident.",
  "That was the petition as it came - -",
  "So it doesn't matter what the facts are. The facts that Justice Kagan gave you would never constitute an actionable claim against a prosecutor; is that your position in this case?",
  "So what you - -",
  "But that wasn't the question presented to us. You didn't present to us an issue of whether the jury instruction - -",
  "-- was wrong or not.",
  "You see, what I'm trying to figure out is whether your position is that under no circumstance, even the hypothetical that Justice Kagan set forth, could you be charged with a single-incident Canton violation. That is your -- your theory?",
  "The Brady situation.",
  "Well, how do you exercise legal judgment if you don't even know what you're supposed to turn over? That was Justice Ginsburg's question.",
  "Counsel, I'm - -",
  "Well, didn't they here? Didn't they make it available?",
  "Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What evidence is there that they put this in their hip pocket? There was a disclosure that the evidence existed. Where is the evidence that the defense counsel didn't have access to asking for it?",
  "Or asking for it to be tested? Where was that suppressed?",
  "And what -- where's the Brady violation for telling a defense attorney there was a blood sample there, you can test it?",
  "So that you are claiming there was suppression of that evidence?",
  "Could you please state in simple terms to me what exactly they failed to train these prosecutors to do, that the prosecutors didn't do? What training -- Justice Alito asked it generally; I'm asking specifically -- what is the exact training that was required in this situation that caused the violation in this case?",
  "Forget about no Brady training. What -- I think Justice Alito asked this question. What specifically would the training have said or done that would have avoided this Brady violation?",
  "Now, that seems to suggest that you're claiming that if there was an intentional violation by the prosecutors, that that statement would have avoided the prosecutor from doing something he or she knew was illegal. Is that what you're intending?",
  "Okay. So tell me.",
  "That goes to the sufficiency - -",
  "-- whether they had a policy to turn over or -- because it was tested, so there was no Brady violation from the failure to test here.",
  "But, you see, it was tested. And it was made available to the defense. Turning over -- using the word \"turning over\" is ridiculous, because they're not going to physically give it to the defense attorney to go off and do what he wants. They're going to give it to a lab that will establish a chain of custody, et cetera, et cetera. So it was made available. He went to look at it, but the looking at it wouldn't have told the defense attorney anything. They had to make it available for testing. He never asked for testing. They did the lab reports. So now we come down to the only failure is in the turning over of this report. Correct?",
  "Now, what did I just say? The failure to turn over the report, correct?",
  "Never knew it existed?",
  "That's - -",
  "But that dooms your case. If it wasn't an innocent error, if it was an intentional violation of Brady, there is no training that was going to stop him from doing that.",
  "Excuse me - -",
  "Were they heard and deterred - -",
  "Counsel, I'm trying to tease out the importance of the -- whether the person's a private nature or public figure -- a private person or a public figure. Does it make a difference if I am directing public comments to a public or private figure?",
  "No, I'm talking about in terms of infliction of emotional distress. If I am talking to you as a Marine, if you were a Marine, and I was talking about the Iran war and saying that you are perpetuating the horrors that America is doing and said other things that were offensive, would you have a cause of action because you are being called a perpetrator of the American experience?",
  "But you're saying yes. So public speech, speech on a public matter, if directed to a private person, should be treated differently under the law? I think that was part of what Justice Breyer was asking. Is that what your position is?",
  "All right. And under what theory of the First Amendment would we do that? What case would stand for -- our case -- stand for the proposition that public speech or speech on a public matter should be treated differently depending on the recipient of the speech?",
  "That's defamation. That's false -- truth or falsity. But - -",
  "But have they done it in the context of differentiating between public and private speech?",
  "I was not talking about State cases. I was talking about a Supreme Court case that suggested that we would treat -- we would treat the First Amendment and the right to -- to speak on public matters differently, depending on the person to whom it was directed.",
  "So it always goes to the context. Now, going to the context of this speech, do we look at the words on a sign alone, or do we look at the entire context of what all of the other signs said at the demonstration, to determine whether or not the speech here was public or private speech?",
  "Well, in that case - -",
  "Well, that's - -",
  "Counsel, I'm following your argument that the bulk of your speech in the epic, and even the bulk of your signs, involve public speech. What you have not explained to me is how your speech directed at the Snyders constituted public speech, or speech about a public matter, because you're talking about them raising Matthew for the devil, teaching him to, I think, defy the creator, to divorce and to commit adultery. At what point and how do we take personal attacks and permit those, as opposed to -- I fully accept you're entitled in some circumstances to speak about any political issue you want. But what's the line between doing that and then personalizing it and creating hardship to an individual?",
  "So if we disagree that that made him a public figure, if we view him as a private figure, is that enough to defeat your argument?",
  "All right. So assume that he's a private -- that the Matthews are private figures, and you did this.",
  "So explain to me how you are protected by the First Amendment.",
  "You want to change my assumption.",
  "We assume that he' a private figure. You have now made a public statement and directed personal comments at an individual who is a private figure. Is that actionable?",
  "You keep saying that. But didn't I understand correctly that that drug was withdrawn from the Japanese market in which it had originally been -­",
  "Was it proven that it was as effective?",
  "Explain why.",
  "Is there any provision in the regulations that require a manufacturer to withdraw a drug earlier than when the FDA tells them to?",
  "So this immunity would come along until they go to the FDA and say, Well, we've gotten enough incidents to prove -­",
  "So why didn't they make the vaccine court exclusive? There is plenty of administrative systems that make -- preclude State law actions altogether and place you in administrative proceedings. So if their intent was to drive out State lawsuits, why not do that?",
  "So, how -- couldn't they have taken care of that with Daubert? I mean, won't most of these cases get resolved on a motion for summary judgment?",
  "Point me to the FDA regulations or law where the FDA, in giving a license to or permitting a new vaccine, actually looks at whether that vaccine is the most efficacious way with the least serious harm to the population. Is there a regulation that requires that judgment by them before they issue permission to market?",
  "All right. What is the motivation? If there is no -- there's no approval mechanism for the FDA to look at that issue, what is the motivation for manufacturers to voluntarily remove a drug that is causing harm to the public before the FDA acts? If they are completely immune under your reading of this preemption statute, what motivates them to act more quickly?",
  "Could you please just answer that question? What is the motivation for the manufacturer to either continue the testing of their product and voluntarily stopping it if a better design has been found by someone else or even an inducement for them to find a better design if a competitor comes around? Because I don't see why they should stop until they have caused as many injuries as they need to before the FDA says stop.",
  "What is the inducement for them to do it voluntarily?",
  "I am not asking about the FDA.",
  "I said the manufacturers' motivations.",
  "Does the victim of that withholding have a private cause of action? I don't see anything in this that would give them -­",
  "Or there is something better on the market than this that won't cause that.",
  "What do those 64 percent do now? What is the percentage of those people who actually go into court now?",
  "Is that because whatever the percentage is, proving causation is never easy -­",

  "You are making an assumption that has a flawed premise, which is that their only concern was protecting the manufacturers.",
  "It couldn't have been.",
  "Not only do they compensate victims, but they permitted victims to go into State court.",
  "No, no, no. That's your assumption. My point is that if we are talking about what the purpose was, you can't assume that -­",

  "If this drug had not been sold and another drug had been used the person would have avoided their injury.",
  "It sounds to me that you're going to win on non-summary judgment. I don't see -- I do understand the cost of litigation. It can be very, very onerous. So I'm not trying to minimize it, but I do think that there's a whole lot of hurdles in place before a plaintiff wins on one of these claims.",
  "Excuse me -- going back to the point you just started with -­",
  "-- which was is this -­ is the Control -- Disease Center, is it making a judgment before it approves a drug for licensing, that it's the most efficacious drug on market?",
  "No -­",
  "Where do I look at that? At what documents do I look at to make a judgment that in fact, CDC is doing what I ask, that it is looking at the question of whether this is the most efficacious drug with the least adverse effects? Is that a judgment it's making?",
  "We know the FDA is not. Are you representing to us right now that CDC makes that judgment?",
  "That would include comparisons to other drugs on the market?",
  "Counsel, I don't know that you answered Justice Kennedy's question.",
  "I don't know you answered his question. His question was: If you can deny or deny on the merits, what's the difference between the two?",
  "There's two choices, so they have to have different meanings in some way.",
  "They showed us the docket for that day -­",
  "-- of the denial here, and there were different ones. If it's the same court taking action, why would they choose one over the other for particular cases?",
  "Well, that's what -­ that's feeding into your adversary's argument, that when the court does a summary denial, you don't know whether it's procedural or merits. That's his argument. You're adopting his argument?",
  "What was the basis of that?",
  "So it took 14 months for this petition to be filed to the State court. Do you have cases that show whether those 14 months are presumptively unreasonable under California law?",
  "So there is great validity, you think, to your timeliness -- so this timeliness claim. And despite that, you believe the silent denial was an adjudication on the merits.",
  "Did they say that?",
  "Did they explicitly say in every single case you have to consult an expert?",
  "Or did they say, in the circumstances of this case, given the nature of the issues, that consultation would have been effective?",
  "We could take issue with -- with the timing of that consultation, but let's assume that it turns out afterwards that if he had consulted an expert, that that expert would have told him that one of those blood spots absolutely had to be Klein's near the bedroom. You would have no quarrel with saying it would have been ineffective for that counsel to have failed to confer with an expert, wouldn't you?",
  "You would say, even if the expert were to give that kind -- an expert would have given that kind of exculpatory information, that that would not have been ineffective?",
  "I'm not talking -­",
  "I gave you a hypothetical different from the facts of this case. I take the Ninth Circuit to be saying, if you're in an area, and you are a lawyer, where you have no expertise and your case depends on a technical issue, it behooves you to at least talk to an expert to find out if you are on the right track. And if you fail to and you get something that's completely exculpatory, you're ineffective. So I posed the hypothetical: If an expert would have looked at all of these test results and said, that has to be Klein's blood there, it can't be Johnson's for this reason, you are positing that even under that circumstance there would not have been ineffectiveness for the failure to consult with an expert? Is that what you are telling us?",
  "You keep wanting to return to this case, and I respect why you want to, but I am positing a hypothetical that underlies, I think, the Ninth Circuit's point.",
  "It may well be in this case that the consultation would have resulted in no prejudice. That's different from whether it was effective to ignore a consultation. Those are two different questions.",
  "Mr. -­",
  "Counsel, there's a lot of talk about the importance of this pool of blood, but as I read Detective Bell's testimony, he never posited -- or talks about how that pool was formed. Only your expert does that. What Bell does talk about, however, is that there's a high-velocity blood splatter in front of the couch and that the pooling of blood on Klein's face shows that he was shot there. Your experts do nothing to refute that testimony, which was really the basis of -- of Bell's testimony. He had nothing to say about the pool of blood. He talked about why Klein was shot where he was shot. And there's no expert testimony to refute that. So how do you get past there being a reasonable probability of a different verdict when there is nothing to refute the critical testimony at issue, that Klein was shot where he was shot because there's high-velocity blood splatter in front of him and because the pooling on his face shows that?",
  "Could you explain the blood pooling in the face for me? You talked about the high-velocity, but -­",
  "I'm having a very hard time with your reliance on that footnote because the very last paragraph of that footnote says when Respondent's asserts -- and I'm shortening the introductory line -- a State procedural bar and when nevertheless our order disposing of a habeas corpus position does not impose the proposed bar or bars as to that claim, that signifies that we have considered Respondent's assertion and have determined that the claim or subclaim is not barred on the procedural ground.",
  "So the footnote itself says unless we invoke the procedural bar, we're not applying it.",
  "Right.",
  "What others could apply in this case?",
  "It wasn't part of the cert -- the question -- we added the question.",
  "No, no. I'm saying they didn't raise it to start with; we added the question.",
  "So it wasn't as if they were trying to get around their own waiver?",
  "Is it -- if I am understanding your argument, it is that the Court erred in assuming that if the confession had been suppressed -- which you're not arguing for or against. I'm assuming you are not taking your amicus's position that we have to get to the question of what would have happened in a motion to suppress -- but that under all circumstances, if there's a suppressible confession, a defendant should never plead guilty. You are saying that that conclusion is what the Ninth Circuit drew and that was wrong?",
  "So it's another way of saying what I said, which is, no defendant should plead guilty if it's a suppressible confession?",
  "All right. So now, what is the other information that would have made a plain guilty in this case inevitable? However, that's a higher standard than you need to meet, but -­",
  "Were those higher than the minimum he pled to? Were those mandatory minimums higher?",
  "Without any confession -- forget about the brother or the girlfriend -- assume that there had been no confession, wouldn't it have been a fair conclusion to draw that without any confession whatsoever that the plea bargaining strength of the defendant in this case would have been appreciably higher and that the prosecutor would have had to offer something -­",
  "None of the three -­ MR. KROGER -- had been made.",
  "-- whatsoever. I mean, if the brother's confession -- or the confession to the brother is a very big piece of why a plea would have been reasonable in this case. Let's assume no confession.",
  "I am having a little bit of trouble here with your argument for the following reasons. Assume we suppress the confession. Why is it unreasonable for the defense attorney to have concluded that the evidence showing your client's presence at the shooting, and identification as the shooter, that it was solely that he should have gone to trial on a defense that he wasn't involved in the shooting at all. Once you put him in this shooting, then the only issue he seems to be confused about is that he thinks that because it was accidental that that presents a defense to felony murder. And that's clearly an erroneous position on his part. So what made the case so weak that the Government was never going without the confession to prove felony murder?",
  "What would have been the defense?",
  "What would have been the defense absent the confession? You have one at trial on the confession, suppressing it, how would he have defend the this case?",
  "What motive would his brother have had to put him at the scene of this shooting as the accidental killer? That's all his brother would have had to say. He was at the scene, he accidentally -- this gun went accidentally off.",
  "His brother had no pending charges against him at the time.",
  "So what does that have to do with what interest does his brother have when he has no pending charges against him at the time, he's going to use this as a future chip in case he does something wrong?",
  "To put his brother into jail for 25 years? This is illogical, counsel.",
  "Impeachable how? What motive did he have to implicate his brother? You still haven't answered that question. All you keep saying is, he was a past cooperator, he had no pending charges, and now he has a motive to do this against his brother because of that?",
  "And a competent -- and a competent counsel is supposed to accept their irrational client, who doesn't want to understand the law, and let him risk getting an aggravated felony charge brought against him, or a capital murder charge brought against him, and not -- and just go ahead? And try the case because he's not going to recommend to the client, go to trial, take the plea, because you're irrational?",
  "That's really what you are saying, that a competent attorney would not recommend to his client take the plea, and that his client wouldn't ultimately accept the plea, because the objective reality is his upside horrible and his downside is almost a given.",
  "But four witnesses put him at the scene to kidnap this guy and scare him to death. Or scare him.",
  "So you mean that if the Government says you've got to file a complaint with us by either calling us or submitting something in writing, and at a cocktail party a worker goes up to a Government employee in that agency, and says, you know, my company is violating the law. That that's enough?",
  "The reason I'm asking that question is related to Justice Alito's question, which is, what does filing a complaint mean? Does it have to be relative to the procedures adopted by the person that you are reporting this to?",
  "Well, at a cocktail party that employee may be there on personal time, but when he goes back to work the next morning he could do something. Is that enough?",
  "So what you are doing is he is estopping the Government from saying, the only way that you can file a complaint with us is to do it in writing. We are now forcing the Government to adopt an oral procedure even if it chose not to? Even if it thought an oral procedure would create havoc, et cetera, et cetera?",
  "What does file -- what is the meaning of \"filed\"?",
  "So why is it inherently unworkable here in any greater extent that it is unworkable in all of the other statutes where oral complaints are permitted? What makes this worse than these other statutes? What would create more cases in this area as opposed to some of the other areas? Oral complaints are explicitly -­",
  "This is the -- this was the Lochner era where they weren't even sure they could do this. But why should we read their language with a narrow reading of any complaint?",
  "What grievance -- would the bringing of a grievance, the example that Justice Breyer suggested, an employee goes to his union and says, they are violating the statute. Let's grieve it. And according to the proceedings established by the employer, they meet with the employer, and the employee does everything in the grievance and they now fire that employee. Under your reading, that's not instituting a proceeding?",
  "Then we have to address your second question, not the first. You are saying the oral wouldn't work in there?",
  "Would it work if they instituted a proceeding orally and the proceeding required itself to start orally?",

  "That Congress's intent was not to protect a worker who publicly took an oath in front of an arbitrator and testified about a violation of law, that they would not have considered that retaliatory under the statute.",
  "That goes to your adversary's first argument or second argument where he says when this act was passed for all of those people, they would never have thought of going to their employer because the work ethos at the time was that those employees couldn't complain to their employers. They would always naturally go to the Government. How do you answer that? How do you disprove that point: That historically at the time this was passed in 1938, that there was a number of those employees who as a regular course of their business, filed complaints with their employers as opposed to the Government?",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "I'm sorry. What's the rule that's arbitrary and capricious that you're challenging?",

You can't get it if it was present at the time and -- meaning if that actual test that you're seeking was available at the time of trial, or you don't prove that you couldn't have done it for a good reason. So what is it exactly that the court did in applying this that was unconstitutional?",
  "But, wait a minute. That's what the statute says. The statute gives the conditions under which a petitioner can seek DNA evidence, and it said you didn't meet those conditions. I'm still trying to figure out what you're arguing -­",
  "-- was the procedural due process violation in their application of those items. So are you challenging it facially, or are you challenging it as applied, but as applied how?",
  "And so what do you think -­",
  "What is it about what they said it means that's unconstitutional?",
  "I don't even -- I'm not even sure what that argument ties to, because I thought what the court said was: This DNA testing was available then. You could have gotten it. Strategically your trial attorney chose not to, and so that disqualifies you from seeking it now. I'm not quite sure what the date of the statute's passage, whether it makes any difference, because -- because why?",
  "That -- that answer is not addressing Justice Alito's point, which he said a Rule 50 motion is not jurisdictional. You are in essence claiming it is. You're saying they lacked the power, but Justice Alito's question to you said they don't, that they've misread the fact that this is not a jurisdictional motion. So address that question: Why is it jurisdictional as opposed to a claim processing?",
  "The claim processing rules, we have said that, unless you object, the court doesn't lack power. Since you didn't object below to a -- a argument that Rule 50(b) precluded consideration by the court of appeals, why wasn't that argument waived before the court?",
  "That's -- just finish: Because if Ms. Jordan had reported the incident that she was required to, they would have put Ms. Ortiz in segregation automatically; is that it?",
  "So that we should -- I think what that means to me is that you really ignore whether it was raised at summary judgment. If you're going to look at the evidence at trial, what do we look at, at trial, to see that the claim of qualified immunity was preserved?",

  "Could -- could you articulate for me the line that you see between assuming all of the facts and it's not enough as a matter of law, and a sufficiency claim. And -- and let's break out the two claims: one against Ms. Jordan, one against Ms. Bright. On a due process claim against Ms. Bright, there are two prongs, I think, to your argument. One is that, as a matter of law under Sandin, putting her in solitary confinement did not violate any -- any constitutional right. And then there's \"she didn't retaliate\" part of your claim. The two seemed mixed up to me, below. And I thought in reading your submissions to the district court you were saying that, if she retaliated in putting her in segregated confinement, it doesn't matter whether there is a Sandin violation or not; she couldn't do the retaliatory act; is that correct?",

And wouldn't our announcement of a rule -- that whether it's an issue of law or fact, it has to be renewed under 50(b), so everybody's on the same page as to what's going to be heard on appeal -- why is that a bad rule? Why would that be a bad outcome as a matter of law?",

  "So why isn't our rule simply -- what is so wrong with a rule that says if you can bring it in the Court of Claims you have to, but if there's relief that you can't secure there you can have two lawsuits? What is so irrational about that?",
  "If there is no double recovery possible.",
  "We have already gone through that because most of those claims would have had some element of double recovery, that might have precluded a second action. The point that I raised was if there is a chance of potential double recovery, you can't breach, what's wrong with that?",

There is no principle of law that you are articulating that says it -- it has to be -­ this is not clear enough for the Federal Government, but it is clear enough for the State. \"Appropriate relief\" either has a meaning or it doesn't.",
  "If it is, why is injunctive relief included at all? Meaning, what you seem to be saying to me is that no relief should be appropriate, because no relief is clear whether it's injunctive relief or damages?",
  "Some would say that injunctive relief attaches more to the public FISC then compensatory relief. Because future conduct or change of conduct can have an enormous intrusion on the public FISC, so why do we draw the line between saying one is more intrusive than the other?",
  "So now we have three distinctions. With respect to land use discrimination, the Rehab Act would presumably apply. So the Rehab Act says compensatory damages are permissible for that kind of discriminatory claim, so now we have compensatory damages for that. We have, potentially, compensatory damages for local governments, but not for State or Federal level. We are chopping up the statute at each stage, correct? We are treating different defendants differently and different claims differently with respect to the relief that's permissible?",

  "It's absolutely a falsehood. They go in, they report it to Miss Buck. Miss Buck does an investigation. There are no witnesses. There's no one else to prove that they came in late. She just takes the supervisors' word. She looks at their report -- it was moments after the employee didn't show up -- and she says: He's a late-goer. I don't know anything about anti-animus; I simply fired him because two supervisors who are trustworthy -- I've looked at their files, they've never lied about anything before, they are pretty honest people and -- what happens in that situation?",
  "How? She went and looked for witnesses, didn't find them. She looked at their records. She did what happened here; other people have complained about these people, don't particularly like them.",
  "Well, but that's the question, because you just added a very important fact, which is a 10-year history of being late. But on this day, he wasn't late. On this day, the two supervisors made it up.",
  "Would she have fired him absent that report? Isn't that what the jury has to decide?",
  "Well, what the -- what this circuit's \"cat's paw\" theory does and what others do say, if she engaged in any investigation, there's no liability.",
  "But that assumes that the employment decision is solely hers. It's hers, not based on her peccadilloes; it's hers based on information that she has gathered.",

  "Well, in most situations, an employer comes in and says: I fired X for X, Y, and Z reasons. And if they don't mention one of those inconsequential or immaterial reports, why would a court rely on it at all? It's not a motivating factor.",
  "Well, it did say that earlier, didn't it?",

  "Can I ask you a question? How is this case different from a situation where the agency looks at a request for a minimum standard, says: Require that a certain light be added to the lights in a car. The agency comes back and says, you know, there are so many designs of cars; in some cars, particularly sedans, the light is an added safety feature; in vans it may not be because of the size of vans. And so we are not going to require it. We are going to let manufacturers, depending on what design their car has, to choose between the two, so that we're not going to set a minimum standard for every one because there are too many different designs. Despite that ruling, the manufacturer says it costs two pennies more to put this light in a sedan. I know the agency has said it's safer, but I don't want to do it. I don't have a van, I don't have any reason except the two pennies that I don't want to do it. Is that case preempted? Because you were just merely given the option?",
  "How is this different from the hypothetical where the agency said there could be an obstruction with the entry, but manufacturers who can design it without the obstruction should really do it. How is this, this case, different than the one hypothetical?",
  "But wait a minute. What that -- what you are not answering is flexibility to ensure that a manufacturer imposes or thinks about safety and chooses the option that is safest.",
  "So what's the inducement for a manufacturer to put the light into a sedan or to put a seatbelt 2, when it can, without causing an added safety risk? If it's preempted, there is no inducement.",
  "But that's always the case when the agency sets a minimum. By setting a minimum, it's basically saying we don't want to mandate more.",
  "But -- but you are not disagreeing that the statute by its term says that a minimum doesn't preempt State common law.",
  "So I'm still not sure why creating an option is any different than the minimum.",
  "But the default is always that the manufacturers have an option. A minimum by definition gives manufacturers options.",
  "But you haven't explained why.",
  "If the minimum by its own definition gives freedom to the manufacturer to impose more if it chooses, or not, why does the option to tell a manufacturer, pick what you think is safest, why does that do more?",
  "But I'm sorry, you still haven't responded to me. Manufacturers are always at risk for common law claims under this statute, because this statute expressly says they are. Every design choice a manufacturer makes under almost any situation where the common law is in effect puts it at risk that a jury will decide whether it did enough or not, under cost/ benefit analysis and technology. So I don't know why when the agency creates a minimum by choice or not, it should be implicitly preempted in -- from the application of State law.",
  "But this wasn't the center seat. This was an aisle seat.",
  "But that is not the issue here. The issue is whether it was feasible in this car, not whether or not it was not feasible elsewhere.",
  "That goes to my point of the light in the sedan versus the van. It's letting the manufacturers decide what's the best choice.",

How do we draw the line between a law that says discovery has to happen in arbitration, and one that says a -- in a contract of adhesion, if the superior party retains the right to do discovery but tells the inferior party, you can't?

  "I mean, other than -- I don't want to look through legislative history and determine whether some committee person said something that sounds like subterfuge. How do I look at the law and its effects and determine that subterfuge or that discrimination?",
  "-- in the legislative record?",
  "Excuse me. May I pose a hypothetical so that I understand? And I think it follows up on what Justice Alito was saying. Let's assume all taxes are equal between water carriers and railroads, except there is an excise tax: 4 percent on the railroads, 2 percent on the water carriers.",
  "Everybody else pays 4 percent. On your theory, is that discrimination or not?",
  "But this is not an exemption area, so what meaning do you give -- that's what I'm trying to figure out. Are you saying -- what meaning are you giving to discrimination at all, other than -- unless we accept that the class always has to be the commercial class?",
  "So if there's 100 businesses, where does the line between singling out the railroad get drawn? When they exempt 98? When they exempt 97? When they exempt 95, or is it at 80? Where do we draw the singling out? If the State says the general tax is 4 percent, but everybody -- but how many are exempted?",
  "What sense would there be for Congress to use the word \"discriminate\" and intend, in the hypothetical I gave you earlier, that railroads will pay 4 percent like everyone else, but their competitors, for no reason other than that the State wants to favor the water carrier, is only paying 2 percent? What -- what conceivable reason would Congress want that differential to exist?",
  "I'm not talking about an exemption. I'm talking about a rate difference.",
  "So to answer that question, you are telling us that we have to define what discrimination means?",
  "It's not quite -- it's not quite that. You forget the other part of the test, which is without a reason. Now, the other side hasn't defined what a legitimate reason would be. And that's a separate inquiry. But if there is a -- some form of legitimate reason to treat people differently, I think the other side is saying that's okay.",
  "In their particular facts of their case. I mean, that's what they have to come up and explain to us, what's the -- what's the defining principle of acceptable or unacceptable different treatment, because it can't be -- you're right, logically, it can't be most favored taxpayer status.",
  "Well, so far, yes, unless they can give -­",
  "I'm having a problem. I thought as you argued in your brief that you were only arguing that States can tax-exempt, but you are asking us to rule more broadly to say that States can treat -­ impose taxes differently.",
  "So it doesn't really matter that it's a tax exemption; you are just saying if the tax is a positive imposition or a negative one, taking someone out, it doesn't matter.",
  "So give me a definition of discriminate. Give me your working -- it can't -- as I started to ask your adversary, it can't be most favored taxpayer status. True?",
  "So what constitutes an adequate justification?",
  "Well -­",
  "Stop. You are going to grant an exemption; you are going to treat someone differently because you are favoring them for a reason. People don't -- States don't do these willy-nilly. Either some enterprises or some individuals, like the 85-year-old widow, you are sympathetic to her. You want to encourage your water transport, because it's an industry that is nascent in your State and you want it to grow, so it's a pro-competition reason. Are those legitimate? And if those are -­",
  "-- what isn't?",
  "Give me a working principle. What does -- how do you define legitimate and illegitimate, assuming -­",
  "The government reason is always going to be premised on wanting to favor someone for a reason.",
  "That is the problem because there were two objectives. One was to promote equality with local businesses and the other to promote equality -­",
  "Right.",
  "But that doesn't answer, I don't think, Justice Ginsberg's question, which is: This appears to be an exception to a generalized non-gender based requirement. Couples, male or female, and fathers, unmarried fathers, are subject to five years. Only unmarried mothers get the largesse of one year. Why isn't -- why shouldn't everybody just be put to the broader category rather than extending a largesse to a greater number of people?",
  "So doesn't the 5-year residency requirement address that? If we apply it generally, wouldn't the 5-year residency requirement honor Congress's concern about there being a substantial tie to the States?",
  "Intermediate scrutiny and -- is not without some deference.",
  "Unless we apply strict scrutiny, which no one is arguing for, the question is, is it rational basis deference or is it some intermediate scrutiny, correct?",
  "Well, but you can't really mean that because we can put up a hypothetical that is very simple and then you'll explain to me why a U.S. citizen should be burdened in this way and the hypothetical is, let's assume Congress determines that there are too many foreign-born children of U.S. citizens coming into the United States, and that those foreign-born children, those born of women are placing a greater burden on our economic system. They need more care for reasons that Congress determines analytically or statistically. They are spending more money -- more government money. And Congress passes a rule that says, only the foreign-born children of men can come into the country, not of women. Wouldn't that be a rational basis?",
  "There is a facially legitimate bona fide reason.",
  "What's arbitrary about a government saying, I want to spend less money on a new citizen?",
  "Is that the rational basis plus test you are talking about?",
  "So now we're going to just continue sort of tweaking the definitions and creating more variations on our review standard?",
  "It's hard here because both the father -- this father, but many fathers and mothers are actually U.S. citizens who want to bring their children over as U.S. citizens. So, if the father was making the claim here, you would still argue it was a rational basis test even though he's a U.S. citizen and entitled to all the protections of the Constitution?",
  "Would Rule 35 permit a challenge for a Federal violation? You've given an example of an illegal sentence that you think is discretionary; am I correct?",
  "But does Rule 35(a) permit a legal challenge of the kind that Justice Kagan was asking?",
  "All right. Let's assume a pure legal challenge.",
  "Would Rule 35(a) be other collateral relief -­",
  "-- as designated by the statute?",
  "So explain again why you don't think this is collateral?",
  "No, no, no. Why is Rule 35, assuming it's a -- a challenge to an illegal sentence on a legal ground -­",
  "Why would it not be collateral review?",
  "And if there's no justification, what do they do?",
  "Do you quarrel with a statement in Mollicone, a Rhode Island 2000 decision that says we will interfere with the trial court's discretion, vis-à-vis sentencing, only in rare instances where the trial justice has imposed a sentence that is without justification and is grossly disparate from the other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses?",
  "Is that the review standard?",
  "That is the standard of review, correct?",
  "So please explain to me why that is not what Justice Kennedy described as a review for abuse of discretion and why a review for abuse of discretion is not a legal challenge?",
  "I'm sorry. Am I misunderstanding you?",
  "Are you saying that the Rhode Island appellate courts never change a sentence under Rule 35?",
  "Or are you saying that they do find some lack of justification in some sentences?",
  "So a petitioner in the future in Rhode Island should file a petition that says: I'm filing a motion pursuant to 35(a) for an illegal sentence -- make something up -­",
  "-- or for leniency. And then are district courts supposed to figure out whether the legal challenge was frivolous or not or had a basis in law or fact -­",
  "-- and then decide whether they would toll or not toll based on that now side trial on what's an illegal sentence and what's just a plea for leniency? That's what you are proposing?",
  "So what if they say \"correct the illegal sentence because it was an abuse of discretion\"?",
  "So is the magic words \"illegal sentence\" or is the magic words \"abuse of\" -­ what are the magic words?",
  "I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand that. There's nothing in this rule that bars a litigant from filing after the conviction is final. They have 120 days.",
  "I -- your adversary said the contrary, and I was -- you're flip-flopping. Can this be brought on a direct appeal or not?",
  "A non-legal sentence?",
  "So what did you mean when you answered the Chief Justice that it could be brought in collateral proceedings?",
  "That's -­",
  "Just so your adversary, when he gets up on rebuttal, can confirm or not this point, any challenge to an illegal sentence has to be brought first in a Rule 35(a) motion, regardless of what the grounds of the illegality are?",
  "There seems to be some confusion. Judgment is rendered before this motion is made. There's a conviction and there's a sentence, right?",
  "So there's a judgment rendered. That's different from whether the judgment is final in a Federal sense. It's final as far as the State is concerned, because the judgment was rendered, correct?",
  "But if there's no appeal, it was final the day it was rendered.",
  "As far as the State is concerned. If there is an appeal, then it may undo that, correct?",
  "So there is a judgment, and this is always post-judgment.",
  "I'm sorry, I -- you were speaking so fast, I didn't follow you.",
  "Perhaps we can go back to the simple question, which is, can a defendant who has been sentenced bring a challenge to a sentence in a direct appeal or not? Or do they have to go by Rule 35(a)?",
  "All right. So now we get to the point where some can go under 35(a) but some can't.",
  "So they should go on direct appeal, correct?",
  "I'm totally confused. If this is part of the criminal proceeding, which is your position, that it's not collateral, but it's part of the proceedings, when does this proceeding become final?",
  "That -- that truly -- because -- you're -- you're -­",
  "But if the Rhode Island court has told litigants that they can't challenge some portions of an illegal sentence except by way of Rule 35, how can we call the decision on the affirmance of the conviction a final determination of the legality of the sentence? That's contradictory.",
  "Well, but that's not -­ that's not what the -- what it says. It talks about a judgment. And a judgment in -- in other terms is usually the conviction and the sentence. Rhode Island for its own reasons has separated the two, but -­",
  "So basically you're taking the position or you're conceding that the California courts are not consistent in their application of the timeliness rule?",
  "Your brief doesn't even try to defend that position. Are you conceding that there is inconsistent application of the rule?",
  "Well -- I might be speaking for her, but I thought that the Habeas Corpus Resource Center brief showed that the court, the California court, did reach some cases where an explanation had not been proffered. And so it can't be just a simple rule, that if you don't proffer an explanation, you won't get heard. So what's the next step in that? Why do they reach some and not others?",
  "How could it be complex when there's no justification offered?",
  "Well, they pointed to a certain number of cases that were 5 years or above in delay where no justification was offered, and in some they reached the merits and in others they applied a procedural bar. So how is that consistent?",
  "So how do we know that the California court just thinks that the Federal question is too hard and it doesn't want to reach it? It may be meritorious. How do we know they're not applying the decision to reach the merits on an arbitrary and capricious basis or one that seeks to avoid hard Federal questions?",
  "The claims here -­",
  "I'm -- I'm a little bit confused by your response to Justice Scalia. I thought from your brief that you were positing that there was no claim of inconsistent application of a rule that could ever survive. Let's assume for the sake of argument the following hypothetical, and probably not far off the mark. Litigants who don't know the law, who claim they're not educated in it, say that they have just learned about a new California case that gives them a ground to challenge their prior sentence. And the litigants learn about the case anywhere between 3 and 6 months of the issuance of the case by the supreme court. A dozen litigants apply for this discretionary review, and half of them are granted review and half are not. Half of them get a correction of the sentence and half of them don't. There is no difference between them that's discernible. They each just claim ignorance. Is that a case where someone would be out of luck, and why, for a claim of inconsistent application?",
  "Getting time-barred. Some are time-barred; some -­",
  "Exactly.",
  "No. Some -- all of them are within that small framework of 3 to 6 months from the time the supreme court decision was issued. They all claimed they just learned of it and filed immediately, and some are getting relief and some are not. Is that an inconsistent application that would be cognizable under your view of the rule as it should be?",
  "It does. So the question -­",
  "I'm sorry. What?",
  "Well, that's the issue.",
  "Which is: What rule do you want us to impose and how does that rule capture that case?",
  "You're not answering my question.",
  "But it doesn't answer why inconsistent application among similarly situated individuals should not provide an avenue of relief.",
  "Five years is different. I'm talking about treatment of similarly situated individuals differently.",
  "Oh, I don't disagree with you. So that the question I have for your adversary is whether or not he can point to any case where a litigant who proffered an -- something that was evident on the trial record and on the appellate record was ever granted a merits review after 5 years. Because I don't see them proffering any case that shows that. But -- and I think that may be your argument.",
  "Well, but what did you present below, or what has Habeas Corpus Resource Center presented? A case with a 5-year delay where the claimed errors are apparent on the trial record and the appellate record, and no justification for the delay is proffered. Those are the three seminal facts that go to the requirements of Robbins and the other supreme court -- other California Supreme Court cases. Do you have one case that's similar where the court went to the merits?",
  "No. Was that someone who made a claim based on the trial and appellate record with no justification?",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "So is the solution for California to say, if you delay more than a year from when you should have known, you're barred except we'll excuse it for any number of reasons?",
  "That would be a regularly and consistently applied rule in your mind?",
  "That would be enough?",
  "And pro se litigants who don't know deadlines generally are going to live with knowing that -- what?",
  "Excuse me. Could you tell me -- from your briefs, I just haven't understood what the alternative steps are. The court below talked about some proposals like construction and said the legislature has struck them down. There's -- the fiscal crisis has gotten worse, so construction is really not an option. I don't see how you wait for an option that doesn't exist. They talked about hiring more staff, but the conclusion was that even if you maximize the staff, you don't have the facilities to add more staff, which is what you need to cure the constitutional violation. So tell me what specific steps outside of this order should have been given time to be implemented, because the receiver has basically said: I've tried, and the small progress we made has been reversed because the population just keeps growing, so we can never get ahead of the problem.",
  "So slow down from the rhetoric and give me concrete -­",
  "-- details about what the least restricted means would have been, other than to say, throw it back to a receiver and special master who are saying we don't have a solution outside of reducing overcrowding.",
  "Oh, counsel, that was one statement years ago. If that's all you're relying on -­",
  "That may be your weakest argument. Tell me -- give me concrete steps that are least -- less restrictive.",
  "So you go back to that panel because it invited you to. It said if circumstances change, come back.",
  "So it's possible that within the 2-year period, you're going to hit the mark if you -- that's what the lower court's -­",
  "That's what the three-judge panel said, which is: If you implement most of the proposals being made, you are likely to hit the mark. So what you're saying is you're going to do it. And if you don't, they invited you to come back and -­ you really don't think that if you hit 140 percentage, that the court is going to order an immediate release of the 2.5 percent over the limit it set? It's going to ask you: What have you put into place to reach that level over what additional period of time?",
  "So what are we fighting about? Are we fighting about that the plan was wrong, or are we fighting about that you're angry that you were told to do it in 2 years -- in 22 years, as opposed to do it in 25 years? Is that -- is that what you're objecting to?",
  "Can -- can you do it in 5 years?",
  "Well, the best interest of the State of California, isn't it to deliver adequate constitutional care to the people that it incarcerates? That's a constitutional obligation.",
  "So when are you going to get to that? When are you going to avoid the needless deaths that were reported in this record? When are you going to avoid or get around people sitting in their feces for days in a dazed state? When are you going to get to a point where you're going to deliver care that is going to be adequate?",
  "Counsel, did you -­",
  "Counsel, this issue about evidence -- did you proffer to the judge anywhere in this record what the additional evidence it was that you wanted to show? I know that the decrease in suicides happened post-trial, so you couldn't have proffered that pretrial.",
  "But you run the prisons. I presume that you could have yourself without discovery set forth a proffer for the court that says: We had a wait time between diagnosis and treatment that was 60 days, 90 days, 120 days in the past, and we've reduced that down now to 2 weeks or whatever the reality is.",
  "Why don't you -- you keep saying we were blocked.",
  "Except that the district court invited you to proffer that evidence that went to the appropriateness of the remedy. So you didn't have to proffer it -- it viewed you as saying, we're no longer violating, constitutionally violating the Eighth Amendment. Instead, it said: We'll take whatever you have to proffer to show that the remedy is inappropriate.",
  "When does -- well, we'll get back to Justice Kennedy's -­",
  "Are you talking about current figures or past? Tell us the date of the figures.",
  "That's what I thought. How do you address your adversary's point -­",
  "-- that the adequacy of a remedy can't be measured unless you measure the state of the situation at the time the remedy is imposed?",
  "Could you give us the record -­",
  "Counsel -­",
  "Counsel -­",

  "Counsel -­",
  "Counsel, didn't -­",
  "Counsel -­",

  "-- of reducing the population -­",
  "-- and said we're not imposing them because we want the State to do -- to choose among them?",
  "As I've looked at the State's final plan, I thought that they had in fact not only accepted all of the recommendations, but they added a couple of additional remedies that the court had not suggested.",
  "Is it a fair statement that the district -- that the three-judge panel was saying, if you do these things -- that's their finding -- you can do it without affecting public safety? Wasn't that what they were saying?",
  "The second and more important question is going back to something that Justice Scalia asked you, which was: You made the statement that no one was stopped from proffering evidence about prison conditions -­",
  "-- up till 2 months before the trial. So what evidence was excluded?",
  "What point is the other side making that they were excluded from making?",
  "Did the expert who gave -­",
  "The expert who gave the 145?",
  "The expert who gave the",
  "Let's go to the one who has used the 145 figure.",
  "He was a what?",
  "And did he say that at 145 you could deliver health care safely?",
  "So should the court have said 2 years for everything but construction? Wouldn't that have been a more narrowly tailored remedy?",
  "Except that they -­",
  "-- there was going to be no construction adequate, because there was no money.",
  "I'm sorry. What page was that?",
  "I'm sorry -­",
  "I don't know what the declaration said. Is the actual declaration in the record somewhere?",
  "All right.",
  "So why didn't you give the court that as your plan? The court gave you absolute discretion to implement the plan that you wanted; it said we don't want to do facility by facility, because we want you to figure out where you need to implement. So, your plan didn't do that; why? Either in your 5-year plan or in your 2-year plan.",
  "But there was a proposal to amend 2 -­",
  "And there was a conscious decision by Congress not to do 2 to conform to Crooker more generally, but to only pass 7. So there has to be a meaning to the decision to limit the amendment.",
  "Counsel, in Rose we talked about a legitimate public purpose in seeking information. I tie my question to Justice Alito's, which is at what point does -- is it legitimate for the public to seek information, internal information, relating to the rules and practices of personnel? Can the public seek information that places the community at a severe security risk? Is it possible for us to say that that kind of information, given our line of reasoning in Rose, could not be legitimate public information?",
  "Could you tell me what the textual basing for Crooker's \"predominantly internal\" and \"circumvention of agency regulation\" requirements is? Where in the text are those words, and how do you create them except through sort of judicial crafting?",
  "The problem with that in this case is that it's a mixed document. It is predominantly for internal use, but not exclusively.",
  "So how do you square that with the words \"related solely to internal\"?",
  "Well, the case summaries there were internal solely. They were created only for purposes of the agency's honor code review or discipline review.",
  "And yet we ordered it disclosed. We created an exception to the -­",
  "-- plain language of the rule, it seems to me.",
  "Oh, I agree.",
  "But I think the distinction it made was that it's only internal rules and practices of the agency, a personnel agency, if the public has no legitimate interest in it.",
  "Well, that begs, I think, Justice Scalia's question. One could argue that everything that the agency develops except rules telling the public how to come to the agency with a complaint, et cetera -- virtually everything will govern either the internal personnel practices or the agency's practices vis-à-vis the public.",
  "Counsel -­",
  "So, basically, anything that the agency uses to craft its internal employee practices and rules gets swept up as private, as internal?",
  "If -- if --",
  "So you are taking out the records related to personnel and not making it a condition of the disclosure. You're saying if any document circumvents the agency's functioning, that's exempted.",
  "You're not tying -­ that's where I'm confused.",
  "So, how does -­",
  "How do the documents that the agency reviews to determine and craft its internal rules and practices fall under the rubric of being related to, solely related to, personnel practices and rules? If they were created separately, if they were created for multiple purposes, if they were -­",
  "-- used in different circumstances besides the relationship of employees to others -­",
  "The map doesn't. You use the map to do the latter things.",
  "Do you see -­",
  "I'm sorry. I'm cutting you off because your light is on. Do you see any difference between the position you're taking and Crooker?",
  "You formulate your test very differently than Crooker does. What are those differences?",
  "Well, why is that true? If they're separate corporate entities, what legal rule would stop a separate corporate entity from suing another? Is there a -- if they're part of the same company, I think that's a different issue. If they are the same company, that's a different issue, and just a different branch or a different office.",
  "Counsel, I'm -- I'm not quite sure what the premise of your argument is. You seem to be arguing that the independence of the State agency is what makes this particular entity capable of suing. Yet, in your brief, you rely on Verizon's simple test, which says if you're asserting a Federal claim, you can sue and you're not -- and you're looking for prospective injunctive relief, you can sue the State. That general rule wouldn't look at who's suing. That was part of your argument. Yet, now you're arguing the independence of the agency. Which is your position?",
  "And if it is the one about the State's independence, how do you articulate why that becomes important or not? What's the legal significance of that vis-à-vis this case and any ones moving forward?",
  "Counsel, following up on Justice Scalia's question to you, his question in fact is in part what happened here. Virginia at some point did require every State agency to seek the permission of its attorney general, is it, to sue? And the government said that's not independent enough, and if you want the money, you've got to make VOPA eligible to sue without that permission; is that correct?",
  "Could you be a little bit more specific for me on what you mean about an Article III problem? Justice Kennedy was concerned about State attorney generals willy-nilly suing -- or not willy-nilly -- suing governors to comply with Federal law. Why do you think it won't happen, and what are the legal impediments to that occurring?",
  "I'm sorry. I -- I think there are concepts being confused. There's no question that it hasn't waived sovereign immunity. VOPA doesn't claim that. And this is not a direct suit against the State; it's a suit against a State official. And the entire premise of Ex parte Young is that this doesn't offend sovereign immunity for a party to seek enforcement, prospectively, of a Federal right. So I don't know why it really matters who the plaintiff is so long as the sovereign interests that we've recognized, that the issue of sovereignty is one that respects a State's coffers and State's laws and we're not going to interfere with any of them, but we are going to ensure that, because of the pre-emptive effect of the Constitution and our laws, that Federal laws are respected. So what's in this case the intrusion on State sovereignty when the State knew and consented consciously to letting VOPA sue for records when it needed to?",
  "The State should have expected that.",
  "It hasn't happened. Why do you think? Don't you think it hasn't happened because there are so many practical political restraints on that kind of activity? What would happen, I think, in that State where there was a rogue attorney general is somebody would win; the governor would win by getting a legislative act that says it can't be done, or the attorney general will win because the political sentiments are so strong in his or her favor that the suit is actually welcomed by the population. So where's the intrusion on sovereignty? States do what they want. The only issue is how do we protect Federal rights.",
  "I'm not sure that -­ what you're forgetting is that Virginia took a lot of money to set up and get the benefits of Federal funds by creating an independent agency. It had expressed its desire to control the agency more, and it was told very directly: You can't. You have to let that agency sue. What I don't understand is why you think that it's a greater affront to sovereignty that the suit is here as opposed to State court. The State has already said: We're going to take your money, and this is what we're going to permit -­",
  "-- a suit.",
  "But we use -- we don't bring the State in; we bring a State official who is violating a Federal law.",
  "Counsel -- I'm sorry.",
  "I'm -- I'm not sure why Congress would have actually known the difference that we established in Bowles, because when it passed this statute, it was before Bowles, wasn't it?",
  "So what to read of its knowledge of Bowles, whether it meant jurisdiction or not, is -- is a bit of a fiction, isn't it?",
  "So what's the rule? Justice Scalia said Bowles seemed to establish a sensible, clear rule, which is if Congress uses the word \"notice of appeal,\" it intends a jurisdictional restriction.",
  "That appears to be the rule that Justice Scalia articulated. What would be your rule or test now to determine Congress's purpose? What -- what of our cases would you point to that establish a different rule?",
  "I'm not sure what that distinction is. I'm sorry. It -­",
  "But what we went on was the word \"notice of appeal\" in Bowles, with -- within a historical context.",
  "So it's only -­",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "But that's court to court. Do you have any case, at the time or before the statute was passed, that ever held that a statutory deadline from an agency to a court of appeal was jurisdictional in the sense of Bowles?",
  "Well after.",
  "But those had different language. They used \"barred\" language rather than \"filing\" language. Most of those.",
  "Counsel -­",
  "Counsel, I'm -- I'm a little confused.",
  "I thought that the entire premise of Booker was that judges should have full discretion under 3553 to balance the factors that are required by the statute to be balanced and to come to what they believe is the appropriate sentence. If we impose, in a resentencing, in a remand order that has vacated a prior sentence, a limitation on that power, don't we in turn do exactly what you're arguing in your first half of your appeal, which is unconstitutionally tie the hands of the judge? I think that was what Justice -- the Chief Justice was getting to in his first question.",
  "So why isn't a new sentence just that: A new sentence? And the judge, whoever the judge is, can do what they're supposed to do, which is to look at all of the factors and weigh them as that judge believes is appropriate, assuming the remand order is not a limited order.",
  "And as far as you're concerned, Justice Alito's question about post- -­ post-sentencing criminal conduct couldn't be considered by a court, either?",
  "Because it wasn't a factor mentioned in the original sentence, so you would apply the rule equally to -­",
  "Is there any logic to that? I mean, I know that when I was a district court judge, routinely post-sentencing criminal conduct would make me wonder whether this person really was worthy of a lower sentence or not, or of whatever largesse I may have given him or her in original sentence. What makes sense about that?",
  "I -- when this provision was passed, Congress was worried, I thought, about the situations where district court judges' hands -- were on appeal told you can't use this ground for departure, and often the court, because they thought the original sentence they gave was fair, would then articulate another ground for departure that they hadn't earlier. But didn't all of that go out of the window with Booker? I mean, the presumption in -- that drove Congress was that the guidelines were mandatory. Once Booker said they weren't, why should we be limiting Congress -- a judge's discretion ab initio or post hoc to giving what they believe is a reasonable sentence?",
  "How many of those statutes are left that we -- that the Court hasn't looked at?",
  "Which are the three?",

  "-- a whole series of prima facie elements.",
  "Counsel, is -- who's the violator alleged here? Not in the complaint, but in the briefs? As I read the briefs, they claim that Janus itself did not make the false statement, that the two appellants did, that they are the actual speakers because they were talking about their activities, and they used Janus as a conduit to deceive the market. That's, I think, what they're alleging.",
  "So how do we sustain the intermediary cases when the company, through market analysts, divulges misleading statements? We don't talk about the market analysts' falsity; we talk about the company's falsity, because the market analysts didn't have scienter.",
  "But what's the difference between an omission or a commission if a company purposely divulges a falsehood to an analyst, knowing it's going to be distributed in toto? So who's making the false statement, the analyst or the company?",
  "So why isn't -- why aren't the two appellants, on their theory, on -- we can talk about whether the complaint does or does not adequately allege their theory. That's a different issue. I accept that. But under their theory, why isn't the appellants the primary violator, not even a secondary? Because they -- they claim, I think -- and I'm going to find out from them -- that Janus had no scienter, that it didn't make the false statements, that all of this was done in secret by the appellants, so they were the only violator.",
  "Do you mean to say to me that puppets become a legal defense for someone who intentionally manipulates the market information?",
  "That's the control person statute?",
  "But I -- but if Janus had no scienter, if its board of directors did not know that the statements were false, they had no way of knowing, because as I understand the complaint -- and this is alleged -- the deal was secret. So Janus itself could not be a primary violator. Who is?",
  "Even though there was no scheme with another actor? Even though it was the only violator, which is a -­",
  "-- fair reading of the complaint.",
  "Except that I, as I read your brief -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong -- you were arguing that because there was an independent board of directors, presumably because there are two corporate -- different corporate funds -- two different corporate forms, that there couldn't be control person liability under 20(a). You seem -- that -- I thought, reading your brief, that's what you were alleging. So you can't have your cake and eat it, too. Either the independence of the board makes no difference or it does. So which is your position?",
  "Under what theory would you defend an allegation that the investment manager who had control over the everyday affairs of the company, drafted or helped draft the prospectus, hired the lawyers who helped draft it, wouldn't be a control person? How would you defend that?",
  "Exactly. So you -­ you're -- if they can't be control persons because they're separate companies, then how do they escape being primary violators?",
  "But it's not in this case, because the allegation is that it -- not the company, that it chose to deceive the market.",
  "You're -­",
  "You're not suggesting, are you, that they did this for purposes of protecting your client from a lawsuit?",
  "When it -- no, they did it for a business reason, that having separate entities was economically more useful for the market, correct?",

  "Then go back to Justice Breyer's question, because I can see when there's one primary violator who uses another entity as a dupe or as a puppet, but I can't, and I don't know how to, distinguish what you're proposing from aiding and abetting. There has to be something to differentiate the two. So what is it?",
  "Counsel, could you start by taking your brief and distilling it down to three sentences? Define what a primary violator is, what a secondary violator is who aids and abets, and who a control person is? And then tell me how that definition would exclude lawyers, auditors, investment -- general investment advisers, et cetera. I've read your brief, but I've been trying to distill it down to three sentences. So try to do that for me.",
  "Give me an example of that. What do you see as all of the elements?",
  "I understand. But -­",
  "And that becomes -- how is that different from aiding and abetting the making of a statement?",
  "But that's every lawyer -­ MR. GANNON -- or indirectly.",
  "-- who writes the false statement knowing it's false. So, are you saying that every lawyer who writes the statement knowing it's false is a primary violator?",

  "Could I -- could I -­",
  "-- just -- just focus the questioning? Because we keep talking about whether the APA-type definition of licensing is what Congress intended or not, but you don't disagree that Congress at least intended that if someone violated the Federal law and hired illegal aliens and was -- undocumented aliens and was found to have violated it, that the State can revoke their license, correct?",
  "-- to do business?",
  "So it really doesn't matter whether they're revoking their right to do business in the State. And they can only revoke their charter or their articles of incorporation if they're -­ if they were filed in that State. They wouldn't have power to revoke a Delaware -­",
  "All right. So it's stopping them from doing business. So really the only conflict you're talking about is not the power to stop them from doing business, because you accept that this saving clause gives them the power to do that, to revoke the right to do business; what you're talking about is a conflict in the adjudication of that issue.",
  "Is that correct?",
  "All right. So I'm -­ you know, how they define \"license\" or not is irrelevant to me. Walk me through whether -- what expressly pre-empts that adjudication right -­",
  "-- or what implicitly pre-empts that adjudication right.",
  "Because that is, for me, what the center of this question is.",
  "But this is -- it can't be uniformity of sanction, because the court permitted licensing sanctions.",
  "So let's go back to my question of adjudication. What you're saying is what's specifically pre-empted is the right to adjudicate -­",
  "-- whether someone has hired undocumented aliens, correct?",
  "Your argument sounds to me like look at the law and see what its purpose is. If the purpose is to regulate undocumented aliens, then it's struck down. If it happens to put its revocation provisions in its licensing law, then it's okay.",
  "It doesn't make much sense -­",
  "The face of the statute talks only about if you hire undocumented aliens, your license is revoked.",
  "But the -- the saving clause says that it's okay. Civil or criminal sanctions other than through licensing and similar laws. So, I mean -­",
  "If we disagree with you, could you answer the question I posed to your adversary, which is what makes the adjudication of status pre-empted?",
  "At the time the statute was passed, there were many, many State laws that adjudicated revocation of licenses. Perhaps not many had addressed the issue of hiring undocumented aliens, but many State laws existed that independently adjudicated revocations. What in the legislative history or in the words of the statute show that Congress intended in any way to limit those adjudications?",
  "I'm -- doesn't it frustrate the congressional intent when the Federal law says that the I-9 can be used for no purpose other than the Federal adjudication of whether a violation has occurred or not? Doesn't it frustrate that law to have the States raise a defense that depends on forcing someone to disclose something that the Federal law protects? I mean, this is a vicious circle. Federal law says you can't do the I-9 for -- you can't use it for any purpose other than the Federal adjudication. Now you're creating a defense that says you have to supply us with something that Federal law otherwise protects from disclosure.",
  "That doesn't answer my point. Doesn't it frustrate Federal law when the Federal law says that I-9 can be used for no purpose other than the Federal adjudication of the status of employees? I think that's -­",
  "So, in answer to Justice Breyer's earlier question, in fact, relying on the I-9 does not provide a safe harbor, because under the E-Verify system, you can't just rely on the I-9 forms and statutes; you have to rely on the E-Verify.",
  "Wouldn't -- wouldn't it be easier, if that's Justice Scalia's concern, to take the Solicitor General's position, that if you're adjudicating good faith or intent differently in any way from the Federal Government, that it's pre-empted? Isn't that what waiting for an as-applied challenge means, whether or not you are putting different requirements on proving good faith?",
  "Well, let -- then let me ask the question directly. If Arizona's system does not permit a employer to rely on non-suspect documents, the I-9 documents that are permitted employers to rely on -­ the Arizona system says, no, you can't rely on those. Is that pre-empted or not? You can't rely on I-9, or the Arizona system says -- on the I-9 documents. Or the Arizona system says you can't hire someone who hasn't been approved under the e-verification system. Is that pre-empted?",
  "So you think the same deference is owed to ANPRs as to the amicus briefs? What is your position on that?",
  "Well, I do think -- I do think, counsel, that that major change doesn't have to be the way you describe it. The difference between either contemporary notice and/or 15-day notice versus 45 is a significant change.",
  "And so it doesn't need to have been precipitated solely by a decision that the old rule, if it's as your adversary advocates it, didn't exist.",
  "What's left of your arguments if we decide that the statute is ambiguous, the official staff commentary is ambiguous? What's left? Is Auer deference then required?",
  "To -- to the amicus brief at least? We can talk about whether the ANPRs or the unofficial commentaries are -- are due deference. But what are we left with if we think there is ambiguity?",
  "So your case rises and falls on whether we believe that the statute is clear?",
  "Well, that's a different question. You're claiming that the Board's regulations supersede whatever deference Auer would otherwise give to amicus briefs?",
  "But wait a minute. These -- these weren't psychics. These were three clinical doctors in this area, one of them you knew poised to go to a society meeting to make this allegation. Doesn't it make a difference who the reports are coming from and what the substance of those reports may do to your product?",
  "But had there -­",
  "Counsel, I -- you got cert granted on a limited question, and the limited question was whether, in a complaint that alleges only adverse reports, can you prove materiality and scienter without proving statistical importance. That's the question presented. Justice Kagan started with the point that the FDA doesn't require that. It requires just reasonable evidence of a connection, not statistical. Many of the amici here have done a wonderful job of explaining why statistical importance can't be a measure because it depends on the nature of the study at issue. So given all of that -- and even in your brief, in a footnote, you answered the question by saying no, we can't establish that rule as an absolute, because there are additional factors that could prove materiality and scienter. So you've already answered the question presented. Are we down to what Justice Scalia asked you, which is: We've got a \"no\" to the question: Are the facts in this case enough? I don't know why we would have granted cert on that, but you presented a different question presented. Given the question presented, is the answer no? And if not, why not?",
  "Can I just interrupt a second?",
  "This wasn't an FDA­ approved drug.",
  "So there weren't any adverse reports in the legal sense of that word.",
  "In the FDA sense. So we're using a misnomer here to start with.",
  "Continue.",
  "How was your -- that long litany of factors that you mentioned a few minutes ago about how a company will go about determining whether an adverse event report is material or not or should be disclosed or not -- are you saying that companies don't have to respond to irrational securities holders? Are you accepting your adversary's proposition that on some level -- you said credible evidence -- that they don't have to respond to things they judge are not credible?",
  "As I was hearing the Solicitor General's argument, he wasn't actually even talking about causation. He was talking about a statement you made about the company poised to double its growth. And I think he was saying that on the basis of what you had heard up until that time, you had to have known that that statement was misleading, as was the statement that this drug -- that there was absolutely no proof or connection of causation, which was your scientific panel said you couldn't make that extreme statement.",
  "Well, that's the essence -- that's the essence of the argument before us. The depletion was the amount of water that was taken from this water source to irrigate the crops. The -- the issue now before us is whether beneficial use means consumption or it means use, isn't it? I -- you're begging the question in my mind, because I don't -- what source do you have for the fact that a return flow is beneficial use?",
  "That's not actually true. Their water right was the beneficial use that your pre-1950 consumers used, meaning you had consumers who were irrigating their own crops, who were doing other things with the water. The rights protected are their pre-1950 uses. You're putting -- you're -- you're still equating consumption as -- as being their use, but I don't know where you get that equation from.",
  "As use.",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "Could someone pre-1950 who irrigated crops change the crops?",
  "How in the world do any States monitor that? The change in crops, the change in irrigation methods, the change in anything that would cause a difference in return flow? Let's assume global warming in some form or another evaporated more water, and so some crop area did some solar heating that caused a greater evaporation. Is that a breach of the compact? So two questions embedded in there. How does any State monitor that, the change in crops or change in irrigation methods? And, second, how far does it go in terms of the pre-1950s right to use their water?",
  "So really -- I'm sorry. The issue is, are both of you -- both of you have pre­ and post-1950 users?",
  "All right. And I -- I guess this goes to the second question, which was sort of not really addressed. The Special Master said, well, you could cut back your post-1950 users and satisfy all of the needs of your pre-1950 users. Why isn't that the answer? Why isn't that an answer that should be respected, because you can satisfy all of the pre-1950 needs that you have potentially?",
  "Before any 1950 use? Post-1950 users are permitted?",
  "So why isn't this a premature lawsuit? Because I think really the essence of your claim is we need the pre-1950 water flow. We don't care who it comes from. And what -- all the Special Master said, in my mind, was the difference -­ you can't look to what the pre-1950s were doing in this situation, but I haven't addressed what the posts are going to do or have been doing and whether that's right, and that's depriving you of the water flow. I don't know if he answered that question. Are you, in fact, entitled to a minimum amount of water flow? That's really what should be the point of the issue, isn't it?",
  "I thought -­",
  "Excuse me -­",
  "Counsel, could I -­",
  "Could you answer -- do you see a difference? Finish that, and then could I just clarify something from what you were just reading?",
  "Counsel, could I go back to my question, which is twofold? The first is the Solicitor General recommends that we defer the decision on remedies in this case, and Montana seems to agree. Do you agree as well? The second question presented.",
  "It has? My problem with this is -- and I think I need to understand what the fight is about here, or what the dispute is about -- it really does seem to me that it is a question of remedies, not about whether you're taking more water rights through irrigation or not. If I understand this compact right, both of you are protected in your pre-1950 beneficial uses. Each of you appear, under the terms of article V, to be entitled to get enough water to fill those uses. The next section, the one that you read earlier, lets you use things in the future for post-1950 uses, but only if the water supply's protected pre-1950 beneficial uses have received all they're entitled to. Neither of you are entitled or -- to take anything post-1950 until pre-1950 is protected. That's how I read article V. Am I reading it wrong? Because it seems to me that the only time that we get into a dispute -- and this is the part that I think your adversary may be right about, ultimately -­ is it's not a consumptive compact, but it's a use compact, and both of you are entitled to get a full -­ that's what I'm reading article V to say, to get enough water to satisfy the beneficial uses before anybody's entitled to post-1950 water. Tell me what in the language of article V suggests something different than that understanding.",
  "But this is not happening today, is it? There's -­",
  "All right, but that's an isolated year.",
  "In most years, are you putting water to post-1950 use -- to post-1950 uses or not? Have you been regularly putting water to post-1950 uses?",
  "I don't disagree.",
  "I don't disagree, but as I read the article, it says, you put all the water that's available to pre-1950 appropriated uses. You then go, as I read the second part of this article, to any water supplies that each State has until you fulfill those 1950 appropriated uses. And then it apportions, between the two of you, post-1950 percentages of the excess water that you're entitled to have. Am I correct about that structure?",
  "Exactly.",
  "But that's why -- I do understand the remedies were deferred, but to the extent that we were to rule that appropriated rights included the right to change irrigation methods or crops -- we don't have to reach crops, because that's not at issue here -- in the end, you're only entitled to take the appropriated uses, including irrigation rights, that existed pre-1950. Are they entitled to get as much water as necessary to satisfy their pre-1950 rights or not -­",
  "-- before you can use post-1950 water?",
  "But how -- why aren't you taking more of the percentage that way of post-1950 waters? The compact says, post-1950, you can take whatever percentage it was. I've forgotten what percentage that might have been.",
  "Whatever it was. 60 percent -­",
  "They're entitled to 40. Does that mean you can take a hundred percent, because there happens to be more water that they can satisfy the pre-1950s users with? Why aren't they entitled to their 40 percent of whatever that big basin is so they can give more water to post-1950 users, that they can exploit their full 40 percent?",
  "Yes, I understand that.",
  "Well, I -- I'm answering this only -- I'm asking this because I know we've deferred decision on the remedies -­",
  "-- but for me that is so integral to the issue here because when they talk about being entitled to a water flow, I see that as being entitled to a pre-1950 satisfaction of water needs or beneficial uses before anybody gets post-1950 water. And so, I see the only issue before us, because remedies have been put aside, as to whether the beneficial use includes some percentage increase because of irrigation demands, but so what? It just means it's going to limit post-1950 users. It's not going to limit the rights of the pre-1950 users. Everybody's entitled to change their irrigation methods. Everybody's entitled to change their crops. They appear not to be entitled to put the water to a new use, whatever -- however that's defined. We don't need to get there today, but I'm not sure how you're entitled to post-1950 uses while they're still not satisfied in 1950 use.",
  "The question is what?",
  "Could you -- but your brief, before we entered that order, said the Special Master was right, that they have to satisfy their needs from pre -- post-1950 users. Why? Aren't they entitled to their 40 percent of how much excess water there may be after their pre-1950 users have been satisfied in full? Doesn't this compact say both of their pre-1950 users have to be satisfied first?",
  "How many years has there been not enough water to fill all pre-19 -- forget about whether there was post-1950 use. How many years are we talking about in which there has been not enough water to fill everybody's?",
  "Excuse me, counselor -­ counselor, going back to -­",

  "What is -­",
  "So it really, to you -­ are you saying that Justice Breyer's hypothetical creates jurisdiction, that the mere sale to a distributor anywhere creates jurisdiction, wherever that distributor is marketing the manufacturer's product? I thought because, in the hypothetical he created, it was they were availing themselves of the U.S. market because they were marketing. They went to seven trade shows. They did merely -- they did something more than the sale. So where's your -- what's your position?",
  "Could you answer -­",
  "I'm sorry. Could you -­ just one quick point of clarification.",
  "It's a point that your adversary raised in passing. I'm not quite sure, do you sell outright to the American company? Do you ship a product and they pay you, or they only pay you when they receive the money from their customer? There appears to be some suggestion of the latter.",
  "But that's a different question than I asked. There was no consignment on this machine?",
  "But you're not claiming that there might not be on others?",
  "Ms. Peddie, let's assume that you're right, that on some level that some -- that it's not just the place of incorporation or the principal place of business, that it could be created by something more. The only something more here is Goodyear USA, so your adversary is right that what you're asking us to do is sort of a reverse principal-agent. You're saying that the subsidiary has used the principal, its owner, as its agent. That's really -- that's the core problem with your argument, isn't it?",
  "Because without the Goodyear USA activities, there's no other activity by the foreign corporations.",
  "Does -- do any of these companies, the Goodyear Turkey Company, the others -- do any of them sell the tires directly to Goodyear USA for distribution to the United States? As I understand it, these tires were sold to other entities, foreign entities, who then sold them to the U.S.",
  "I'm not sure that that answered -- I understood you to be saying that, substantively, they might not be liable for the defect that caused the accident. Is that it?",
  "Counsel, do you know if Indiana has an enhancement for convictions, sentencing enhancement of any kind, for convictions that have an element of -- of risk of harm to others?",
  "So it's possible that there is a -- there's a use of the difference between the two categories that might not be implicated in this case but may lay the foundation for an enhancement later?",
  "In your brief, you take issue with the Government's definition of \"aggressive,\" but would you give us yours?",
  "How would you define it and on what basis?",
  "Counsel, have you done or looked at -- not every burglary has a risk of harm to another or results in harm to another. The general definition of burglary is entering without permission and intent to commit a crime, and generically the crime doesn't have to be physical injury to others.",
  "Yet, ACCA defines burglary as a qualifying crime of violence. It's measuring risk, not by the elements of that crime, but by something else, by some measure of incidents in which violence might occur. So how is that different than the Government's argument here and the question that Justice Breyer asked you, which was: It is true, potentially there's some forms of fleeing that might not pose a risk of injury, but statistically there's a large number of incidents in which violence follows. So, how is that different than burglary? That's really my question. What -- it can't be that the elements have to pose a risk of injury, because burglary doesn't do that. So, what -- how do we measure it?",
  "So if you're not doing that, that's my question: Where do we draw the line?",
  "Where do we draw the line?",
  "I think that was what Justice Breyer was trying to ask you earlier, which is: When do we say that, as in burglary, that some risk is more likely to follow than not in a particular type of crime?",
  "That ignores the in-kind requirement of Begay, because you seem to be confusing the risk of violence with the in-kind inquiry, and that's where I'm trying -- I'd like you to concentrate a little bit on, which is in burglary the defendant is breaking into, generally, a place and going without permission, and -- with an intent to commit a crime. How is that comparable to merely not stopping when a police officer tells you not to stop? How is that an in-kind -­",

  "You can't commit (B) without committing (A) first. (B) has just one additional element, but all of the elements of (A) are part of the elements of (B). So, how can it not be a lesser included?",
  "Could you succinctly tell me how this is any less purposeful, aggressive, or violent than escape from custody? What's your best answer to why this is just not identical to escape, which is a fleeing-from situation just as this is.",
  "Well, here an officer has told you to stop. They're trying to effect custody. And I don't know what the aggression or violence is, other than, you know, breaking a window, doing something. It doesn't require the escape -- that you actually injure someone to get out. It's just that you run away.",

It was simply not answering the door and moving. So if that's all it takes, any police officer will come in and say: In my experience, most drug dealers destroy the evidence when we knock.",

  "But what makes that different than knocking on the door and saying \"Open the door or I'm going to kick it in\"? You're saying that's lawful because until the person submits, you're suggesting there's no coercion in that whatsoever.",
  "So why wouldn't that objectively be bad faith if what we find out is that they now have a tactic which is they go through this building, and every time they smell marijuana, hash, or -- I don't know if crack cocaine smells or not when they're smoking it -- but whenever they smell something, they just do that.",
  "So there's no bad-faith measure whatsoever in your analysis -­",
  "-- and lawfulness is defined by actual physical seizure. So if we have cases that suggest something else, a command to submit, your argument would be lost, correct?",
  "No, no. I -­",
  "Did the trial court make those findings? I know that you said it in your brief, and I thought I read the trial court record. I know they knocked loudly.",
  "But what else did they do?",
  "But what does that have to do with the -- the police officers' lawfulness? Now, I -- I grant you that attempting -- that there is something troubling about the police attempting to coerce entry as opposed to requesting entry, but as my colleagues have pointed out, it's not clear from this record which of the two the police did, in a loud voice or not. You're saying just a loud knock, a scream, \"Police,\" that that would be coercive? That's how I'm reading you.",
  "Or -- or are you going further and trying to say that, as a matter of fact, the testimony's critically clear that they knocked loudly, said \"Police,\" and said \"Let us in or we're going to bust it\"?",
  "On the ground that the court here, the Federal court, decided that there weren't predominant issues based mostly on the fact that, like the Virginia court has now, it's decided that there is no economic loss, what were the differences? What were the differences here? How would the difference in standard play out here?",
  "The -- I'm sorry. I don't mean to cut you off. But you're really arguing that due process requires the same treatment, essentially, of notice and an opportunity to be heard that we are giving to a substantive decision that blocks a future member from pursuing his or her claim, correct?",
  "You're almost treating it as a property right, and -- and you're basically saying we're equating it with, essentially, a property right.",
  "If we disagree with you, because there is a difference of some sort between procedure and substantive rights, then what would command the due process violation in a situation in which the Federal litigation has applied essentially the same standard that the State has and there has been adequate representation on the procedural question, where no substantive right of a plaintiff has been extinguished? That's a lot of conditions, but those are the three conditions of this case. So, what in due process requires that outcome, your outcome?",
  "You're extinguishing a substantive right. If I return to my question of what makes a procedural right substantive -­",
  "Actually not true. The plaintiff here received the same thing. The issue is how much money the lawyers are going to receive, really -­",
  "-- because plaintiff gets their attorney's fees, gets a statutory violation amount, which is going to be the same whether it's in a class action or an individual action, so it's really not the plaintiff who stands to win.",
  "Counsel, under the Anti-Injunction Act, would it permit a blanket injunction that says, against all future State court class proceedings across the United States? Could a court just order a re-litigation bar?",
  "That's my question to you.",
  "So articulate what we're comparing when we're saying that the re-litigation bar can apply to a procedural ruling.",
  "We started a little bit on the question. Is there any requirement that that issue have been fully and fairly adjudicated in the prior proceedings?",
  "All right. Let's take -­",
  "You talked about different standards. Your adversary said that, in this State, reliance doesn't need to be proven. Let's assume that fact. And the district court's ruling here was based on a reliance requirement and said no predominance because each individual plaintiff will have to prove reliance. Does that become the same -- a different standard or not?",
  "I -- I -- I'm posing it as a hypothetical.",
  "As a hypothetical.",
  "You see, the problem is that I don't know how you get and when you get to the question of whether reliance needs to be proven or not, if you're going to bar the State court from reaching that -- that substantive question, not that substantive issue, but that substantive question -­",

  "That's usually what happens with other privileges.",
  "Wait a minute. Where's the obligation of the government to tell you build it this way using the technology we already have? I thought your claim was that you were promised this information, and you structured the contract based on that promise.",
  "There's a factual dispute about that. I think somewhere I read that there is a claim that they told you your weight estimates weren't right.",

And if there's not, then explain to me why it's unfair, given that you're two sophisticated contracting parties, to say you entered a contract knowing the government could invoke state secrets, it has, and so you bear the risk of that. I mean, you always knew the government could do this.",

  "So, what's the constitutional basis?",

  "So, answer the -­",
  "Answer the question. Don't assume.",
  "Can the bankruptcy court adjudicate permissive counterclaims?",
  "And if you posit a no, what's the limiting principle?",
  "Counselor, that sort of begs the question, because I think what I haven't unpackaged -- and I want you to unpackage it with me -­ you're obviously not deprived of a State or Federal trial forum to decide your claim. What you're -- what you're deprived of -­ you can get your judgment. No one's telling you, you can't go to those courts and get a declaration of your rights. What you're being told is you can't get paid on it. But that happens all of the time, either by the vagrancies of the fact that a debtor goes bankrupt and doesn't file in the bankruptcy court or does file and there's been a discharge. What you haven't said to me is what entitles you, outside of equity, and what stops either a State court or a Federal -- a State legislature or congressional legislature from saying, when someone is in bankruptcy, this is the res and these are the people who are entitled to it? It's a separate claim. It's not the State law claim. It may be measured by State law entitlement, but it's a separate claim. Why isn't it just a separate claim?",
  "But that's what you have to become to make that claim, meaning you would need to adjudicate your State law entitlement. You get a judgment saying she defamed you. Then what do you do with that judgment?",
  "That's -- that's my problem, which is if Congress could do that, why can't it do what it did here, which is to say if you -- not to make an equitable claim against the estate. It's not going to be in the amount of your judgment because they're in bankruptcy because they can't pay your judgment. If you want a piece of this, you have to consent to all claims, all compulsory claims -- let's not try to get into the compulsory/permissive category -- to be adjudicated. Otherwise, like with preferences, there's an unfairness that makes this unequitable. You're asking the estate to give you something, but you're not willing to submit in equity to deciding whether there's something you should give the estate back.",
  "Compulsorily. I mean, you know, not -- I'm trying to take the permissive issue out.",
  "Every -- every bankruptcy priority rule extinguishes someone's entitlement to money. The security rules mean the people who have secured interests get paid before unsecured people get paid, and there are insider rules. Equity, as in terms of how the bankruptcy sets up the res, is at the vagrancies of the legislature.",
  "They choose what they're going to permit you to take under what circumstances. So why is it inequitable to -- to force you -- not to -­ to force you, we'll use that word -- to say if you want money from the res, what you trade off is letting the debtor sue you for what you owe.",
  "You don't have a constitutional right to collect your debt. You have a constitutional right to have your claim adjudicated by a court.",
  "You can go to a -- well, once you get the stay lifted at the end of the discharge, you could sue the estate. You may not get a judgment that you can collect after that.",
  "Without a proof of claim?",
  "Counsel, by your theory, you're basically saying that Congress cannot delegate any State law-based claim to which a jury is entitled to the bankruptcy counterclaim at all. So if you have a claim by lawyers for their fees in a defense of malpractice, maybe they can adjudicate that, but they can't adjudicate the malpractice claim. It would be a counterclaim. Correct?",
  "I don't understand that. A private contract is just that. Two parties go into the contract. They set the terms of their deal. No one forced the manufacturers to enter into this deal. So why isn't the issue exactly what the circuit court said: What was the intent of the parties to the contract? You want to make it Congress's intent, but this is a private deal between you. And Congress may have specified some terms to include, but -­",
  "How do you answer the point that, if Congress wanted to make this a pure regulatory statute, it wouldn't have even required a contract? It would have just passed a statute that says anyone who wants to -- to sell to the -- to the States or to the 340B entities -- you can't charge more than this price. Why do we even need a contract, unless inherent with it is some discretion in the agency who's administering it?",
  "Discretion that is consistent with normal contract principles.",
  "Your adversary claims you gave up your argument that the contract doesn't make the manufacturers a third-party intended beneficiary. Have you given up that argument?",
  "Counsel, are you telling me you're taking -- then your -- then your co-counsel is right; you're agreeing with her totally. If Congress wrote the statute, said these are the terms we want to give you in a contract, you figure out how to implement and enforce this, and the Secretary says I don't have the resources to enforce this, I'm going to write a contract that gives the 340B entities a private cause of action, the manufacturers can take it or leave it -­ you're taking the position that the Secretary is without authority to do this?",
  "Well, that begs the question that Justice Alito asked you, which is: If we go your route, which is, is this a regulatory or some sort of other contract, how do we tell the difference, and do we need to go that far? Isn't your position -- I thought half of your -- other half of your position was that this is not a third-party intended beneficiary. All the terms of the contract are between the manufacturer and the Secretary and the obligations to the Secretary, not the obligations to the third parties.",
  "Is there a different -­",
  "You're walking away from your position in the District of Massachusetts? The States do not have, according to you, the right to enforce the rebate program?",
  "An implied cause of action? Is that what you're saying those State suits are?",
  "How is that regulatory scheme any different than the one involving the PPA?",
  "So I understand your position clearly, in a regulatory contract situation like this one the Secretary is without authority to decide he or she can't enforce the statute and to confer expressly by contract third-party beneficiary rights to the -- to the people receiving the benefit? That's the position you're taking? If the Secretary had written a provision into this contract telling 340B entities you can sue, that would have been, according to you, ultra vires?",
  "Can you tell me where -­",
  "Third-party -- I'm sorry.",
  "Counsel -- I'm sorry. I don't understand the distinction that you're ignoring in the law. I thought it was very clear that proof that you merely received the benefit in a -- by a contract is not proof that the parties intended to confer on you an enforceable right; is that correct? Is that the statement of the common law?",
  "No matter how -­",
  "No matter how you want to draw this line, if the issue is what's the objective intent about enforceability, if I look at the PPA, it makes the manufacturer's obligation one-way to the government to provide the pricing information. It gives only the government the right to institute the informal dispute resolution system that the contract specifies. This is not the new law. This is the PPA as it existed at the time. It gives only the Secretary other enforcement rights. What am I missing? Where in the contract is there one provision, one sentence, one anything that requires the manufacturers, other than the price benefit, to do something that could be characterized as enforcement?",
  "Can I ask you a question? I'm not sure I understood your response to Justice Scalia. If there is ambiguity, if a term can be given two meanings, and it's not clear -- and I know you're challenging the clarity question here -- I thought that Congress's intent to have full disclosure would necessarily mean that where there's ambiguity as to the meaning of an exception, then we should change the narrowest meaning.",
  "Counsel, if an individual has been -- individual human being has been investigated by the FBI and a FOIA request is made for records related to that investigation, would the name of the individual not be turned over?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, that's the point. So really your adversary is saying that the same harm that occurs to an individual -- putting aside the difficulty of defining privacy more broadly, but the same harm that occurs to an individual who is disclosed to have been the target of an investigation is an identical privacy right of a corporation, that a corporation has the same negative effects as the individual.",
  "So I think they would concede that privacy might need to be defined differently for corporations. They're simply saying this privacy interest is not.",
  "Well, parts of -- they pled guilty already. So it is hard to imagine how much exponentially more damaging -­",
  "But that presupposes some sort of investigation. So that's public knowledge already.",
  "What would be similar to medical files and such, under Exemption 6, that uses the same phrase, \"unwanted invasion on personal privacy\"? So what would your reading do to Exemption 6, and how would we create or even make sense of Exemption 6?",
  "Why? I mean, if you're saying that personal privacy has some overlap with individual privacy -- obviously, it has to if you're going to give meaning to personal privacy -- don't we have to give meaning to \"and similar files\"? And so what would those be?",
  "Let's assume in this hypothetical -- just that case, TVA. State -- the Federal Government sets the price, and someone's accused of violating that price. Can that defendant come in and say, just as in TVA, that's unconstitutional because prices have to be set by the State? Can the defendant say that, or is that an anti- commandeering claim that you say they're barred from raising?",
  "So my question goes back to one that's been asked before, which is, give me a hypothetical of a defendant who has been convicted where it would be a pure anti- commandeering claim that you say they have no standing for.",
  "Does that analysis differ in any way because this is a treaty power claim versus a Commerce Clause claim? Your briefs go back and forth on which one it is. Your reply brief now emphasizes Commerce Clause power, but your main brief was saying this is a treaty provision challenge. Do they differ?",
  "Excuse me. What do you see specifically? Because there's a lot of discussion about labels and what the labels mean in this case. But tell me specifically what -- not the word she uses, but the specific ways in which prudential considerations bar her standing; meaning: What about the nature of her claim prudentially should counsel us against giving her standing?",
  "Do you think Pennsylvania would be upset that the Federal Government got her when they couldn't?",
  "Could you just articulate for me -- we're speaking in generalities -­ what in the nature of her claim, taking the labels away, do you think is a pure Tenth Amendment challenge?",
  "As I read her complaint, and it's always that it's a Tenth Amendment claim because Congress and the president have exceeded their powers in some -­",
  "That's -- you haven't answered my -- my question. Why isn't that a merits decision as to whether or not the President and Congress have the power to enact this legislation?",
  "Isn't that an issue for a civil lawsuit as opposed to a criminal one? Because all that would happen in a criminal suit is that the defendant's conviction would be undone, but that doesn't mean that the State is bound in some way. The State wasn't a party to the criminal action.",
  "Well, there's two things that could happen. One is that if the State loses, then -- and it doesn't want to lose -- it passes its own law. Or if it wins, if the case is as stated below, it just lets the status quo go. I still don't understand what the long-term injury to the State is or could be.",
  "Counsel, on that issue, do you accept the First Circuit's rule in U.S. v. Hood that if the government is found to be attempting to frustrate the operation of the Speedy Trial Act, that those motions and their delays won't be counted?",
  "It suggests that qualification?",
  "Sanctionable against the government, or -­",
  "How does that help a defendant whose speedy trial rights have been violated?",
  "You haven't answered my question. The rights that this statute protects are the rights to have your trial start within 70 days absent or extended to these exclusions. If the government frustrates that and makes the trial start later, why shouldn't a defendant have the benefit of the Act and have the indictment dismissed with or without prejudice?",
  "Counsel, I hope you won't sit down without addressing the (h)(1)(F) issue and explain why we shouldn't reach it, because the issue is, as I see it, one of law, not like Nobles, one of discretion. And although you say it's unimportant because of a change in Rule 45, how could any criminal conviction that's inappropriate be unimportant to the defendant or insignificant enough for this Court to address the question once the case is before us?",
  "Counsel -­",
  "-- there's a lot -­",
  "Counsel, there's a lot of discussion about the applicability or nonapplicability of this rule to this case. The rule by its terms applies to computing any period of time specified in these rules, any local rule or any court order. None of that includes the statute at issue here, correct?",
  "So this whole debate about whether the rule applies or not is irrelevant. The only question is what does the statute intend, correct?",
  "All right. So if what the statute intends hasn't changed -­",
  "-- between the old rule or the revised rule, correct? Congress hasn't -­",
  "-- made an amendment; correct?",
  "Will you like the way we're going if I accept your proposition that when Congress uses 10 days, it really means 10 business days? I take words in a statute like that at their plain meaning. It says 10 days, not 10 business days. So -­",
  "But Congress has used 10 -- has used business days in other provisions, hasn't it?",
  "So Congress changed its mind between the two rules?",
  "How do I know that? Where? Rule 45 doesn't apply to statutes.",
  "Where in the statute does it -- say, apply the criminal rules?",
  "Excuse me, but isn't that what the statute says? Meaning, if you look at (h), the beginning paragraph at (h), it says, \"The following periods of delay shall be excluded in computing the time within which the trial of any such offense must commence.\" It's not talking about the delay of the trial. It's talking about the computation of the start date for the trial. So if that's what that commands you to do, doesn't -- isn't only the Solicitor General's position consistent with that? It's telling you to take the periods of delay and compute the date the trial must start by excluding those. That's the language.",
  "That's the -­",
  "Well, but that's what (h) says; (h) says you compute the start date of the trial, when it must start, by excluding all of these periods of delay. It's defining it for you.",
  "So it doesn't matter how substantial and important a motion is, whether it was your motion to dismiss for Speedy Trial Act reasons or the administrative motions here that you say really didn't require time? It doesn't matter; all that matters is keeping track from day one, the commencement of the trial, as to when the Court is about to set the trial date, that it does it at the end of all the motions. That's the only time the court can do it.",
  "Why wouldn't it matter?",
  "Well, actually it happens all the time. In the \"rocket docket\" in Virginia, the court sets a trial date, and you file whatever motions you're going to file. Under your theory, until that last motion actually delays the trial date, none of those motions exclude time.",
  "Counsel, I don't believe I had a trial in my district court days where between the time I had the pretrial conference and the time trial started, there wasn't a slew of motions, because that's about the time counsel tends to wake up.",
  "Okay? And -- and decide that really now they've got to get ready.",
  "Why should we care whether it's an administrative motion or simply to clarify the functioning of the trial? Why should we not exclude those times, because those -- those motions, whether they're administrative or not, will cause the trial to go faster, because issues that would otherwise consume the time of the court during trial are being resolved before trial.",
  "Counsel, could you -­ maybe it would be easier if you would describe to us the situations you don't think would be based on the guidelines. The Solicitor General claims that since every plea negotiation has to start with the guideline calculation as a starting point for departure and/or consideration by the judge under 6B1, that every C plea agreement would be considered based on. Are you taking that position?",
  "All right. So I'll give you a couple of examples, but you give me more. Would a plea agreement that doesn't mention the guidelines at all but picks a sentence within the actual guideline -­ is that based on the guideline?",
  "All right. And how about one that departs or varies from the guideline, the range, whichever word you want to use?",
  "So there -- the Solicitor General is right; there really isn't any situation that you're claiming is not based on?",
  "Give me the examples.",
  "So from what base does a judge depart downward? From the crack cocaine range or from the downward departure range?",
  "So aren't you just asking us to permit district court judges to make up their own C agreement, to decide what the parties would have done in the absence of a higher range? And don't we fall prey to sort of just asking district court judges to create their own agreements?",
  "Counsel -­",
  "I don't -- I am not in disagreement with the point you're making, but I think that going back to what had bothered Justice Alito and Justice Scalia on now that the guidelines are not mandatory, is any sentence even under C really based on the agreement? Because even a C agreement has to be approved by the judge. The legal consequence is not the agreement. That doesn't sentence the defendant. It is the judge's decision as to what the sentence should be which he denotes in accepting the agreement that binds. And I think -- I may be making Justice Breyer's argument -- that if under the policy statement and it's clear what the judge did here, if the judge feels bound by the agreement or otherwise to calculate a sentence in the guidelines and impose one in the guidelines, how can you say that the legal effect is not the guideline sentence?",
  "-- no. Because you're assuming that the agreement was automatically binding on the judge.",
  "The judge was always capable of saying at the time of sentence I won't accept the 106. If he had calculated the guidelines and if it turned out that the guidelines called for 240 to 360, he could have said easily no, that is so far outside of the guideline range with no justification that I am not going to accept -- impose the sentence. You could withdraw your agreement and do whatever you're going to do.",
  "Why would we -- wouldn't the rule that you're setting forth, willful blindness not being a part of it, mean that nobody would ever get a patent search, because what would be the inducement to do that?",
  "No, but you're not presumed to copy other people's items, which is the difference. Is there -- let me just ask you something. Assuming we were to find the willful blindness test to actual knowledge, the facts of your case, the fact that they did not give the name of the product that they copied to their patent attorney, is that just, as a matter of law, willful blindness?",
  "Do patents -- are patents -- can you do a patent search on the basis of the name of the holder?",
  "And the product that they copied, did it have the name of the holder of the patent?",
  "So what is the likelihood that if they had actually given the attorney the name of the product, that he would not have found the patent?",
  "I think it would be probably 90 percent, assuming -- because there's always errors in searches. So -­",
  "I'm -- I'm a little confused. If you knew that there was a patent under (b), and you still gave the fryer -- patented the fryer that you know it is a patented fryer to Montgomery Ward or Sunbeam to sell, you're not liable under (b), because why? What act of yours was not purposeful?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, we'll go as to -­ let's -- let's just stop there. Justice Kennedy and I believe the Chief have asked you, isn't your entire argument that we should move the knowing knowledge of (c) into (b)? And you said no.",
  "Explain to me -­",
  "Well, then explain to me -­",
  "-- what's not purposeful or knowing -- what's not purposeful, culpable conduct, if you know there's a patent or -- you can decide whether knowledge includes willful blindness or not, but it's not my issue. If you know there's a patent and you give the product to someone else to sell, how can you not be culpable for it?",
  "So you're introducing a mistake of law defense to knowledge. You're saying, I really didn't know that it was unlawful. I knew that there was a patent, but I really thought that it wasn't a legal patent, so I was going to violate what I know wasn't legal. Is that what you're saying?",
  "Why do you get off the hook for making a mistake of law?",
  "You would never have any patents enforced under your theory.",
  "-- do so, because we still have to define knowledge. If we accept that actual knowledge can have a different definition, just not the should have known definition -­",
  "Do we have to define what knowledge -- what kind of knowledge we are talking about?",
  "I agree. We can say that. But how does it help -­",

  "Forget the narrow rule. What do you think the rule should be to articulate what Justice Breyer would like?",
  "I am sorry. Why are you doing that? I thought that you came in arguing that you have to have actual knowledge of the patent.",
  "By number, and that was the conversation we had earlier, and that the patent covered the scope of your invention.",
  "What if the inventor had not been an employee? If it had been an independent contractor who was working in combination with the university, how does this automatic vesting -­",

  "Does the -- as a practical matter, when a university is seeking a patent, doesn't it have to identify the inventors and get their -- proof of their assignment before it can claim ownership of the patent?",
  "That's a different question than mine.",
  "Does the Patent Office require the assignment for purposes of showing ownership of the patent?",
  "Could I ask -- that all sounds to me like there's an assumption about assignments, even in the patent law, that you -- the section that you just recited to me says a promise to assign will get you an assignment if the inventor won't give it to you.",
  "How -­",
  "Is there any conceivable reason that, under the Bayh-Dole Act, whose intent was to protect the government's interests after it's funded the discovery or implementation of an invention, that Congress would have ever wanted the university and the inventor to be able to circumvent the act by failing to secure an assignment?",
  "But frankly, every act before this one -- actually, the IPA -- required that the contractor seek assignments from inventors. Why would this act omit such a critical term if it didn't intend to vest title in the contractor?",
  "The government just said -- if we say that the contractor and the inventor can do what they want, what sane university wouldn't enter into agreements with employees letting the employees retain title to their inventions and just sharing royalties thereafter? It wouldn't make any sense for universities to do what you're saying -- get assignments -- because they could just continue taking the bulk of the royalties.",
  "Sorry. They -- they do. I mean, the general rule is that the inventor owns the patent.",
  "And there -- there is proof that they can go into court, an employer can go into court and show that the inventor was hired for this specific item and the law would presume or recognize the employer's rights; but why would Congress leave all of that up to the nature of the contract that the university entered into with its inventors?",
  "But the -- but the question I started with and Justice Kagan has picked up on, why would Congress create this act relying on assignments and not have a provision requiring one? Nothing in the Act, nothing in its regulations, nowhere is there a requirement that Federal contractors seek assignments.",
  "Do you think that Cetus would have let the doctor in absent the agreement between Cetus and Stanford? Wasn't that the primary reason they permitted the doctor in? It wasn't for this ephemeral assignment of an unknown invention. It was because the university and the company had entered into a share agreement of what would happen if they contributed to a Stanford invention.",
  "But they had a preexisting cooperative arrangement, correct?",

  "Can you get cocaine into a rock form without using a base? Is there some way that the rock type form of cocaine could ever be achieved without a use of a base?",
  "And coca paste, what can you do with coca paste? Can you make it into powder or is it only useable as a -- ultimately for a rock-like formation?",
  "I'm sorry, cocaine paste -- coca paste is smokeable in its paste form?",
  "All right. Assuming we accept the -- the brief of the physicians and scientists, they say clearly that coca leaves can be chewed, but they are bulky and contain a lot of organic matter in addition to cocaine. I understood their scientific explanation to say that coca leaves contain coca -- cocaine. I think you've taken the contrary position, but let's assume we accept the sciences answer. What does that do to your argument?",
  "So you're representing that you will never prosecute someone who possesses coca leaves under subdivision (iii)?",
  "And you're representing to the Court that you won't?",
  "So why did it draft it to say \"cocaine salts, et cetera,\" as opposed to \"cocaine, comma, its salts, et cetera\"? If it intended to differentiate between true cocaine and its byproducts like salts, et cetera, why didn't it just simplify the language in Roman numeral number (ii)?",
  "But why would it do that? If it's going to treat cocaine base, which is the same thing as cocaine, differently from cocaine salts, why doesn't it just say cocaine salts?",
  "Couldn't -­",
  "-- it say \"cocaine and its isomers\" or something? \"Its isomers.\" Why is it using \"cocaine\" in an identical scientific way in Roman numeral number (ii) and in -- in (iv)?",
  "Let's assume for the sake of a hypothetical that the statute was the same but that things were reversed; that the smaller universe of items was the salt rather than the crack, and so they put an enhancement in Roman numeral number (III) for salt rather than crack. Is your argument that it's redundant based on the fact that a larger grouping of the chemicals listed in Roman numeral number (II) is excluded by Roman numeral number (III), so that -- is that the basis of your argument?",
  "General -­",
  "I'm sorry. Isn't that -- isn't that the -- the county's claim? How Camreta does his job doesn't -- that claim doesn't belong to him; it belongs to the entity who is telling him how to do his job. And so why don't we go back to Justice Ginsburg's question of why isn't the Monell situation the proper case? Because there, it's the party interested in how its officers will do their job at its directive. It has the case and controversy at issue, not S.G. Right now, she's never going to be investigated again. She's in another State. I understand that she doesn't even ever want to return to Oregon for, probably, fairly good reasons, at least from her perspective. So, again, why isn't this the interests of the county, not -- not the interests of the officer?",
  "Counsel, if we were to hold this case was moot, what would -- what do you think the appropriate disposition of the case would be?",
  "Well, you don't really want that, because the Ninth Circuit granted qualified immunity. What would be -- what would we be vacating? They haven't rendered a judgment on the search warrant issue.",
  "Vacate the opinion.",
  "Excuse me -­",
  "If we told them -­",
  "Counsel, would -- I'm interrupting you only for a quick reason. What's the test? Is it a question of whether the seizure is reasonable or not?",
  "All right. So -- so that would be your proposed test. If we were to say you don't need any of those three things right now, where would that leave us or leave the courts below on determining whether what happened here was reasonable or not? Meaning, what if a child is called in and says, I don't want to talk to you without my mom; and they continue to speak to the child? Is that reasonable?",
  "So how do we -­",
  "How do we develop the law, or how do we help develop the law in this case if we answer your question but leave unanswered with no parameters, any idea -- because we have no set of facts; no one's going to review that question -- of what is reasonable in this context?",
  "That -- you see, that's the problem with taking up a case with no case in controversy, because what do we do? We don't remand for them to reach the second question, which is really the one that law enforcement needs some help on.",
  "Counsel, are you -- I just want to make sure I understand your position. Answering Justice Scalia's question: Child walks into the room -- is taken out of their classroom, walks into the room. The officer says: We've heard that your mommy and daddy are doing some things to your private parts; is that true? And the child says -- 9-year-old child says: I wish somebody had asked me before. I'm so afraid of my daddy. He does these horrible things to me. Are you seriously suggesting that if the police stay there for an hour debriefing that child as to the circumstances of that situation, that that's a seizure? It seems to me that what you -­",
  "Well, but what does that have to do or change the police bringing a child into a room and just asking the question? When does -- that's what you seem to have said to Justice Scalia, which is that the mere removal from the classroom is the -- the defining feature of seizure. So it can't be that.",
  "They don't know if there's exigent circumstances until they ask the question.",
  "Doesn't that go to the question of the reasonableness of the scope of the seizure? Don't we have Lidster and -- and other jurisprudence that basically addresses this question and says is this type of seizure or stop detention reasonable? And it's hard to swallow that if a police officer asks a child are you being abused and the child says, yes, I need help, it is nearly impossible to think that that seizure is unreasonable. You're -- you're -­ you're -- it may well be that 2 hours for a protesting child would be, but isn't that all subject to a question of reasonableness as to the scope of the seizure?",
  "General, just a point of clarification before you go on. You said earlier that your office had advised the county not to seize children. Does that mean they're not talking to children at all? Is -- you used the word seized. Are you advising them that they don't have the right to talk to children? Without their parental consent or a warrant?",
  "What's the standard? I mean, I just assume you're not suggesting that this procedure could be used with every child in every school without some ground for suspicion, correct?",
  "Would you -- are you -­ and I guess what I'm asking is, let's assume we go ex ante. At any moment that an agency speaks to a child, they can move from a nonseizure to a seizure, correct? And some seizures can be reasonable and some can't, right?",
  "And law enforcement is never going to know where that line of reasonableness or unreasonableness is, is that correct?",
  "That's in -- that's in the nature of doing this without a warrant, isn't it?",
  "But they do it anyway, meaning even if we say that they can seize the child, you would still have to not do a seizure that was unreasonable. You wouldn't -- in scope. They can't speak to the child endlessly, can they?",
  "I'm not quite sure why you stipulated to a seizure in this case, but that was your strategic choice.",
  "So that means that if they tell you go look for it on the Web site of X agency, then they are incorporating everything that that other agency has as part of their report?",
  "That it's not a response in telling you you've got to find what you're looking for?",
  "Counsel, the -- I think you've just divided up two issues. The first is, the FOIA letter does tell you that there weren't reports for certain years.",
  "Found. Now, the issue is different from whether the ones that were found were false or not; is that correct?",
  "Mr. Reiss, assuming that the government did all of the steps you took, how does it promote the purposes of FOIA -­",
  "-- to find a document created by a third party, under duty or not, that is submitted and contains false statements. How does it promote the government's interests to bar an individual who has personal knowledge about the falsity from being a qui tam action?",
  "Doesn't that seem illogical, meaning the -- the report filed by the employer is not screaming out, \"I filed a false report.\" You need some outside knowledge from that statement by the employer to prove the falsity. So how is your rule promoting FOIA's purposes?",
  "I'm still not sure I understand. Here the relator is saying, the statement says we complied with the military act, and he says they didn't. I have personal information they didn't because I know they didn't do X, Y, and Z. Why did we even reach the questions we did if what he's claiming is that he was an original -- that he has original knowledge not -- not reflected in the reports?",
  "I still don't understand how it promotes the purposes of a qui tam action -­",
  "-- to put any kind of bar on a relator who is challenging the creation of a document that's submitted by an independent party to the government.",
  "In fact that's not true. We have -- that -- because the Government's right; Congress changed the -- the law from anything that was in the government's possession and narrowed the scope of the bar.",
  "Counsel, there are different types of hearsay involved here or different types of statements. There's the report itself, which was Exhibit 1 that was introduced, and it has certain certifications by the analyst, that he followed certain procedures, et cetera. I'm assuming that you're claiming that those -- those are the Confrontation Clause violations, that exhibit itself, because it is attesting or certifying to something.",
  "The witness is not at trial here.",
  "Well, that's where I want -­",
  "That -- the \"also\" is what I summarized in saying that he followed certain procedures, that it was in accordance with law, et cetera.",
  "Right.",
  "All right.",
  "Now -- if I might just finish my question.",
  "Let's assume that the raw data, the graphs that were made, were reviewed by a separate witness, and he reviewed the data and says, this data shows that the blood level concentration was .21, or two-point whatever it was. Would that violate the Confrontation Clause, using the raw data itself?",
  "The printout from the machine.",
  "That wasn't introduced here; am I correct?",
  "All right. But let's assume -­",
  "Let's assume he just took the raw data at trial. I know we now have a chain of custody, and someone will have to prove that this is the data related -­",
  "-- to Mr. Bullcoming. But if that expert then read that data and testified that this was of a certain amount or percentage of alcohol, would that violate the Confrontation Clause?",
  "What part -­",
  "What part do you see as testimonial or not? What can an outside expert look at?",
  "Well, I -- that -­",
  "There's two different issues: one, what can be introduced into evidence, which is the reports themselves; and what can he or she testify to is a different question. That's a form of evidence. And so that's the line I'm trying to get you to describe for me, which is, when does that testimony become a violation of the Confrontation Clause?",
  "Let's assume the hypothetical I proffered.",
  "I'm sorry, could you tell me what that means? Why is it different than the affidavit? It's certified, and my understanding of the dictionary meaning of certification is that that's an attestation as to the truth of the statements contained therein. That's the common definition. So I'm assuming it's the equivalent of an affidavit. So how is it different than the Melendez-Diaz lab report?",
  "Tell me why not.",
  "Can any -­",
  "I'm sorry. He's not simply looking at a number and putting it on a report. He's certifying to certain things. He's certifying to following certain steps, that the evidence wasn't tampered with. He's certifying that he's complied with all the requirements of New Mexico law with respect to the report, so he's just not copying a number.",
  "Isn't the difference between those two documents is that one was prepared primarily for the purposes -- this lab report, for prosecution purposes, and the birth certificate is not prepared for that? It's prepared to mark the birth of a person, then it's used for many other purposes besides trial; is that correct?",
  "So tell me what makes this certificate not primarily for the purpose of use in the prosecution of an individual? Would they have tested this blood if -- if it wasn't to prosecute him?",
  "Does he do any testing except for the police?",
  "Who else do they test for?",
  "So why did you give the data to the analyst at trial? If there wasn't a more persuasive power in the lab certification, why didn't you just have the new expert look at the printout from the graph and say, this is what it says?",
  "That's that as well. Don't you introduce the lab report because it -- it gives more credence to the reliability of the result? Because he's certifying that he followed certain procedures, that he did certain things, that the sample wasn't tampered with?",
  "Is it -- you're looking for that testimony, correct? You're looking, at trial, to that testimony to bolster the test?",
  "Counsel -­",
  "General -­",
  "There is a difference between calling a witness at trial and arresting a person. How is it a part of the prosecutorial or the trial function to arrest someone? Isn't what's protected absolutely is your use of that person at trial, not your arrest or detention of them?",
  "You don't -- you don't think there's a reason to make prosecutors flinch against willy-nilly -- that's not what I'm -- I'm claiming happened here, but if you take the point that you're raising, then prosecutors can out of spite, out of pure investigative reasoning, out of whatever motive they have, just lock people up.",
  "And you're -- you're basically saying -­",
  "You've just raised the question of qualified immunity and the similarities. There is one problem that I have with the regime that you are suggesting, which is that because laws differ among circuits, now we've created a regime where we say if the law was clear or if there was law on this issue in your circuit, and the police officer relied on it, the exclusionary rule won't apply; but if the law was uncertain or not clear in another circuit, then the exclusionary rule does apply. There's something illogical about permitting that kind of difference to control the outcome of suppression. Are you through the back door trying to get in a qualified immunity thing? If any police officer has a reasonable cause to believe their conduct didn't violate the Constitution, then no suppression? That is what it sounds like your brief is ultimately suggesting.",
  "So there's no value in your mind to the fact, as your adversary is saying -- I don't -- I haven't found one case previously by this Court where it has applied the good faith exception to the finding by the Court of a Fourth Amendment violation. Have you? It's never been done in any case, correct?",
  "Well, what we're doing is sort of -- your adversary is right, we're returning to Linkletter, aren't we? We're sort of saying it's going to apply, the exclusionary rule is going to apply in some cases, but not all.",
  "I'm talking about what happened before then.",
  "We're going to have the exclusionary rule apply sometimes but not other times.",
  "Well, if there's a circuit split, how do we encourage police officers to be careful about the Fourth Amendment? There's a presumption somehow that because a circuit precedent exists that says it's okay to do this, that police officers have to do this. I don't necessarily believe that. If there's a circuit split and a police officer knows that other circuits are saying this is unconstitutional, why are we taking away the deterrent effect of having thoughts occur to the officer about thinking through whether there's a better way and a legal way to do things? With respect to the Fourth Amendment, we've built -- your adversary is right, we've built in so many exceptions, and including in this case the inventory search, that the officers have many different ways of doing things than merely doing what this particular court thought was legal or this circuit. So I guess my question is, when there's a circuit split, why are we, as Justice Kennedy is saying, giving protection to the circuit that's plain wrong and to the officer who chose to follow that advice?",
  "But they're going to be protected -- they're going to be protected from that -­",
  "-- meaning they're going to get qualified immunity from any personal liability.",
  "You're suggesting that it's okay for the police to walk up to any citizen, anywhere, and say, you're under arrest until you give me your name?",
  "Well, there's -- there's been no doubt here that it was a stop without suspicion. That's been presumed. So how is that different from what I just asked you -­",
  "That they took a person randomly, detained them without any suspicion, and said give me your name. Are you suggesting that that's okay?",
  "I am presuming. I know that there's counter-arguments to that.",
  "So isn't the eliciting of the name as a result of an unlawful stop something that could be suppressed?",
  "The name is different than the person, the body of the person, which has to do with the Court's jurisdiction. But why isn't the name any different than a wallet that's in somebody's pocket or a shirt or a hat, whatever is on the person? Why is a name not subject to suppression? Let's go past what happens here, because I understand the disconnect between the name, the DMV record, and seeing the person driving. How we tie those together are a different issue. But you made a bold statement when you started. You said that the police securing a name is never suppressible.",
  "Counsel, do you see no difference between Crews and Bynum, in the typical case where the evidence against the defendant is not developed as a result of an illegal stop -- it exists independent of that stop -- and one in which the stop itself creates the ground for arrest? Don't you see a difference between those two things?",
  "But there was no suspicion of that when that person was stopped. The suspicion to arrest arose not independent of the illegality, but as part of it.",
  "But all of the evidence at trial really had nothing to do with the fingerprint. It had to do with the victims and everyone else walking in and saying, That's the guy who did lie to me.",
  "In the arrest.",
  "Are you -­",
  "Counsel, are you agreeing with your adversary that you abandoned and are not entitled to raise the suppressibility of the observation?",
  "And if you're not, in what ways is it tied to the question presented about identity, which is the issue you sought cert on?",
  "What kind of case, hypothetically, would qualify under your theory as a petitioning case to the sovereign? Would a claim of retaliation because of a termination based on race qualify?",
  "Doesn't that get to the -- to the merits of the case? You have to from -­ you can't invite a question as to whether the sovereign is responsible until you litigate the issue. So what is the -- addressing Justice Scalia's question to you, what would qualify as a petition to the employer as opposed to a petition to the sovereign and why?",
  "Those are clear cases.",
  "I was asking the flip.",
  "How much of your argument is premised on the fact that there was an alternative mechanism to the court system available.",
  "Meaning let's assume there wasn't a collective bargaining agreement, let's assume there wasn't a State law protection, all of the items that you mention in your brief as existing to resolve disputes, that the only avenue for redress were the courts. So where would that put your argument?",
  "Putting it aside. You -- you were talking about constitutionalizing a grievance process. I'm going more broadly and saying how much of your argument depends on that fact?",
  "What was the meaning would -- it is harder if all they have access to is a court proceeding.",
  "How about if they don't?",
  "How about if they don't? That's my point. Then what happens to the Third Circuit's definition?",
  "Counselor, your client won everything in his collective bargaining grievance. He got his pay back, he got them to stop doing what they did, and he found a lawyer to file a constitutional claim. So your suggestion that lawyers won't fight semi-chaotic adventures is realistic as well.",
  "People get upset about how they're treated all of the time, and they find lawyers to file suits about that treatment.",
  "Counsel, can I understand what legal analysis you're proposing? Your blue brief seems to suggest, as does your argument a few minutes ago, that you want the Sixth Circuit's rule, which is the only circuit that applies this rule, that says when the facts are identical and intertwined, the defendant gets no fees.",
  "All of the other circuits, as far as I can tell, don't go to that extreme. They say something closer to what you started with, and your yellow brief suggests, is a but-for cause: The defendant is entitled to those costs related to the defense of the frivolous claim. Which of the two theories are you advocating? And then a separate question, of what standard of review should be imposed in those situations in which the activities are so intertwined, but there is still a core essence of defense of the Federal claim, which is some of the hypotheticals my colleagues -­",
  "-- assume.",
  "But there are difference -- are differences in how we read those other circuits, but I'll accept your proposition.",
  "Counsel, did the -- the district court here said they're intertwined claims, they all relate to the frivolous claim, they're entitled to full fees. The Fifth Circuit seemed to do the but-for test. Are you agreeing with that? It's -- the language it uses sounds like a but-for test: \"A defendant is only entitled to attorney's fees for work which can be distinctly traced to frivolous claims. We are confident that the district court can assess the amount of attorney's fees attributable exclusively to a plaintiff's frivolous claims.\" Is that correct?",
  "You think they misapplied that?",
  "Two.",
  "And they joined the Ninth and the -- and the other circuits that have the but-for. So it's three places. They said we're not joining an exclusive fees entitlement either way, we're joining what the majority of the circuits are doing.",
  "So why can't you prove that?",
  "Why can't you prove that in a but-for situation? Why don't you tell me what you -- your proposed standard is. As I understand it, you would say if the Federal claim is frivolous, then you're entitled to all fees, even if the State law claims overlap and have merit or potential merit. I think -- is that your position?",
  "Eligibility, it has to be a frivolous claim, that's -­",
  "But I thought what Congress said and what we've said in Hensley, that the only thing that the defendant is entitled to fees for is the burden of the frivolous Federal claim. Your -- your answer to Justice Kagan is suggesting that even if the plaintiff wins, wins everything they were seeking, you're still entitled to 80 percent of your fees, even though the Federal claim didn't add anything to your work -- to your work, except 20 percent?",
  "But tell me why we would, given the differences that we've announced in Hensley between prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants -- because you can only prevail as to a frivolous fee. Why do we start with your entitlement to your entire fee and deduct from it, instead of starting the other way, which seems more logical, which is you're entitled to the fees related to your frivolous claim, so why don't you have to prove that first?",
  "No. No, no, no. We're assuming a lawsuit that has -- as this one, that has both Federal and State claims and only one -- whether it's one frivolous Federal claim or multiple Federal claims and two are frivolous, one is not, and there is a bunch of State court claims.",
  "So why do we start with your total fee and deduct down, rather than start where all the circuits are starting, which is to say, what can be attributed to that frivolous claim, which is the only thing you're entitled to fees from?",
  "Counsel, every other circuit except for the Sixth has dealt with the but-for test or some variant of it. Even the Fifth did it in this case and ruled in your favor. What you're asking for is, I think, very akin to the opposite rule of saying if we dismiss the Federal litigation, you're not entitled to any fees, because this case was about -- is in Federal Court, so that's the only thing that matters. That seems to be your rule. Every other circuit has some variant of but-for, and they seem to manage it just fine. Nobody likes attorney's fees.",
  "Espouse your test for me, because I still don't understand it except for flipping through Hensley, but Hensley has a different predicate, which is that plaintiffs are -- if they win, they're entitled to fees.",
  "I'm not sure what that means, because if you're taking discovery on the State law issues, defamation, extortion, et cetera, you're pressing it. At the point that the Federal action is dismissed you no longer can pursue that in Federal court to its conclusion.",
  "Then why would -- if you have a bunch of different claims and the facts support some of the State court actions, why should you be entitled to fees that you would have incurred in State court no matter what?",
  "Did you -- are you seriously contending that the lawyer below didn't understand that the defamation and the extortion claims were part of this case? I'm hard pressed to believe that reading that complaint would not doubt that -­",
  "Found?",
  "In answer to Justice Scalia's question, basically the only difference you have with the -- with the Fifth Circuit is that you would say fees fairly attributable to Federal claims as opposed to fees exclusively attributable to Federal claims; is that correct?",
  "So your presumption would be that if the fees are -- support both State and Federal claims, you're still entitled to fees?",
  "I still -- I don't understand what that means.",
  "You want district courts to determine how important the 1983 claim was in relationship to the State claim?",
  "So -­",
  "-- are you saying, going back to the hypotheticals that some of my colleagues posed, police officer comes across an individual, looks older or looks younger, doesn't know, and just engages that person and says come over here and let's talk for a second. Is the officer required to ask the age?",
  "So if they're not required -­",
  "Perhaps not, but it's -­ if it's outside a school, school corner. No reasonable suspicion, just says come over here, kid. Is he supposed to ask the age to see if he's 19 or 18 or 17?",
  "It is, because it's a stop with no reasonable suspicion. And the kid comes over, and the officer stands him there and continues to talk to him for half an hour.",
  "So why don't we go back to the test that Justice Breyer suggested, which would answer many of the hypotheticals here, that the objective fact is what is known to both?",
  "That way you don't get into what the 13-year-old is thinking inside himself or not, because that then becomes subjective; you don't go back to what others might think are special characteristics or subjective characteristics. You go to what's known, what's an objective factor known to both.",
  "I think that's clear, but that's different. I mean, you can tell the difference between a 9-year-old, I think, and an adult generally.",
  "And I'm hard pressed to think that anyone would believe that if you took a 9-year-old out of his classroom and the assistant principal walked him into a room and said these guys want to talk to you, that that 9-year-old would think he's free to leave.",
  "Right. So objectively that's a fact known to everyone, that it's a 9-year-old.",
  "Excuse me, haven't we repeatedly said that it's going to be very difficult for a defendant to show that his confession wasn't involuntary if there was no Miranda violation? Isn't the entire purpose of Miranda and its requirement because there was a belief that it wasn't -- that voluntariness wasn't enough -- was not good enough because it was such a high bar, to secure the privilege against self-incrimination?",
  "That doesn't answer my question. If we've said if you're not in custody, it's going to be nearly impossible for you to show that your statement was involuntary, are you now accepting that with respect to age a 9-year-old may not feel free to leave as opposed to a 13 or 14-year-old, that somehow we should instruct the courts that age really needs to be stepped up in the voluntariness test?",
  "So are you happy with the rule that says, no, not in the objective Miranda test, but, yes, age should be elevated as a prime consideration in the voluntariness test?",
  "So how is that different than blindness or hearing? A person with Down's syndrome, many -- some don't -- show characteristics that they're not capable of comprehension, or not capable of absorbing information.",
  "They barely look at you, they barely -- you know, there are characteristics that show you a lack of absorption of information.",
  "Mr. Waxman, the Solicitor General suggests that the failure in this case or the failure to appoint counsel arises from a due process complaint that the -- that the -- that the Petitioner here didn't know that he had indigency as a defense or what he needed to prove or to bring to court to prove that. Why wouldn't the Solicitor General's solution of saying, as long as a State tells a defendant that they have a burden of proof and some contours of what proof they need to supply or -- on that issue, that that would satisfy due process? What can a lawyer do when someone comes in and says, I'm not earning any money, I can't earn it, blah, blah, blah, end of story?",
  "What do you need? Why do you need -­",
  "He admitted that.",
  "At least up until the accident.",
  "It was up until then.",
  "And you don't think that an individual is capable of saying, I can't -- I'm -­ yes, I am, or no, I'm not using up my money on drugs; that's my preference?",
  "Or I have a $1,500 car, but I need it to be able to do something else?",
  "Where is that form in the record?",
  "Where is the form in the record?",
  "I'm sorry. I'm not hearing you. Could you speak more loudly?",
  "Counsel, as I -- and then I think one of the deficiencies in addressing your argument is that I don't really know what the State's procedures are. Your -- your co-counsel, or Mr. Waxman, has said that there was actually a form. I don't know what that form looks like. The only thing that does seem missing that the State clearly provides is a requirement that the judge explain what the basis of his contempt finding is. I'm looking at 60a and 61a, and this judge left it completely blank. So, is this a due process violation facially, or is this a due process violation as applied, meaning it's just not clear to me whether South -- the State's process, in fact, has all of the elements that you're speaking about or how I make that judgment and whether the -- we didn't grant cert on the question of whether, as applied, there was a failure or not. I mean, one of the difficulties in this case is that there was really very -- no findings by the judge whatsoever.",
  "Well, the -- the form, the order for contempt of court itself, 61a, does require the judge to fill out an answer as to whether he thinks the defendant is gainfully employed or has the ability to make the payments. So, it was just absent here.",
  "Counsel, do we have jurisdiction over any matter that isn't rendered in a final judgment in State court?",
  "So, if we don't have jurisdiction over anything but a final judgment, how could we ever grant a stay if the State refused to?",
  "The State refused to grant a stay.",
  "And why would South -­ why would the State here have granted a stay, if it believes there's no Sixth Amendment right whatsoever to counsel? How could that litigant ever evade mootness?",
  "Can you point to any case involving support payments in which the South Carolina court has ever granted a stay?",
  "Counsel, I -- I took the Solicitor General's position to be -- they may accuse me of not being accurate in what I took their position to be, which is the rule would be simple. You, a State, are free to run these procedures as you choose, but not to provide counsel, you have to meet some minimum Mathews v. Eldridge requirements. And so, the rule is simple. The State can do what it wants, but it has to provide minimum due process, and they've previously set forth the three. All right? So really the answer is, no, you're not automatically entitled to a lawyer if you're providing minimum due process. If you're not, then you have to provide a lawyer.",
  "All right? What's wrong with that rule? That, I think, is what the Solicitor General is suggesting. So, first, what's wrong with the rule? And then, second, in a case in which I did not see and haven't yet a form that really talks about or tells the contemptor about his defense and what he needs to prove, yes, he did get a hearing but not a hearing that explored his statement that he'd been looking for work and couldn't find it, and a form, a judgment that doesn't address his current ability to pay. How does the South Carolina system comply with those minimums of due process?",
  "I don't know that that answers my question, because the way I phrased the question was very specific. South Carolina -- there's no constitutional right to counsel in every proceeding, but the question presented was whether South Carolina erred that an indigent defendant has no constitutional right to appointed counsel in any civil contempt proceeding. And if the answer to that is, if the civil contempt proceeding does not comply with minimum due process requirements, counsel is required.",
  "Then isn't that an answer to the question presented?",
  "We can argue about that later.",
  "Okay? The point is -­",
  "Counsel -­",
  "Can you tell me -- there is an article that suggests that juries don't actually understand what \"proximate cause\" means; and I think, and Justice Ginsburg can correct me, that what does that mean to a jury -- natural, probable, and foreseeable?",
  "Are the three phrases different? And how much more detail do you have to get in to describe that difference in a comprehensible way?",
  "You're really suggesting that the defense attorney here wouldn't have argued the concept of proximate cause in saying the negligence had nothing to do with him just deciding to hit the brake?",
  "-- I -- I -- I -- it's farfetched, don't you think, that because the judge refused to give a proximate cause charge that the idea of it wasn't argued to the jury: What we did didn't cause this.",
  "How did any of those things cause his injury?",
  "You've used the formulation negligence played a part in the injury. So how did those things play a part?",
  "Can I -- can I go back a second and perhaps follow up Justice Scalia's question in a slightly different way? Do you believe a railroad can be held liable for a harm it could not reasonably foresee?",
  "All right. Now, perhaps, we can get to why, under what formulation, if it didn't know harm was going to happen or could happen.",
  "Reasonably foreseeable.",
  "It might not be reasonably foreseeable that an amputation would occur, but it was reasonably foreseeable that some injury to people would happen as a result of these infected insect bites, no? That's what the court ultimately said.",
  "Mr. Frederick, go back again and tell me what a -- what a judge would say to a jury so he or she doesn't say but-for is not, not using those words, tell me in simple, plain language how a judge differentiates to a jury the difference between but-for and this causation. What would a judge say?",
  "The -- that negligence played a part in the injury?",
  "Producing the injury?",
  "Why not, if you know that there are snakes along this route, just like there's an infected vermin or insects or something else? I -­",
  "So it's not that it's a matter of law?",
  "A matter of law, there was -- there could be no proximate cause. You're arguing that a jury should determine whether or not they could anticipate somebody slipping on a slope?",
  "Counsel, you keep -­ I -- I just want to understand exactly what you claim the burden is, because I thought that what the circuit and the courts below said was that there was no evidence that any candidate actually didn't speak or didn't fund raise because of this law. There's some claims to the contrary in your briefs before us, but I've looked for that below, and there doesn't appear to be any record of that. So, I'm going to start from that -- that assumption, that there was no evidence in the courts below that any candidate stopped speaking because of or stopped collecting money because of this. So exactly what is the burden otherwise? What are you claiming the burden is? The burden is that the -- that the government is choosing to give someone else money?",
  "I -- I want to go, not rely on Davis, but just articulate for me, assuming my hypothetical, the burden is that you have to delay fund-raising or delay expenditures because you're choosing to do so.",
  "No, if you spend it -­ if you spend it at the time you want to, you collect it at the time you want, no one's -- the law's not telling you not to do it. You find it an advantage not to do it, correct?",
  "Because your opponent won't speak as loud and won't respond, correct?",
  "Counsel, I thought their expert didn't aggregate them together. He did it regionally, not store by store, as your expert did, number one; and, number two, that he performed, as accepted by the district court, and affirmed by the circuit court, any number of controlled variable comparisons, including job history, job ratings, and other things, and found that the disparity could not be explained on any of the normal variables that one would expect and that the disparity was significantly much higher than the 10 competitors of Wal-Mart and what they were paying their labor force. So, what is speculative about that, number one? And, two, why is that kind of statistical analysis inadequate to show that a policy of some sort exists?",
  "Well, that begs the legal question, which is -- you're right. Ultimately, you may win and prove to a factfinder that this analysis is fatally flawed, but what the district court concluded was that on the basis of your expert, whom he discounted because your expert was -- was basing analysis on -- on premises that the court found not acceptable, that there was enough here after a rigorous analysis. What's the standard that the court should use in upsetting that factual conclusion?",
  "Counsel, would -­",
  "Would that bar the (b)(2) class? Meaning if their claim is, as they state it, that they're seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against a discriminatory impact or -- case or a pattern and practice case, wouldn't that have value and wouldn't that value be, standing alone without the damages component, be that the plaintiffs who come in later have a presumption that discrimination affected them and the burden shifts to Wal-Mart to prove that there was a nondiscriminatory reason?",
  "Even if they did, why couldn't you separate out the (b)(2) issue from the (b)(3) question of whether monetary damages have enough common facts and law to warrant a certification under (b)(3)?",
  "So, would you address the -- address them separately for me, and tell me why a (b)(2) class couldn't exist only on injunctive relief? And if it can, if you're conceding it can, then is your attack merely that the monetary component of this, the back pay -- which, you know, I know the dispute on whether that's equitable relief or compensatory relief or not -- why that just can't be separated out and put into the (b)(3) claim?",
  "That begs my question. Are you talking about any monetary relief? You're -­ you're claiming, I'm assuming, that monetary relief includes equitable relief.",
  "The Fifth Circuit has described a test where it doesn't use the predominant question; it uses the incidental test. What's wrong with that test?",
  "I -- that's where I'm going to. Would you accept that incidental test as appropriate to the question of when monetary damages predominate or don't?",
  "What would the injunction look like in this case?",
  "Counsel -­",
  "Counsel, I'm -- I'm a little confused, all right?",
  "Because you're saying an individualized hearing is impossible, but that's exactly what you're saying you're going to do, only through statistics.",
  "You're going to say through my statistical model, I will be able to identify those women in the class who are deserving of pay raises. What that doesn't answer is when in this process is the defendant going to be given an opportunity to defend against that finding?",
  "Because you're -- are you suggesting that the district court would appropriately bar a defendant where there's no proof of intentionality with respect to not keeping records, that it was intended to stop these women from collecting money, et cetera? When are they going to get a chance?",
  "And if they're going to get a chance, isn't that an individualized hearing?",
  "No, no, no. That sounds like you're saying their only opportunity will be on the model.",
  "They will be precluded from attempting to show any particular evidence that a particular decision was not made?",
  "You're not answering me.",
  "You're -- what you're saying is we're going to preclude them from doing anything but offering a mathematical model -­",
  "-- because otherwise it's going to be too hard to have individual hearings.",
  "You don't -- you don't seriously contend that if a plaintiff, if a policy were found or practice of discrimination that a woman couldn't come in and say they put X in, I had a longer history at Wal-Mart, I had far superior job ratings, I had no criticisms of my work, and I wasn't promoted. Wouldn't that be enough for her to show that that policy influenced her lack of selection?",
  "And your personal database has all that information. So, why is it impossible to try these cases other than because of their large numbers? That's a different issue.",
  "I think he's just making your -- their point, which is if they started paying women the same as men, they might get more diversity.",
  "Well, that's the whole issue that's in dispute.",
  "Going -- going back to Justice Alito's question: Obviously, the statute's not written to say the intent to preclude a witness from talking to law enforcement officials. If it were that simple about a Federal crime, then it wouldn't matter whether it was likely, possible. All that we have -­ know is that the witness was -- that the killing was intended to stop them from talking to law enforcement, period. So, clearly, (g) has to have a meaning different than merely stopping from someone talking to a law enforcement officer, because there has to be some connection to that officer being a Federal officer. So, going back to Justice Alito's question, how do you define the intent? What is the defendant's intent? If he doesn't have to know it's a Federal officer, what does he have to intend?",
  "Articulate what the intent has to be.",
  "Does the defendant have to know that? That's my question. Does he have to intend to stop the witness from communicating this information to someone that's related to either a Federal judge or a Federal law enforcement agent?",
  "When did they go to the Federal authorities after 2002?",
  "When did they go to the Federal authorities after 2002?",
  "I have one last one, the plain error question. Neither your brief -- I think you're taking the position that simply because we granted cert, we've accepted there's a plain error; is that your position? Because you haven't really defended against a finding of plain error.",
  "So we're really -­ granted cert to give an advisory opinion?",
  "Because if there's not plain error, how do we reverse this court below?",
  "So, what you're suggesting is that we announce the standard, hopefully different than the courts below for your sake, and then remand to then let the court apply the new standard?",
  "And if it's not, what's the other?",
  "How could we do that unless we found there was plain error? And how can we say there's plain error when this question has vexed so many courts?",
  "I have to say to you that even if a bright-line rule is announced, the real work begins in deciding what evidence is sufficient to meet that burden.",
  "What do you see -­",
  "I'm a little bit confused. Tell me exactly why you see a difference between \"realistically likely\" or \"reasonably possible.\" Tell me -- tell me what fine line exists between those two and what quantum of evidence more you would need under one as opposed to the other.",
  "Tell me what the difference in proof would look like.",
  "\"Likely\" is proven?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, but you still had to prove, didn't you, or wouldn't you have a measure of obligation to have a witness get up on the stand and say, the FBI always looks at bank robberies? In the absence of that, aren't we asking the jury to speculate that, merely because it can be a Federal crime -- bank robbery can be both a State and a Federal -- that it's reasonably possible it would go, not everything you yourself said not everything goes to the Federal government, so -­",
  "I'm not sure I understand your answer to Justice Kagan's hypothetical. We -- we -- there's no proof that this particular officer who was shot was going to pick up the phone to the FBI. He may have overheard this. He would have called his fellow officers, and somebody, probably his supervisor, or the DA's office was going to make the decision whether to call the FBI. So, how is that different from the cemetery caretaker, who is going to call it in probably to 9-1-1, and he doesn't particularly have an idea of who's going to get involved or not because it's really not his issue. Why is there a difference between those two situations? And isn't the question, going back to what Justice Breyer asked, was, what's the likelihood that this is going to get investigated by the Federal Government? Why is it reasonably possible? Anything is reasonably possible -­ or almost anything.",
  "So I guess then your burden is only to show that it's a Federal offense, because why you need to show anything else because \"reasonably possible\" encompasses every single Federal offense or anything that could be termed a Federal offense.",
  "Do you know what the difference was between the State and the Federal penalties?",
  "Excuse me. There is a legal obligation to advise the FDA when you have reports of adverse results that suggest the label may be wrong. Are you disavowing your -- your obligation to tell the FDA when something's wrong?",
  "So please describe what the difference between that obligation and the obligation to suggest a label change when you know it's been misbranded.",
  "So what's -- so what's the conflict with State law, meaning you have an obligation to keep your label as it is, but if you also have a Federal obligation to advise the FDA of adverse -- of adverse results and of needs for change, why can't you then comply with a duty to warn obligation because you can go to the -- to the FDA?",
  "Counsel, do you think -­",
  "Counsel, do you think Congress really intended to create a market in which consumers can only sue brand-named products? Because if that's the case, why would anybody ever take a genetic? And why in the world would Congress create a different, or even the FDA, a different obligation on brand-named products or generic products to give them information about labels when they know there's been a misbranding? What the government says is you start by instructing a jury that there had to actually have been information that proved a misbranding. That's the first step of the tort suit according to the government. So why should you or why would Congress or the FDA have intended to treat the two differently?",
  "Counsel, all you're arguing is that this rule will have little practical effect, that there is going to be very few lawsuits that could be brought against your companies because you're just not going to have enough information to suggest a label change.",
  "Can you, and I think that this is part of what your adversary has been talking about when he says we don't usually receive adverse incident reports; they go to the brand manufacturer. So tell me what you view as your main obligation. This is a little bit like what Justice Scalia was asking. You come in and you say there's a drug, it has an adverse effect, there should have been a warning about it because look at all of this literature, look at all of this proof -­",
  "-- that this drug is, in fact, in some way plausibly or otherwise causing this incident, and the label was inadequate to tell me not to do it. Is that your obligation completely? You don't have an obligation to show that this particular manufacturer knew that in some way?",
  "Am I -- am I to understand -- and I think I am understanding you. There is a legal obligation in the statute to report adverse events. You're saying that the statute also requires every manufacturer, of whatever type, to monitor the safety of the drug they're selling? Is that what you're saying?",
  "And if reasonable evidence, whether directly in their possession or in the marketplace -­",
  "Counsel, the difference, as I see it, is that they're not suing you for a failure to tell the FDA. They're suing you for a failure to tell them. It's you who are interposing a defense and saying I manufacture a dangerous drug, and I have no obligation to monitor and ensure that the label is accurate. And what the government is saying, as I understand it is, no, you do. Yes, we understand you want to sell more cheaply, but not at the cost of public health. So what's wrong with that argument?",
  "Counsel, underlying that question is an issue that I think Justices Ginsburg and Scalia were asking. Technically feasible is different from economically ridiculous or economically burdensome. How does that, \"economically burdensome\" -- does it get considered by anyone so that -- because one could imagine, as Justice Breyer said, that a competitor could come in and say, now, build me the Taj Mahal as an entrance facility or as an interconnection facility. So, is there anyone controlling for that latter issue?",
  "Counsel, I know you're saying that, but everybody's arguing about what the -- what the TRO and the TRRO say or don't say. But I go behind that and I go -- I think the Government's entire argument is not based even on those. It's based on the LCO regulations themselves. They've cited two, which is 51.305 and 51.321. They're not relying on those TROs in their back and forth there; they're relying on the regulation.",
  "So, how do you address their point that there are two different charges at issue?",
  "That one -- that interconnection by definition includes transport. It's hard for me to think of how it doesn't because they've got to travel from one place to another, so --",
  "Well, now you're reading limitation into the statute. All the statute says is you're obligated to provide interconnection services. It doesn't say how or limit it only to things that are not bottlenecks or things that are bottlenecks. It just says you're obligated to do X. And that's what the agency's saying.",
  "I -- in that regard, in all of these years, are -- you mean to tell me there is no other incumbent that has provided interconnection services at an entrance facility and charged TELRIC rates?",
  "But that's -- that's (c)(3).",
  "(C)(2) says you just -- you have to. It imposes an affirmative obligation to provide interconnection -- an interconnection.",
  "But wait a minute. Does -- don't the regulations now and the commission's TRO, et cetera, say that an entrance facility is within your network? You haven't challenged that.",
  "And it's now they --",
  "If they're in your network --",
  "Figure 4.",
  "I guess the problem I'm having is that you tell me on the one hand that up until, what, 2005, you were always paying the cost plus profit rates, the TELRIC's rates, for interconnection at a -- at an entrance facility.",
  "Well, it did in its footnotes. It said -- that's what the whole dispute is about, which is we're not changing the obligation to provide interconnection services. So, it said it clearly.",
  "Its view --",
  "If we accept their policy arguments, what does that do to your main argument?",
  "Because I think they've explained it to my satisfaction why this is necessary because (c)(2) requires interconnection. Congress has made a judgment that interconnection is the mainstay of competition in this area. So, if I accept that --",
  "Counsel, I -- I -­ having read some of those cases that you've cited that you claim weakened or eliminated the burden of proof standard, most of them didn't quite eliminate it. Virtually all of them added an instruction to the jury of some sort that said that the application of the standard should take into account the fact that the PTO did not consider evidence -- did not consider the prior art relied upon in the invalidity challenge. You didn't ask for such an instruction in this case; is that correct? And if you didn't, why isn't that adequate to convey the point that you're trying to convey, that a jury should, in fact, consider that the PTO never got to see that prior art?",
  "But other judges give a slightly different standard. They give a clear and convincing standard, and they add a separate instruction that tells the jury, in applying that standard, you should consider the fact that the PTO did not see this evidence. You didn't ask for that?",
  "You just asked for the preponderance of the evidence charge?",
  "Why?",
  "I mean, you said to the judge below: All you have to charge is preponderance of the evidence. You never told him: Please explain to the jury that under clear and convincing they can take into account -­",
  "Isn't there a lower court that has ruled that that standard, in the manner that you've articulated, could confuse a jury as to what clear and convincing evidence means?",
  "In fact, it's not clear and convincing evidence if you phrase it that way, that it's something less than that.",
  "And so, the amici here have suggested alternatives to that language that you're endorsing -­",
  "Counsel, the problem with your argument, assuming its validity, is why do you need the second sentence? If Congress was intending to sweep up in the use of the word \"presumption\" the need to overturn it by clear and convincing evidence, why did you need the second sentence saying that the other side now bore the burden of persuasion?",
  "Counsel, aren't -- isn't punishment and rehabilitation often flip sides of each other? If you read what the judge said here, his comment was this man -- or this woman, I'm sorry, has been involved in a series -- escalating series of serious offenses. Logically, she has to be put away for a long time unless she gets rehabilitation because there's going to be no deterrence otherwise. And so, what the judge was basically saying, in my judgment -- and I don't know why it's not just the flip, which is without -- without drug treatment, we can't deter her. And so, this crime, given her background, deserves this kind of sentence. One of its by-products is a drug treatment program. How different is that, or do you really think that a judge who knows that someone is going to get a rehab program if they serve 50 months and the sentencing range is between 45 and 55, do you think that they're going to take 50 -- they're not going to choose 50 if they understand that there's no chance for this person to be deterred without drug treatment?",
  "That's a -­",
  "Well, wait a minute. That's the whole point, because what the judge said was if she doesn't get treatment, she needs to be in jail a long time because her crime was serious, because she's just going to continue committing crimes. There's a chance if she gets it that she won't, but without it, for sure, she's not, and this is the just punishment she deserves, this amount of years. That's how I read the transcript.",
  "But you're ignoring his lengthy discussion talking about she was really going down the wrong road here. I understand her troubled past. She gets involved in alien smuggling, which is very serious. He is talking at length about the seriousness of the crime. So what I'm asking you is, if what we see is a judge who's talking about a flip situation, i.e., you need to punish strongly because the crimes are serious, and an added benefit is rehabilitation, why does that violate 3582? What about 3582, in using the word \"recognizing,\" stops a judge from saying without something there's going to be no deterrence?",
  "So you're talking only about when rehabilitation is the primary purpose? So the issue here is what was the judge's primary purpose?",
  "So now we want some talismanic words where the judge says what I said? This crime is so serious that the sentence should be X amount, and now talismanically I'll say rehab is just a side effect, really the sentence is motivated by -­ completely by punishment?",
  "Counsel -­",
  "Counsel, can a judge who believes a defendant is dangerous to the public and thinks that that danger can't be abated without a drug treatment program, could the judge nevertheless under 3553(a)(2)(C) say, because of the danger to the public, I'm going to lengthen the sentence?",
  "And in the hopes that a drug rehabilitation program will be available? I don't care if it is or it's not; this person's dangerous to the community otherwise?",
  "So what's different than what the judge did here, where he talked about, explicitly, on page 26, \"it has to deter\" -- the sentence has to deter criminal conduct by others, and it has to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and the sentence -- that's a big factor here, given her failure to appear and what she did out on bail. So, if the sentence has a dual motive, is that okay?",
  "Now, I know that you're -- there's -- there's an issue about whether this transcript can be read as a dual motive or not.",
  "But my question is, is a dual-motive sentence permissible?",
  "Isn't that what \"dual motive\" means? Unless -­",
  "You want talismatic words. I would have picked the sentence anyway.",
  "Can you articulate an interpretation of this provision that would guide appellate review? If rehabilitation can always be a factor, then when and how does a court of appeals determine whether a judge has abused his or her discretion? You said 5 years, if the guideline range presumably is 24 months and the judge adds 5 years. But how do you define that? The simple answer is if the judge is imposing the sentence because of rehabilitation, they can't do that. Is that what you're arguing or are you arguing they can do it except within a range? I'm not quite sure I understand how far you're going.",
  "Counsel, this makes a lot of sense when we're talking about huge disparities in a guideline sentence, versus one where the judge goes outside the guidelines or imposes a greater sentence than otherwise the guidelines would determine for rehabilitation purposes. But not infrequently guideline ranges are within very narrow scopes, and in fact there are some prison advantages that you get from being sentenced to a year and a day that you don't get if you're sentenced to 12 months; and district courts routinely will choose between a year and a day or 12 months based on knowledge about what might be available if you're there for over a year. Why is that wrong? What would be the difference? You see, I'm having a hard time in this case, because if a judge comes in and says guideline range is 50 to 60, I think in the middle is perfectly fine, I just don't know whether I should give him 54 or 55 months, but I know that at 55 months there's this kind of program available. I'm going to do -- I'm going to -- you know, it is -- judging is not so precise that you know exactly where to go within the small ranges, and so there are many factors that influence that decision. Why should we announce a rule that says to a judge in those situations, don't give him that extra month?",
  "Counsel, all of the statutes relating to these funds use the word \"trust.\" Not one statute defines trust and says in any way this is not a fiduciary relationship. To the contrary, in fact, most of the statutes require what would be consistent with fiduciary obligations, and at least one of them that you rely on says \"but not limited to.\" So the issue before us doesn't involve a competing sovereign interest by the U.S. You've conceded that in your cert petition. The circuit below said this is not a case where there is an independent sovereign issue governing the U.S. activities. Just explain to me what's the rationale that would permit a trustee of a trust fund to withhold from the beneficiary the kinds of documents that relate to the management of the fund? If the funds exist for the benefit of the Indian tribe, why aren't they entitled to management documents?",
  "That's the part that doesn't make -- that you're not explaining.",
  "But in both -- in all of those cases, counsel, it was a limitation related to competing interests, meaning it was recognizing that there are potentially moments in which an attorney is acting both in the interest of the government and in the interest of the tribe.",
  "But that was a jurisdictional question, not a question with respect to -- to the -- to the obligation. You're not seriously suggesting that if you're a trustee of an Indian fund that you can breach your fiduciary duty by simply not exercising care in your investment strategies. So some form of -- of duty exists.",
  "-- from the common law, and the common law has to define that.",
  "And so why would, if it imposes those duties, protect you from disclosing items that might -- attorney confidences that go to that very act, the very act of investing in the way, even under your definition, that the trust requires you to?",
  "But this argument, frankly, would be -- we wouldn't have any need for 501, because if as an evidentiary rule the government is always different, then there is no situation in which fiduciary duties in common law would ever exist.",
  "Is there -- is there any greater value to a fiduciary duty than to manage the account for the benefit of the beneficiary? That's the very essence of what a trust means, and so I'm having a hard time understanding not a competing interest situation where you're addressing a different statutory requirement, but merely -- and that's what this case was presented as, merely the management of the trust. So what you're, it seems to me, you're arguing is there is no duty. You're saying it's all defined by statute only, but you're rendering -- there's no need to use the word \"trust\" because it wouldn't be a trust.",
  "There were no prospective, is that -- did you -­",
  "But aren't you confusing, just following up on the Chief Justice's, ownership with access? FOIA itself doesn't make these records less -- the government doesn't own them less merely because FOIA requires them to share it with other people. So the ownership interest is not the defining legal obligation.",
  "Counsel, doesn't a lack of response to a disclosure -- couldn't it be in some situations reflective of an inefficient market?",
  "Why is it? Why is this case -- why can't you pigeonhole this case into that argument, which, it appears what your -- what the Respondents have done is move away from the loss causation proof and gone to the issue of whether they rebutted reliance or not.",
  "How do you see or what difference do you see between their loss causation evidence and an inefficient market? Could they -­ assuming there was no stipulation in this case, do you see any difference in -- in how they could use the fact that other information affected the market and not this one? Or is it your theory of the case that there is no evidence that they could marshal to show that this is an inefficient market?",

  "Could you -­",
  "Could you give me a place in the record where you actually said that, as opposed to relying on Oscar to argue that the Fifth Circuit was right in addressing as a merits question whether the plaintiff had proven loss causation?",
  "So you're not defending the rationale of the Fifth Circuit now? You're -­ you're sort of backing yourself into the reliance element?",
  "Well, could you explain to me why in this case it's not reasonable to believe, meaning assuming the truth, that there was falsity in the statements made, those alleged -­",
  "Assuming truth to those statements, why wouldn't a market react to corrective measures? Because what I see is a difference between saying it's an inefficient market or that the statements had no price impact for some other merits-related reason. But why does that tie to an inefficient market at all?",
  "So tell me why on its face, with the false statements alleged here, why would it be unreasonable to conclude that the market wouldn't respond to them?",
  "Well, but you conceded efficiency below, so you've sort of given up that argument.",
  "Counsel, I -- I have just one problem, which is under your theory, I understand it, if a State increases a penalty, makes what would have been a penalty for a misdemeanor now a felony, then that defendant is a career criminal, by your logic.",
  "So the person who thought that at the time they committed the crime they were committing a low-level crime is now a felon; is that your theory of the case?",
  "What -- what -- what logic do you think there is in that, why Congress would want to punish someone now for -- for criminal activity that they thought was lesser, and the State thought was lesser, at an earlier time, less reprehensible?",
  "I'm sorry, how do you see that? I thought the government had two alternative positions, the first being that you look at the time -­ at the time of the offense, at the conviction or, alternatively, it was arguing the way to take the position of the court below. But if you're going to use the present tense then you look retroactively to see -­ then you look to see whether the State would retroactively apply the new sentence.",
  "You understood their brief differently?",
  "I'm sure they'll tell you.",
  "Could I -- just to clarify your point. If there's been a modification of law that would have entitled him to a retroactive change in his sentence, although I'm not quite sure how that works, because if there's a modification, I thought it would only apply to a defendant who had committed the crime at that earlier time but was convicted at the present time. This defendant wouldn't have his sentence modified.",
  "Well, that's my question. Is your footnote related to that kind of individual only or are you saying -- or are you accepting your adversary's argument that the circuit below got it right? You look at the is as to what the sentence would be today -­",
  "-- if this person had committed the crime?",
  "I'm just trying to clarify whether you mean that the -- the modification had to have occurred, meaning that he was convicted, he got 10 years, and somewhere for some State reason, that actual final judgment was amended to include 5.",
  "Are or are you talking about -­",
  "-- accepting his argument that if he could apply for a change now -­",
  "Is this the first time you're advancing the argument, the first part of your argument?",
  "It doesn't appear as you did -- if you did it below; am I correct?",
  "Can you tell us whether changes in State sentences -- do the States routinely address retroactivity? Or do they leave it to their general common law? Or do you have any idea of what -­",
  "Counsel, that -­ assuming there's some form of privacy that relates to not being harassed because there's certainly legislative record of doctors or groups of doctors testifying to feeling harassed by detailers, if Thompson requires a less restrictive method, why does this have to be an opt-in rather than an opt-out? Because isn't an opt-out I call up and say I, don't want you to have this information? So isn't an opt-out less restrictive?",
  "Well, but, given the restrictions on speech, why is that a bad thing? Meaning you don't really intend to tell us that the State couldn't and wouldn't -- just like we got all of that advertising relating to the opt-out on telephone solicitations, virtually every American knew they could do it if they chose. Maybe some didn't, but a vast majority did. You can't really say Vermont's incapable of telling doctors in a mailing or in some public professional magazine, if you want to opt out, here's the number?",
  "Mr. Goldstein, I -- I understand your argument and I have a difficulty. Today with the Internet and with computers, there's virtually no privacy individuals have. Any transaction you do could be spread across the world instantaneously, and for the longest time catalogs would sell your name and address to other catalogers, and if you bought one product from one company, you would get a thousand catalogs from 50 million others. Today the industry is policing that, in part to get the State not to intercede, by giving you an opt-out option. And so, if you're a consumer who doesn't want a million catalogs, the industry is giving you the right to opt out, so they don't sell your address. If there is, as I see, some interest that the State legitimately has in protecting that part of the public who says, I entered into this transaction, I didn't really want you to sell my name, I didn't want you to do other things with it, all I did was this transaction, why can't the State say -- there is a difference in my mind between an opt-in and opt-out? Why can't the State say, your desire to enter a transaction in which you're doing just that transaction and not others is something we can protect?",
  "I read in one of the briefs that pharmacies were not permitting either patients and/or doctors to opt out; that if a patient came in and said I don't want my doctor's information sold, or a doctor has called the pharmacy and said, I don't want you to sell my information, the pharmacies are not respecting those limitations.",
  "So why don't I read this statute as simply doing what the consumer statutes are doing, which is giving people some control outside of the limited transaction that they're engaged in?",
  "So what you're saying I think to Justice Kennedy is answering my earlier question by saying the State cannot constitutionally stop the spread of information. So if the State said to the pharmacy, all you can do is fill the prescription, that's what doctors think pharmacies are doing, and that's all you can do, you're saying that's unconstitutional?",
  "So you're really -- you are really hinging your argument on the discrimination aspect -­",
  "-- that --that drug companies or detailers are being treated differently than any other user of this information?",
  "Could you do it -­",
  "Counsel, just to clarify this issue, because I don't know that I've heard you state it explicitly, the second part of this recusal statute that bars the advocacy of a measure in which there's an interest prohibited by the statute, it is your position that's advocacy in the legislative body?",
  "So it's only limited to getting up on the floor and talking about that?",
  "That person can still go outside and give all the press releases they want?",
  "What do we do with cases like Miller v. Town of Hull and Colson v. Grohman that have recognized retaliation claims because of speeches given during the casting of a vote? Would those cases still be viable if we decide that there is no First Amendment right in voting?",
  "How is that different from the minority people in the Chief Justice's? It only affects them when they're in the minority?",
  "So it only affects somebody if they fall within the strictures of the statute?",
  "Did you argue associational rights below?",
  "Why do you think the court didn't address it? Because it relied on the First Amendment analysis?",
  "If the relationship wasn't particularly special, no more special than any other political volunteer, why did that become front page news?",
  "And if your client didn't have a suspicion that he was on the edge of a law, why did he bother going to the city attorney to get an opinion?",
  "How will we ever write -- how will the Congress ever write a law that would be so clear that clients would never have to go to lawyers -­",
  "-- or that lawyers couldn't disagree about? We would have to invalidate virtually every law as vague.",
  "But you're not -- you're not denying that most laws would be vague -­",
  "Under that definition?",
  "That lawyers disagree on the conclusion of what the law means?",
  "I think Justice Breyer's question -- he can tell me if I'm wrong -- is whether that argument by them was actually raised below the way he is stating today?",
  "Whether that associational right of the political -­",
  "Excuse me. Were those --",
  "Were those amendments submitted before they took effect or after they had taken affect, like here?",
  "I'm --",
  "That's where I'm a little bit confused. The injunction here only stopped you from implementing the rate changes until you got approval from HHS in its administrative process that it was going to approve the amendment, correct?",
  "That's a separate question about whether the courts are required to give deference to an HHS finding. But the injunction here wasn't one that said you could never do this. It just said go finish the process, right?",
  "And if it's not, could you please -- you said yes, it is.",
  "But give me the theoretical foundation. If the Supremacy Clause doesn't -- I'm assuming you agree with your -- with Petitioner that it doesn't provide for a cause of action.",
  "Is that your position?",
  "Then what gets all of the cases that we've had since 1824 into this Court that have granted injunctive relief on supremacy arguments?",
  "Well, but we -- we have plenty that don't: King, Townsend, Carlson. We've had many others that are not dissimilar --",
  "-- from this case.",
  "So, go back and explain to me how all of those cases --",
  "What's the theoretical?",
  "So, go to your -- Petitioner's response to one of my colleagues, to Justice Scalia, when she said yes, if these providers decide to charge the old rate to their patients, the State will go after them. How is that any different than the cases where we're talking about railroads charging -- not charging customers more than a State commands because the penalty's too high, or --",
  "-- or those types of cases that fall into this pre-emptive category that you're talking about?",
  "But you haven't explained how that's theoretically different than the example I just gave you.",
  "Fighting -- why are you fighting Justice Breyer so much?",
  "I mean, it sounds like you are, and that's why I am having some difficulty. There are two points, following up on his and then my second question. Engage the Solicitor General's suggestion that this isn't a cause of action under the Supremacy Clause, but that it is a cause of action under some implied equitable --",
  "-- doctrine, okay? Which may square. And I'm now coming back to Justice Breyer's question. I agree with all you were trying to say about what the State did or didn't do here, but if it's a primary jurisdiction question, what's wrong with just saying that the court's power is limited under equity to issuing an injunction that gives the matter over to the administrative agency that puts in the status quo -- assuming there's some sort of violation of Federal law or seeming violation of Federal law -- a preventive injunction that just stops the State from acting until the administrative process concludes?",
  "What's wrong with that?",
  "No, no. They're saying you can't have any.",
  "But -- but Justice Breyer's question, I think, was slightly different, which is, what's the limit on --",
  "-- the court's power? And how do you --",
  "Would you engage the question that -- the approach the Solicitor General has been making, which is don't find a cause of action under the Supremacy Clause; find it in the court's -- an implied cause of action?",
  "Well, I might, if you continue in your earlier position that a Supremacy Clause cause of action would stop Congress from having a -- a voice in enforcement in cutting it off clearly, if Congress were to write a law that says no one can enforce this, either in damages or in injunctive relief. Your earlier answer seemed to suggest Congress didn't have the power under the Supremacy Clause to do that.",
  "If this were in equity --",
  "Could you clarify that answer? The -- are you admitting that there were no criminal enforcement options for the Attorney General under the Wetterling Act for acts committed prior to 1996? Is that what you're saying?",
  "And that included all individuals who had -- who had been convicted of -- of sex abuse acts before 1996?",
  "Excuse me. I'm -- let me go back to that question, counselor -- to that answer. Let's assume we accepted the Solicitor General's understanding of the rule, that it was illegal to travel -- that you had to be -- had to register from the start of SORNA. What challenge do you have left either to the interim rule in 2007 or to the final rules in 2008? What -- what challenge could you conceivably make?",
  "What would be the basis of that challenge?",
  "What would have obligated him to take your client out of SORNA?",
  "Could you -- could you tell me why?",
  "What would be an abuse of his discretion if he didn't take your client out?",
  "That -- we're in a circular argument.",
  "What would have commanded him to take your client out?",
  "You -- you would have to bring some sort of suit that said he abused his discretion. On what basis would he have -- what would be your claim of abuse other than I really want my client out?",
  "But what impact would the interim rules have had on you?",
  "Arrested for a misdemeanor to do what?",
  "I thought Justice Kagan's question was, what would have stopped Congress from just saying you have to register on the day of passage? There was nothing to stop Congress from doing that, correct?",
  "That's your reason for why they didn't do that. They didn't make it automatic, correct? That's your argument?",
  "Counsel, let's -- is there anything -- if I understand the Solicitor General's position, all your client had to do after SORNA was passed was, after a reasonable amount of time or upon his travel, to tell Missouri, which was his State of conviction, that he was moving. Correct?",
  "Right.",
  "No, I'm not assuming that.",
  "Would he have been in compliance with SORNA under the final rules today, the interim rules when they were passed, or on the date that he left if he had when he traveled, or a reasonable time thereafter, told his State of conviction that he had moved? Would that have been enough?",
  "What does he have to do in addition to that, under the interim or final rules?",
  "So, how do they know where to register? Do you agree with your adversary that -- that they have to register under SORNA?",
  "So, how were they supposed to know when or how they would register until the Attorney General acted?",
  "I'm not talking about those people.",
  "Not the people who can comply with (b).",
  "I'm talking about the -­",
  "You're starting from a proposition, counsel, it seems to me, that Congress necessarily and under all circumstances thought that it had to include pre-SORNA convictions. But I don't know -- yes, it wanted a uniform system, but it had State systems in place; it had an imperfect Wetterling Act in place. It had lots of other mechanisms in place to punish non-registrants. So, you're starting from the proposition that, by necessity, they wanted to include preconviction felonies. But I guess for those of us who believe in legislative history, and I know many of my colleagues don't believe in it or pay attention to it, there were two bills passed on SORNA, one a House bill that made it very clear, explicitly clear, that it applied to pre-SORNA conviction felons; and the Senate bill which under the label Retroactivity had the terms that (d) now has. Doesn't that suggest to us that Congress itself was unsure of whether it wanted to include the pre-SORNA convictions or not?",
  "I guess my problem is that you make an assumption, you continue to make an assumption that if the Attorney General hadn't acted -­ that the Attorney General was incapable of acting quickly. I mean, if the Attorney General had, within a few months, done what he ultimately did a year later or whatever time period after, had come out and said it applies; this is what you do; briefly, you register wherever you were convicted or -- et cetera, if you move or change your name -- then Congress would have accomplished the goal it wanted.",
  "How does this work now, counsel? How are you proposing this work? Right now, in the Federal system, a pro se litigant comes in and says, I have an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Most district courts say, ask the attorney to submit an affidavit, and then decides whether on the face of the claims there is reason to appoint counsel and hold a hearing. Under your theory, every State would be obligated to appoint counsel ab initio to check out whether there is the potential for an IAC claim?",
  "So, what you are essentially saying, every State is obligated to appoint an attorney on the first leg?",
  "Counsel, there is a huge reliance interest that has developed since Finley and its progeny, and States don't routinely appoint postconviction counsel.",
  "What are we going to do about that reliance interest and the burdens on States?",
  "Well, I know - -",
  "I know for a fact that most do in capital cases. But I don't know if that's the same figure for non-capital cases.",
  "Well, that -- it's only a cost if that second counsel, however it's secured, can actually make a credible or sustainable claim that appellate counsel, the first-tier counsel, was ineffective.",
  "Federal courts - -",
  "-- handle them routinely.",
  "Federal courts handle them routinely on papers, and most of them are denied. Is the State system different? Where first-level counsel, appellate counsel, postconviction counsel raises ineffective assistance of trial counsel. How many of those cases end up in hearings?",
  "Exactly. Very few.",
  "Could I go back to just clarify the record for a second?",
  "What authorized Levitt to file the postconviction relief motion? Wasn't he appointed simply to prosecute the direct appeal?",
  "What gave him the authority to file the 32 motion? Obviously, he didn't seek his client's approval, because the client when he received the motion said: I don't understand what you're saying; I only speak Spanish. So, what gave Levitt the authority to do what he did?",
  "By an attorney appointed just on the direct review?",
  "So, what would have been -- what was the tactical advantage of doing what she did? What conceivable reason was there for her to file the Rule 32 motion before direct review finished?",
  "Well, you know that she didn't. So, answer my question. What reason did Levitt have, strategic or otherwise, to file the Rule 32 motion?",
  "But she files essentially an Anders brief that says, I don't see anything. What was the -- what was the strategic reason for doing that? What conceivable strategic reason?",
  "You mean -- it makes no sense to me. That happens quite frequently on direct appeal where a variety of issues are raised, and the court -- the circuit courts or the appellate courts send it back to trial counsel to develop the record further. Your position is every time there's a sending back, that stops the need for effective counsel?",
  "Forty-seven do and the Federal Government does?",
  "What you haven't told me is a reason why he shouldn't have had effective counsel in the first postconviction proceeding? I mean, our entire line of cases under Douglas were premised on the fact that defendants would not be or couldn't be charged with the ability to prosecute their claims through direct appeal. Discretionary appeal, we said the likelihood is they could do it on discretionary appeal because they would have a record from below; they would have competent counsel below who would make the best arguments possible. They could then pursue their discretionary appeals because they had something to work with. But if your first chance as to present ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a postconviction proceeding, you have no record to work with.",
  "You've now told me that the vast majority of States -- 47, I think, is the number you gave -- put this into postconviction -- give counsel at postconviction review.",
  "Isn't it an empty promise if what you're giving is incompetent counsel?",
  "I mean, it's a - - Strickland is a very high standard.",
  "You're begging the question, which is how is the clerk supposed to know this? This is a functionary in the clerk's office who sends out notices, receives back mail that's not returned. There has to be some local counsel that does work.",
  "How is he supposed to know the difference between those that do and those that don't?",
  "Counsel, can I --",
  "Mr. Garre, I have two questions for you. Is that -- is this State the only one that doesn't appoint counsel in a postconviction capital case?",
  "But the vast majority do?",
  "In capital cases?",
  "All right. Number two, I thought there were two questions in this -- in this part of your case. The first is, don't we have to decide that abandonment, which you have termed, is cause --",
  "-- in a -- to excuse a procedural bar in a State court.",
  "So we have to decide first whether we extend Holland to this setting.",
  "That's the due process. I'm talking about -- yes, both we would have to decide. Assuming -- we have to decide the first question. Is --",
  "Will we extend Holland to this type of situation?",
  "Yes, I -- I understand.",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Garre, we don't know, we don't know. Isn't that just proof that if we were to find that Holland applied, a Holland exception applied, that we would have to remand this case?",
  "In that regard, there is one part of Holland that you don't really address, which is that Holland contrasted a statute of limitations issue with respect to access to a Federal court with a procedural bar and said that the State's procedural bar had interest of federalism, that we had to be cautious of ignoring a State procedural bar because of federalism. If we were to extend Holland in the way you want, how do we justify ignoring federalism in that situation?",
  "Is that surprising? I think Justice Kennedy asked your adversary: How often do appeals lie from the denial of State postconviction remedies?",
  "In a capital case.",
  "Counsel, could we go back to the Chief Justice's initial question? Let's assume the two letters went to Sullivan & Cromwell and came back \"left firm,\" as they did, and that the letter to Butler came back \"deceased.\" Would there be cause in that situation to excuse the State's procedural ground?",
  "Well, we -- we know that they -- that both lawyers in this case didn't move to another firm. Both of them took jobs that precluded them from representing this defendant. So, I don't know how I define abandonment other than I take a job where I can't work for you anymore.",
  "So, he had figured out that something had terminated the relationship between Mr. Maples and his lawyers?",
  "Counsel, could you tell me -- I'm assuming you've practiced in your State for a while.",
  "How frequent is it in the Alabama capital system that local counsel takes the laboring oar, or even an active participation, in the defense or actions of a capital defendant? Your -- the amici here says generally they did what Mr. Butler did; they just facilitated the -- the admission of the volunteer attorneys. Was that your experience?",
  "I guess the problem is, accept the rule; it exists. But if a lawyer says, I don't care, I'm not going to do whatever the rules required me to do, what more do you need for abandonment? If a lawyer comes in and says, I understand this is a rule of the court; I understand that I'm supposed to do x, y, and z; I don't care; I'm just not -- that's the question.",
  "What's the difference between \"I don't care\" and abandonment?",
  "We're not talking about the notice issue; we are talking about the abandonment question.",
  "Counsel, do you know how often Holland relief has been granted -- since it's very recent, but how -- how frequently Holland relief has been granted by the courts below?",
  "Don't you think being in custody itself is a circumstance?",
  "What's all this \"all-circumstances missed\"? I thought that our case law was fairly clear that all circumstances is a test for voluntariness. I thought the issue has always been under Miranda: Is the person free to go or not?",
  "So, since when have we imported of the language of voluntariness into the Miranda test? And should we be creating yet another test?",
  "So, go to the test of freedom to leave.",
  "You're taken from your cell and locked into a room -- and let's change the facts --",
  "-- and locked in a room and said: Talk to me; tell me. You have to tell me what happened. Is that person free to go.",
  "All right. So, what makes this case different? He's taken from a -- except being told that he could leave. If he had been taken from his cell, removed from the prison, his normal setting, taken by armed guards to another building and, with guards at the door, sat down and told talk to us about this incident, why would he think he was free to leave? There is one fact I'm taking out of it.",
  "Which is that he was told he was free to go.",
  "There -- as I see the record, he claims twice he said, I don't want to talk to you. And when he asked to leave at the end, it took 20 minutes, and they continued the questioning. Doesn't that counter the rest of what you're saying?",
  "The Chief asked you, in his question, which way does it cut? Meaning you seem to be advocating a rule that says merely because he's in prison is irrelevant, standing alone. I think your adversary is saying you can't take out the fact that this person's liberty is restrained from the equation. So, going back to my hypothetical, if you're forced to leave the prison, as this gentleman was, and put in another room, what presumption should you start with? Shouldn't the presumption be that if you're forced to go to another place, that you are in custody?",
  "What -- what would make someone who is forced to go somewhere think that they're free to go back, absent being told?",
  "But let's -- what would make any reasonable prisoner who can't move without an escort believe that they're always free to go back?",
  "Once they're forced to go from point A to point B.",
  "Well, you're going back to confusing coercion issues with custody issues, and I don't know that you have really answered Justice Breyer's question. Someone's picked off the street and told you have to go into this room, and questions are asked. Wouldn't we assume that that person is in custody?",
  "Well, but he didn't choose to go to that room. He was placed in that room. What makes him think that if -- if his jailers are walking him somewhere, that he's free to leave?",
  "The Ohio court -- or the -- I'm sorry. The court below had its own -- seemingly had its own absolute rule --",
  "-- that if you're told you're free to go, that that breaks the chain of custody, whatever that might mean. Assuming -- and the Sixth Circuit said if you are removed from the prison and questioned, you absolutely must be given warnings. Is there a middle ground, and what would that middle ground be? And what would be -- how would that middle ground affect the outcome of this case?",
  "Counselor, there was no limit here, meaning these foreign works were never given the opportunity to be copyrighted. Isn't that a substantial difference from the hypothetical that you're trying to proffer? You're -- the hypothetical -- and I think that's what Justice Ginsburg was responding to -- is you had a copyright, it expired, and now Congress wants to revive it. Isn't that different from not having had the opportunity at all and being given a term to exploit your work and protect it?",
  "The problem --",
  "I -- I know, but it didn't do it when it set up the copyright system.",
  "In 1790, counsel, there were three States that didn't give copyrights. There were other States, and you make a big deal in your brief about common law protection, but common law protection, particularly in New York, which you relied on, only extended to unpublished works. Once a work was published, it was no longer protected under the common law. That was true of most States. And some States gave copyright protection to residents of their own State but not to residents from other States. So, it took a whole body of public works and gave them copyright protection the day they decided to pass the copyright law. So, what are you doing telling us that there has never been a historical experience with Congress taking public works out of the public domain?",
  "Read those words to me.",
  "You just --",
  "-- well, you have to have a --",
  "I -- your reading of that passage is different than mine. I think it's a -- it's saying if -- whether you have or you haven't.",
  "If we disagree with your proposition, does your argument fail? If the historical work does not point to what you claim?",
  "In 1790. If Congress did what I believe it did --",
  "-- would your argument fail.",
  "It could have started in the place you want Congress to have started now?",
  "It said, moving forward, there's a Federal copyright. It didn't have to take things out of the public domain. We're arguing about whether they did or didn't. But assuming they did.",
  "You don't think that there are some foreign authors who didn't or wouldn't come into the U.S. market because they couldn't protect their works here and kept their works in other markets that -- in which it was protected?",
  "And it doesn't encourage them to sort of make investments?",
  "Why not?",
  "Foreign authors who decided not to exploit their works here wouldn't be induced to think about coming into this market because now they can protect their works?",
  "You're not answering my question. You don't think that this law induces those foreign authors to come here and promote their work?",
  "Counsel --",
  "It might be his incentive to buy it or not, but the question is the author's incentive to sell it here. Those are two different incentives. Whether -- you know, he could go anywhere and buy a cheaper book if he chose to take the trip or get on the Internet and find it. He could do that now. Copyrighted materials here go at a different price than they do elsewhere. That's not the issue. The issue is the author's incentive.",
  "Well, if you can't incentivize them, they're not going to claim their rights.",
  "They're not going to come and claim their rights. Part of this law is that they have to declare that they're interested in protecting their copyright here.",
  "Optional for them, but once they do, that's when they can sue a prior user.",
  "What is it that you're -- that you're referring to?",
  "You said there are limits.",
  "What --",
  "-- library, the day this law was passed, had to go and pick out all the books it had that were subject to copyright and throw them out, or do what with them?",
  "Stop them from circulation?",
  "I'm not sure. How did they protect themselves from infringement?",
  "Counsel, most of the circuits have recognized a ministerial exception. But they've, in one form or another, created a pretext exception. The reason for that is the situation that troubles me. How about a teacher who reports sexual abuse to the government and is fired because of that reporting? Now, we know from the news recently that there was a church whose religious beliefs centered around sexually exploiting women and, I believe, children. Regardless of whether it's a religious belief or not, doesn't society have a right at some point to say certain conduct is unacceptable, even if religious -- smoking peyote? And once we say that's unacceptable, can and why shouldn't we protect the people who are doing what the law requires, i.e., reporting it? So, how do we deal with that situation under your theory? Under your theory, nothing survives if the individual is a minister, no claim, private claim.",
  "The problem with that is that it doesn't take account of the societal interest in encouraging the reporting. And, in fact, if we -- if we define the ministerial exception in the way you want, we take away the incentive for reporting; we actually do the opposite of what society needs.",
  "How? Give me a theoretical framework for this.",
  "I'm sorry. Going back to the question Justice Kagan asked you, if one of these Protestant teachers that's not Lutheran led the cafeteria prayer, as they are required to, you're now saying that the law must recognize that lay teacher as a minister and apply the ministerial exception, even though the religion doesn't consider her a minister?",
  "Well, but that was the answer you gave. If she taught a religious class - -",
  "So, what is your definition of \"minister\"? Maybe we need to find out. So, it's not a title. It's really -- the only function -- you're saying anyone who teaches religion?",
  "Mr. Laycock, I'm not sure why the status of the individual matters under your theory. It seems to me what you're saying is, so long as a religious organization gives a religious reason of any kind, genuine or not, for firing someone that's associated with it, whether minister or not, that that invokes the exception. Am I hearing your argument right?",
  "All right. So, why is there a difference?",
  "So, you would say with janitors, you can get into the pretext question.",
  "So, you're limiting your test to whether that person is a minister. So, define \"minister\" for me again.",
  "I'm sorry. How does that -- how does that provide you situs on the adjacent waters?",
  "I see. So, you're saying you don't even -- you're not going - -",
  "So, how do you get to the water above the shelf?",
  "Instead of saying they're part of the shelf?",
  "I think the issue that Justice Kennedy was alluding to was the example the Ninth Circuit used: A pitcher on the mound throws a baseball and hits the batter. The situs is not the mound, but the injury has occurred as a result of pitching. And so, he's coming up with examples, and I think that's what the Ninth Circuit was saying when it was creating the test of a substantial nexus between the operation and the injury.",
  "And that's the part of your -- of your definition that gives no credence to that possibility.",
  "You may be arguing that as a factual matter what this man was doing on land was not a substantial nexus. That's a different issue than providing a test that limits injury to an operation solely on the shelf.",
  "Well, you're not -- you don't want a but-for test. Or do you?",
  "All right. You don't want a proximate cause test.",
  "Give me your definition of causation now.",
  "This is a new version of proximate cause, so - -",
  "A substantial nexus is just right?",
  "Do you accept your adversary's position that whatever causal -- you have to, given your status test. Where are you drawing your status test from? Meaning, obviously it's not from the language.",
  "You're not -- I would have just thought you would have taken it out of (b) subdivision (2), the term \"employer,\" almost the obverse, means an employer -- means an employer any of whose employees are employed in such operations.",
  "Would the -- would worker who went to the factory be covered by State workmen's comp?",
  "Counsel, how do you -- how do you get past Horn? Horn says that Teague and AEDPA are two different analyses that each case must undergo, that you start with, okay, what does Teague say, but you then look at what AEDPA says, and that each can serve as an independent bar. So, if that's the case, how do you get around AEDPA's requirement of a past-looking statute being one that involves the adjudication and whether at its time it was contrary to Supreme Court precedent?",
  "One part of your argument that troubles me is what if those 12 States that don't have the right to collateral review -- what do we do with the two Teague exceptions?",
  "Don't worry about the States that do.",
  "I asked -- my hypothetical was assuming there are some that don't.",
  "But we haven't decided whether actual innocence --",
  "Well, whether it's well established is another issue.",
  "Well, that statute didn't have, as this one has, a disclosure requirement that says you have a right to sue.",
  "Well, it could be a meaningful one.",
  "Does that mean that there's a violation of the statute the minute one of these organizations asks someone to sign an arbitration clause?",
  "A $1,000 penalty for the mere asking?",
  "Well, doesn't that reading, however, make suspect your claim that Congress would have intended -- without any discussion in the legislative history -- and our case law has said you have to read the intent to bar arbitration both from the language of the statute, its context, and its history. I just don't see any history here that supports your reading.",
  "Mr. McConnell, can we go to the issue of the class action? If we buy your argument that procedural and substantive rights are different, is it your position that you could seek a waiver of a class action even though this statute expressly contemplates class actions?",
  "So, your answer to me is that that is waivable. That's not a right contemplated by the right to sue.",
  "Well, you have to meet the prerequisites - -",
  "But you have to meet the prerequisites of a class action before you are entitled to seek one. But your position is that's not a protected right?",
  "Unless - -",
  "Unless we read the disclosure requirement of a right to sue to mean that you're entitled to bring your action in court. With whatever protections, procedural and substantive protections, that entails.",
  "But you're not -- you're not -­",
  "I -- I go back to Justice Breyer's question. What you just said made logical sense; the category of gun possession doesn't go in. Visa fraud doesn't become a crime of moral turpitude. But we have cases that have said, generically, manslaughter, which involves violence, is a crime of moral turpitude. Others have qualified sexual abuse of a minor. I don't know of anyone who would think that that category of crimes, whether you call it indecency, touching, or -- we've already said touching alone may not qualify, but my point is you now are saying, I think -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- that aggravated violent felons is an entire category, and anything that falls under that label can't be a ground of exclusion.",
  "That's how I read your categorical comparison now.",
  "All right. So, now -­",
  "-- why is manslaughter not a crime of moral turpitude?",
  "Well, I keep going back to my question. There's only one category now, aggravated violent felony. That's the only category you're looking at. It doesn't matter, in your judgment. That -- that is your test.",
  "If it qualifies as an aggravated violent felon, it cannot be a crime of moral turpitude.",
  "Let's go back to a concrete example following Justice Ginsburg's example. Someone is charged with a crime of violence, voluntary manslaughter. And would an officer at the airport say you're not admittable; that's a crime involving moral turpitude? Could the officer say that?",
  "And could he then waive that ground under 212(c)?",
  "Now -­",
  "Now let's assume that he did, that he waives that crime of moral turpitude. Would the government now put that individual in deportation and say this voluntary manslaughter doesn't meet the statutory counterpart test. So, for that very crime, we're going to deport you, even though we let you in, because it's a crime involving violence.",
  "Would you? Can you?",
  "Is that where your test leads you?",
  "Could I ask just a practical question? Does this issue go away finally when there are no more St. Cyr people? Meaning is there any -- there's no 212(c) anymore.",
  "Exactly.",
  "And so, really the issue that we have at the moment is whether your decision to effect what has happened now in the past, to do what Congress has done moving forward, and to avoid St. Cyr, is just to say, if it's an aggravated crime of violence, it just doesn't qualify anymore. That's what you are doing. You're not giving 212(c) to anybody anymore.",
  "But you were just saying if they're aggravated -- if they've committed an aggravated crime of violence, they're not getting it anymore.",
  "But this whole thing goes away once all the St. Cyr people have.",
  "If they weren't law-abiding, they would have committed a new felony that would render them inadmissible and -­",
  "I'm sorry. Are you --are you suggesting three different levels? Stripping naked: It's okay to stand 5 feet away, but not 2?",
  "All right. So, are you -- are you taking the position that it's the purpose of the search -­",
  "-- that's at issue?",
  "I'm still -­",
  "-- unsure if it's okay to shower -­",
  "-- and have an officer watch you shower naked.",
  "What is -- the greater intrusion is that you're standing 2 as opposed to 5 feet away?",
  "All right. If that's a line, that doesn't make much sense to me.",
  "Then let's go to the next line, which is -- that's one kind of search.",
  "The second is I think what some have called a visual cavity search.",
  "Whether you're going to have the individual open or expose private parts.",
  "Can you make an argument that that's different than just a visual search?",
  "Could I -­",
  "Counsel -­",
  "Could you clarify two points for me? The first is, was he admitted into the general population at Burlington?",
  "The prior charge against your client was the use -- involved the use of a deadly weapon. Assuming the prison knew this, wouldn't that provide the reasonable suspicion that you argue was missing?",
  "So, now you're feeding into your adversaries' arguments that what you're asking the police to do on intake, or the corrections facility on intake, is to investigate in that fine detail. They can't even look at the rap sheet -­",
  "-- and see use of a deadly weapon and say, ah, this guy could be dangerous?",
  "Would a manual search -­",
  "So, why do we change the policy? In Bell, we found that the policy was successful. Even though there were searches, contraband still got in. So, virtually every circuit -- in practice, the Federal system -- have been following this reasonable suspicion for minor crimes, and they've been fairly successful. So, why do we change the constitutional rule to let them do more?",
  "To invade more.",
  "I -- I understand contraband is serious, but most of the studies point to it not being on intake, but coming in through guards, coming in through contact visits.",
  "The great cause today is that from corrupt correction officials.",
  "Counsel, could I ask you something just in terms of your rule? I think your brief says your rule is you're not entitled constitutionally to any right of privacy in prison.",
  "If that's the case, are you saying that if the prisons decide on a manual search, every prisoner who comes in, correction officers can manually check their cavities, is that -­",
  "So, there is some privacy right?",
  "Can we go back to Justice Alito's question? Isn't one of the factors that we look at under the Fourth Amendment reasonableness? And should we be thinking about the fact that many of these people who are now being arrested are being put into general populations or into jails, sometimes not just overnight but for longer periods of time, like this gentleman, for 6 days before he sees a magistrate? Should we be considering a rule that basically says your right to search someone depends on whether that individual has in fact been arrested for a crime that's going to lead to jail time or not, whether that person's been presented to a magistrate to see whether there is in fact probable cause for the arrest and detention of this individual? I mean, there is something unsettling about permitting the police to arrest people for things, like kids who are staying out after curfew with no other -- based on probably nothing else.",
  "But what -­",
  "But what are we doing with the presumption of innocence? That's also a constitutional right. And so, shouldn't the degree to which a search is permitted be conditioned in some way on whether or not this person has been presented to a magistrate?",
  "Well, I mean -­",
  "The issue has to be certainly some misdemeanor. Some people charged with misdemeanor crimes will try to smuggle things in. The issue is how many of them would not have been found on a reasonable suspicion standard? I think Justice Breyer said, in the San Francisco study, it appears only one.",
  "But we don't have 20/20. We have how many years? Fifteen years since Bell -­",
  "-- where prisons have been applying the reasonable suspicion standard. And the most you can muster under that standard is one example of a case where someone has entered? At some point, empirical evidence has to mean something in terms of us judging the question of reasonableness.",
  "Well, I -- I do have a question about that today. I know that when -- it's bad to base your judgments on your own personal experiences. When I was a prosecutor, it took sometimes days to get a rap sheet. I understand that that's no longer the case today, that they're virtually almost always accessible by computers today.",
  "Counsel, isn't there a right to make a critical decision on whether to accept or reject a plea bargain, once offered? There's no right to demand one or to keep it, but isn't there a right to make that kind of critical decision?",
  "You can -- you can agree with that when 95 percent of the criminal cases are disposed of by way of bargaining?",
  "How can you talk about the reliability of a process or its fairness when you have an attorney who has fundamentally misgauged the law? How can a trial be fair when the attorney is going into a trial thinking his client can't be convicted because the shots fired hit below the waist?",
  "So, how can that kind of trial ever be fair?",
  "If Justice Breyer permits me to add an addendum to give the reasons why I might agree with him or a way of viewing this, as I read the lower court's decisions, they said there wasn't ineffectiveness because he was just trying to get a better deal. And I think that, translating what he said, the very reasonable view by the court was the prosecutor may think of a lesser charge, because if this guy really wanted to kill this woman, he would have hit her head or her chest, but he aimed low. So, he was really just angry and shooting enough so that if he hit her, okay, if she died, okay. But he really didn't have that heinous intent to execute, you know, a gunshot to the brain. And so, he was hoping to negotiate something better. If that's -- Justice Breyer is shaking his head. If that in fact -- if this is an AEDPA case, and we have to give deference to the State courts, doesn't that resolve this case?",
  "We have to give deference to their finding.",
  "You're -- you are begging the question.",
  "Okay? Because I think, yes, Justice Breyer's first statement, you have to prove the guy was going to take the plea, because there's no sense in -- in giving him a remedy that he - -",
  "-- would have never sought.",
  "All right? But it goes back to, I think it was Justice Alito or Chief -- or the Chief Justice's question, on what basis can the judge reject the plea? You have said earlier that he has to put aside any information he learned during the trial. And that's really the nub of this case. What are the grounds that you're proposing the judge can use to reject the plea?",
  "Counsel, what was the defense at trial?",
  "What was the defense at trial?",
  "Did he deny having committed the act of the shooting?",
  "At trial?",
  "Is it the case that, in most of the cases in which motions of this kind are brought to trial, judges -- if there is a defense of mistaken identity or of \"I didn't do it,\" that judges often find the defendant has not proven that they would have taken the plea?",
  "In most cases in which a trial is had, where the defendant is pleading misidentification or \"I just didn't do this act,\" in those cases, do most of the trial judges not permit or don't find that the defendant has met their burden of proving that he or she would have taken the plea?",
  "I thought in this case, and you can correct me if I am wrong, that your client told the attorney from the beginning: I did it; I want to plea.",
  "Counsel, sometimes one's experience has to be challenged. I, for one, have never heard of a case in which parties are discussing a plea, except in the most unusual of circumstances, and they advance a court date to enter the plea. In most cases, they just wait till the court date and tell the judge: I'm ready to plead guilty. This is such an unusual case, because the plea happens on day one. The court below is assuming that between day one and day five, or three or four, the guy would have come in and pled guilty, would have advanced the later court date?",
  "No, that's the second plea, but - -",
  "I'm talking about the plea deal.",
  "He commits the crime on the 29th or the 30th -- he commits a second offense on the 29th or 30th?",
  "All right. My point is, how reasonable could it be for the -- for a court to assume that the plea offer had been made and that he would have taken it before the January court date that was set?",
  "Are you taking the same position your -- I don't want to call him co-counsel - - Petitioner's counsel is taking, that you are not entitled to an attorney at plea bargaining, unless you waive your -- unless you waive your right to a trial?",
  "It's not a critical - -",
  "Counsel, I have a two-part question.",
  "All right. What exactly made his plea unknowing or involuntary, number one? And, number two, identify the right he was deprived of, substantive or procedural, by his attorney's failure to communicate the plea.",
  "I'm sorry. Just to make sure. I thought the earlier, the November 15th letter agreement - -",
  "-- always left it up to the judge whether to accept either the felony with shock treatment or the misdemeanor with 90 days. So, the judge was always free to reject either of those two?",
  "Binding the judge?",
  "He would have had to accept it.",
  "But he would not have had to accept the 90 days.",
  "What proof -- I'm sorry. What proof did you have in the record that the judge would have accepted the 90 days?",
  "Could you address the question posed earlier of what were to happen if there was a State law that gave absolute immunity to these private correctional officers, and that was the case before us. This particular State, it's undisputed, would not permit any kind of intentional or negligence suit against these officers.",
  "Interesting, because what you're proposing is a sort of State-by-State, circuit-by-circuit, presumably, existence of a Bivens claim or not. That's really the outcome of your position.",
  "Then I guess the question is -- yes, when you talk about an overlap of remedies, we have said that it doesn't need to be a matching one-to-one remedy, but you do need some degree of meaningful overlap, don't you?",
  "So, how -- define how much or how do we describe the adequacy of that overlap?",
  "Why are State remedies -- what of your clients' claims could not be vindicated under State law? And why is a Bivens action superior to a negligence action in California?",
  "You can't - -",
  "-- asking us to do is limit our inquiry to California?",
  "Limit it to California. What -- what - -",
  "They're saying don't look at what other courts will do; just look at the State you're in, the place you're going to make your claim, and figure out whether your claims are covered or not covered essentially in those -- in that State.",
  "Right.",
  "Mr. Pincus, you -- in answer to one of Justice Kagan's questions, you noted that you really can't find a case where a court relied exclusively on the grand jury testimony. In most of the cases that I've reviewed, there's a discussion that both non-grand jury and grand jury testimony was being relied upon; is that accurate?",
  "Could you tell me what -- the United States as amica is supporting vacatur and remand on the ground that there might be adequate independent evidence from the grand jury testimony in this case to sustain a cause of action. Do you agree with their recommendation? And if you don't agree, assume that we were to adopt the United States' position. What would be the independent evidence that you have that would support a malicious prosecution claim?",
  "Now, the court below took that into account and said: You're only relying on the grand jury testimony to prove the conspiracy, and that's not enough.",
  "I don't know what an independent cause of action could be, because it is the grand jury proceeding that initiates the action. So, why would the common law permit it unless it recognized that a complaining witness has to do something to get the grand jury up and running - -",
  "-- and go in and testify to something false to be liable for malicious prosecution? But the point I'm making is I don't see how your position differs from the Government's at all, and I'm not sure what -- how you could have independent guilt proven that requires anything more than proof, than the proof they proffered below, which was that this police officer issued subpoenas and took other steps to start the grand jury's process. And then you use their testimony at the grand jury to figure out whether it was false or not.",
  "So, explain to me again -- over here, Mr. Jones. Explain to me again why the act of sitting down with the prosecutor in his office and telling him a falsehood that leads the prosecutor to convene the grand jury and call you as a witness, why that act of meeting with the prosecutor and stating the false statement is not actionable independently? Or is it your position that that would be?",
  "No, no, no, no. He sat down, told the prosecutor exactly what he was later going to say in the grand jury. I rarely called a witness to a grand jury when I was a prosecutor who I hadn't spoken to before. Occasionally, I had to because of circumstances, but the vast majority you sit down and talk to and find out what their story is. Identical story before and after during the grand jury. Is the story before an independent act sufficient to bring a malicious prosecution claim?",
  "You have a time sheet that shows that the prosecutor met with - -",
  "-- the investigator?",
  "You have a time sheet. You mean, you need a witness to say they met together? You need someone to say that they talked before the grand jury? Assuming you have that much evidence, you think that's enough?",
  "Yes, exactly. Is that what you're requiring?",
  "Counsel, before your time expires, I'd like to ask one question on the merits. In Jimenez, we held that the most natural reading of 2244(d)(1)(A) is to read it like we read 2255. And we read 2255 to say that finality is reached when direct review -- and direct review concludes when the court affirms a conviction or denies a petition, or, if the defendant forgoes direct review, when the time for seeking such review expires. Isn't that what the Fifth Circuit did --",
  "-- with -- with 2244? It read it exactly the way we read it in Jimenez?",
  "I know, but you're not taking its holding.",
  "You -- you take language from it --",
  "-- but I read -- I read Jimenez to say that the court should be reading this alternative \"or\" language in exactly the way the Fifth Circuit did.",
  "Jimenez held that it's an either/or. If you do direct review, you do it from the time that it's final, that it concludes or, if you've forgone direct review, when the time for seeking review expires.",
  "Counsel, are -- are you accepting Justice Scalia's point that the certificate of appealability doesn't have to jurisdictionally describe the substantial constitutional issue?",
  "So, you're disagreeing with the question he posed to your adversary, that --",
  "You're saying that this was deficient because, both, it didn't indicate the issue and because it didn't describe the substantial constitutional question. MR. Delaney: Our contention is that a certificate of appealability must indicate a specific certificate of appealability under (c)(1).",
  "Counsel, I'm a little confused, okay? And I think it's what Justice Ginsburg was trying to get at, and Justice Breyer, which is: What you are requiring and you're saying the statute requires if, is that for the district court to always reach the merits of any argument presented in a habeas petition, to figure out whether it's a substantial argument before it dismisses on a procedural ground.",
  "And that seems to be what you're -- you're wanting to happen because a judge would have to say: I'm dismissing on a procedural ground, and I believe that the claim is more than nonfrivolous, that it has a substantial basis.",
  "How does that speed the habeas process in the normal cases? I mean, in my experience, what district court judges do is find the easiest way to dismiss something. If the speedy trial ground is the easiest, they go that way. I'm sorry. If it's not --",
  "-- and it's a procedural bar, they use the procedural bar. They don't create extra work for themselves.",
  "So, what do we do then?",
  "What happens if it happens?",
  "Does that make any sense? Isn't it easier to read it, the statute, the way your adversary suggests, which would protect both the right to direct review and the right to collateral review?",
  "Do you have any idea of how much the jurisdictional question plagues the courts below? Meaning, is it -- is it so complicated that people below don't really know what district courts are granting COAs on?",
  "-- and do -- circuit courts don't understand what the issues are somehow by the opinion below?",
  "Circuit judge -- or a circuit judge or judge?",
  "Yes.",
  "Counselor, does your position depend on police involvement at all?",
  "I'm -- if a private investigator shows a picture or -- that has no connection to the police, a company's investigator - -",
  "-- or the news media publishes a picture of someone that it thinks - -",
  "Now we've changed the language of Wade when it talks about intentional or unintentional. And you're suggesting that police manipulation always has to be intentionally suggestive?",
  "Even if the policeman tells you he wasn't really thinking or focusing on a distinguishing characteristic in the line-up?",
  "Could you tell me what you think would have happened here? There was a reason the police asked this defendant to stay put. They didn't want him to leave the scene, correct?",
  "In your judgment -- I think Justice Kennedy hit the nail on the head. My suspicion is that at some point they would have asked the witnesses in the building and engaged in a show-up. What's so different between intentionally doing the show-up and holding the defendant in the back yard standing there next to a police officer, so that anyone who wants to -- like this woman, who wants to find the guy, can just point to that one? What's the difference?",
  "No. I mean, the way not to skew it was to put him in the police car and just let him sit there in the dark. So, they intentionally made him wait at the scene of the crime. I'm not talking about whether this was necessary or unnecessary, because I think that a perfectly good argument could be made that the police acted reasonably and necessarily. All right? It makes no sense to move a defendant that far from the scene of a crime if you're not sure he's the one who committed the crime, he or she. But I'm going to the question of how do we define, if we write this opinion, manipulation without getting into a mens rea type analysis and adding yet another layer to Biggers?",
  "So, tell me -- they gave the hypothetical of the police pointing out the defendant out the window. But earlier you said it might be a different case if the defendant was two blocks away and they brought him back. Same scenario. They do that, bring him back two blocks; make him stand at the scene of the crime; and go upstairs, talk to the woman and she spontaneously says it's the guy standing over there. That would entitle the defendant to a Wade motion? To a Wade hearing?",
  "We're now -- we're now at mens rea again. So, what has surprised me about this case is in some ways the way the State court wrote this, because if the State court had simply said something like there was no unnecessary show-up here, they were just holding someone until they could figure out what happened, there was no suggestiveness by the police because the woman pointed out the window, throw out the motion, we wouldn't be here. The argument has become something else now because you're trying to define a level of intent on the part of the police to create unreliability that I think just complicates the inquiry.",
  "But I think that - -",
  "Well, what's happened is that your briefing and your counter's briefing is broader than I think needs to be on the facts of this case. But putting that aside, you've addressed this as the need for police manipulation. If you define it that way, then we do get into a mens rea discussion rather than what I think Biggers and Wade were about, which is are the circumstances created by the police unnecessarily suggestive.",
  "Counsel, there are a number of circuits that already follow your adversary rules. I think it's not just one or two. It's about five or six. The floodgates open there? How many -- how many suppressions of witness identification has occurred in those circuits?",
  "I'm sorry. I'm a little bit lost here. Your definition of \"deceit\" is a false statement with an intent for the other party to rely. And you don't see that when you file your tax returns that the government is relying on your statement to calculate your tax and to ensure that you've paid it? You don't see any reliance by the government on the truthful statements there and its collection of taxes?",
  "So, it also had to prove that the government relied? Is that what you're saying the - -",
  "I'm not even sure why, because under tax evasion you can be charged with tax evasion merely for avoiding the payment of tax. You don't have to make a statement at all. You can take the money from the bank, withdraw it openly, and stick it in your mattress, refuse to pay, and if somehow they find your mattress, you can be charged with tax evasion.",
  "Where's the false and deceit in that?",
  "If there's a -- if there are cases that say otherwise, what does that do to your argument? Of which there are many that say that the avoidance of taxes, tax payment, doesn't require an act of fraud or deceit?",
  "Excuse me. Are there any tax provisions that you think are not covered by the fraud and deceit section and the tax evasion section?",
  "Any tax crime.",
  "Felonies, I should say.",
  "Does that fall under tax evasion, or that's a separate statute?",
  "I cut you off. Which are the other ones?",
  "Mr. Lewin, you were cut off earlier when you were saying this reading doesn't hobble the President in the future. It says anybody born in -- in Jerusalem can have Israel listed, correct? What happens if there's a peace accord tomorrow, and Israel gives up any claim to sovereignty over Jerusalem? Is the President free to stop listing Israel on the passport?",
  "Or does he have to wait for Congress to change the law?",
  "So, you are hobbling the President with respect to situations that occur frequently -­",
  "-- as happened in Egypt, sometimes overnight.",
  "The Constitution requires ambassadors to be appointed with the consent of the Senate. It gives Congress the power of the purse. So, why don't -- why isn't the better view that we let Congress express its approval and disapproval in the mechanism set up by the Constitution to do so? Meaning, if the President recognizes a country that Congress doesn't want it to recognize, it can withhold approval of an ambassador. It could refuse to fund the embassy. It could do many other things. But what entitles Congress to trench on a presidential power that has been exercised virtually since the beginning of the country?",
  "General, what is -­",
  "General -­",
  "General, the tension that I see here, and I think it's what Justice Breyer is getting at, is the label's important, because if we call this a political question and don't address the merits, the outcome is that the President is saying that he's entitled to ignore the Congress. I don't know what kind of message that sends, but it's a little unsettling that a Court charged with enforcing the laws passed by Congress are basically saying we're not going to determine whether this law is constitutional or unconstitutional. That's what your definition of political question is becoming. And where does that stop?",
  "In what situations? Only in foreign policy do we decide not to -­",
  "But that's not what the D.C. Circuit did.",
  "Could you tell me -­ let's assume that a dozen nations said this designation on the passport is -- we view as an act of war; if the United States is going to do this, we're going to view it as an act of war. Would that then permit the President to ignore Congress's statute -­",
  "So, it's not the misperception that's at issue.",

So -- under your theory and the theory espoused in your brief, you could monitor and track every person through their cell phone, because today the smartphones emit signals that police can pick up and use to follow someone anywhere they go. Your theory is so long as the -- that all - - that what is being monitored is the movement of person, of a person, they have no reasonable expectation that their possessions will not be used by you. That's really the bottom line - -",

  "Tell me what the difference between this and a general warrant is? I mean - -",
  "-- what motivated the Fourth Amendment historically was the disapproval, the outrage, that our Founding Fathers experienced with general warrants that permitted police indiscriminately to investigate just on the basis of suspicion, not probable cause, and to invade every possession that the individual had in search of a crime.

I don't see that far in the future when those cameras are going to be able to show you the entire world and let you track somebody on the camera from place to place.",
  "So, if -- give us a theory. Is that okay for the police to access those cameras and look at you moving from place to place? And if that's okay, then why is this not okay? What is your theory of your case?",

But you also mention other things, and Respondents spend 90 percent of their brief arguing against the other things. But I just want to clarify those other things. Number one, was the testimony mixed testimony about whether the assailants wore a mask across their face or over their entire head?",
  "What's the best take on what the evidence showed that was presented on that issue?",
  "Could I ask you something? Who determines that issue of whether that's a dying declaration? Do we determine that in deciding whether the withholding of the Brady materials was harmful or not? Do we give deference to the lower court's determination of that? Do they have to decide whether it was a dying declaration? What's the standard on something like this?",

  "This is all a jury argument.",

  "Counsel, my worry is the following: You've read Cullen.",
  "You read Cullen.",
  "You read the dissent in Cullen. There has been serious accusations against the practices of your office, not yours in particular but prior ones. It is disconcerting to me that when I asked you the question directly should this material have been turned over, you gave an absolute no. It didn't need to be. It would have been prudent, but it didn't need to be. That's really troubling.",
  "That's the second prong of Brady. I said there were two prongs to Brady. Do you have to turn it over, and, second, does it cause harm. And the first one you said not. That -- it is somewhat disconcerting that your office is still answering equivocally on a basic obligation as one that requires you to have turned these materials over - -",
  "-- whether it caused harm or not.",
  "So, your -- your position is if the contract for purchase is consummated in some way on premises, that's pre-empted? And so, your answer to Justice Kagan and Justice Scalia is that if the purchase contract occurs before the animals arrive at the gate of the slaughterhouse, that that would not be pre-empted?",
  "Well, your whole argument is on express pre-emption.",
  "You've given up any argument on implied.",
  "Please tell me why you think the sale of the meat is expressly pre-empted. The Solicitor General says it's a closer question on sale of the meat because the slaughterhouse processes -- the law is involved only with the operations and -- of the premises and manner of slaughtering and has nothing to do with sales. So, why is the sale of the meat pre-empted?",
  "So, how about there's a law that says you can't slaughter cats, dogs, or horses, or you can't sell cats, dogs, or horses for slaughter?",
  "Or for consumption.",
  "Is that pre-empted?",
  "Is there a Federal regulation to that effect?",
  "Can you tell me, if it's okay for California to say you can't sell a nonambulatory animal and that that applies to everyone off the slaughterhouse premises, is that -- that's basically your position. So that if the purchase occurs on premises, then the person who's selling it, even if it's not the slaughterhouse, can still sell it on the premises?",
  "What a -- what a fascinating area of immunity. Now what we're saying to auction houses and everyone else is don't pass title until you get to the slaughterhouse.",
  "How do you define the scope?",
  "All right. So, now explain how under your definition it's not among at least one of those.",
  "I understood that the Federal regulation -- you can correct me if I'm misunderstanding -- is that if there is a suspect animal of any kind, that it requires a slaughterhouse to wait until the Federal inspector comes and finds out whether it's just suspect or it's something that can't be sold. And the reason why the inspection occurs, as I understand it, is that there are some diseases that are so contagious that if the inspector decides that that animal is carrying that disease, that the whole lot will be quarantined or otherwise destroyed. So, are you fighting with -- that that's what the purpose of pre-inspection under the Federal system is for?",
  "I'm having a hard time drawing that distinction. If there is a valid purpose to the pre-mortem inspection -- and I can't see how you can argue otherwise -- that there may be some diseases that are so contagious that the entire lot, ambulatory or nonambulatory swine, are affected, then I don't see how you can argue that you aren't trenching on the scope of the statute. If the scope of the statute is to ensure that meat is unadulterated and if there is the risk of contagion, that has to be within the scope.",
  "But you define the scope almost exclusively by purpose. And regulatory power is broader than purpose, I mean, as is reflected by the regulations here which are dealing not merely with animals that are adulterated but are dealing with the whole process of what happens from the minute they arrive to the minute they're sold. So, if we don't accept your limitation based on a scope being defined by purpose, how do you win?",
  "Well, you seem to be assuming that in effecting its obligations that only when it finds adulterated meat is that within the -- the scope. The Government has basically said: We've got to figure out if it is, and this is how we're going to do it: We're going to do it starting from the receipt of the swine through its sale, and we're going to have inspections all through the process, whether or not the meat will ultimately be sold or not; our scope is what happens in that slaughterhouse. That - -",
  "I'm sorry. You're not seriously arguing that the Secretary couldn't regulate in the manner California has, that the Secretary is powerless under this Act to say you can't slaughter animals that can't walk?",
  "The Secretary could do that?",
  "So, what do you -- what do you make of the ICC in 1916, in the Tiller case, regulating the lights that railroads had to have, locomotives had to have in the yard, and that those lights had to differ when the railroad was in use?",
  "I'm not sure I understand. It prescribed different lights when the - - when the locomotive was in the yard.",
  "That had nothing to do with safety in use. It had to do with safety in repair.",
  "Distinguish for me our reasoning in the Ray case.",
  "Distinguish for me the difference in the Ray case, that had to do with navigation and where we held that the agency, in ensuring safety in navigation, controlled design completely, whether in repair or not. So, how do we - - why don't we apply the logic of Ray to this case?",
  "That's the argument here, which is - -",
  "-- once you regulate what -- what the design or use of asbestos is, you're interfering with what available components there are for locomotives.",
  "So, you're giving up all of your other claims?",
  "I'm not sure I understand this. Are you talking about wearing a particular hazard suit?",
  "Are you talking about blowing out air? Are you talking about changing the design so the asbestos comes off without the dust cloud that's generally created?",
  "If the manufacturer is really not controlling the repair shop, of what value is this failure-to-warn claim?",
  "How -- they can't control whether they do or don't.",
  "So, you're okay - -",
  "I -- if I'm understanding your argument correctly, you're saying that if Napier controls the design of -- and a locomotive part, that includes any design defect that's encompassed by State law, whether it's design in its traditional sense or failure to warn.",
  "That's basically what the court below said.",
  "Just as a practical matter, I'm assuming that some railroad repair yards are owned by the railroad itself, so the railroad repair people are railroad employees, correct?",
  "Are there some that are not?",
  "They are not considered railroad employees, but they're considered something else?",
  "Just to be - -",
  "Just to be clear, under your view of the LIA, there could be other laws that pre-empt it or prohibit it? States can tell railroad yards put signs up, wear protective equipment, do whatever it is to protect the worker from this repair.",
  "They just can't tell them - -",
  "-- include a warning on the brake, or to - -",
  "Mr. Garre, what's the logic of your position? Congress does a whole study about how these harassing calls and e-mails and other things are to citizens, and all of a sudden it's going to limit the rights of those citizens to recover under the Act to those States that are going to say okay. Why even bother passing a Federal law if it was going to give States the option to protect against this kind of conduct alone?",
  "But generally it does. You've just admitted --",
  "You've just admitted to Justice Ginsburg nowhere else has it created a Federal right with a private cause of action in which it's limiting the protections of the Federal law to those States that decide they want to do it too. I mean, generally Congress creates a Federal right because they don't think the States are doing enough.",
  "Unquestionably. But it's -- it is unusual for them to create a Federal right with a cause of action and then limit its application to those States that say it's okay. I go back to my question --",
  "Why not simply say to the States, please, do something about this problem?",
  "Could you tell me why you seem to be taking somewhat contradictory positions? You seem to be conceding that this is not a Federal subject matter jurisdiction issue, but the scope of the cause of action that was created. The judgment was on the basis of lack of Federal subject matter jurisdiction. Aren't you trying to alter the judgment? And didn't you need to cross-petition to do that?",
  "So, you're saying that a State could, if it chose, say we're only going to award actual damages, not the $500 statutory --",
  "But it can. It could choose not to enforce that Federal right of action.",
  "Counsel, going back to Justice Breyer's --",
  "Counsel, are you taking the very broad position that this is an unusual State, as appears to be in three or four others where the States mandate that title insurance be at a fixed price? But in those States in which there is no such mandate, you seem to be arguing that Congress can't ever presume damages or injury, that even in those cases, the plaintiff has to come in and prove that they would have paid less. Is that the position you're taking?",
  "No, no. Please tell me, in those States in which insurance is not fixed by the State --",
  "-- what does the plaintiff have to do other than to say I -- they didn't disclose to me that there was a kickback, and I want the amount I paid for the service? Do they have to show something more?",
  "So, you are in fact arguing very broadly that there is no presumption of -- of injury in these cases, that the plaintiff still has to come in and prove --",
  "-- that in fact they would have gotten a cheaper -- a cheaper policy?",
  "Same thing with nominal damages and statutory damages? You're -- you're taking a very broad position now.",
  "So, what more does this plaintiff have to allege other than, if I had been told that this was a prearranged, tied product between the mortgage and the title company but that I had a right to get an untied product even at the same price, and I would have exercised that right if I had known? Would that be enough?",
  "Would that be enough in -- in Justice Breyer's example, of someone who says I received a call at midnight and it bothered me?",
  "So, you go back to your position that Congress has no power to give a cause of action on the basis of a statutory violation in which it is presuming injury?",
  "Well, certainly you couldn't -- you couldn't sue. But if I paid money that I would have -- and that I'm entitled to get back, then I've been injured, because --",
  "Counsel, I'm still having problems --",
  "Counsel --",
  "Counsel, maybe I'm just looking at this too simply. You pay -- your client paid $455 for title insurance, correct?",
  "She is claiming that she paid that money on the statutory assumption that the agent would disclose to her any kickbacks, correct?",
  "She said I didn't receive what I paid for, correct?",
  "I paid money, I lost the money, I'd have it back because what I've bought was a conflict-free --",
  "-- referral, and that's not what I got.",
  "Counsel, would --",
  "Well, the problem is that the injury here is the defendant's conduct, meaning if the nature of the claim, as is here, that someone has received a profit they're not entitled to, then the injury is the same. The profit belonged to the shareholders or the corporation, not to the insider. So --",
  "-- textually the nature of the claim here is the very injury, plaintiff's injury.",
  "Well, disgorgement is injury, meaning that it's something that -- that you're taking away from someone else.",
  "Tell me what logic there is in reading this as a statute of repose, other than your argument about finality and its importance.",
  "If we take your adversary's position that this statute of limitations was geared under an understanding that an insider would in fact make the requirements -- would file the statements required by 16(a), then it makes absolute sense to think of it as a statute of repose. But if Congress understood that some wouldn't do the statutory requirement and file in a timely manner, why wouldn't equitable tolling be a more appropriate way to look at this?",
  "Is there a public document that a -- that a shareholder can look at to see whether an insider has traded within 6 months?",
  "I didn't ask that. I'm going back to Justice Alito's question, which is how easy is it to find out without the 16(a)?",
  "That's a big thing. I didn't ask maybe.",
  "And so, what's the likelihood that a broker's going to turn you in?",
  "That's a very nice thing, but what -- how likely is that?",
  "How would the broker know that the -- that his principal didn't file a form he was required to?",
  "So, that was the --",
  "But tell me what was hidden from you in the prior filings in the academic literature that your adversary points to? All of the facts you've just recited have been written about extensively for years and years. So, what new information that you received told you that you should file a lawsuit?",
  "You mean to tell me that somebody's investing in the amounts that are invested here and they're not following the fact that this has been the center of securities litigation for years?",
  "Could you answer what I consider a very strong argument on their side, which is Congress, who creates a statute of repose for intentional conduct like fraud, why would they not create a statute of repose for what is a strict liability statute?",
  "Or the SG's.",
  "Counsel, how do you deal with section 346?",
  "I read 346(b) to say that, unless the estate is a separate tax entity under the code, that the debtor, not the estate, pays State and local taxes. This is totally contrary to what you're saying, but the language of 346(b) --",
  "-- basically answers the question against you with respect to State and local taxes.",
  "So, the debtor is going to pay.",
  "And so, when this says whenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides that no separate taxable estate shall be created in a case concerning a debtor under this title --",
  "-- chapter 12 doesn't create a separate taxable estate.",
  "And that the income, et cetera, shall be taxed to or claimed by the debtor under State or local law.",
  "This -- this is hard for me to understand, given the last line. \"The estate shall be liable for any tax imposed on such corporation or partnership, but not for any tax imposed on partners or members.\" By the logic of that last sentence, it seems to me that the preceding section is not looking to the estate, but to the debtor, to pay the taxes.",
  "So, why -- why would the last sentence be necessary?",
  "I'm going to ask the Government this, but are you aware of any circuit split or any cases below that have accepted the Government's arguments that chapter 12 involves prepetition debts only and that don't pay administrative expenses postbankruptcy?",
  "A different question.",
  "The Government's now saying that chapter 12 involves only prepetition claims.",
  "And it's basically, by that argument, saying it doesn't involve and can't involve administrative expenses. That's how I read their argument.",
  "And so, I'm asking is -- are there any courts that you're aware of below who have been presented with this argument, outside of the tax situation, who have accepted it?",
  "Who have failed to give priority to administrative expenses?",
  "I'm not asking you to defend their position.",
  "It's just such a broad position that I'm trying to understand if there's a split out there that we are unaware of.",
  "So, can we go back to the issue that gives me trouble?",
  "How to read \"incurred by the estate.\" If the estate doesn't pay taxes --",
  "-- how could it be incurred by the estate when Congress, if it intended what you're saying it intended, could have said \"incurred during bankruptcy\"?",
  "Could you turn back to -- before you answer my other question, could you finish your thought on what you're doing with wages? Are they given priority or aren't they? If you're saying they're not -- if we accept your reading of this, employee wage taxes are not administrative expenses.",
  "Counsel, before you finish, could you answer my question of what impact your broader reading, your chapter 12, affects only prepetition debts? What else is that kind of holding going to affect? Your narrow alternative holding affects just this issue. That broader reading -- I worry about a broader reading when I don't know its impact.",
  "But the problem with that argument is that the two are used interchangeably by everyone. Congress, the Court --",
  "The government in many situations, given the broad definition of \"claims\" --",
  "-- the only logical conclusion is that it includes a subset, a liability created by administrative expenses.",
  "I'm a little bit confused by that because in your brief, the Solicitor General's brief in Doe, it described the earlier version of general damages in the following way -- and I'm quoting from your brief there: \"The general damages provision in the Senate bill likely derived from the common law of tort of invasion of privacy where general damages may be awarded as\" -- quote -- \"'presumed damages,' without proof of harm.\" So, I think there in Doe you argued that general damages presumed injury. But that's very different than, I think, the question Justice Ginsburg was asking you. It's -- and I read your brief and your arguments as sort of an -- an assumption that if you suffer nonpecuniary harm, you haven't been injured.",
  "There's a big difference between presumed damages and proven injury. In Gertz, we reference the common law tort as requiring actual proof of injury for emotional distress. Most State laws say you have to prove the emotional distress. We're not presuming the injury. So, I guess what I'm saying to you, aren't you the one confusing what injury is from presumed damage?",
  "So, why is that different from actual injury? I have -- I'm not sleeping. I have a nervous stomach. I'm not eating. The typical things that juries look at to determine whether you've proven emotional distress --",
  "Why is that not actual injury?",
  "I've looked at those cases, and in all of them except for two, where the reference wasn't really precise, it was because the use of \"actual damages\" in the particular statute were limited to pecuniary harms or the nature of the harms at issue were pecuniary by nature.",
  "I'm sorry. Are you arguing that the emotional distress component can't be?",
  "So, you're -- under -- as I understand the definition of \"special damages\" in common law, if you proved any pecuniary harm, you were also entitled to the mental distress damages as well. So, you want half of the common law award -- award?",
  "We may have a difference of -- of history there because, yes, special damages required pecuniary harm, but once you prove that, it also permitted recovery of nonpecuniary losses as well.",
  "But that's what your brief said, actually.",
  "We're not talking any differently. That's what I just said. If you --",
  "Sort of odd for Congress to borrow from the defamation context and with a defined term of art, \"special damages,\" and not use it in the Privacy Act if that's what it intended.",
  "And to use a term, \"actual damages,\" which has a much broader meaning than \"special damages.\"",
  "Do you have any statistics on the percentage of actions brought under the Privacy Act in which the plaintiff was able to establish pecuniary harm?",
  "Are you aware of any runaway verdicts based on awards of mental damage proof?",
  "I define \"runaway awards\" as those in -- in six figures or above.",
  "Or even high five figures.",
  "Counsel, you seem to be arguing throughout that \"general damages\" meant actual damages when \"general damages,\" in my understanding, meant two things: presumed and actual. So, why is it illogical for Congress to look at what \"general damages\" meant and pick the meaning that included proven damages, actual?",
  "I -- I'm still confused. \"General damages\" meant presumed or actual? Congress says we don't want general damages because it includes presumed. So, we're going to use the word \"actual.\" How do you get from that, that Congress meant \"only pecuniary\"? I mean, that has its -- why didn't they just use that? Instead of \"actual damages,\" why didn't they just say \"pecuniary damages,\" if that's what they intended?",
  "Counsel, in the third sentence of this provision, on its face, does Mr. Setser fit into it?",
  "\"Multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times run consecutively.\" What's unclear about those words?",
  "The words are not unclear. We have to do the statutory interpretation that you want?",
  "Some fairly respected jurists below, Judge Easterbrook and Judge Fletcher, two different circuits, have read it as taking care of all those situations that the other two sentences don't cover. Why is that an irrational reading?",
  "But that assumes the answer, is what I'm saying to you. If you give each sentence its plain meaning, why is -- why is Mr. Setser not within the plain meaning of the third? He -- he had multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times.",
  "Well, it's judicial review of what? Not of the -- not of whether that was the desire of the State court or not. Judicial review as to whether they abused their discretion.",
  "So, you're going to make a bureaucrat equal to a judge in making the most important decision that a defendant faces: how much time he should spend in jail. So, a bureaucrat, rather than a judge, decides whether he's going to tack on a year and a half, 5, or 10, or whether he's going to let the defendant serve it concurrently?",
  "It's not a -- it's not a who or when, because the State court judge's recommendation is not binding on BOP. It has said that repeatedly, hasn't it?",
  "Just answer that question. Hasn't BOP said that a State court recommendation is not binding on it?",
  "So, it can't be just who -- it can't be just when. It's who's going to make the decision.",
  "But wasn't the SRA passed and this provision passed in part to take that decision away from the bureaucrat?",
  "Well, let's answer Justice Scalia's point. Wasn't the SRA passed in part because of the dissatisfaction with the fact that the parole board used to make this decision, and they wanted to put it back in the hands of judges?",
  "I don't know why it takes away from them on that score. They can choose whatever facility they want within the constraints imposed by a judge in terms of the length of the sentence.",
  "Mr. Jay --",
  "Mr. Jay, there is some force to your -- to Petitioner's argument that federalism should be respected, that Federal courts and the State judges and their individual wishes should be respected and followed by BOP actually. The system you're proposing actually takes away from both Federal judges control over the sentencing decision. If Federal judges recommend the consecutive sentence, then the State judge can take that into account in setting how much time they think is warranted for their crime in addition or different from, and the judge -- if he wants it to run concurrently the way Justice Breyer said, he could just give a zero. He knows what the Federal judge wants.",
  "The bottom line --",
  "Actually, it becomes easier than that. The State court can't force the Federal Bureau of Prisons to take the prisoner back, correct?",
  "Exactly. And so, all it can do is sentence the defendant to whatever time it's going to sentence the defendant. The defendant serves that time. Then the Federal sovereign takes over and does whatever the Federal judge said.",
  "Runs it consecutively or concurrently. Whatever the Federal judge said controls in every situation.",
  "That's preferable, to clog the judicial system with untold number of Federal convictions that have not been reduced to judgment? That's preferable to giving judges or recognizing their power to state their views up front?",
  "Could you tell me what facts would affect the sentence here? The judge here very clearly believed that some of the State charges overlapped and some didn't. And so, it ran some consecutive to one set of State charges and concurrent to the other. What are the facts with respect to the defendant that the Federal court needed to know?",
  "Counsel, I thought in the Leon case that, in fact, just like the claim in this case, that the affidavit was submitted to supervisors, and the Court created the Leon test in spite of that. So, to say do we have a case on point, Leon itself is on point. We created the test in the face of supervisors' review. You're not actually, are you, arguing a Nuremberg defense now?",
  "That -- that simply because supervisors decide, that it's okay, that that --",
  "-- exculpates someone from responsibility?",
  "All right. Then let's go to the other two ways that I think you're asking us to overrule our precedent. The first is the using subjective information that a police officer knows but hasn't disclosed in the warrant. I'm having a little bit of difficulty understanding how an entire warrant regime that presumes that the magistrate has all pertinent information -- and that's why you would be let off the hook -- how you can excuse a police officer when he doesn't place that information in front of the magistrate.",
  "Tell me how, this case, the bare-bone affidavit was sufficient? All it says is that this defendant is a member of a gang, but when the police officer is questioned, he's asked whether this crime at issue had any connection to his gang relationship, and the answer was no. So, how is the request in the warrant to search for all gang-related indicia anything more than the general warrant that our Founding Fathers in part passed the Fourth Amendment against?",
  "This is almost like --",
  "What do we do with the officer's testimony when he said -- \"Did you have any reason to believe there were any more weapons in the house?\" He said, \"No.\" What -- when an officer says that, why would then he think that he has complete license to go and ask for a warrant that's looking for more guns, when there's only evidence of him possessing one?",
  "So, you're answering -- you're answering Justice Ginsburg by saying that any time a gang member commits any crime, the police are entitled to seek a warrant that permits the search for anything they have in their home that relates to their gang membership and to -- to guns?",
  "That did not involve -- by the officer's admission and your own, that wasn't gang-related.",
  "The assault --",
  "But wait a minute. That has nothing to do with the gang, unless you're saying that you had proof that the gang did something illegally in helping him procure the weapon. What information did you have to suggest that?",
  "Counsel --",
  "But tell me something. There's 10 people in this house. There's 10 people in this house, and as I understand it from the questioning, they also knew other gang members were there. So, even if they found gang colors, did they tell the -- the magistrate that -- what would that prove when there's multiple members in the house?",
  "Well, but it's not limited to that.",
  "What does that have to do with anything other than a general search --",
  "-- a general search in the hope of finding evidence of other crimes?",
  "That's what it sounds like.",
  "You keep adding facts that weren't --",
  "So, what happens --",
  "-- below on that question? Following up on --",
  "-- the same question that Justice Kagan asked your brethren, which is how about we find that it was reasonable to ask for the guns but not for the gang-related materials? What does that do to your claim, and do you disagree with the manner in which he described what the inquiry would be below or before us now?",
  "Counsel --",
  "Counsel --",
  "Counsel --",
  "I'm sorry. Finish answering.",
  "I'll wait for your rebuttal.",
  "Except that --",
  "Except, counsel --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Except the FDA tells parties not to rely on the orange code.",
  "It tells them that what controls is the patent.",
  "Could I ask -- could I ask you --",
  "-- just on a practical basis -- I understand that the Petitioner has filed an amended label in 2010. I presume that that amended label copies the current label with the exception of substituting the manufacturer.",
  "But let's assume that's what --",
  "Now, it claims that when the paragraph IV -- the paragraph IV action is started and it's sued for infringement, that it's automatically going to lose --",
  "-- because --",
  "All right. Could you explain to me --",
  "Could you explain to me why? Is merely the use of a label that's identical infringement or is it an infringement of the underlying patent?",
  "Okay. So, tell us how a court gets out of the quandary of there being a claim that is stipulated to -- I've infringed -- and then how does it deal with the counterclaim? Now, the district court just ignored --",
  "-- the act of infringement below and went straight to the counterclaim. But I'm not quite sure how you get out of the quandary that this creates for the courts and the parties.",
  "All right. How about --",
  "Let's assume that Caraco puts in a label like the one it wants to use under claim 4. Will the FDA just kick it out?",
  "It will not even --",
  "It will not even ask for a response from Novo?",
  "But is that before -- without an infringement action by Novo?",
  "Well, if you tell me that the FDA --",
  "If you tell me the FDA doesn't want to get involved in construing the patent, why is it kicking out the claim for -- claim until Novo does a suit on whether or not the generic is infringing or not and let that issue be decided below?",
  "What odds would you put --",
  "What odds would you put as a betting lawyer on them winning a challenge to the FDA policy decisions of what it's capable of doing and not doing?",
  "Counsel, let's -- let's assume -- because I now take from your earlier conversation with Justice Breyer that you're saying the use code here is absolutely right, because the only use that we claimed was the combination use of the drug, your drug, with the metformin -- that the only thing that's wrong here is the indication that the FDA has required. So, that's not even wrong because you had no choice about that; is that correct?",
  "Tell me -- what this means practically, I believe, is that until your patent expires, no generic can come in with a use that's different than yours because they're going to be boxed out by this indication, this overbroad indication. Do you actually think that that's what Congress intended? I thought, with claim IV and section (viii), that what Congress intended was to ensure that drugs got onto the market as quickly as possible.",
  "What is the parade of horribles that you imagine if we were to read the counterclaim provision in the way your adversary is promoting and the Government is promoting? What -- what, presumably, in the normal case and the one that the regulations appear to expect is that the use code, the indication code, everything is going to match the patent. So, in that situation, the counterclaim would have no work to do. So, what's the parade of horribles?",
  "I -- I'm asking you to accept that we were to -- as an assumption only, don't -- it's not intended to be a -- a ruling -- to assume that we read the counterclaim in the way your adversaries want us to.",
  "What's the parade of horribles?",
  "Going back to the question that I had and a more practical question --",
  "As I read the record, in April of '08, the FDA rejected your section (viii) application.",
  "All right? And it asked you to submit an amended code. Your brief says we did it in September of 2010. Is it anywhere in the record?",
  "That you submitted what the FDA requested for your claim 4, the amended label?",
  "I'm sorry. Can you remind me of what the outcome of that testing was?",
  "Counsel, as I read your briefs, I think you're making, perhaps, two different arguments. And I want to focus you in on which one you're really concentrating on.",
  "Which is this presentation seems to be that, regardless of what standard we apply to the court of appeals' review of what the district court did in denying the motion to substitute counsel, that it was wrong. And I presume that means it was wrong for the standard you're proposing and it was wrong for the interests of justice standard. Am I correct?",
  "All right. As I read the Ninth Circuit decision, assuming an interests of justice standard because that's the one they invoked, they said what happened here is that the district court didn't hold a hearing to determine itself exactly what the dispute was about. And so, it was a process failure, basically is what they're saying. Now, you make assumptions based on matters that have come up since that hearing about what the dispute was about, and -- but I still don't know what the Federal defender's position was as to whether or not communications had broken down with the client to a point where they thought, as they did on appeal, that they couldn't continue. So, tell me why, assuming we accept that an interests of justice standard applies, the circuit court has no power or applied it improperly by saying -- forget about the remedy -- has no power to say, district court judges, you have to at minimum inquire and set forth your reasons based on the facts of that inquiry.",
  "But what does that have to do with \"I think they're doing a good job\"? I mean, it could well be that the judge later decides, after he hears from the Federal defender, I don't think that -- we don't think there's anything to be done; he disagrees. But he really never got an explanation from the Federal defenders.",
  "He never got an explanation from the Federal defenders.",
  "You are familiar with 3599(e), aren't you?",
  "Which requires counsel to participate in subsequent proceedings.",
  "Of a certain type and limited. Is it your position that if there is a complete breakdown of communications with an attorney, post-habeas decision, that that is inadequate in the interests of justice or otherwise for a court to say that could implicate proceedings after 3599, so I should substitute now?",
  "Oh, but you're presuming you're going to win.",
  "You're presuming you're going to win. I think 3599 applies to situations in which the habeas petitioner wins a remand or otherwise has something that's going to follow the habeas decision.",
  "So, this is sort of a made-up standard.",
  "Can you point to one case in which this standard has been used by any district court or court of appeals?",
  "Can you point to any inquiry by Congress in which such a test was discussed, considered in any way?",
  "Well, so, what you're suggesting is in noncapital cases, which are less serious, you're going to have a higher bar for a right that the statute gives a judge without any limitation. The capital limitation is that the judge on its own motion or a motion by defendant can substitute.",
  "So, how about a standard that the courts are used to and one that has a basis in Congress's choice, like interests of justice?",
  "Counsel, can I give you an example? Beginning of the litigation, all right? Capital counsel is appointed. Capital counsel wants to raise challenges to the conviction and sentence, and defendant says: I don't -- I want to die. Is a district court entitled to substitute that counsel under your theory? Because you said to me it has to be counsel that's -- that counsel that has abandoned the client. Counsel doesn't want to abandon the client; counsel wants to prosecute the case. There's no conflict of interest. Counsel's not representing anybody else. And what was your third criteria?",
  "Well, this is -- you know, this is Seth Waxman sitting right next to you.",
  "I -- I suspect that's the case.",
  "So, beginning of the case, first decision, and defendant comes in and says substitute my attorney. What would be your argument under your test?",
  "So, there are some decisions that -- that the client controls?",
  "That's not abandonment. That's an error. That's a problem. But it's not abandonment under your definition.",
  "Well, if I tell my attorney follow these leads, that's a failure of an agent as well.",
  "Given my example, isn't it the case that, under the interests of justice standard, there will be situations in which a substitution like the one I just posited would be right that wouldn't be right under your standard?",
  "Are you suggesting that, for noncapital defendants, Congress chose to give them more rather than less?",
  "But you're saying capital have lesser rights.",
  "Isn't delay one of the factors that courts routinely look at under the interests of justice standard?",
  "So, we go back to Justice Breyer's point that, even under the interests of justice standard, you're claiming there was an error?",
  "Mr. --",
  "It has to go with the scope of the remedy that they did.",
  "Assuming, as I do and you just said, that what the Ninth Circuit said is there's -- he should have gotten a reason, an explanation, but now there's a new attorney anyway, so, what do we do, isn't the normal thing to do just to remand it, to let the district court decide what steps it wants to take, including to decide whether or not it would have granted the motion for substitution if it had heard the explanation?",
  "Meaning, there was a new judge, but that doesn't -- a new judge is never stopped from considering --",
  "-- what has happened in a case and to decide whether under the facts as they existed at the time --",
  "But it's not academic. It wasn't academic for the judge below, the new judge --",
  "-- to say what happened back then; I don't believe the motion was timely; I don't believe that you were foreclosed from doing other things; motion to substitute would have been denied --",
  "-- end of case.",
  "Can you tell us whether that testing has been done or not?",
  "I'm sorry. No, you don't think it has been?",
  "In the appendix.",
  "I'm sorry. Then your answer is yes, Mr. Goh's prints don't match the prints found in the file.",
  "That doesn't worry your prosecutor's office?",
  "If -- if the fingerprints that were found at the scene of this crime matched Goh, that wouldn't give you pause?",
  "I'm sorry. What?",
  "So, why hasn't the test been done?",
  "Counsel, it hasn't been the focus of the briefing, but you've just made it the focus here. I know that you've been claiming that her statements about what constituted the Cellmark lab results are a statement that violates the Confrontation Clause. But are you taking the position that her statements and the admission of the documents, mailing the lab sample to the laboratory, and them getting it back, that all of those business records were improperly admitted?",
  "Because she testified that in her records she sees that her lab -- and she says -- I think those records were produced; I could be wrong -- that --",
  "They were produced and admitted into evidence. That the lab sample taken from the victim, L.J., was mailed to the laboratory and that it came back. Are you taking the position that those shipping documents were not business records? Are you taking the position that those were improperly admitted?",
  "Counsel, on your theory of this case -- and I think you say, first, it's not a statement; and, second, that if it is, it was not offered for the truth. Under your theory, if this lab technician had introduced Cellmark's report, that would have been okay, because it wasn't offered for the truth.",
  "I'm changing the facts.",
  "Under your theory, she could have introduced the lab report?",
  "I don't understand the difference. Meaning, the fact that you didn't physically introduce the report makes a difference?",
  "She testified that she reviewed lab samples --",
  "-- that matched the defendant. So, what's the difference between that and saying I have the report in my hand, I match that report with the Williams report, and this is my conclusion?",
  "No. She said that Cellmark said this is L.J.'s vaginal swab DNA.",
  "So, she said that.",
  "So, what's the difference between this and Justice Kennedy's question about Bullcoming? Could the expert in Bullcoming have said, as one of the amici here said, that all they would have had to do in Bullcoming is to read or to give a report that gave the blood alcohol content, the .5 or .10 or whatever it was, and have an expert come in and say that number shows he's drunk?",
  "Is that any different than this situation?",
  "No, no. The only part of his expertise is the report says point .10; I'm not offering it for the truth; I'm assuming if that's true, then he was legally drunk.",
  "He has done nothing.",
  "All the report did was give a number. And the supervisor comes in and says that number violates -- is legal drunkenness.",
  "How is that different from that?",
  "All right, but you're not telling me why that's not the same here, because he -- what this expert said is the Cellmark report is from this victim. So, it's the same set of numbers as in Bullcoming. Now he's taking a step and saying, instead of legal drunkenness, it matches someone else's that I took.",
  "But, Mr. Dreeben, she did repeat what Cellmark said. I asked your -- the State's attorney whether, if she had read the data report from the laboratory analysis, would that have been a violation of the Confrontation Clause? Not clear. She says, only if you admitted it. But in fact that's what she did. If you read her testimony -- I give you an example at page 79 -- she tells on cross-examination exactly what the steps were in the Cellmark report, what numbers they gave, and she tells and explains -- she -- the State's attorney took pride in this -- she said, I disagree with that number that they came up with; I think the number should be.... So, she's really reading the report.",
  "All right. So, then let's --",
  "All right. So, let's -- so, let's get to --",
  "Could the State have done this?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, if no expert from either lab came in, if an expert had the Cellmark information and the Illinois State Police information, not offered for the truth of the matter, and came in and said, I matched this and I matched that, and it's the defendant -- could that have been done?",
  "Are you saying that we owe no deference to the Illinois Supreme Court's judgment on this evidentiary issue? And if so, no deference, tell me what proposition of law supports that or are you saying deference is due, but we shouldn't give it. Which of the two positions are you taking?",
  "I'm sorry. I'm going back to Justice Kennedy's question. There is an Illinois requirement that the trial judges give the instruction he described?",
  "I'm sorry. I didn't think that this patent covered the actual machine. Mayo is free to develop a new machine.",
  "Well, it -- it actually is much narrower than that. It's within a range, two ranges actually. And so, it has already changed one range, and that's not the subject of the district court's finding that the lower number it's proposing is infringing. So, it's not as broad as you are stating.",
  "Well, it took that position, but the district court narrowed it to 15 percent, to 15 --",
  "It can offer the test.",
  "It can offer the test. It just can't recommend the dosage to the doctor.",
  "Tests do two things: They measure something --",
  "-- and therapeutic range does something else. The tests can happen. The doctor gets a number. What the doctor does with that number is a different issue.",
  "I -- I don't know what -- you keep saying you have to limit the product.",
  "But you told me that there's a different range for the treatment of skin diseases.",
  "So, presumably, there are different ranges for treatment of other diseases.",
  "So, this patent has not limited exploration in there. You're claiming it has. That's an issue that your adversary can speak to. I think they say no in their briefs. But the point is there's still a limit to their range. You're claiming at one point they said it was limitless, but if we disagree with that --",
  "-- how do you answer Justice Breyer's question?",
  "So, do we -- do we add up all of the diseases in the world, all the potential diseases, and pick a percentage that this covers within that range?",
  "I think Justice Breyer is asking you for something that doesn't involve that --",
  "-- that involves some greater answer to the issue of limitation.",
  "How many patents of this type are out there?",
  "So, it's novel? What's your answer about why this is novel?",
  "I guess my problem is, if we call this just simply an application of natural phenomenon or of a natural process, why are treatment patents at all --",
  "-- permissible, meaning if someone finds out that at level 300, it's bad, and tells doctors to stop, that's natural, too.",
  "Could you define \"de minimis\" for me?",
  "If we can't --",
  "-- what's the guidance or limit that we set for States?",
  "I know you've told me that you think Montello is not pertinent because it involved a different issue. But assuming that it were pertinent, because I'm not quite sure how its discussion doesn't fit the needs here, one of the factors you haven't mentioned in terms of de minimis is the portage and its use with respect to commerce. And by that I mean, it appeared to me in Montello, what the Court was saying was the history of use of this river showed that these obstructions didn't stop the flow of commerce, that what people did was, it appeared, some extreme things. They got off -- they got their goods off one boat, walked it a certain distance or drove it by wagon another distance, and then put it on another boat or the same boat that they had lessened the load on and moved it over. And so, it doesn't talk about the distance of that portage; it talks about the impact on commerce.",
  "And so, why isn't that a factor in the de minimis issue?",
  "If there were a history here.",
  "There was a canal in there, wasn't there?",
  "Well, in Montello, they took the cargo off some boats --",
  "-- and moved it overland to another spot before they put it back on a boat.",
  "We can both look at the opinion, but I think there is one spot where the Court says that in some areas they had to change boats.",
  "I don't disagree with you, but I -- what I'm asking is, if we had a history of navigation of cargo that went to the beginning of one of these rivers -- and I'm not a sailor, so my terms -- the cargo is taken off and driven by wagon or some other mode to another spot and picked up again. Is that a different situation than one where that doesn't happen? That because this -- this length of portage is so long that it is both economically and physically impossible to transport cargo in that way. Is that a different case for the question of navigability?",
  "Seventeen miles is very long.",
  "I think the Thompson is only 2.8.",
  "That's really close to Montello, where it talked about, about 2 miles for some portage areas.",
  "But I'm not a Midwesterner, and rivers of 200 miles are normal there, I understand.",
  "So, what's de minimis?",
  "Could 2.8 be de minimis in one situation and not, and how do we tell courts below --",
  "If there's no falls but there are riparian waters that don't permit navigability over 2.8, then that's still navigable? I'm not sure --",
  "Am I to take that \"de minimis\" to you means small enough so that they get the boat physically over the portage?",
  "Whether they carry it --",
  "-- drag it.",
  "Go back to carrying their boat on their shoulders, which apparently in The Montello they did. What's the answer to --",
  "Under your theory, if there's a fall like this of 17 miles, and a train is 50 miles away and traverses that 17 miles, that portage --",
  "-- is good enough to make that area navigable?",
  "Outside of your fur traders and your gold miners, has that happened in any other situation -- your alleged gold miners and fur traders? Has that happened on -- on the -- in the Great Falls?",
  "Could you -- could you do me a favor and you tell me again -- I'm having real trouble with the competing evidence in this case with respect to every one of the three areas in dispute, and I have some serious questions about whether the court properly granted summary judgment. Your brief seems to suggest that I can't do -- we can't do anything about that because it wasn't a part of the question presented.",
  "Your adversary says that it's a fair question if we determine there's an illegal approach -- error in the legal approach of the court below. I'm assuming that also means on their weighing of evidentiary matters. So, why shouldn't we address the summary judgment issue?",
  "Is there a mile stretch anywhere on this river?",
  "Yes. Is there a mile stretch in which the boats stop?",
  "There's some water in the middle, and they --",
  "I know the two at issue. But you're saying, if we rule the way we do, we're going to slice it up and so does the Attorney -- the Solicitor General's office say, we're going to slice it up half mile or half acre by half acre. I'm not sure how that happens. I go back to Justice Kennedy's question, which is, does a boat stop midstream?",
  "Five miles, was that -- was that the canal? What subsequently became the canal area?",
  "I think that then the simplest rule is, is the river from shore to opposite shore -- any portion of it -- did boats traverse it? That would be I think what Justice Alito was asking.",
  "Can you point to some portages that are de minimis? Point me -- I don't care where they are in the United States. Give me a list of some that are de minimis.",
  "Who would review that and where? Going back to Justice Kagan's question of - - let's assume you went through an APA process, and they found it was wetlands and that the compliance terms were -- had a substantial nexus. What happens when you go into an enforcement action?",
  "So, does anything get estoppel?",
  "Does anything get estoppel? Assuming it's not a legal question, would the factual findings that there's a substantial nexus between the remedy ordered and the violation -- would that get estoppel?",
  "You're conceding that the compliance order, assuming there is a violation, is all right? You're not challenging any of the terms of the compliance order other than the finding of a violation?",
  "Well, Mr. Stewart, given - -",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Mr. Stewart, I - -",
  "Counsel, but those situations are slightly different because the Act doesn't specify any specific remedies that apply to any specific property. It just says you violate the Act by filling in wetlands. It doesn't say that you violate the Act by not removing the fill and not planting trees and not doing this or doing that. What it says is you violate the Act if you don't comply with the compliance order that tells you to do those things. So, it's a very theoretically different violation that's going on. One is in the affirmative act prohibited by the statute; that's the violation of the statute. And the other is the violation of the remedial steps that the compliance order is the only thing that has set forth.",
  "But those are not in the statute. They're permitted by the statute, but they're not set forth as requirements under the statute.",
  "That has nothing to do with the fact that the Act doesn't specifically tell you to remove it.",
  "Mr. Stewart - -",
  "I'm sorry. Finish your answer, and then - -",
  "You were cut-off. You were saying if we were troubled by the additional penalties, and you were going to suggest something. If we were troubled by that aspect of the order alone, and you haven't dealt with the permit issue after the fact, what would be your approach to the case then?",
  "But you're required to make a finding that there's a violation. You're not suggesting that the government is going to act willy-nilly and it's not going to act on sufficient evidence in -- in sending a letter that says we find you are violating the Act.",
  "I thought that -- it's interesting that the language of Morgan and one of its companion cases, not companion in the sense of being heard at the same time, but on the same issue -- Radio City case -- both of them don't talk in the language of today. They don't talk about deference. They don't talk about substantial evidence. They talk about whether the PTO has expertise, and presumptions that their factfindings based on their expertise have to be overcome with some convincing evidence. So, they're talking in different language, but the concept they're talking about is one where the court does accept findings of the PTO on the matters that involve their expertise and give them weight, substantial weight, essentially, and only overturn it if the court is, in the words of Morgan and Radio City, \"thoroughly convinced\" that they were wrong. So, what's wrong with that standard? Everybody likes the deference language of today, but they were very clear in what they were saying: If the PTO made a finding, you decide whether that finding was based on its expertise, and if it was, you don't change it, court, unless you're thoroughly convinced they were wrong. Is there anything wrong with that? With that articulation of what the standard should be in all situations, whether there's new evidence or no new evidence?",
  "All right. Let me tell you what my problem is with this case. It is the issue that Verizon raised and the lack of connection between the district court's holding and the circuit court's holding. The district court excluded the affidavit for the proposed arguments on the basis of them being new arguments that Board rules precluded them from raising at the stage they did. The circuit court described the affidavit as new evidence. And the Verizon amicus brief says: Court, be careful, because it's not really clear what's new evidence in this affidavit and what's new argument. And that question troubles me, for the following reason: Verizon posits that the issue of whether a description is specific enough is a legal question to which the PTO is not entitled to deference. Why, other than Federal Circuit and Patent Board precedent, is that right? And can you explain why this affidavit that was rejected is in fact new evidence and not merely new argument?",
  "Could you tell me what -- other than that it's in the form of an affidavit, tell me what in the content was new evidence? I want to get away from the labels, and I want to get to the substance because I've looked at all of these submissions, and it sounds like what I read in briefs every day.",
  "I'm not sure why - -",
  "But I don't know that that -- I think you're confusing the nature of the review, which is de novo, new, with the -- the burdens that attach to the proof. Those are two different concepts. And so, that's what Microsoft said. Don't confuse burdens with standards of review. That it's de novo review is one thing, but even in de novo review, we often give more weight or presumptive weight to some facts as opposed to others. And that's what I think Morgan was talking about. Morgan was very clear: Whether it was new evidence or not, you give -- you accept as valid whatever the PTO does, and you require to be thoroughly convinced by new evidence or not that they were wrong. I don't know why that standard can't apply in any situation. I think that's what Judge Newman intended, although he didn't say that. So, why are we confusing the standard of review with the burden?",
  "I have two problems with your argument. The first is -- and I know that it may be unique to me because many of my colleagues say that you don't rely on legislative history, but I'm not relying just on legislative history. I'm relying that the legislative history is replete with the commissioner of patents himself saying that section 145 required de novo review. And witness after witness tried to argue for Congress to change it, and it didn't, arguing that it required de novo review. Second, our cases repeatedly describe it as de novo review. So, you got to get past that. And then you got to get past that between 1927 and 1945 you have Barrett on your side. But there are plenty of courts, including the Second Circuit, and a very respected jurist, Learned Hand, saying that if you exclude new evidence, it should only be if it's on principles of estoppel, that someone intentionally withheld evidence from the PTO. So, how do you deal with a record that doesn't basic -- that doesn't support your basic argument?",
  "So, give us a standard and how is what -- the good cause that you're somehow willing to accept different from the Government's reasonable cause standard? And equity seems to have required an intentional or bad faith withholding. Is that what you want to limit yourself to? What do you do with sort of the in between? The intentional and the grossly negligent.",
  "And what do you see the limits of that estoppel -- equity principles? I think that's what Justice Breyer was -- was referring to. What would be the contours of your equity limits?",
  "That's a little bit unfair, to characterize the cases as limited to that. Some talked about negligence.",
  "And some courts said it should be intentional. There was a debate back and forth.",
  "Yes, I agree.",
  "It seems to me you were introducing such a gamesmanship. Anybody who wanted to get out of substantial deference under the APA just has to present an expert. That -- that's what makes little sense to me, trying to -- now we're hair-splitting in a very minute way.",
  "Articulate a standard that would -- Newman is suggesting total de novo review with no reference to any kind of presumption applied to the PTO decision. Another way - -",
  "-- to look at it is the way I suggested, which is it doesn't matter whether there's new evidence or not; what is the level of respect that you are going to give to the PTO factual findings?",
  "Be -- as in the language of Morgan, be convinced that the PTO was wrong?",
  "So, why didn't the court just say what you said? If it -- if -- not the court; Congress. If you admit that Congress intended a section 145 action to permit new evidence, if it wanted to limit that evidence to something that could not have been found with due diligence or whatever your limitations are, why did it speak more broadly? I mean, the statutory language suggests \"as the facts in this case,\" not in the case before the PTO. As law and -- \"as equity might permit.\" This is very broad language.",
  "Mr. Clement, section 5 says you can't draw new maps unless they've been precleared. You can't put them into effect.",
  "So, the only thing that exists is old maps until you get the preclearance. I don't see how we can give deference to an enacted new map, if section 5 says don't give it effect until it's been precleared.",
  "But you're asking for more than for guidance. You're asking for deference. You're saying they have to start with the new map even though that map hasn't been approved.",
  "Instead of starting, as the court below did, with the old map which had been approved.",
  "Doesn't that turn section 5 on its head?",
  "What map is that?",
  "What district is that?",
  "But what's was the problem?",
  "I'm sorry. That's - - that's incomplete.",
  "Counsel, I'm not sure how I understand that, okay? As I looked at one of the El Paso maps, the enacted map created a antler-type district, a head and two unconnected antlers on top, nothing tying them together. The district court went back to the benchmark and said this is the benchmark district; now I'm going to draw the districts around it that fall naturally, trying to stay within neutral principles of not dividing up the city more than I have to. And it came out with another district. I don't understand what principle, what legal principle, the district court was violating that makes what it did with that particular county wrong. You're saying they should have given deference to an oddly shaped district that changed a prior benchmark that's been challenged as having been created specifically to minimize the Latino vote. All of the challenges that relate to El Paso are very significant. The district court has already denied summary judgment on that. Tell me what legal principle they violated, other than the deference principle that you're relying upon?",
  "That's your second - -",
  "Then you're saying the court should look at the merits.",
  "No. Let -- let's go to -- something Justice Scalia asked was what does a court do with frivolous claims? Does it assume under your theory that those frivolous claims are valid? And if you say no, it shouldn't assume that, then what level of inquiry should the court engage in before it accepts or deviates from the enacted plan?",
  "So, the Texas court cannot -- should automatically accept all -- that every district that a challenge has been raised in the D.C. circuit court is - -",
  "-- court is okay?",
  "Mr. Garza, what's the real drop-dead date? It's not November 6th because that's the day of the general election. What's the latest election -- primary election that any State has? June 26th?",
  "All right. So, working backwards, what's the last - -",
  "Yes.",
  "So, how many days before that election do -- does the voting mechanism or apparatus need to set up the voting booths, et cetera?",
  "Could I ask you a question about the merits?",
  "Are you attacking the normal system of basing assessments moving forward, based on past accounting and chargeability and non-chargeability? Or are you just attacking the special assessment?",
  "All right. So, articulate for me what's -- borrowing a phrase from one of my colleagues yesterday, how do we write this opinion? When is a second Hudson notice required? Let's presume for the sake of argument that the union had cost overruns. Labor salaries went up; printing costs went up, not for lobbying; but generally there was a 10 percent increase in their expenses across the board because various contracts that they were involved in required it. Would you require a second notice in that circumstance?",
  "Articulate that again. A material change - -",
  "And take the money that they collected?",
  "Can they take the money that they collected under the first notice, and, instead of doing the special assessment, in the middle of it, this campaign gets announced by the governor, and can they then divert the chargeable amount that they had predicted and spend it on the non-chargeable amount? Or are you -- or does that require a second Hudson notice? Without a special assessment.",
  "The problem is in -- in this system, and going back to Justice Breyer's practicality, they will get a chance to object. It just won't be at the moment of the special assessment; it will be the following year. So, when the union gives its new notice, it's going to set forth its chargeable and non-chargeable amounts as audited, and it will say, as it did -- as it's done in the briefs before us, on Proposition 76, we're going to take 50 percent as chargeable. And the union members can come in and give a Lehnert objection, those who want to. Those who don't, know it's happened, and they agree to it. Isn't that correct? They do get a chance to object; the question is the timing.",
  "Is there an answer to that? They will get a chance to object then?",
  "Well, but that's true of the first example I gave you. If something happens in the middle of the year and the union needs to divert already-assessed funds to challenge a election, they can do it. And you said that's okay.",
  "Well, but what happens - -",
  "But going back to the - - forget about special assessments. I think in one of the briefs, I know in one of the briefs, someone says elections happen every 4 years. So, in the normal cycle of union activities, in an election year they're going to divert more of whatever accessible moneys they have to their lobbying efforts, and the following year they'll go back to normal for 3 years. You're not challenging that normal variation in the -- in the distribution of the moneys, correct?",
  "So, I guess my problem is I don't see how that, given your argument, is any less alone than this special assessment where the labor -- where the objecting members at the end of the year will get notice of what has happened that year, will have an opportunity to place their Lehnert challenges and get them ruled upon, and will, as Justice Breyer said, have a benefit because they're going to either pay more if the Lehnert -- pay less if the Lehnert challenges are upheld or pay more if -- if they're not. But I'm not quite sure how this is a different loan.",
  "Can I clarify a point? I thought I heard and maybe I just didn't look at the union regulations, the new ones -- is it limited to 180 days? I thought I heard your adversary say that the - -",
  "I see.",
  "Could you tell me what the burden is on a union to give a second Hudson notice whenever there is a special assessment? Meaning do you happen to know how frequently unions impose special assessments - -",
  "-- and what the incremental cost is to the union of giving such notice?",
  "Try to summarize it. I wasn't looking to monopolize you.",
  "And a footnote: And if it happens a lot, how burdensome is it?",
  "Could you please answer my question?",
  "All right? The burden.",
  "But they don't lose it; they're going to do it the following September. The attractive part of your argument from the beginning was that this is somehow a forced loan. And I understand the attractiveness of that. But it goes back to what Justice Breyer said from the beginning, which is, given, as has been recognized, that money is fungible and that you can't really often predict what's going to happen in the future, it's been developed a system that cyclically gets money to the people back.",
  "The problem is that I'm being told by your adversary -- and since we don't know, I'm always afraid of writing a decision in a vacuum, okay?",
  "That unions structure their business in a myriad number of ways, that some have a very small due each year and a larger special assessment for special projects. And I assume there's endless variety. You're proposing a rule that every single time an assessment outside of annual dues is imposed, that a new Hudson notice can be given. And you're suggesting, Justice Scalia, that all they have to say is we think it's going to be for chargeable effect.",
  "Counselor, I -- I take your argument, but if you look at the legislative record, the reports, the findings, et cetera, and the statements repeatedly by many congresspeople, there appears to be -- have been a dual motive for this provision. They were, in fact, engaged in the question of discrimination against pregnant women. That was recognized in Hibbs, and that's clear. But with respect to this particular provision, they were also concerned about economic effect that -- that happened to everyone, men and women, who became disabled. And so, they appear to have had dual motivation. Part of the bill was gender-related; part of the bill seemed to be disability-related. What do -- how do we judge that kind of bill, where Congress may have been expanding the benefits it's giving to people, not solely because of gender discrimination, but because of this desire to address disability discrimination?",
  "Can I go -- I'm sorry.",
  "But there certainly was -- there was certainly much conversation and testimony that, whether they in fact took the same amount of leave time or not, that women who were pregnant or were perceived as capable of getting pregnant were hired less frequently because, subjectively, the employers thought that they were more likely to take the time. So, frankly, for years there was questions about whether law firms were hiring young -- not hiring young women because they feared they would leave in the middle of a big case or something else. We all know those stories. So, it is sort of common knowledge in many ways, but there was plenty of testimony related to that. So, assume that that was Congress's perception, because it was supported by the record or as much of the record as Hibbs recognized as adequate. Where does that leave your argument?",
  "I thought Justice Alito was trying to help you.",
  "He was.",
  "And I'm working from a different proposition than you are in response to this question. I don't think that the actual amount of time that men and women take is relevant. The question is: What is the employer's perception, and did Congress have a valid basis, as Justice Kagan pointed out earlier, to believe that employers thought women took more time?",
  "Counsel, would Justice Scalia's reading in your judgment -- accept his proposition that those currently receiving voluntary payments from the employer fall under subsection (c). Would his reading require the employer every year to recalculate the benefits to the maximum that's established that year?",
  "And that's why his reading - -",
  "The function of (b) is to set a maximum that will control all payments present and future.",
  "And so, if you read it the way he does, that maximum would change each year.",
  "Counsel, what happens to your argument if we disagree with you that employers have a way to seek a compensation order? As I read the regulations, the only way they can do that is if the employee files a claim, and the employee's filing of the claim then sets the process in motion. I can't imagine that an -- any employee, knowing that a future award could help them, would bother filing a claim to help the employer lock in his rate.",
  "That's not my question. Most of your argument is premised on the -- I thought, that the employer could lock in his rate - -",
  "-- by seeking an award.",
  "If I disagree with you that the Act doesn't provide for that and neither do the regulations, that only employees can seek awards, what happens to your argument?",
  "Well, as I've studied it, I think that's the case. So, assume that fact to be true, that employers have no regulatory or statutory right to seek an award. They can either stop paying and have the employee make a claim or not. How -- what does this do to your argument, if that's accurate?",
  "By stopping payment.",
  "So, that destroys the whole voluntary payment aspects of this.",
  "Isn't it an odd statute?",
  "All right.",
  "What page are you on?",
  "His answer to that was that the provision also permits an entry after someone -- of an order after someone dies.",
  "So, it's -- the incongruity is taken care of by the Act directly.",
  "Your brief -- your brief seem to use the \"newly awarded compensation,\" your meaning of it, at the time of injury, the time of disability, the time of entitlement to compensation. And it seems to use those terms interchangeably. What term are you settling on and why?",
  "Counsel, let's assume an employer pays, continues to pay over a period of time, and the employee needs more money and goes in and says you owe me more money; I'm going to make a claim. The board says no, he doesn't owe you more money; he was paying the right amount. And so, you're not entitled to the 1200 you're asking for; you're only entitled to the 1,000 he was paying. Under your view, if that happened 5 or 10 years after the payments started, would the employer be liable for the higher average 10 years later?",
  "Assuming it does, that the answer is \"yes\"?",
  "So, what stops an employee from simply doing what I said? What stops an employee from kicking up his own maximum by -- whenever he chooses to do it, years and years later?",
  "If we find any ambiguity in the statute, in the statutory language, would it then make more sense to adopt your meaning or the Government's, given all of the factors that the Government argues counsels in its favor?",
  "Assume that - -",
  "Why isn't that the case here?",
  "It seems to me that there's enough evidence that the lawyer was the one who held the investigation; the people who attended the meeting between the lawyer, the Respondent, and the other personnel that were there were acceding to what he was doing. The chief -- he goes to the chief and he says: I want you to do this. And the chief is relying on him, not his own independent judgment, to issue the command that's contested here. So, that sort of puts your argument on its head because it appears that he was more the independent investigator - -",
  "-- than he was the individual under the control of the agency.",
  "This argument seems to fall under what Justice Scalia termed a functional test, that he's serving just like any other government lawyer. If you were going to fit this case under the Richardson majority test, how would you do it?",
  "Well, that would be a breach of his duty as an attorney.",
  "And he would be subject to malpractice in that case. You -- seriously, I find this whole argument about market forces with respect to attorneys representing people odd because there's a whole slew of unemployed lawyers who will be happy to take on any government service they can. So, going back to the -- that's -- what I consider the central argument you're making, which is: Will it chill advice? And I'm not sure how it can, given the independent fiduciary duty that an attorney has to zealously guard his or her client's interest.",
  "But don't we have cases - -",
  "That's not true of most lawyers.",
  "Most lawyers are not part of the civil service -- internal lawyers are not part of the civil service system. They're generally considered employees at will, at least most of the circuit courts have so held.",
  "That they're policymakers and, as such, are not subject to civil service protections.",
  "But that -- but that argument hasn't changed between the predecessor statute and this statute. You made the same argument under the Colony statute. It lost. So, you can't go back to that argument because it's already been rejected. So, what goes from that?",
  "My problem with your argument as I read it in the brief, it's a bit convoluted, as Justice Scalia observed. But if Congress intended to change Colony, it wouldn't just have created this subdivision (i); it would have changed the main statement. So, why don't we read this as simply saying we accept whatever Colony said, and the only thing we're -- we're creating exceptions around are the following? The exception argument.",
  "-- real estate developer in the business of buying and selling property. So, I'm not sure that I buy your argument that it can't be goods and services, because that was the services of this particular company.",
  "Well, they can't -- they can't change the interpretation of the statute, but they are the agency with expertise to define a term within a statute. Why don't they have the expertise to define either what the words \"gross income\" mean or don't mean?",
  "Presumptively because you're saying that this is a new interpretation. But the IRS is taking the position that the meaning hasn't changed - -",
  "-- that it's just clarifying some ambiguity that the courts have had; not that it's had.",
  "There's too many presumptions in your answer. The first is that Colony controlled - -",
  "-- what to me itself says it's not -- it's not interpreting the new statute - -",
  "-- whatever its footnote meant.",
  "How about the career criminal enhancements, instead of the felon in possession? And assuming your arguments, what limits can Congress put on anyone with respect to future conduct if it's going to be a burden? Under your view, it stops people from traveling. Career criminal statutes put on the distinct disadvantage of a longer sentence.",
  "Does that argument that you've just made go more to whether or not the BIA's conclusion that Congress intended to rescind the Fleuti decision -- but you assume that's what its intent was?",
  "So, if we assume that, if we assume that was Congress's intent, doesn't that start -- give you the conclusion? If Congress intended to undo it, doesn't that prove that they intended to effect it retroactively?",
  "No, no. I -- those go to the basic premise.",
  "If you assume Congress intended to rescind the prior doctrine, isn't that proof itself that it intended to apply the statute retroactively?",
  "To this conduct?",
  "But isn't that the case here, meaning -- it goes back to the Chief Justice's question, which is what they're trying to do is punish those individuals, those LPRs, who have committed this kind of crime, by not letting them travel or come back in. That's really what their argument is, is -- you know, you are imposing a punishment, a disability, for having committed the crime. You're not imposing a disability merely for the act of traveling.",
  "Prior to the Fernandez case, the illegal act was remaining. And so, that was within your control. But the -- you can't undo an illegal act that you've done to be able to travel. The act is now part of your background. And so, there's nothing in your control to change that act once the statute has passed.",
  "And so, you're -- you're carrying that around as a disability.",
  "But did it make that determination as a legal matter or as an exercise of its discretion? As I read its opinion, it felt that it had to come to that conclusion as a matter of law.",
  "If we were to find the statute ambiguous, where has it explained its policy decisions independent of its legal conclusions?",
  "Assuming we don't accept Respondents' -- what appears to be their argument, that being an LPR is not a requirement of the statute, if we assume that being an LPR is what triggers the availability for the Attorney General's exercise of discretion, how does that -- how does the imputation rule harm the statute? The child has lived with the parents for 5 years, whether before or after -- well, after, it wouldn't be an issue, but before the grant of LPR status. How does that harm the purposes of the statute? I thought the idea of the statute was to give individuals who had ties to the United States an opportunity to stay. If a child's been with their parents for 5, 10, 15 years, what sense does it make to deprive them of the Attorney General's exercise of discretion merely because the administrative process has taken too long to give them something which they're going to get and which they've gotten?",
  "So, why is a parent's fraudulent conduct imputed to a child? There's no intent there. The child obviously doesn't have an intent or couldn't have an intent to commit a crime. So, why is that imputed by the BIA?",
  "Other than that it's a holding against the immigrant, which your adversary points out is not a very favorable outlook for the agency, that it only imputes when it harms the immigrant. But, putting that aside, there's no intent involved in the fraud. It's just the commission of an act.",
  "What's the state of mind of committing an act, like a fraudulent act?",
  "The child doesn't commit a fraudulent act.",
  "One of the problems that I have is that I see the imputation as an equitable doctrine.",
  "And to me, that often means discretionary.",
  "If it is that, discretionary, I -- I don't know what more the BIA has to say than \"I don't want to,\" because it renders lots of issues open, like what do we do with 1229b(a)(2)? Isn't that an end run on stopping this continuous 7-year statute, or 10, whatever it is, if we're imputing a parent's residence or any of the things that you're - - that the government said, the BIA said, in rendering its decision? I mean, you can't force a court to -- the BIA to impute. So, what more do they have to say than we don't think it's consistent with the statute, even if it is ambiguous to do this?",
  "What's so reasonable about a child who lives with their grandparents outside the country? Why should their parents' being in the U.S. be imputed to the benefit of that child? I certainly understand it in your client's situation. Your client is the one who has been here since 5 years old.",
  "So - -",
  "Just for factual correction, the record doesn't tell us whether he was living with his mother -- Mr. Sawyer was living with his mother.",
  "And the answer to that is? Is this a child living with a grandparent out of the country or not?",
  "Counsel, that's a very big assumption. I mean, yes, it's the two biggest circuits who have defined domicile and imputation, but it wasn't us, number one. And, number two, going back to Justice Alito's question, they didn't adopt the same word, \"domicile\"; they changed it. So - -",
  "And that's what the BIA was saying.",
  "It can't be aware of all judicial decisions.",
  "I just don't understand that argument because they've conceded that you need the -- the child needs their own LPR status before it triggers - -",
  "-- residency.",
  "Counsel, under your reading, as I understand it, the words \"portion, split, or percentage\" means an amount less than the whole?",
  "So, what happens if a service provider gives 100 percent to the other side, as opposed to a -- an amount less than the whole?",
  "But that -- does that make much sense that if you give one meaning -- if you stay consistent with your meaning, what you're saying is a situation where the service provider gives away everything, 100 percent, they're just not liable under (b)?",
  "If they give away 1 percent, they -- if they keep 1 percent, they're liable.",
  "Is there -- Judge Higginbotham, in his dissent, said there is a big difference between unearned fees and overcharge fees. He said unearned fees, in their simplest form, is no service whatsoever. Overcharges are some service but an excessive value. What's wrong with that definition? Why is that definition unworkable in terms of limiting and defining this statute?",
  "You think not? How about with subsidiaries? Wasn't it common practice - - isn't it common practice that subsidiaries are often receiving parts of the payments because then they become -- they come out of the gross income of the major parent?",
  "So, why isn't it a potential common practice that they're getting 100 percent of something they didn't do?",
  "If they're rendering -- if they're already rendering services?",
  "Counsel, if your reading of the language is not plain, if there is two ways to read this statute, give me your best reason for why the policy statement should not be given deference. I know you said because it didn't go through notice and -- through notice; but outside of that, why isn't this a HUD interpretation that the statute tells us HUD can do, an interpretation of the statute? We can argue about whether it's an interpretation of regulation X or not, but why wouldn't it be entitled to deference?",
  "Well, the Seventh Circuit had said a lot different, and HUD came back -- and invited HUD to do something, and HUD came back and said you read it that way; we think this is a better reading. What more do we need from an agency?",
  "In essence --",
  "Counsel, I'm sorry. May I just --",
  "-- correct you on that? Didn't HUD in that preamble say explicitly, \"The Secretary, charged by statute with interpreting RESPA, interprets 18(b) to mean that two persons are not required\"? It says that explicitly.",
  "Not in the policy statement; in the preamble to regulation X.",
  "In -- in 1996. I thought that was the final rulemaking you were talking about, because it didn't do rulemaking with respect to the policy statement.",
  "But I'm not sure. Congress didn't say that HUD could only give interpretations through rules. It said it could give rules, pass rules and regulations, and give interpretations. So, what's the procedural defect in it just giving an interpretation?",
  "We go back to whether the -- whether the policy -- whether the statute is ambiguous or not.",
  "And what I'm trying to figure out is what's the deficiency in the policy statement that's independent of the ambiguity you rely upon.",
  "Well, it says it's longstanding for it.",
  "Counsel, I'm a little confused. Under your interpretation or theirs, the court gets involved in determining whether fees, services were rendered. I mean, it's not as if your interpretation is going to keep the court out of that business. To be able to find a kickback, the court has to determine whether services were rendered or not. So, what's the difference in that inquiry when it involves a kickback and when it involves a -- a single provider? In a kickback situation, the court has to decide whether there was actually a service rendered that entitled the person to a percentage or not, correct?",
  "So, what's the difference between deciding that question and deciding that the -- the one individual provided a service?",
  "And it listed, as Justice Ginsburg said, unearned fees. Why would it matter to Congress? Give me a reason that it would matter to Congress whether the unearned fee was by one person in a dual relationship or a single person alone? The issue was unearned fees, rendering -- charging for a service you didn't render. That's what the whole kickback idea was about, correct?",
  "I'm sorry. Could you go back to Justice Scalia's question? If a -- if a bank has an appraisal fee from the past and decides I don't need a new one, but still charges you for an appraisal fee, would that violate the statute?",
  "Or if the bank charged you for a title search that it did?",
  "If it had one already?",
  "No, no. So, going back to Justice Scalia's question, if the provider decides I'm going to use what I had before, I'm not going to redo the work, but still charges you a second time, they're not liable under your reading of the statute?",
  "Could I make sure that I understand the extent of your argument? Are you saying that it's interpretation, oral interpretation, just in the courtroom?",
  "I -- I have to say that if you read it the way you do, then what you're suggesting is that for appointed experts, they only get recompensed for the time they're testifying, because that's the only time they spend in court.",
  "Yes.",
  "But court experts get a -- get paid for their prep work.",
  "Could I -- one further question.",
  "I take all your arguments, but I read the common dictionary and there's no question that the primary meaning of \"interpreter\" is interpretation of oral languages. But the dictionary is broad enough to include translation work as well. Given that the courts for 70 years have been awarding -- most of the them except for I think the Seventh here. Virtually every court over a 70-year period has been awarding translation fees as -- as authorized. Why shouldn't that be enough for us?",
  "Meaning, if the dictionary term is broad enough and that's what the courts have been doing and the world hasn't crashed despite one case where a large amount was given -- your adversary points to the fact that most of the translation fees tend to be fairly reasonable. Why should we muck with what works?",
  "I think I'm drawing -- I'm drawing from ways that my colleague next to me usually asks a question.",
  "Could we get back to the issue? In the legislative history of this provision, is there any indication that Congress explicitly rejected translation work from its coverage?",
  "Outside of the text. Is there a statement by one of the sponsors in the congressional bill or the study --",
  "Those are the other provisions that they passed with respect to --",
  "So, if a lawyer sits down with an interpreter now in his office and says to the interpreter I can't pay for translation work; now, you sit here and interpret what this letter says for me -- is that what we're asking lawyers to do now?",
  "If we accept your reading?",
  "But you would say that might be different in the courtroom.",
  "Because the lawyer is communicating something live. It could be in the courtroom, but not outside.",
  "Is there something logical about this?",
  "I guess I'm -- I'm having a problem with, you know, they're \"potentially large.\" Interpretive services are potentially large, although you claim that they -- that they don't -- they have sort of a terminus point. I've been in trials where we've had multiple languages simultaneously being translated to multiple defendants, with witnesses speaking even other languages. I was in the Southern District of New York. And fees there without translation, just for the oral courtroom work, sometimes went ahead for months. So, potentiality's not the question. If you're talking about disproportionality, then that goes to the word \"reasonable\" in the statute, doesn't it? I mean, the Ortho case you point to, the court did sizably cut the translation fees. And, more importantly, from the little I can tell, that was a huge patent case with a patent that was claimed to control 60 percent of a market. So, I don't know that that was a small case by anyone's definition.",
  "I've got one going as far back as -- it was a district court. But it was as far back as the 1930s.",
  "Some in the '40s, some in the '50s.",
  "No, no. Clearly. But these awards have been common.",
  "Justice Breyer is asking, can you think of an example where words are not on their face plain, and the Court has looked to the practices that have been imbued into that word and said -- and we've decided that they will be accepted in the way that practice has given them meaning?",
  "Counsel, one --",
  "Counsel, I thought that part of your argument was that, given the instructions in this case, which the jury appears to have followed to the T, they can't get to a lesser count unless they've acquitted on the preceding count.",
  "When the judge asks them, did you reach criminal negligence, they say we were told not to. Now, the judge, whether he was right or wrong under Hughes as to whether they followed the instructions or he misunderstood them, I don't know. But it's very clear in context from the government's arguments to the jury, to the defense argument to the jury, you don't reach the split count or even talk about it unless you've been acquitted. So, given that the jury responds at the end we haven't reached a verdict, and the jury said earlier that they hadn't reached a verdict on the one issue, isn't the -- the only assumption is that they didn't go back?",
  "Counsel, what do several States have? I've -- if I read what those States are saying, including the Massachusetts State that you point to, it's a very simple rule. And you seem to be arguing past it or around it or -- I think what they say is, once the jury announces an acquittal, then that's the substance; the person's been acquitted once they've made a judgment and announced it. It -- the Constitution doesn't -- the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't entitle someone to have it announced, doesn't entitle someone to force the jury to announce it. But if the jury gets up at the end of the trial in a State that doesn't permit partial verdicts and said, contrary to the instructions of the judge, contrary to the law of the State, the jury says we acquitted on counts one and two, we're hung on count three, the Constitution says jeopardy attaches because there has been an announcement of a verdict. Isn't that your position?",
  "Well, Ball -- our case in Ball says it doesn't matter whether a judgment is entered or not. As far back as 1896, Ball said the judgment is irrelevant. It is the verdict of acquittal, and it basically equated that verdict with -- it doesn't matter if it's entered properly, if the jury is polled, if anything happens. It's as soon as the jury announces acquittal, that's the operative double jeopardy kicker. Isn't that what you're saying?",
  "And I thought I heard you arguing that here the lack of manifest necessity was that the judge had heard they reached that verdict.",
  "And he should not have discharged the jury without asking them, could they reach a verdict that they had -- had they reached the verdict that they announced?",
  "I'm sorry. I'm so totally confused by you ignoring Hughes.",
  "The Arkansas charge says: If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt on the charge of capital murder, you will consider the charge of murder in the first degree. And I thought the Arkansas cases said no one juror is going to think they can go to the next count. They have to understand from this charge that it has to be unanimous. And that's what the prosecutor argued. It's what the defense argued. It's what your supreme court has said has to happen. I'm a little confused, given your case law, your supreme court case law, that says you can't move on to the next one unless it's unanimous, how you can answer Justice Kagan's question the way you have. I mean, there's nothing in your case law that --",
  "Would this be different if they had -- if the judge had called them back in and said, are you deadlocked on the third count? And -- my hypothetical to your adversary. And they said: Well, we have acquitted on capital murder. We've acquitted on the second count. We are still, Judge, deadlocked. If this had been announced at the very end, what would be your position today?",
  "Doesn't sound like the judge was interested in any of the defense counsel's positions on mistrial. He announced that whether the jury told him they were deadlocked or not, he was going to call them back. So, I don't know that the judge would have done what you suggested.",
  "Because a judge -- the defense attorney did ask for partial verdicts after their first announcement.",
  "So, if the State rule says we don't take partial verdicts and the judge had entered a verdict -- a judgment -- declared a mistrial or entered a judgment saying hung jury as to all counts, would jeopardy have attached?",
  "No. If the jury had announced what it did, but following Arkansas law as you read it, you don't take partial verdicts, it could only be one hung jury.",
  "Would jeopardy have attached?",
  "So, really the only issue here is whether it's reasonable to conclude that a jury that had been told acquit first comes back and says we're only hung on this, and the jury says listen to each other on what your hung on, that that jury reasonably -- the judge could have ignored their stated verdict and enter a trial -- a mistrial on everything else.",
  "General, how do you deal with our cases, Ball and Martin Linen and the whole line that says State -- the form of State law judgments doesn't control?",
  "I'm not sure what that means.",
  "And that's the problem with all of this area, which is States vary on how they enter judgments after the jury speaks its verdict. So, where do we draw the line as to when a State law trumps -- when a Federal law, the Double Jeopardy Clause, trumps a State system?",
  "General, other than trenching on State rules that don't create the constitutional protection, what's wrong with a simple rule that says, once a jury announces that it is unanimous on acquittal of a count, you can't go back unless the jury says that it's not unanimous in some way? What's wrong with that rule?",
  "Why? The jury comes out and says we're unanimous. There's a poll. One juror says I'm really not unanimous. They go back. But once a jury says it's unanimous, a judge can't declare a mistrial, can't do something until it ensures itself that -- that jeopardy hasn't attached.",
  "No, I'm not -- I'm not asking -- I'm not announcing or setting a rule that says you have to ask them, you have to force them to give a verdict. I'm not -- I'm saying what's wrong with the constitutional rule that simply says, once the jury says we're unanimous, there can't be manifest injustice -- there can't be manifest necessity until you're sure that they can't reach a verdict -- that that verdict is not their verdict?",
  "That's what --",
  "That's what three State courts have said. Three State courts have said, if there's any meaning to jeopardy, it is that once a jury out loud says to a defendant you're not guilty, the defendant is entitled to rely on that. So, what's wrong with that simple rule?",
  "General, may I pose a hypothetical? During the Vietnam War, a protester holds up a sign that says I won a Purple Heart -- for killing babies. Knowing statement. He didn't win the Purple Heart. As a reader, I can't be sure whether he did and is a combat veteran who opposes the war or whether he's a citizen protesting the war. Is that person -- if he's not a veteran having received a medal, is he liable under this Act?",
  "Somewhat dangerous, isn't it -­",
  "-- to subject speech to the absolute rule of no protection? Which is what you're advocating, I understand.",
  "That there are no circumstances in which this speech has value. I -- I believe that's your bottom line.",
  "Well, that's not -­",
  "Harms -- General, I spent a lot of time going through the multiple cases that you cited in your brief defining the various statutes that basically impose penalties for impersonation of some sort or another. And virtually in every one of them, except perhaps one, there was either an economic interest that was harmed by the impersonation, either by the face of the -- by the very face of the statute or by the nature of the claim, a dilution of a trademark by taking on someone else's valuable property rights. And so, I went back reading our cases, and Justice Story many, many years ago said, look, falsehoods have no value as such, but the \"breathing space\" concept is defined by those falsehoods which cause injury to rights that people possess, to pecuniary -- to pecuniary interests that they have, or to the reputation of others. And almost every statute where we've approved a harm concept as being permissible for recovery has affected one of those three things. So, please tell me what's wrong with Justice Story's view, number one; and, number two, how does the definition of harm fit in that? What's the harm here that fits within that descriptor?",
  "I didn't mention -­ neither did Justice Story.",
  "He said if you want to regulate a falsehood, it has to cause a harm in this way.",
  "Not really. They're intended to protect the right of the government to secure truthful information.",
  "The government has a right to subpoena you at trial, subject you to oath, and force you to tell the truth.",
  "So, if you -- that's a right. That fits within Story's definition.",
  "General, but I have a problem, which is it's not as narrow as it could get. Wouldn't take much to do exactly what Congress said it was doing, which was to protect against fraudulent claims of receiving a medal, and the example it used was someone who used a fraudulent claim of receiving a medal to get money. What I'm trying to get to is what harm are we protecting here? I thought that the core of the First Amendment was to protect even against offensive speech. We have a legion of cases that said your emotional reaction to offensive speech is not enough. If that is the core of our First Amendment, what I hear, and that's what I think the court below said, is you can't really believe that a war veteran thinks less of the medal that he or she received because someone's claiming fraudulently that they got one. They don't think less of the medal. We're reacting to the fact that we're offended by the thought that someone's claiming an honor they didn't receive. So, outside of the emotional reaction, where's the harm? And I'm not minimizing it. I too take offense when people make these kinds of claims, but I take offense when someone I'm dating makes a claim that's not true.",
  "And -- and -­",
  "You know -­",
  "Or I'm not going to do this because the medal has been debased.",
  "But the reality is that this gentleman was publicized, deriled for what he did. His public position was compromised, as is the case with almost everyone who's caught at lying.",
  "Counsel, my -­",
  "May I -- if I understood your argument, you're saying historically we have not protected false statements that cause harm. I think that's your argument.",
  "All right. Assuming -­ so, it's -- we do protect false statements presumptively, but the historical exception, like defamation, are those that cause harm. So, I go back to Justice Alito's question because you really haven't answered his question. You've dealt with the government process cases, although I -- we could argue about whether that's protecting a process or protecting a government right to truthful information. That's a different issue. But the question is how do you deal with the intentional infliction of emotional distress? Because damage -- we require injury, and it's defined under law what kind of injury. So, tell me how you define harm in the nongovernmental situation, number one, and then tell me why that -- this situation doesn't fit that definition.",
  "So, why isn't the outrage that medal winners, legitimately entitled medal winners, experience in seeing fake people or hearing fake people claim a medal -- why isn't that comparable?",
  "Counsel, it seems to me that you're asking us to value the speech in context. We're not talking about the effect of the speech and whether you can regulate that. You're asking us to say, you know, the guy who says he's a college graduate in a political campaign, that could chill political speech. So, in that lie in that context, you can't sanction, but you can sanction that lie in a different context. On a date.",
  "I don't know because, on a date, it doesn't chill political speech, and it will induce a young woman to date someone who she thinks is more of a professional, because that harms the parents, it harms the family.",
  "Counsel, we asked for two questions presented. The first was: Do court of appeals have the power sua sponte to raise issues? And in your reply brief, you appear to say, yes, they do in some circumstances. So, are you conceding that that power exists or that there is no power whatsoever?",
  "Is that a question of power or a question of exercise of discretion?",
  "That seems sort of strange. Both rely on a factual situation. Either you can do something or you can't. That's power. If you can do it sometimes, that's still power, and then the question is, did you do it when you couldn't do it?",
  "So, all this fight is about is whether there was a deliberate waiver or not?",
  "As opposed to power?",
  "Only the opportunity or when it acknowledges -- in Day, we faulted the district court for not telling the State, essentially, which we may -- not telling the State that it had a potential statute of limitations defense. Is it your position that if the State had just been silent about the statute of limitations defense and not raised it, that the court of appeals wouldn't have power? Or is it your position that because they knew they had the defense and didn't raise it that the court of appeals didn't have power to sua sponte raise it.",
  "You're not answering my question.",
  "Does the court of appeals have the power to sua sponte raise it if the issue?",
  "All right. So, it doesn't have the power if the issue has been raised? Is that your position?",
  "I'm a little confused. You seem to be arguing that because the court of appeals raised it before the party did, that that's worse than a party raising it first. Is that your position? That that -- that the court of appeals has more power after a party who has forfeited below or waived below now tries to come up on appeal and assert a defense that they didn't assert below? Now the court of appeals has more power?",
  "But those arguments were rejected in Granberry and Day.",
  "Why should they win now?",
  "So, what's wrong with that? Why should we be penalizing the State for trying to simplify an action and make it move more expeditiously?",
  "Can I -- can I ask you, do you mean to tell me that, using your own words in your brief, that a waiver is the intentional abandonment of a known right? I think you're equating intentional abandonment of a known right to be I have to admit I could win and I'm giving up that argument.",
  "Is that what you're saying -- deliberate?",
  "Well, you knew you had a defense under the statute of limitations.",
  "You thought, because you conceded, that you weren't conceding that it was untimely. So, you were conceding you thought it was untimely, and despite admitting that you knew you had a defense, that you knew it could win, you were choosing not to assert it. So, tell me why that's not either an intentional waiver, a deliberate waiver, or an abandonment of a known right?",
  "You were protecting the court's right to do whatever it wanted.",
  "So, why isn't it an abuse of discretion for an appellate court, when there has been an intentional abandonment of a known right, to sua sponte raise that defense?",
  "The new --",
  "I'm sorry. The new case law is what I said. When you say I won't raise this defense, I waive it, everything you said except saying I don't admit it, today, before a circuit court abuses its discretion, you also have to say I am waiving the right of the court of appeals to raise this sua sponte. That's -- that's -- you want that to be what you need to do for us to find a waiver.",
  "Counsel, do you --",
  "Are you talking about a facial challenge to the statute as -- and am I understanding you right? A facial challenge goes to the district court and a constitutional as-applied challenge goes to the commission?",
  "Could you tell me how --",
  "-- how -- how this is any different than the administrative system and review system that was reviewed in Thunder Basin and Illinois Long-Term Care? In both those statutes, the agencies weren't permitted to consider facial challenges, constitutional challenges; and we said that's okay, they can't, but the reviewing court can. So, how's that any different from the situation you're proposing here?",
  "But please deal with the language of both cases. Both cases said even if the agency can't review a constitutional challenge, there's still review within the Federal Circuit -- within the -- within the circuit courts, and that's okay.",
  "So, why isn't that okay here? I think that was Justice Scalia's question to you. I know that you say, well, the Federal Circuit won't have a record. But the Government says if it wants a record, it can remand and ask the agency to develop it. So, what's wrong with that procedure?",
  "Isn't one of the challenges here by one of the Petitioners that he was constructively discharged? Isn't that an issue that the board is better suited to determine in the first instance, whether there was at all a constructive discharge?",
  "Is that your -- is that your answer for that's why it's an out for their failure to have gone to the Federal Circuit?",
  "Will they be able -- if the -- if the commission says, no, we won't reopen, do they have any avenue now to go to the Federal Circuit?",
  "Please finish with your answer.",
  "To go back to your interesting suggestion that the board should decide the constitutional issue, I've just been spending a little bit of time going through the Act, and you're certainly -- it doesn't appear that there's anything in the Act that precludes them from granting any appropriate relief with respect to an unlawful discharge. Am I correct?",
  "Is there any rule of the board that stops a litigant from making a proffer -- an offer of proof?",
  "Wouldn't that be the proper way of doing it, if you're going to go up on a constitutional claim? Make your offer of proof, and then the Federal Circuit can decide if it needs more evidence or not.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, could you explain to me the -- the difference between respondeat superior liability and corporate liability? In -- in the briefs, there seems to be an assumption that respondeat superior liability is -- is permissible, and the only issue is whether corporate liability is. Is there a difference between the two doctrines?",
  "For all the reasons Justice Kagan mentioned, that the TVPA is not a limiting source and can be viewed as a supplemental source, but there does appear to be a little bit of incongruity, that aliens can sue corporations for acts against other aliens, but American citizens under the TVPA might not be able to sue corporations. How do we deal with that incongruity?",
  "The problem --",
  "The problem is I don't even look there. I look to the TVPA, section 2(a)(2), which uses the word \"person.\" So, it wasn't as if in writing the statute Congress forgot the word \"person.\"",
  "They appear to be using \"person\" in the organizational way that \"person\" is defined in the Dictionary Act and elsewhere. So, isn't that a textual clue that they were using the word \"individual\" in a different sense?",
  "Individuals, legal representative, or to any person who may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death. I'm not quite sure. Legal representative is often -- can be a person but can often also be a -- a corporate entity.",
  "Yes.",
  "In the same sentence? In the same sentence?",
  "Those statutes you --",
  "So, it's okay to keep out individuals who subject others to torture, but corporations -- we want their money so they should invest here --",
  "-- because we're going to protect them from liability to -- for people that they torture.",
  "So, what's the good reason --",
  "-- for the U.S. to have limited liability to natural persons in the TVPA but not in the ATS context?",
  "Counsel, I understand your arguments. Your adversary raises a point that concerns me, which is what happens to all other amnesty programs like parking ticket amnesties? And if you take your logic to an extreme, how about something that doesn't involve money but immigration status amnesty, illegal aliens who can apply for citizenship and be forgiven their illegal entry? Doesn't the logic of your theory basically mean that there are no circumstances in which the government could treat people differently?",
  "Every time a police officer stops me for a traffic violation, I get angry when he lets somebody else go. So, you're suggesting that there is a difference between that and this case where the government is basically saying you owe me something and I'm going to forgive you what you owe me?",
  "You see, the problem that I have is that you're trying to lop off half of the project, which is what was the Barrett project, without looking at what the new project is. And that goes to what Justice Breyer's point was. Moving forward, every old project and every new project is going to pay more money than they did under the Barrett Law because I think, if I understand correctly, the city is raising a -- essentially not a flat fee, but a fee, assessing a flat fee across all taxpayers so that these sewer lines can be built. Am I correct about that?",
  "But it -- but it says that new people are going to pay a flat fee. Old people are going to pay $10 more a month that they didn't have to pay.",
  "And so, why can't they come in, and why don't they come in, and say exactly what Justice Breyer said: You forgave the payments of taxes for hooking up to the sewer system of these new people coming in. You're treating me differently.",
  "Well, so, everybody else says I want to pay $2,500. You're still not dealing with the fact that this was one decision tied to others. It was a package deal and -- so that the rationality of this package deal has to be seen in context. You want to lop it off and say all I'm looking at is how much these taxpayers paid for this old system, not what the new system is creating.",
  "That is the parking amnesty example that you have said wasn't the same. Because if an individual taxpayer has filed late, it's like the parking guy who didn't file his ticket, either.",
  "So, you really are saying that amnesty programs are out of the question if the risk is imposed equally on everyone.",
  "No, but you're saying if you forgive the parking ticket, that's an equal protection violation.",
  "Was his figure of 2 million accurate? As the stake -- in the other case.",
  "There was in my memory, and it's been a while, that some States, if not all -- and that's what I was going to ask you -- basically deem any child born during the marriage to be a child of the marriage, whether it's a biological child or not, so that if a mother has had a relationship outside of marriage, the married parent's still responsible for that child. That would take care of, I think, a great number, wouldn't it, of the new technology births that occur without perhaps the input of one of -- the biological input of one of the parents?",
  "Yes. My question was, do all States have similar rulings? And for those that don't, what happens to a child that's been born with, as Justice Roberts said, as the Chief said, with new technology? What happens to that child in terms of their definition -- of whether they'll be considered a child for Social Security purposes?",
  "Rebuttable presumption or irrebuttable?",
  "Can I ask -- Justice Scalia said that the statute is ambiguous. Is that your position? Is it your position that the definition of \"child\" is ambiguous and that we have to give the agency deference, or is it your position that, in context, it's unambiguous and even if the Social Security Administration wanted to extend benefits, it couldn't, in the circumstances of this case?",
  "Excuse me. Could you tell me what purpose 416(h) serves in this statute --",
  "-- given that you believe that 416(e) is self-sufficient unto itself?",
  "As the child who should receive. So, what's the purpose of (h)?",
  "So, the -- a child who was born during marriage but is not a biological child wouldn't qualify?",
  "Even though they qualify under State law as a child?",
  "So, would this -- let's assume Ms. Capato remarried but used her deceased husband's sperm to -- to birth two children. They're the biological children of the Capatos. Would they qualify for survivor benefits even though she's now remarried?",
  "Well, that's -- you see, a situation like that is what is making me uncomfortable because I don't see the words \"biological\" in the statute. I don't see the word \"marriage\" directly when -- within the definition of \"child.\" So, where do I draw them from? Where do I come --",
  "That would be true under State intestate law.",
  "I'm interested as to what your definition of \"child\" is. Is it just a biological offspring? Is it limited to a biological offspring born of a particular marriage, but in what context? Because we go back to Justice Ginsburg's question of what happens if the -- if the decedent is the mother. There's no question that she bore this child. Married or unmarried, does it matter? Does marriage matter only if it's the father that's the decedent? What is your --",
  "If there is a sperm donor, does any offspring that sperm donor have qualify?",
  "So, a mother who is unmarried who bears a child, this child is not automatically covered.",
  "Oh, so there are situations in which you think those provisions should govern.",
  "This is what was not clear to me. So, you're -- you're not arguing that \"child\" has just one natural meaning.",
  "In whatever meaning you could give it.",
  "How -- do you think that Congress thought of either of these situations as real possibilities? Do you really think that the 1939 Congress, or even the one that passed the later statute, ever thought that a State would disinherit a naturally born -- all naturally born children -- or that children could be born 18 months, 4 years, 50 years later?",
  "They weren't thinking of either. So, the question becomes, given the language of (h) that says define \"child\" this way throughout the subchapter, why shouldn't we give that directive its plain meaning? That's really the argument that you have to convince us of.",
  "But that's because every State law recognized them as such as well, correct?",
  "You have no inducement to --",
  "Mr. Phillips, can you deal with one policy argument that your adversary raised that gives me some pause? And that is, the number of days is certainly something that the jury here could -- relatively easily decided upon. It could have looked at the evidence and figured that out --",
  "-- okay? But in fraud cases, in securities cases, sometimes the identity of victims is not determined for months, till months after the conviction, and the amount of fine and/or restitution is set at sentencing. What's going to happen to all of those statutes --",
  "-- because -- or all of those procedures that have been set up by Congress to sort of set the amount of loss and repayment? Are all of those subject to the Apprendi rule?",
  "Well, isn't -- aren't fines indeterminate here by definition, going back to Justice Kagan's question? There's no upper limit to how much the fine could be here. It's set -- the upper limit is set by the number of days, but why is it different?",
  "Why is restitution --",
  "Well, so -- so --",
  "So, how about when a fine is set by the value of the loss?",
  "That's no different than restitution.",
  "Congress permitted --",
  "-- in 1790 indeterminate sentences as well, with no statutory maximum for jail.",
  "So, they did both --",
  "-- with respect to fines and --",
  "I'm not sure how you can fully make that argument, because I thought the history was set forth fairly clearly in Apprendi that the early history was that nothing was given to the jury with respect to imprisonment or fines because most if not all sentences were indeterminate. It's only when States began, and the Federal government, to experiment with determinate sentences that the Apprendi issue then became live.",
  "So, explain to me, other than your reliance on Ice, some sort of tradition, which, you know, we can debate whether you can draw any conclusion from tradition in any of these areas, whether it's imprisonment or fines. Tell me on the logic of Apprendi, not using Ice, why fines are different, without relying on history, which to me is -- I view it as ambiguous. Okay?",
  "I thought it was a fairly simple algorithm. It says if the statutory penalty -- if a judge's factfinding can increase the statutory penalty, then that's a violation of the Sixth Amendment. A jury has to find any fact that increases the statutory maximum.",
  "So, outside of a -- a -- imprisonment, there is no other penalty that Congress could fashion because it has no history that wouldn't be within the purview of the judge?",
  "What makes acceptable common law? Let's assume there weren't 50 States back then, but whatever the number was, 20 States, and 15 of them submitted it to the jury and 5 didn't. Does that mean there was no common law that this was generally submitted to the jury? If you can point to one case, that's enough to defeat the existence of a common law view?",
  "That -- you see, that's my problem.",
  "But so was imprisonment.",
  "Well, how many statutes had anything but indeterminate fine structures?",
  "How many statutes in the early common law had anything but indeterminate fine statutes?",
  "I may have just forgotten, but does your brief go through the status of what lower courts have decided with respect to fines and how they're dealing with them? I just don't remember it as being part of your brief, the statement you just made to Justice Kennedy.",
  "Okay.",
  "I'm sorry. I thought you just said a second earlier that you had a bifurcated rule: No life without parole whatsoever for 15 and under, and no mandatory life for 16 -- 15 and over.",
  "How do you -- how do you write the opinion to do the bifurcated rule? What justifies an absolute ban at a certain age and a modified ban above an age, and how do you deal with Harmelin with respect to the second part of your rule?",
  "Harmelin says we don't look at individualized sentencing.",
  "So, how do we get rid of the mandatory if that's what we're were going to do?",
  "Counsel, there is no question that you're dealing with a much smaller universe of children sentenced to life without parole who are 14 and under. There's an argument that that's because so few of them commit the crimes. But putting that aside, the universe is rather small.",
  "All right? There is a much, much larger group, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, for life without parole for juveniles at 15 and above.",
  "Go back to my question.",
  "I need an answer to it.",
  "Which is, assuming --",
  "-- the bifurcated theory that you proffered, tell me how we get around Harmelin. How would you write that decision?",
  "There wasn't a majority in theory in Harmelin, and -- but at least three Justices spoke about a gross disproportionality.",
  "Is it your views that life -- a mandatory life without parole for someone like a juvenile is grossly disproportionate?",
  "Did that happen in Jackson?",
  "Counsel --",
  "Actually, I do want to ask, and it dovetails with what Justice Breyer is asking, the Enmund/Tison line for adults, which is we can't execute someone who hasn't killed, intended to kill, or was reckless in killing. This is a question more in the Jackson case, because I think it's an issue there. But although all murder is heinous and regrettable, there are different kinds of murder. That's why some people are subject to the death penalty and others are not. And I do see a world of difference between the Miller killing and the Jackson killing vis-à-vis the individual defendants' personal liability. So, assuming there are different kinds of -- of killings, of murder, should we be looking at the Enmund/Tison line at all? Should we be talking about its application to juveniles in a different way? Being Enmund/Tison basically, okay, felony murder if you know that there's a gun involved, but should that line be the same for juveniles? And, if so, then how do you go back to justifying, as Justice Breyer spoke about, the mandatory nature of life imprisonment without parole, given that not every juvenile is equal and not every murder is equal with respect to them?",
  "But that's not an individual legislative determination. That's -- that's just a --",
  "Could you start -- I know that Enmund and Tison has to do with death eligibility with respect to adults, but it does draw a line between death eligibility with respect to intentionality or not, or recklessness. Assuming for the sake of argument that some of us might be interested in whether a line should be created for juveniles who intended or didn't intend death, with respect to their eligibility for life without parole, whether it's mandatory or voluntary, how would we write that? Would -- would we just import all the Enmund and Tison jurisprudence? Or would we say something different with respect to juveniles?",
  "That has to do with your general rule, which -- which we shouldn't impose it at all.",
  "But if we go even to your second step rule -­",
  "-- assuming we bifurcate --",
  "-- then -- then we still have the question of when do we permit a mandatory imposition of --",
  "Well, in fact, Jackson was convicted with a non-intent, just a felony --",
  "It doesn't matter.",
  "The jury didn't have to -- all the jury found was that he didn't meet his affirmative burden of proving.",
  "And he didn't counsel -- they didn't make a finding --",
  "-- as to what words were used and what the intent was.",
  "I'm not sure reckless indifference means that. Meaning, if he knew they were carrying guns, doesn't that make him liable for the reckless indifference --",
  "-- whether he thought they would use them or not?",
  "Counsel, I -- I know that this seems like block building, but I think of law as sort of logical. If you're involved in a felony and you counsel the felony where someone dies, under Arkansas law, you're guilty of felony murder, correct?",
  "Right. So, whether or not that he intended to counsel the crime, he was guilty of felony murder, unless he could prove the affirmative defense, right?",
  "So, obviously, he didn't prove the affirmative defense, but that doesn't mean that the jury actually found that he used one set of words or another. It just means that they didn't believe he had proven by his burden of proof that he had not counseled, correct?",
  "As a possibility for the jury.",
  "But not that it was an actual finding by the jury.",
  "All right.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "What hope does he have?",
  "What hope does he have?",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "I thought he was life without parole. I thought he was sentenced to life without parole. How can the parole board --",
  "Could you tell me what the error actually was? I see -- and you can add another -- three potential things about these calls or three potential errors: One, that they proved as a matter of fact that she was biased. But, as the majority points out, she already said she was before the tapes were played. So, whatever error may have been occasioned by the jury using the tapes as for the truth, it really was cumulative to an already admitted bias. The second is some sort of ambiguous statement by her that all of them were in trouble, meaning all the defendants, and a similar statement by the -- by Petitioner's lawyer. So, what was it that was error that affected or influenced the jury among these three choices?",
  "It was never referenced in the summations, however, or in the reply.",
  "So, that's the error that you think --",
  "-- influenced this trial?",
  "All right. Now, tell me what in this record reflects that influence.",
  "The fact that they asked for her testimony -- well, she was your client's entire defense. So, what does the asking for her testimony show that they were interested in that particular part of the transcript?",
  "Which transcript? The transcript of her testimony?",
  "Could we get a little more practical here? I think I understood your basic argument, which is: My defense was by this one woman, the wife of one of the codefendants. She tells a story, and if the jury had believed her story they would have acquitted your client.",
  "All right. So, I am assuming what you're saying -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong -- which is if we believe that the error committed affected her credibility in a meaningful way, that that deprived you of a defense. Is that what you're saying?",
  "Of the potential of convincing the jury.",
  "Okay. Now, assuming that's your argument --",
  "-- I go back to my question. Okay? Because what you said to me earlier, it wasn't about believing her or not; it was about believing the defense attorney when -- whether the defense attorney thought the defendant was guilty or not.",
  "Let's -- let's --",
  "Are you -- are you taking the position in this case that a reviewing court, under no circumstance, could conclude that this error was harmless? Or are you taking the position in this case that the court here, the Seventh Circuit, I think, committed review error and we should send it back for them to do it the right way?",
  "I don't know how to separate out an admitted error situation. And let me explain why, okay? Let's assume the facts of this case, but instead of this tape recording, the improperly admitted evidence was a confession by the defendant. Would you be prepared to say that in a circumstantial case of guilt -- now, we've already said that confessions are one of the most powerful pieces of harmful error -- that in this, in a confession, that somehow this was still harmful -- harmless?",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "That's a different standard.",
  "Let's -- let's talk about it under the Kehota standard. Let's talk about the standard we're assessing.",
  "No, no, no. He testifies, but he testifies to everything Marina said. Meaning, he -- when I used the word \"confession,\" I'm sorry, I misspoke. He takes the stand. He -- or doesn't take the stand. He says everything he said to the police. And that confession that he was there, et cetera --",
  "She called him --",
  "-- et cetera.",
  "It was improperly admitted. Without Miranda --",
  "-- Miranda warnings.",
  "Uh-huh. Not the tapes, just the story.",
  "All right.",
  "My hypothetical is not working for this reason, and I understand what you're saying. It's hard to identify a comparable mistake. But my point is that -- doesn't the harmfulness of the error sort of vary with the strength of the government's case?",
  "If he had not run away, and the tapes were admitted --",
  "Exactly.",
  "And what the defense said was there's only one defense here, and it's the wife's defense that he was there by accident, not intentionally. There was a lot of countervailing evidence to disprove that, but the question is could a reasonable jury have -- might have or could have credited that defense?",
  "No, you look at how the case was tried.",
  "Counsel, I just don't see how you can do it without the error. I keep going back to this point. How about if the prosecutor had done in summation the following: Ladies and Gentlemen, whatever the wife told you disbelieve because the lawyer said he was guilty.",
  "The lawyer -- the prosecutor got up at the end of trial and said: Disbelieve everything the wife told you, because the lawyer said the defendant was guilty. All right? I'll go through all the other evidence I have that might prove that she was not telling the truth, but the central, most important piece of evidence in this case about his guilt is that the lawyer said he's guilty. Can you say that this jury was uninfluenced by that error?",
  "Because under your formulation --",
  "-- a rational jury would have convicted absent the lawyer saying that.",
  "The dissent pointed out that she admitted that before the tapes were played.",
  "That she was testifying in the hopes of getting a lesser sentence for her husband. So, she -- the tapes weren't necessary for that.",
  "What was your second --",
  "Counsel, that --",
  "That's exactly what Justice Breyer is saying. Okay? Which is, as I understand it -- and there's some literature that talks about should we be treating misdemeanor arrests different than felony arrests, because there's less discretion that an officer would have with respect to arresting someone for a felony than for misdemeanors or criminal fines, because like jaywalking, policemen don't arrest you for jaywalking unless they're either on a ticket binge or because there's something about you that they don't like.",
  "So, if that something about you they don't like is that you're wearing an antiwar armband, are we going to let that plaintiff not recover, because somehow we need to protect police officers so much, in the discretionary use of this vast power they have to arrest that we're going to permit them to trample the First Amendment, essentially? Or are we going to say, in the normal situation there is a First Amendment claim, even with probable cause, if you can prove that it's the motivating factor for the arrest; but we treat Secret Service differently? And I think that was the point Justice Breyer's getting to, and the one I'm most interested in.",
  "If we don't extend. Hartman, how do we in a principled way deal with the unique needs of the Secret Service?",
  "If you're jaywalking, there's probable cause.",
  "But -- but what does it have to do with violating the First Amendment? Meaning, if police officers have discretion and they would not otherwise arrest you except for their dislike of your speech, that's a violation of your right to free speech, isn't it?",
  "We can go to that question later.",
  "Do you have a sense of how many of these First Amendment retaliatory claims in those jurisdictions that permit them -- I know they're more limited -- how many of these cases arise?",
  "And with what frequency?",
  "And how many arrests are there a year?",
  "It's -- a non-felony. I'm sure it's in the millions.",
  "Excuse me.",
  "Let's go past that for a second. What was it that the arresting agent said or did that showed the animus? Meaning, because that another officer actually saw it and understood himself what he thought doesn't mean that this agent who was told that there had been a touching had that information.",
  "So, I know collective knowledge is a theory in a lot of cases, but let's deal with the facts of this case. What's the animus?",
  "How does all of that prove your point of animus in light of the undisputed fact that he lied about touching the Vice President?",
  "And that's the --",
  "You do understand that this case is inviting the questions the Chief Justice asked, which -- and which -- as Justice Breyer and some of us are concerned about, which is what your adversary has described as First Amendment voicing is going to be a part of many, many arrests.",
  "How do we draw a line outside of the one that you proposed by your adversaries, that probable cause is the line?",
  "That doesn't enmesh the police in a constant barrage of claims that just because they angered a police officer, that's why they were arrested.",
  "Counsel - -",
  "Mr. Long, in Bowles, the Court looked to the long history of appellate issues as being jurisdictional in its traditional sense, not as a claim-processing rule, but as a pure jurisdiction rule, the power of the court to hear a case. From all the questions here, I count at least four cases in the Court's history where the Court has accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General and reached a tax issue. I have at least three cases, one of them just mentioned by Justice Kagan, where exceptions to that rule were read in. Given that history, regardless of how we define jurisdictional statutes versus claim-processing statutes in recent times, isn't the fairer statement that Congress has accepted that in the extraordinary case, we will hear the case?",
  "But doesn't that just prove that it knows that the court will impose a claim-processing rule in many circumstances, and so, in those in which it specifically doesn't want the court to, it has to be clearer?",
  "Could you go back to the question that Justice Alito asked? Assuming we find that this is not jurisdictional, what's the parade of horribles that you see occurring if we call this a mandatory claim-processing rule? What kinds of cases do you imagine that courts will reach?",
  "That wasn't my question.",
  "My question was, if we deem this a mandatory claim-processing rule - -",
  "-- what cases do you imagine courts will reach on what grounds? Assuming the government does its job and comes in and raises the AIA as an immediate defense - -",
  "-- what -- where can a court then reach the question, despite - -",
  "Assumes the lack of competency of the government, which I don't, but what other types of cases?",
  "But Bob Jones involved a statute where it denominated the exaction as a tax.",
  "Here we have one where the Congress is not denominating it a -- as a tax; it's denominating it as a penalty.",
  "Absolutely. But even the section of the code that you referred to previously, the one following 7421, the AIA, it does very clearly make a difference -- 7422 -- make a difference between tax and penalties. It's very explicit.",
  "Could you tell me why you think the Solicitor General's reading creates a problem? He - -",
  "That it is a jurisdictional bar, but there's an exemption for those items that Congress has designated solely as penalties that are not like taxes.",
  "Oh that's not -- that's carrying it too far, because he says if a penalty is designated as a tax by Congress, then it's subject to the AIA, and that's most of the code, the tax code. And he says for those portions of the Affordable Care Act that designate things as taxes, the AIA applies. So, it's only -- and I haven't found another statute. I'm going to ask him if there's another one. It's only for those statutes in which Congress has designated something solely as a penalty.",
  "And not indicated that it is a tax.",
  "They don't fall within the AIA.",
  "Well, General, you also have the Bailey child labor tax cases, 'cause there the Court said that the tax, which was a prohibitory tax alone, was a tax subject to the AIA, and then it said it was beyond the Court's taxing power in a separate case, correct?",
  "That's a different issue. The question Justice - -",
  "Could we -- could we address, General, the question of whether there are any collateral consequences for the failure to buy -- to not buy health insurance? Is the only consequence the payment of the penalty? The Private Respondents argue that there are other collateral consequences such as for people on probation who are disobeying the law. If they don't buy health insurance, they'd be disobeying the law and could be subject to having their supervised release revoked.",
  "Is your whole point that this was inartful drafting by Congress, that, to the extent that there is an exemption under the penalty, it's an exemption from the legal obligation?",
  "General, but I thought that people who were eligible for Medicaid weren't subject to the penalty. Am I wrong? I could be just factually wrong.",
  "Yes.",
  "But for those people below - -",
  "Well, why isn't - -",
  "But tell me something, why isn't this case subject to the same bars that - - that you list in your brief? The Tax Court, at least so far, considers constitutional challenges to statutes. So, why aren't we -- why isn't this case subject to a dismissal for failure to exhaust?",
  "Big difference, though.",
  "No, that -- that's not true. The suit here has nothing to do with hearing the action. It has to do with the form of relief that Congress is barring. It's not permitting -- it is not a tax case; you can come in afterwards. It's not permitting the court to exercise what otherwise would be one of its powers.",
  "It does seem strange to think of a -- a law that says no court can entertain a certain action and give a certain remedy as merely a claim-processing rule. What the -- the court is being ousted from -- from what would otherwise be its power to hear something.",
  "So, how do you deal with this case and our Gonzalez -- our recent Gonzalez case, where we talked about - -",
  "-- the language of the COA statute, that no appeal will be heard absent the issuance of?",
  "There is an argument that we should just simply say that Bowles applies only to appeals, but we haven't said that.",
  "Counsel, all of those - - all of that in particular - -",
  "And we haven't relied on it in other cases.",
  "Many of which themselves speak in very clear jurisdictional language.",
  "So, why don't we say - - so, why don't we say it's jurisdictional except when the Solicitor General waives?",
  "Why would that not promote Congress's policy of ensuring -- or Congress explicitly says - -",
  "Yes. It's a contradiction in terms. I don't disagree. I don't disagree.",
  "They raised it and then gave it up.",
  "I'm -- I'm a little bit confused, and this is what I'm confused about: There - - there's a challenge to the individual mandate.",
  "All right? What does the fact that the State is challenging Medicaid -- how does it give the State standing to challenge an obligation that is not imposed on the State in any way?",
  "Yes. That's what I'm - -",
  "-- a little confused by.",
  "General --",
  "General, I see or have seen three strands of arguments in your briefs, and one of them is echoed today. The first strand that I've seen is that Congress can pass any necessary laws to effect those powers within its rights, i.e., because it made a decision that to effect -- to effect mandatory issuance of insurance, that it could also obligate the mandatory purchase of it. The second strand I see is self-insurance affects the market; and so, the government can regulate those who self-insure. And the third argument -- and I see all of them as different -- is that what the government is doing -- and I think it's the argument you're making today -- that what the -- what the government is saying is if you pay for health -- if you use health services, you have to pay with insurance, because only insurance will guarantee that whatever need for health care that you have will be covered, because virtually no one, perhaps with the exception of 1 percent of the population, can afford the massive cost if the unexpected happens. This third argument seems to be saying what we're regulating is health care, and when you go for health services, you have to pay for insurance, and since insurance won't issue at the moment that you consume the product, we can reasonably, necessarily tell you to buy it ahead of time, because you can't buy it at the moment that you need it. Is that -- which of these three is your argument? Are all of them your argument? I'm just not sure what the --",
  "So, on that ground --",
  "-- you're answering affirmatively to my colleagues that have asked you the question, can the government force you into commerce?",
  "And there's no limit to that power.",
  "General, could you turn to the tax clause?",
  "I have looked for a case that involves the issue of whether something denominated by Congress as a penalty was nevertheless treated as a tax, except in those situations where the code itself or the statute itself said treat the penalty as a tax. Do you know of any case where we've done that?",
  "General, the problem goes back to the limiting principle. Is this simply anything that raises revenue, Congress can do?",
  "So, there has to be a limiting principle as to when --",
  "Do you accept here the General's position that you have conceded that Congress could say, if you're going to consume health services, you have to pay by way of insurance?",
  "All right. So, what do you do with the impossibility of buying insurance at the point of consumption? Virtually, you force insurance companies to sell it to you?",
  "Could we have an exemption? Could the government say everybody pays a shared health care responsibility payment to offset all the money that we're forced to spend on health care, we the government; but anybody who has an insurance policy is exempt from that tax? Could the government do that?",
  "Under what theory wouldn't it be?",
  "We get tax credits for having solar-powered homes. We get tax credits for using fuel-efficient cars. Why couldn't we get a tax credit for having health insurance and saving the government from caring for us?",
  "But we don't in car insurance, meaning we tell people buy car -- not we, the States do, although you're going to -- I'll ask you the question: Do you think that if some States decided not to impose an insurance requirement, that the Federal Government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insurance?",
  "Well, that goes back to the substantive due process question. Is this a Lochner-era argument that only the States can do this, even though it affects commerce? Cars indisputably affect commerce. So, are you arguing that because the States have done it all along, the Federal Government is no longer permitted to legislate in this area?",
  "But health insurance -- I mean, I've never gotten into an accident, thankfully, and I hope never. The vast majority of people have never gotten into an accident where they've injured others; yet, we pay for it dutifully every year on the possibility that at some point, we might get into that accident.",
  "But you're -- but the given is that virtually everyone, absent some intervention from above, meaning that someone's life will be cut short in a fatal way, virtually everyone will use health care.",
  "But that's exactly what Justice Marshall said in Gibbons. He said that it is the power to regulate; the power like all others vested in Congress is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than those prescribed in the Constitution. But there is no conscription in the -- set forth in the Constitution --",
  "-- with respect to regulating commerce.",
  "Well, see, that's the --",
  "Could you tell me, do you think the States could pass this mandate?",
  "Is there any other area of commerce, business, where we have held that there isn't concurrent power between the State and the Federal Government to protect the welfare of commerce?",
  "But then that's true of almost every product.",
  "It's true of almost every product, directly or indirectly by government regulation. The government says -- borrowing my colleague's example -- you can't buy a car without emission control. I don't want a car with emission control. It's less efficient in terms of the horsepower. But I'm forced to do something I don't want to do by government regulation.",
  "They force me to buy --",
  "They force me to buy if I need --",
  "--unpasteurized goods, goods that don't have certain pesticides but have others. There is government compulsion in almost every economic decision because the government regulates so much. It's a condition of life that some may rail against, but --",
  "But wait a minute. We let --",
  "We let the government regulate the manufacturing process whether or not the goods will enter into interstate commerce, merely because they might statistically. We let -- there's all sorts of government regulation of manufacturing plants, of agricultural farms, of all sorts of -- of activity that will be purely intrastate because it might affect interstate activity.",
  "So, how is that different from saying you are self-insuring today, you're forgoing insurance? Why isn't that a predecessor to the need that you're eventually going to have?",
  "Do you think that there is -- what percentage of the American people who took their son or daughter to an emergency room and that child was turned away because the parent didn't have insurance -- do you think there's a large percentage of the American population who would stand for the death of that child --",
  "-- if they had an allergic reaction and a simple shot would have saved the child?",
  "I'm sorry. Did you say the penalty's okay but not the mandate? I'm sorry. Maybe I've misheard you.",
  "So, the --",
  "So, the -- I want to understand the choices you're saying Congress has. Congress can tax everybody and set up a public health care system.",
  "That would be okay?",
  "Okay. Congress can --",
  "Are you taking the same position as your -- as your colleague? Congress can't say we're going to set up a public health system, but you can get a tax credit if you have private health insurance because you won't access the public system. Are you taking the same position as your colleague?",
  "So, how is that different than this Act, which says if a taxpayer fails to meet the requirement of having minimum coverage, then they are responsible for paying the shared responsibility payment?",
  "I think -- I think that's what's happening, isn't it?",
  "We're paying -- I thought that everybody was paying, what is it, $10 a pack now? I don't even know the price. It's pretty high.",
  "I think everybody recognizes that it's all taxation for the purposes of dissuading you to buy it.",
  "Counsel, that may well be true. The economists are going back and forth on that issue, and the figures vary from up 10 percent to up 30. We're not in the habit of doing the legislative findings. What we do know is that for those States that found prices increasing, that they found various solutions to that. In one instance -- and we might or may not say that it's unconstitutional -- Massachusetts passed the mandatory coverage provision. But others adjusted some of the other provisions. Why shouldn't we let Congress do that, if in fact the economists prove -- some of the economists prove right that prices will spiral? What's wrong with leaving it to -- in the hands of the people who should be fixing this, not us?",
  "That's all it said it was essential to. I mean, I'm looking at it. The exchanges. The State exchanges are information - gathering facilities that tell insurers what the various policies actually mean. And that has proven to be a cost saver in many of the States who have tried it. So, why should we be striking down a cost saver - -",
  "-- when, if what your argument is -- was that Congress was concerned about costs rising?",
  "Why should we assume they wouldn't have passed an information - -",
  "I think on the bottom line, is why don't we let Congress fix it?",
  "We're not taking -- if we strike down one provision, we're not taking that power away from Congress. Congress could look at it without the mandatory coverage provision and say this model doesn't work; let's start from the beginning. Or it could choose to fix what it has. We're not declaring -- one portion doesn't force Congress into any path.",
  "You are not suggesting that we should take on more power to the Court?",
  "Because Congress would choose to take one path rather than another. That's sort of taking onto the Court more power than one, I think, would want.",
  "Well, but it's not - -",
  "No statute can do that, because once we chop off a piece of it, by definition, it's not the statute Congress passed. So, it has to be something more than that.",
  "So, what is wrong with the presumption that our law says, which is we presume that Congress would want to sever? Wouldn't that be the simplest, most objective test? Going past what Justice Scalia says we have done, okay, get rid of legislative intent altogether, which some of our colleagues in other contexts have promoted, and just say: Unless Congress tells us directly it's not severable, we shouldn't sever. We should let them fix their problems. You still haven't asked -- answered me why in a democracy structured like ours, where each branch does different things, why we should involve the Court in making the legislative judgment?",
  "It's not a new rule. We presume. We've rebutted the presumption in some cases - -",
  "-- but some would call that judicial action.",
  "And what's wrong with that?",
  "But is that a matter of - -",
  "Mr. Kneedler, would you please - -",
  "Mr. Kneedler, move away from the issue of whether it's a standing question or not.",
  "Make the assumption that's an -- that this is an issue of the Court's exercise of discretion, because the last two questions had to do with what's wise for the Court to do, not whether it has power to do it or not.",
  "So, let's move beyond the power issue, which your answers have centered on, and give me the sort of policy. And I know that's a - - that's a bugaboo word sometimes, but what should guide the Court's discretion?",
  "Would you please - -",
  "I've asked you three times to move around that.",
  "I thought the simple answer was you don't have to because - -",
  "-- what we have to look at is what Congress said was essential, correct?",
  "Could you get back to the argument of -- of the heart?",
  "Striking down the heart, do we want half a loaf or a shell?",
  "I think those are the two analogies that - -",
  "I thought that the 26-year-olds were saying that they were healthy and didn't need insurance yesterday.",
  "So, today they're going to bankrupt the - -",
  "Counsel - -",
  "The problem I have is that you're ignoring the congressional findings and all of the evidence Congress had before it that community ratings and guaranteed issuance would be a death spiral -- I think that was the word that was used - - without minimum coverage. Those are all of the materials that are part of the legislative record here. So, even if it might not be because of the structure of the Act, that's post hoc evidence. Why should we be looking at that as opposed to what Congress had before it and use \"essential\" in its plain meaning: You can't have minimum coverage without, what the SG is arguing, community ratings and guaranteed issue. You can't have those two without minimum coverage.",
  "But you don't want them to say, either, that there is a death spiral. Do you want -- you don't want us to make either of those two findings, I'm assuming.",
  "Mr. Clement, could you respond to amici's point? He says that Congress didn't go into this Act to impose minimum coverage. They went into the Act to have a different purpose, i.e., to get people coverage when they needed it, to increase coverage for people, that this is only a tool. But other States -- going back to my original point, that there are other tools besides minimum coverage that Congress can achieve the same goals. So, if we strike just a tool, why should we strike the whole Act - -",
  "-- when Congress has other tools available?",
  "Is that a limit on the Federal Government's power to tax?",
  "Are you suggesting that at a certain point, the States would have a claim against the Federal Government raising their taxes because somehow, the States will feel coerced to lower their tax rate?",
  "Now, counsel, what percentage does it become coercive? Meaning, as I look at the figures I've seen from amici, there are some States for whom the percentage of Medicaid funding to their budget is close to 40 percent, but there are others that are less than 10 percent. And you say, across the board this is coercive because no State, even at 10 percent, can give it up. What -- what's the percentage of big gift that the Federal Government can give? And -- because what you're saying to me is, for a bankrupt State, there's no gift the Federal Government could give them ever, because it can only give them money without conditions --",
  "-- no matter how poorly the State is run, no matter how much the Federal Government doesn't want to subsidize abortions or doesn't want to subsidize some other State obligation, the Federal Government can't give them 100 percent of their needs.",
  "So, what makes them coercive; that the State doesn't want to face its voters and say, instead of taking 10, 20, 30, 40 percent of the government's offer of our budget and paying for it ourselves and giving up money for some other function? That's what makes it coercive --",
  "-- that the State is unwilling to say that?",
  "May I ask you a question, Mr. Clement? Do you think that the Federal Government couldn't, if it chose -- Congress -- say: The system doesn't work. We're just simply going to rehaul it. It's not consistent with how -- what we want to accomplish. We're just going to do away with the system and start a new health care plan of some sort. And, States, you can take the new plan, you can leave them. We're going to give out 20 percent less, maybe 20 percent more, depending on what Congress chooses. Can Congress do that? Does it have to continue the old system because that is what the States are relying upon, and it's coercive now to give them a new system?",
  "That's what I -- I want to know how I draw the line, meaning --",
  "-- I think the usual definition of coercion is, I don't have a choice. I'm not sure what -- why it's not a choice for the States. They may not pay for something else. If they don't take Medicaid, and they want to keep the same level of coverage, they may have to make cuts in their budget to other services they provide. That's a political choice of whether they choose to do that or not. But when have we defined the right or limited the right of government not to spend money in the ways that it thinks appropriate?",
  "I guess my greatest fear, Mr. Clement, with your argument is the following: The bigger the problem, the more resources it needs. We're going to tie the hands of the Federal Government in choosing how to structure a cooperative relationship with the States. We're going to say to the Federal Government, the bigger the problem, the less your powers are, because once you give that much money, you can't structure the program the way you want. It's our money, Federal Government. We're going to have to run the program ourself to protect all our interests. I don't see where to draw that line.",
  "The uninsured are a problem for States only because they, too, politically, just like the Federal Government, can't let the poor die. And so, to the extent they don't want to do that, it's because they feel accountable to their citizenry. And so, if they want to do it their way, they have to spend the money to do it their way, if they don't want to do it the Federal way. So, I -- I just don't understand the logic of saying, States, you can't -- you don't -- you're not entitled to our money, but once you start taking it, the more you take, the more power you have.",
  "Mr. Clement, he's not going home tonight.",
  "But could you tell me --",
  "I don't understand your first answer to Justice Kagan. You don't see there being a difference between the Federal Government saying we want to take care of the poor; States, if you do this, we'll pay 100 percent of your administrative costs. And you said that could be coercion. All right? Doesn't the amount of burden that the State undertakes to meet the Federal obligation count in this equation at all?",
  "Counsel, if we go back to that era of matching what a State pays to what a State gets, Florida loses. Its citizens pay out much less than what they get back in Federal subsidies of all kinds. So, you can't really be making the argument that Florida can't ask for more than it gives, because it's really giving less than it receives.",
  "You don't really want to go back to that point, do you?",
  "Can we go back --",
  "General, I'm trying to --",
  "-- go back to that because Justice Kennedy asked you whether there's -- I think he said it's coercion if no one can be politically accountable. I'm not sure how that could be practically politically accountable, because almost every gift -- if the terms are attractive, it would be an unattractive political alternative to turn it down. Dole itself was one of those cases. I think every State raised the drinking age to 21; correct?",
  "I guess my point is that political accountability has two components: What can I do if I like something, and what can I do if I don't like something? And if people really like something like Medicaid, they're not going to let you drop it, correct?",
  "Exactly. That's the whole point; that's their choice, right?",
  "Well, they made a choice with the stimulus bill, didn't they? Some governors rejected the stimulus bill --",
  "-- and some of -- some of their congressional or legislative processes overturned that.",
  "In others, they supported it. The percentages were smaller, but it's always the preference of the voters as to what they want, isn't it?",
  "Could you answer Justice Alito's question? Your brief to the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit suggested that a sale is a -- is a transaction, a transfer of some sort, or at least a promise to purchase. But your brief here calls it a much more rigid test, that there has to be a transfer of title. And he pointed to the language of 3(x) -- 3(k), that says \"consignment for sale,\" which doesn't have a transfer of the title. So, what is the Government's position?",
  "Counsel, can I --",
  "Counsel, I thought that this whole system was set up on giving industries the opportunity to ask the government for an opinion letter, correct?",
  "I saw in the briefing hundreds of opinion letters by hundreds of different industries. Outside of this 1945 letter, did anybody else, any other pharmaceutical company, ever set out for the government or seek an opinion letter that you're aware of?",
  "Can you give me what your regulation is going to be?",
  "And would it exempt everybody from coverage? Meaning, you seem to be saying if in some sense they make sales, it seems that every promotional person will be a salesman, that all industries have to do is put one or two forms of sales activities involved in the work of their worker, and they're exempt. Give me your definition? As long as it's in some sense, that covers everybody's exempt?",
  "Well, it seems like the sale here is not the primary duty. The sale here is to schmooze the doctor and give him information. That's what you said in one of your briefs -- your company said in one of its briefs in -- in a products liability litigation.",
  "Primary duty is one of the limiting, and what was the second limiting principle?",
  "How's that different from a bonus that an employee gets? How is it any different than what most companies do in -- in giving a bonus at the end of the year?",
  "Mr. Clement, you give me one definition of \"outside salesmen,\" the one that you prefer for us to apply here. The Department of Labor gives another, and the one they're giving according to them is a bright-line rule. It's easy to apply. You have to do some sort of transfer of title. That's as -- their rule. Tell me what the -- your argument is that -- why your rule has to win. Meaning, aren't we supposed to give deference to the expertise of the agency, especially when Congress lets them define --",
  "-- the scope of the --",
  "Do you think it's a clear and unmistakable implication -­",
  "-- if we're going to argue about the language?",
  "Well, generally the word \"express\" incorporates \"clear.\"",
  "So, that -- why doesn't that defeat your case?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, almost any law that repeals a prior penalty is doing so because the legislature determines that that prior penalty is unjust in some way, because why do you eliminate a penalty unless you think it is necessary to do so and that it's injust or unjust in some way? So, what makes this repeal particularly different so that the exception doesn't swallow the rule, because you can argue in almost any situation that the repeal is of something that's unjust?",
  "Mr. Estrada, what's so difficult for a legal doctrine to say that when Congress has made a finding that a law has a discriminatory impact -- because I always thought that when discrimination was at issue, that we should do as speedy a remedy as we could, because it is one of the most fundamental tenets of our Constitution, as has been repeatedly emphasized in case after case, that our laws should be -- should be enforced in a race-neutral way. Once Congress has said this law's not being enforced in a race-neutral way, we want to fix it, why shouldn't our presumption be that the fix is immediate rather than delayed?",
  "Mr. Estrada, I've been a judge for nearly 20 years, and I don't know that there's one law that has created more controversy or more discussion about its racial impact than this one.",
  "I don't think there is any other law that had as much conversation about its racial implications than this one.",
  "Well, but this agreement -­",
  "Mr. Estrada, even without the guideline amendment, for those defendants who committed crimes after the effective date of this Act, they would not have had -- new offense, not old offense -- if the day after this Act they committed the offense, they wouldn't have had a mandatory minimum that required their imprisonment for a certain amount of time, because the Act had already done away with the mandatory minimum, correct? Or changed the -­",
  "Yes, changed it, lowered the amounts.",
  "Exactly.",
  "So, those people would not have been bound to a mandatory minimum. And since district courts were not bound to the guidelines anyway, even if there had been no amendment to the guideline, the judges would have known they weren't bound to the mandatory minimum and probably not bound to guidelines that hadn't been amended yet either.",
  "So, it would have benefited these defendants no matter what.",
  "No, only in cases like this, where we know they have to change because Congress has directed they be changed.",
  "But that begs the question -­",
  "-- I started with, with you, which is if we know that this new Congress has already determined that those -- that mandatory minimum is discriminatory in the way that it had been constructed, what would be the purpose of delaying implementation?",
  "Mr. Estrada, I'm not sure I follow -­",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "I'm not sure I follow your example. I think that the guideline regulation is that the guideline -- the Sentencing Commission always has to be -- pass guidelines consistent with the mandatory minimum. And if the statute says that the mandatory minimum requires the -- the carrying medium to be included, the guidelines can't change that. The mandatory minimum would apply.",
  "But defendant -- I don't know that I know of one guideline scheme that changes whatever Congress has statutorily required.",
  "No, no. You have to -­ what you're arguing is not that the guidelines would be available for new offenses. What you're arguing is that they would be available for everybody except the cliffhangers. That -- that's what you're arguing.",
  "Everyone but the cliffhangers, because, as Justice Breyer pointed out, those people who were subject to the old guideline at a higher rate above the minimum now have the benefit of a lower rate. And so, they're going to get sentenced to a lower amount because they're not bound by the mandatory minimum.",
  "Excuse me, but could the Secretary have done anything else?",
  "Could the Secretary have done anything else? There's an allegation that the Secretary in fact pays some contractors more than their pro rata share, that it pays some nothing --",
  "-- so that it's in effect acting -- I don't want to use the word \"arbitrarily\" -- but acting in whatever its best interest is. So what protects the contracting party from that -- from that conduct, assuming it were to be correct?",
  "It says it has a policy.",
  "But the allegation is, is that it's not following it, that it's choosing to pay people some more than others.",
  "Well, how -- what was our reference in acceptance of the Ferris doctrine? And the Ferris doctrine was almost identical to this situation, where Congress allotted a certain amount to the building of a particular dam, and the same -- we applied the Ferris principle and said even though they gave it to one type of contract, the dam, they were paying 1 percent less than others.",
  "Where they had an allotment adequate enough to cover that individual.",
  "I know what the Federal Circuit said. I don't think the Federal Circuit's right. If you read Ferris, that there was an appropriation for the dam.",
  "So do the tribes have the right to stop providing the services --",
  "-- that they've contracted to?",
  "How do they know that until they know what they're getting?",
  "Meaning they don't know what they're getting.",
  "They signed a contract that says you're going to pay them for their services to their members and for their administrative costs. They incur that cost, and then at the end of the year, the government now says to them you've honored your part, but we're not going to honor ours.",
  "What does the system do to the 50-odd contracts that Arctic Slope, in its amici brief, points to that are similar to these? Does this now mean that moving forward, that every government contractor who has a \"subject to appropriations\" language takes the risk that at some point in the middle of the contract, the government's going to dishonor its obligation and pay it less than it said it would?",
  "So how do -- how do we differentiate those 50 other contracts?",
  "So why don't we let Congress fix it? There are so many ways that Congress could fix this problem directly. By doing a line item allocation, it could take away the obligation to enter into these contracts and fully fund. It could be much more direct --",
  "-- than it's being, given the interpretation that you're advancing.",
  "It was trying -- it was trying to tell the tribes, we're honoring our obligation by paying you the costs, but we're really not going to do it because we're going to let the government give you less?",
  "I have to assume Congress intends what it says. It intends to obligate you to enter into contracts that -- that give -- make you commit to paying their costs, correct?",
  "But that's true of every contract. That's where I'm getting stuck on what your theory is. The Antideficiency Act says you can't spend more than you're given.",
  "So every single contractor, under your logic, should know that when they sign a contract, the government can break it because if it doesn't have enough funds, it can't pay.",
  "But -- so there's no real logic to your argument, other than to say we can't -- we're -- if the contract says \"subject to appropriations,\" let's do away with Ferris, let's do away with Cherokee Nation, and --",
  "-- it just means that we pay you what we can.",
  "But what you're saying is you make two promises on the ISDA. We're going to pay you your support costs, your administrative costs, in full, and we're going to retain the right to break that promise. That's really what you're saying the ISDA says.",
  "So you ignore all the language where it says we're going to pay you X amount, all the law that says you have to be reimbursed -- the tribes have to be reimbursed for all their costs. All of that is going to be ignored.",
  "Could you give me that cite again?",
  "Mr. Phillips, this is an unusual situation with the tribes, because in the normal not to exceed appropriation by Congress, the government rightly says we have the power to not contract. And in military contracts and others, we have a for convenience cancellation. We have all sorts of things that protect us from the deficiency. But this is a unique situation because the government, on the one hand, despite their protestations to the contrary, are forced to accept these contracts.",
  "And on the other hand, Congress is saying, don't pay more on them. We're telling you to accept more payment than we're going to give you.",
  "Should we create a special rule for this -- why shouldn't we create a special rule for this unique situation?",
  "Mr. Phillips, how does Congress do this without upsetting the entire scheme? Knowing that these contracts are not all signed on one day, that there are 12 regions, that the negotiations go over time, how could Congress achieve the scheme that the government wants now? How would it write this contract?",
  "I'm sorry. You keep saying that, but I thought in your earlier answer, you said that the contracts are generally signed by the time of the appropriation.",
  "Where is that in the cycle of performance? Is that at the beginning of performance?",
  "So the tribes -- even when the appropriation comes out, they don't know how much the Department has contracted with other tribes.",
  "So they're performing until they get that notice later on.",
  "Do you dispute Mr. Phillips' statement that the tribes don't know how much they're getting until some point further into the performance cycle?",
  "The system that's in place does not --",
  "It makes no sense to me what you are saying because, under all circumstances, the credit bid, unless the property is valued higher than the credit bid amount, but then another bidder could do -- could make -- could enter that bid.",
  "The maximum value always has to be the value of the credit.",
  "If the -- if the -- if the creditor is willing to put it at risk that way.",
  "But that's just not true from what you just said, meaning what you just said is that the buyer, obviously, is paying other things off, and by definition, he's deducting that from the purchase price. No one gives a purchase price for a piece of property and agrees to pay something else and gives the highest price for the property once they've done that. So what you're asking for is permission for the debtor to use this property to pay other debts, and that's what I thought a secured interest prevented.",
  "So why doesn't he get --",
  "Why doesn't he get everything that the buyer is promising to everyone else? For that, indubitably, is part of the price because he is giving out money to others. That's part of the value of this property. So why isn't the creditor -- the secured creditor, entitled to all of the proceeds from the property?",
  "No -- with -- with sales price, but not from all the payments.",
  "You still haven't answered my --",
  "You still haven't answered my question. If the buyer had money that he's willing to give up to others, why isn't he putting it in the purchase price? Why isn't that part of the price?",
  "Could -- could you explain what the reasoning is for requiring a credit bid, if property is sold during the plan, but not permitting it when it's sold at plan time?",
  "Doesn't that delay the bankruptcy in every situation? I can't actually understand what benefit, other than delay of the bankruptcy process, that would occasion.",
  "Uh-hmm.",
  "They don't have that right now? They don't have that right now?",
  "The vast majority of bankruptcy courts have permitted credit bidding in these situations. So if the vast majority of bankruptcies have stalking horses, then the norm is working, without us having to rule in your favor.",
  "And stalking horses still come in. So it's not as if the 363(k) procedure is failing in maximizing prices.",
  "Could you tell me what the -- what's the purpose -- if you permit credit bidding, why do you go through the sale at all, if it's always -- if the credit is always going to be higher than the value? Why don't you just turn over the property under (iii)? What -- why do you -- why do you go through the sham of a sale?",
  "So it is the stalking horse dance? At what point do they credit bid until they get the highest price from someone else and then let that other person have it, is that it?",
  "When do you think, under 363(k), what's good -- what would constitute or has constituted in the case law good cause not to permit credit bidding? What situations have arisen under 363(k), where a court has found good cause?",
  "I'm sorry. What --",
  "How does a creditor commit malfeasance?",
  "Counsel, I'm a person who believes that, in the business world, the greatest security is just knowledge of what courts will do. And what the two courts who have agreed with you have done is contrary to what the majority of courts have done for -- for the longest time. What's the value for us upsetting the norm?",
  "What's the business value for upsetting the norm?",
  "That means, because people didn't think they could do it in plan sales. So why should we upset the expectation?",
  "They could have gone under (i) and -- and given the secured lender what he's entitled to, which is a future stream of payment.",
  "Could you tell me who you think would have a valid and timely APA action to challenge what the Secretary has allegedly done here, which is to take lands into trust in violation of the statute per our earlier -- I know that the U.S. is challenging that assumption, but let's assume the -- the reality of the allegation. Who would -- who would be able to challenge it, and in what mechanism?",
  "That, I understand. That's why I said timely filed.",
  "Let's assume a situation where you first promise the land to one tribe, and then, in the midst of negotiations, another tribe lays claim. The United States says, I change my mind; I'm going to give the land to the other tribe. Does the tribe that you have denied the land to have any standing or any rights with respect to challenging that determination?",
  "I'm a little confused. The government - -",
  "Counsel - -",
  "Counsel, you're assuming that the statute was passed against a backdrop of complete sovereign immunity, but if you look at Larson and Malone, it appears as if prior to the enactment of the QTA, people could bring suits to say that an officer had acted beyond his or her statutory authority. So what the Quiet Title Act did was encapsulate some of that law. From where do we draw the conclusion that the intent was to eliminate every other claim that could be brought under something like the APA, or an officer suit?",
  "Would you have been entitled to file in that 30-day period? How is your claim, the one that you ultimately made, any different than what you would have done if you had filed within the 30 days?",
  "Same claim; right?",
  "All right. Tell me what relief you're seeking that's different than -- are you -- what relief are you seeking? Aren't you seeking to shed the United States of its title?",
  "Just the -- what's the -- don't tell me what your cause of action is. What relief at the end of the day do you want?",
  "Counsel, is there any limit to who can bring an APA action under your theory? It seems to me that what you're saying is that anyone other than a landowner because of the Quiet Title Act can within 6 years attempt to unravel any decision the government has made to take land, because we're not limited now to trust lands. We're limited -- under your theory, whenever the government takes any kind of land, anyone's entitled to come in and challenge that action under the APA for 6 years, and to seek an injunction because it isn't a quiet title action. It's merely a challenge to the decision to take land. Is there any limit to your theory as to who can bring that kind of action and - -",
  "In which way? You're saying anyone who's affected, your niece, your farm owner's niece who comes to visit twice a year or visits the land and walks through it, could presumably say: I'm negatively affected by the government's taking of this land, Indian or not, within the 6 years, and the government improperly took the land. Undo it.",
  "No, but my question -- counsel, my question was different. Under your theory, you could bring this suit after the land has been taken. NEPA assumes before the land was taken. I'm talking about under your theory of law, once land has been taken by the U.S., if anyone has a viable legal claim that the land was taken improperly, whether it's Indian trust land or anyone else's land for any other purpose, that person within 6 years can still bring a suit under the APA.",
  "Government land is always taken by administrative action.",
  "Forget about the trust.",
  "Because under your theory of what -- what the APA permits you to do, anytime the government takes land, whether into trust or for any other purpose, the APA permits someone within 6 years, with whatever definition of prudential standing you want to give it, to come in after the taking and challenge that it was ultra vires, that it was done improperly. That's your theory. So going back to Justice Breyer's question, why isn't that within the quiet title action prohibition - -",
  "-- once it's in the government's hands?",
  "Was that the -- I thought part of it was agricultural land, and that another part was a business. I mean, I think -- I thought -- well, the government can correct me.",
  "Right.",
  "Is that because you don't have a theory as to why once the government takes it, it's not a quiet title action?",
  "So answer my question, or the one that Justice Breyer has said. Then it doesn't -- and the one Justice Kagan repeated yet again -- okay? What difference does it make that the government has taken title? Whether the government has title or doesn't, under your theory, since this is not a quiet action -- title action, anyone who is unhappy with the way the government took title could challenge it within 6 years. Isn't that the bottom line of your theory?",
  "Absent laches. You say the only defense is laches.",
  "But the bottom line is, under your theory, as long as no landowner, the person most directly affected by the taking, as long -- that person can't sue, but anybody who is an indirect person can sue within 6 years, anybody who says, I don't want the land, I just don't want the U.S. to have the land.",
  "But they can't undo the transfer. They can only get money.",
  "Mr. Clement - -",
  "-- could I interrupt? And turning to 2(B), could you tell me what the state's view is -- the Government proposes that it should be read on its face one way, and I think the state is arguing that there's a narrower way to read it. But am I to understand that, under the state's position in this action, the only time that the inquiry about the status of an individual rises is after they've had probable cause to arrest that individual for some other crime?",
  "Can I -- can I - -",
  "-- just stop -- stop you there just one moment? That's what I thought. So, presumably, I think your argument is that, under any circumstance, a police officer would have the discretion to make that call. Seems to me that the issue is not about whether you make the call or not, although the government is arguing that it might be, but on how long you detain the individual, meaning -- as I understand it, when individuals are arrested and held for other crimes, often, there's an immigration check that most states do without this law. And to the extent that the government wants to remove that individual, they put in a warrant of detainer. This process is different. How is it different?",
  "No, I understand that's their argument. I can question them about that.",
  "But I want to get to how -- assuming your position, that doing it on a systematic -- there's nothing wrong with doing it as it's been done in the past. Whenever anyone is detained, a call could be made. What I see as critical is the issue of how long and under -- and when is the officer going to exercise discretion to release the person?",
  "What happens if -- this is the following call -- the call to the -- to the Federal government. Yes, he's an illegal alien. No, we don't want to detain him. What does the law say -- the Arizona law say, with respect to releasing that individual?",
  "I'm putting all of this outside of -- of -- the - -",
  "I want to make sure that I have a clear representation from you. If, at a call to the Federal agency, the agency says, we don't want to detain this alien, that alien will be released for - - unless it's under 6, is what you're telling me. Or under 6, 3, or some -- one other of Arizona's immigration crimes.",
  "All right. Then tell me - -",
  "Counsel, could -- does Section 6 permit an officer to arrest an individual who has overstayed a visitor's visa by a day? They are removable, correct?",
  "What is the definition of public offense?",
  "Counsel - -",
  "Well, for those of us for whom legislative history has some importance, there seems to be quite a bit of legislative history that the -- that the idea of punishing employees was raised, discussed, and explicitly rejected.",
  "The preemption language would be geared to what was decided to be punished. It seems odd to think that the Federal government is deciding on employment sanctions and has unconsciously decided not to punish employees.",
  "Can I ask you something?",
  "General, could you answer Justice Scalia's earlier question to your adversary? He asked whether it would be the Government's position that Arizona doesn't have the power to exclude or remove -- to exclude from its borders a person who's here illegally.",
  "General, I am having - -",
  "I'm sorry. I'm a little confused -- general, I'm terribly confused by your answer. Okay? And -- and I don't know that you're focusing in on what I believe my colleagues are trying to get to. Making the -- 2(B) has two components, as I see it. Every person that's suspected of being an alien who's arrested for another crime -- that's what Mr. Clement says the statute means -- the officer has to pick up the phone and call -- and call the agency to find out if it's an illegal alien or not. He tells me that, unless there's another reason to arrest the person -- and that's 3 and 6, or any of the other provisions -- but putting those aside, we're going to stay just in 2(B), if the government says, we don't want to detain the person, they have to be released for being simply an illegal alien, what's wrong with that?",
  "Taking out the other provisions, taking out any independent state-created basis of liability for being an -- an illegal alien?",
  "Do you have the statistics as to how many arrests there are and how many -- and what the -- percentage of calls before the statute?",
  "Can I get to a different question? I think even I or someone else cut you off when you said there were three reasons why -- 2(B). Putting aside your argument that this - - that a systematic cooperation is wrong -- you can see it's not selling very well. Why don't you try to come up with something else? Because I, frankly -- as the Chief has said to you, it's not that it's forcing you to change your enforcement priorities. You don't have to take the person into custody. So what's left of your argument?",
  "I -- please move more - -",
  "General, when -- when - - I know your brief, you had -- you said that there are some illegal aliens who have a right to remain here. And I'm just realizing that I don't really know what happens when the Arizona police call the Federal agency. They give the Federal agency a name, correct?",
  "Oh, you don't really have knowledge of what - -",
  "All right. And what does the computer have? What information does your system have?",
  "Well, how does that database tell you that someone is illegal, as opposed to a citizen?",
  "Today, if you use the names Sonia Sotomayor, they would probably figure out I was a citizen.",
  "But let's assume it's John Doe, who lives in Grand Rapids.",
  "So they are legal. Is there a citizen database?",
  "I'm sorry. There is or there isn't?",
  "So the guy who is -- so if you run out of your house without your driver's license or identification and you walk into a park that's closed and you're arrested, you -- they make the call to this agency. You could sit there forever while they - -",
  "-- figure out if you're - -",
  "But you're inviting - - you're inviting the very sort of conflict that he's talking about because what's going to happen, now, is that, if there is no statement by the Federal agency of legality, the person is arrested, and, now, we're going to have Federal resources spent on trying to figure out whether they have an asylum application, whether they have this, whether they have that, whether they are exempted under this reason, whether the failure to carry was accidental or not -- I mean, you are involving the Federal government in your prosecution.",
  "Now, you may say we're not because all we're going to show is -- what? That we got a Federal call -- we got a Federal answer that the person wasn't registered?",
  "No -- no Confrontation -- no Confrontation Clause problem with that? With relying on a call to a Federal agency and the police officer says, you're arrested, you're charged, it's not an illegal alien -- or it is an illegal alien.",
  "No, no, no. How about -- what -- how about they get a response, yes, it's an illegal alien?",
  "So how -- where do they get the records that show that this person is an illegal alien that's not authorized to be here?",
  "Who do they get it from?",
  "Counsel, there is the amicus brief from the European Commission.",
  "And it provides for a very simple rule. Please explain to me what's wrong with it. It basically says you have to borrow both the substantive and procedural international law norms; that those norms do permit these foreign-cubed cases only so long as either, it appears to me, the defendant is a citizen of the country, the acts occurred within that country, or the alien has exhausted both domestic and international avenues for relief, a sort of forum by necessity, which apparently most countries have, including the ones who have submitted amici arguing - -",
  "-- different points, like England and The Netherlands.",
  "It seems to me like a fairly simple set of rules clearly defined and limiting the application of this statute in a way that sort of makes sense.",
  "What's wrong with the rule?",
  "So answer me why is this not the case where on the facts there has been a failure to exhaust.",
  "Do you think it matters that the harboring is after the fact or not? Meaning if the -- if the mercenary fled France and was hiding from the French here, why is there any less chance of a war?",
  "I don't understand. The apples and apples don't -- seem to not match in my mind.",
  "Pirates could have been sued in State court, too, and yet the ATS -- I know that you quarrel about whether an act of piracy qualifies as an international norm, but assuming that I accept it is, pirates could have been -- under your theory, pirates could have been sued in State court, too, yet Congress found it important to pass the ATS.",
  "But you're asking us to overturn our precedents.",
  "You're -- you're basically saying Filartiga and Marcos, Sosa, they were all wrong.",
  "Counsel, how can you say that? Maybe the facts didn't, but certainly the reasoning of the case addressed that issue very directly and -- and basically said it does. And then it talked about how you limit it. That's what Sosa did.",
  "Is that the same -- is that your simple rule? Is that how you want us to rule - -",
  "-- that there could never be aiding and abetting on behalf of a corporation? Is that your simple answer to this case, or what's the general - -",
  "You are disavowing - - you are disavowing any forum of necessity view of the ATS? You are disavowing what other countries do or say with respect to citizens -- to aliens who are attacked?",
  "I asked you a question directly. Are you foregoing -- are you foregoing any forum necessity exception to the rule you've just announced?",
  "Are you talking about a nexus test? That's what it sounds like to me. Has to have either an actor nexus or a act nexus, effect nexus? What are you talking?",
  "Either it exists or it doesn't.",
  "Is -- that -- I'm having trouble with this. We -- without question, piracy, attacks on ambassadors, we know that those were international norms in 1789. If one of those acts happened, you seem to be suggesting that, answering Justice Kagan's hypothetical, that if a Frenchman attacks an English ambassador in Switzerland, that case would never be heard in the United States because there is no nexus to the United States; is that correct?",
  "Well, assuming someone came. So how is that different from here?",
  "So why isn't presence alone in the United States a connection?",
  "Counselor, can I -- can I -- I have been lost even as I have read the briefs, because there's a lot of terminology that I'm not sure -- and standards that have been proposed that -- what concepts they're tied to, okay? As I see our cases, I'm -- I'm not quite sure where indefinitely moored came from. I've seen the word permanently moored. You seem to be suggesting a difference between the two things, and I'm not sure where you get the latter, indefinitely moored, from, and how that ties to the concept of purpose. Does it -- does the permanent status or indefinite mooring of a vessel not make it -- of a structure not make it a vessel, and/or does purpose get layered on top of mooring?",
  "But it applies to whether something is permanently moored or floating on the sea?",
  "Counsel, outside of your floating home, what other structures would be kept out of your definition of purpose or function and the city's definition of practically capable? Can you imagine any other function that's out there floating around?",
  "Because they disavow water skis and garage doors and say they're practical, capable tests with - -",
  "Well, I know. But - -",
  "So I was right. So that permanent mooring is a different inquiry in your mind?",
  "Well, that's a -- that's a somewhat easy case, because the hull, I think, was removed or something was removed that made it - -",
  "No. How about a garage door?",
  "Under your definition, how do you deal with Evansville?",
  "What you are basically saying, we reached the wrong conclusion because the wharf boat floated, and it regularly was moved, and there was nothing to suggest that it couldn't carry people or things. It happened not to because they would empty it, I understand, before they moved it, but it could have. So if it was practically capable of floating, whether it was semi-tied to land or not, it was released from land on somewhat of a regular basis. So are you suggesting that in Stewart we change the Evansville rule?",
  "I guess the problem is the list of absurdities that they point to, not the least of which is a dry dock, which you talk about whether it's permanently moored or not, but most dry docks are held in place by, you know, heavy ropes but you can cut them and you can stick something on them and they can float away. Under -- so how do you - -",
  "For the - -",
  "So what do you do with the - -",
  "-- trampoline and the other examples your adversary gave? Is a trampoline that floats on water capable of moving -- it's moving the trampoline.",
  "It's carrying the Trampoline.",
  "So is the difference whether I attach something permanently or temporarily to the top of the floating thing, the floating board, the floating whatever?",
  "This is not very compelling in this case because they have regulations that pretty much echo what the Solicitor General is saying, so it's not as if they were going to take a different position. The Solicitor General is basically saying follow the Coast Guard regulations.",
  "Counselor, can I back you up a minute to join the two questions that my colleague posed to you? Let's assume there's a merits-based decision on the CSRA and one on the discrimination. In the normal course, assuming you are not barred by being untimely, you could go to the district court, and the district court presumably would have jurisdiction, if one is a discrimination-based decision, to decide both questions. What's the standard of review that a court would apply to each of those claims independently or together? I mean --",
  "-- that that's --",
  "We can then fight about whether the factual issue regarding the timeliness and exhaustion should be subject to one or the other standard of review, but what are the standards of review?",
  "All right.",
  "You argued that you were exceeding the dismissals on the basis of jurisdiction should go to the Federal circuit, but that you were only invoking the exception that procedural dismissals should be permitted to go to the district court or authorized to go. Are you still standing by that distinction?",
  "Yes, but when you argued it below you argued the exception, you didn't argue the jurisdictional rule. Are you abandoning that distinction?",
  "But it's not the view of the circuit courts, even the courts --",
  "Even the courts whose exception you --",
  "Every circuit court unanimously holds that jurisdictional dismissals should go only to the Federal circuit.",
  "And you --",
  "Should you be arguing this before us?",
  "Is this a distinction you should abandon here?",
  "Or at least ask us not to address?",
  "Actually the 7512 argument has more legs, I think. The point is that you're only permitted to go to district court on issues of discrimination that are within the Board's jurisdiction. So if --",
  "Are you abandoning the jurisdictional procedural distinction as you did in your brief? Are you telling us to rule either completely for you or against you?",
  "So you are prepared on behalf of the Government to say that if we rule that procedural dismissals can go to the district court, then you -- then the Government will concede that jurisdictional dismissal should as well?",
  "Under 7512.",
  "We don't have to reach that question in this case, but your brief seemed to make the argument that there was no basis for the distinction between procedural and jurisdictional.",
  "Can I ask you a couple questions?",
  "When the Federal Circuit was created, this language preexisted its creation, correct?",
  "So could you tell me how when Congress was writing 7702 it was creating the system that you are advocating when it had no idea that it would ever create the Federal Circuit?",
  "That still doesn't answer my question, which is: Assuming there is no Federal Circuit, I have to read the language that exists in 7702 and 7703, and I see judicial review, appealable judicial review, used not in the manner that you're describing.",
  "You don't have a quarrel with your opposing counsel's position that once the Board decides the CSRA claim and the discrimination claim, the district court reviews both?",
  "Justice Alito was questioning that, but you don't quarrel with that.",
  "So the lack of uniformity is inherent in this structure. You just want to carve out one piece of it that --",
  "-- that you say deserves more uniformity.",
  "I have a problem, because to accept your reading is to say that judicially reviewable action differs between 7702 and the escape hatch, because the only way the escape hatch can work, it, too, cross-references 7702 in the same way that the provisions you are relying on do. Under your reading both should be given identical meaning, because they both cross-reference 7702; and yet your brief says, no, we shouldn't have that absurd result.",
  "It seems to me that if you concede that there is an absurd result in applying your interpretation to the escape hatch, by definition, your meaning can't be ascribable to that phrase.",
  "So if the board --",
  "So when does the time frames of the escape hatch commence --",
  "-- if the board hasn't rendered any decision on anything?",
  "You still have an exhaustion argument to raise if we were to send this to the district court?",
  "Under your view, is there any situation today where the Tucker Act would be applied to a statute? Because if we start with the statute, which always seems to be where you're pointing us to, and we're only looking for a clear waiver of sovereign immunity, then there’ll never be another Tucker Act action in the future.",
  "What would they look like to be able to get around our clear statement rule?",
  "So basically -- I'm not sure why we're even addressing the issue of Tucker Act jurisdiction. We should have really just been briefing the issue of whether the statute at issue here waives sovereign immunity --",
  "-- because that becomes, to you, the operative question.",
  "Could I ask you --",
  "I’m sorry, I was going to ask -- following up on my question - -",
  "-- many courts have held that the FLSA has an express waiver of sovereign immunity. And many of them have recognized, if not all, a Tucker Act remedy. Under your new approach, that holding is incorrect, I presume --",
  "-- because the FLSA has its own remedial scheme?",
  "But then the Federal circuit has no jurisdiction over those claims, according to you, because the waiver is in the FLSA, it has its own judicial remedy. They’re not authorized, then, to go to --",
  "It has the same language as here, in -- you can bring your suit in any Federal or state court of competent jurisdiction.",
  "I don't know -- I don't see the difference between --",
  "That's exactly what I started with. That's what I started with: Is there anything left to the Tucker Act?",
  "So the new rule is if a statute is written to impose obligations only on the Government, then the Tucker Act is implicated immediately. If the rule says the Government and any party who contracts with it -- a Medicaid provider -- must do X, Y, and Z, and the Government and the Medicaid provider have the burdens of accomplishing Y, unless there is an express waiver of sovereign immunity, the Tucker Act doesn't come into play.",
  "That's your position.",
  "Well, you are not going to suggest that if the scheme I just described says X, Y, and Z, have to do all these things, and someone to whom they owe that obligation can sue the Medicaid provider, for example, for breach of that obligation, presumably -- I'm putting in a lot of hypotheticals given our case law -- but you're saying they can't sue the Government under the Tucker Act --",
  "-- unless there is an express waiver.",
  "Counsel, this sort of begs the question --",
  "-- the statute awards damages for breach of the obligation, so it's money-mandating. The issue is not whether it's money-mandating; the question is who’s it mandating.",
  "But there is not an issue of whether it contemplates the payment of damages. It expressly awards --",
  "I -- it is -- there is some difficulty with your argument, which is, going back to my simplified hypothetical, Government and Medicaid -- X providers have to do X, Y, and Z; if those persons, being defined as Government and providers, doesn't do what they have to do, they have to pay these damages.",
  "I mean, that's pretty clear.",
  "So are you happy with the circuit's suggestion that the specific does govern the general insofar as it will adopt whatever FCRA's limitations are?",
  "And into its own processes?",
  "Your position is that's perfectly okay.",
  "One of the purposes of the Tucker Act was to provide a remedy, where none existed, to get rid of the private bills. What's wrong with the Government's basic proposition which is where you have a remedy you have to pursue that remedy. And I think that, at bottom, that's their argument. What's wrong with that scheme? Instead of permitting two remedies with potentially conflicting commands, whether it's on the amount of damages or the nature of the recovery or the statute of limitations, why isn't their vision of what the Tucker Act -- the role the Tucker Act should play one that should be given voice? One that should be followed?",
  "The FSLA as well.",
  "The FSLA as well.",
  "What happens when there is a challenge to the admission of evidence on a state law ground on -- on a Confrontation Clause ground, and all the state court does is grapple with the evidentiary rule, but it's self evident that the Confrontation Clause is based on a different theory? Are we to assume, in the light of that kind of decision, that the court actually grappled with the Confrontation Clause?",
  "Am I to make that assumption when, before our line of cases in this area, state courts generally had held that if hearsay was admissible under their evidentiary rules, that that was the end of their Confrontation Clause challenge? Is a Federal court supposed to continue with that presumption in light of an undisputed state's statement that their rules are consonant with the Confrontation Clause.",
  "Well, let's assume it's not after our -- we render our decision.",
  "If one --",
  "Irrebuttably?",
  "I see exceptions to that already. There are cases where the state court reaches one prong of the Strickland standard, has no need to go to the second.",
  "So you really can't say in that situation that you can assume they reached the second, can you?",
  "All of the circuit courts basically have a rule close to the one announced by Justice Alito, don't they?",
  "All of them have essentially a presumption that's rebutted by some form of evidence, except for perhaps the Eleventh and this circuit that have a clear, almost irrebuttable presumption. I'm sorry. Not the Ninth, but the Eleventh.",
  "But it's not as absolute as the Eleventh.",
  "I have a -- you know, I mean, for every rule you're going to find an exception that abuses it. It's the nature of human nature. Do you know what the total number of habeas petitions there are and what the percentage that are actually granted?",
  "Would you be willing to accept that it's -- in relationship to the total granted, it's very, very small?",
  "So whatever the abuse of the system is, it hasn't halted justice.",
  "That the person is not guilty is a bias?",
  "That -- that's -- that may be your strongest point, but most of what he said was basically this is a murder case, and the evidence has to be beyond a reasonable doubt, and I think it has to be clear enough for me to be convinced. Is that a biased juror?",
  "I must say that, like Justice Kennedy, I'm deeply troubled when trial judges intrude in the deliberative processes of juries. Most of the time when we're assessing bias, we're assessing it on the grounds of extraneous evidence, a juror who has said one thing in voir dire and is now either a convicted felon or introduced extraneous circumstance. But the degree of being convinced is the very essence of jury deliberations. This case is troublesome.",
  "I'm not sure how you can say that. I mean, I think the simplest statement of the State rule is that the State believes that if you remove a juror for actual bias, that that is okay under the Sixth Amendment. They said it in Cleveland. They were presented with the argument in this case by the briefing that the juror was not biased and hence the Sixth Amendment was violated. And they ruled to say he was biased, and I see as a natural, clear inference that they were saying the Sixth Amendment wasn't violated because he was biased.",
  "That's a different question. That question is whether the California Supreme Court's Cleveland decision, its assumption that a biased juror violates -- doesn't violate -- the removal of a biased juror doesn't violate the Sixth Amendment, is that an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent, not circuit court precedent?",
  "What Supreme Court precedent commands that result?",
  "Is this -- is this a holding that the Sixth Amendment requires you to keep a biased juror as long as the juror says, I have doubts about the sufficiency of the evidence?",
  "Now, answer my question. Does the Sixth Amendment require you to keep a biased juror?",
  "All right. So, if the Sixth Amendment doesn't require you to keep a biased juror, then why is it that the state court's finding that this juror was biased a Sixth Amendment holding, that it wasn't violated because the juror was biased? The logic is almost inescapable to me.",
  "Did the California court find the juror was biased?",
  "Counsel, all of our cases in this temporary versus permanent, as I read the cases and I read what the multiple facts that each are relying on, it seems to me that our cases have been attempting, in the term \"temporary,\" to encompass a lot of different concepts. Both intentionality, because an accidental issue is not a taking; causation: Did this -- and that's part of Sanguinetti's holding -- did what the Government do actually and directly cause the injury at issue? And foreseeability: Is what you intended something whose consequences you could have seen? And they are using that in a multifaceted test, one that the Solicitor General is not trying to endorse here, but one that I think is more consistent with our general jurisprudence in this area. So there is never a simple answer on the question of permanent damage, because you can have permanent damage that's not a taking, if all of the other factors I've just mentioned are not in your favor. Is that correct?",
  "I guess the problem with this case, and it's part of what's interwoven in your adversary's arguments, is that with flooding it's going to occur naturally anyway. The Government generally builds dams to control that flooding to the benefit of all of the interests along its affected route. And at some point, either the Government is going to -- is going to make a decision that's going to help someone and potentially hurt someone. And the question is, isn't all of those situations going to be subject to litigation. The Government's rule -- I call it the Government's rule, but it's -- is basically simple. It can't. Because, if the deviation is temporary -- and that's what the circuit below said -- it's just exercise. It's either a nuisance or temporary trespass, and we're not going to hold the Government responsible for that loss. Assuming it's going to occur in part because flooding is always going to occur, the question is perhaps when. But in any place you have a dam, it's there because flooding was happening. Isn't that the basic argument? And I don't know that you've actually announced the rule that addresses the essence of the policy considerations that are driving the Government decision. So tell me how your rule makes this a manageable situation.",
  "But that's every flood.",
  "But that's every flood.",
  "I'm totally confused now. Is Dickinson decided wrong under your theory?",
  "They built a dam. It raised the water level and flooded the petitioner's land, and the court gave recompense.",
  "But you just said two minutes ago -- or I thought I heard you say -- that when the Government builds a dam, even if it floods some people and not others, that there's no taking.",
  "After it's - -",
  "So the baseline -- tell me what the baseline is. And perhaps you can answer Justice Kennedy's question more directly. Anything in the reservoir is a taking. Anything downstream is never a taking.",
  "I must be -- I must be slow today because I'm -- I'm having significant problem with your articulation of your test. Basically, you're saying once a dam is built -- once a dam is built, no downstream owner has a claim? Or, you're building an exception from when the claim can be applied to a downstream owner?",
  "It doesn't matter whether it's permanent, reoccurring - -",
  "-- foreseeable or anything else?",
  "But what difference does that make? It's nice that you try to reach consensus. If number 2 is not going to be part of the consensus because he's the one always affected - -",
  "-- you're saying permanency -- permanency, repetition, nothing counts, he's just -- loses.",
  "Is the baseline -- go back to Justice Kennedy's question -- is it before the dam or after the dam, and why is it one or the other? If flooding was going to occur more unpredictably before the dam, and possibly summer flooding of this kind could have happened, do you lose?",
  "Even though after the dam and the dam's plan was to ensure that it didn't happen, you would still lose? If natural conditions - -",
  "-- would have possibly caused this, you would lose?",
  "Pre-dam. In the recorded history.",
  "I'm not sure that's not open to dispute. There is some argument here that rainfall that was naturally occurring contributed to what was happening to the trees.",
  "I think that there is - - at least that's what I understood some of the factual argument to be.",
  "Tell me how you define indefinite stays, meaning are you okay with the six months to a year stay, for a court to try to get someone back to competence, assuming that there is a claim in which the defendant's information is necessary?",
  "So how do you deal with Justice Kagan's earlier question of what difference does it make if the person's still necessary -- or the information -- potential information is still necessary, what makes it unnecessary after a year?",
  "But those cases didn't establish a limit on how long states needed to take to adjudicate claims. They just said a district court should put in conditions that move things along - -",
  "-- that -- that require defendants to press their claims within a reasonable time that required periodic updates, that required monitoring by the court, but it didn't set an artificial end time. It just said you can't just do an open-ended stay and not give conditions to comply with. Why should this be treated differently?",
  "But you cap it by saying as long as the discretion is not exercised for more than a year?",
  "Would that standard have been met in both of these cases? Meaning, Carter's claim -- and the one that concerns me the most is why he was excluded from trial and what if he did or did not do with his attorneys afterwards. And Gonzales is a slightly different case. But would your position be that, in both cases, there was enough?",
  "No, no, no. My question was, on the facts of both of these cases, was there a basis for granting the stay with respect to - -",
  "-- their conditions?",
  "Neither Carter or Gonzales?",
  "Well, that is that you're -- that seems like almost a due process argument, that in every single case, you have to grant a stay. You're -- you're parting from the Respondent in Carter, and you are making a broader argument.",
  "No incompetent client, presumably, can help you make those decisions. So tell me, are you saying that, in every single case, the client is entitled to a stay?",
  "So why does that situation give you an entitlement, if it's not in every single case?",
  "What in the record could plausibly, certainly be seen, that would suggest that your defendant has information that could be valuable? Assume it's not the ABA standard, but the plausibility standard or the certainty standard or something.",
  "Well, that, you can see from the record.",
  "What would plausibly give rise to a belief that there was some ex parte exchange between the judge and the defendant? Is there anything to suggest that in the record?",
  "Do you have anything to suggest that there had been an ex parte exchange that would account for that snarling?",
  "Counsel, in this case, the district court denied a stay. If this is an equitable power, how can you be comfortable that the Ninth Circuit, as an appellate court, overrode the district court's equitable discretion?",
  "But you're not claiming that that issue is always in the district court's hands to start with?",
  "So please identify for me what -- how we establish or set a standard so that appellate courts are not overriding that at whim?",
  "Oh, you're flipping it. You're saying, first, you give a stay for competence. You've determined competency first and not essentiality first?",
  "The million dollar question: Assume we say you have to spend a reasonable time trying to get someone to competency. And, here, there appears to have been efforts to do so. And your client is saying, I can't be treated because the drugs make me sick. So when does all of this end?",
  "Well, that time has passed by now, hasn't it? That that -- they stopped treating him?",
  "No one's continuing to monitor him or trying to treat him?",
  "I'm a little confused as to -- I think the Ninth Circuit remanded, so that treatment could be had. So why has it stopped?",
  "Am I -- am I understanding that your position, in response to the question from Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy, is that, for you, indefinite is any stay whatsoever? It sounds like what you are proposing -- or in response to them, is that no stay for purposes of determining competence, whether it's short or long, is permissible. Is that your argument?",
  "I could take objection to that characterization because the clerk of the court told the court that neither party was happy with what was happening, and the court still entered the order. But let me go back to my question a moment. Amici say that most competency issues are resolved within months and that many individuals -- the vast majority, are restored to competency with proper medication within months. Are you opposing those kinds of stays?",
  "But under your definition, it's never appropriate, really.",
  "You argue -- you argue two things. You say, under Pinholster, they -- courts always have to rely on the record.",
  "Even though a doctor says, it can be done, we have to try?",
  "Well, they can never say, it can be done. They can say - -",
  "-- we have to try.",
  "That -- that's also - - I'm not sure how they can do that until they try.",
  "Petitioner says they won't because they can come back with new evidence after habeas is closed. Why is that inadequate?",
  "I'm presume -- I presume that the one claim among your many -- yours is the defendant who was excluded from trial, correct?",
  "So that if he comes back and says, I told my attorneys I would behave, and I wanted to come back earlier, and they never let me back in, this would not be a new claim, this would be part of the old claim that has been adjudicated, correct?",
  "But without his information?",
  "Well, that, you could see from the record. The question in my mind would be whether he told counsel he would behave, and counsel ignored that information, correct?",
  "Could you tell me what the value is to wait for the Ford analysis or the Ford examination to the time of execution?",
  "Putting that aside.",
  "\"At all costs\" is what you seem to be saying.",
  "Well, your adversary has not said it's total speculation. He suggests that, if we set a standard that requires -- we can talk about what the terms are, suggestive in the record, plausible in the record, typical sort of situation -- but assuming that there is some basis to believe that the defendant can provide information of importance to the claim, why should that be -- that door be shut?",
  "And how do you deal with his answer that, if the claim is not a new claim, but just new information about an old claim, that he will be barred from a successive petition?",
  "How do you get past Texas v. Lesage with that injury - -",
  "-- which says that mere use of race is not cognizable injury sufficient for standing.",
  "Can I go to another side? She's graduated.",
  "She disclaimed the desire, after her application, to go to the school at all. She was permitted to apply for the summer program and get in automatically, and she didn't, correct?",
  "But she's graduated.",
  "Injunctive relief, she's not going to get. So what measure of damages will she get or will she be entitled to?",
  "But you have to claim an injury. So what's the injury - -",
  "-- that you're claiming that would sustain a claim of damages?",
  "You still haven't answered how Lesage gets away from that - -",
  "-- but if there's a - - give me another - -",
  "-- damages question.",
  "What damages - -",
  "The one social studies that this University did said that minority students, overwhelmingly, even with the numbers they have now, are feeling isolated. So what do -- why isn't that even under your test? We can go back to whether substantial evidence is adequate, is necessary, or not. Why does their test fail?",
  "So could you tell me what a critical mass was? I'm looking at the number of blacks in the University of Texas system. Pre-Grutter, when the state was indisputably still segregating, it was 4 percent. Today, under the post-Grutter system, it's 6 percent. The 2 percent increase is enough for you, even though the state population is at 12 percent? Somehow, they've reached a critical mass with just the 2 percent increase?",
  "No -- putting aside -- I don't -- I'm not going to quarrel with you that, if demographics alone were being used, I would be somewhat concerned. But you can't seriously suggest that demographics aren't a factor to be looked at in combination with how isolated or not isolated your student body is actually reporting itself to feel?",
  "It might be insulting - - it might be insulting to some to be thrown into a pot.",
  "So what are you telling us is the standard of critical mass? At what point does a district court or a university know that it doesn't have to do any more to equalize the desegregation that has happened in that particular state over decades, that it's now going to be stuck at a fixed number and it has to change its rules. What's that fixed number?",
  "Well, they told -- they told the district court. They took a study of students. They analyzed the composition of their classes, and they determined in their educational judgment that greater diversity, just as we said in Grutter, is a goal of their educational program and one that includes diversifying classes. So what more proof do you require?",
  "Well, but given it was in the evidence, what more do you think they needed? I think I hear all you saying in your brief is the number's fixed now, they got enough, no more is necessary.",
  "That's enough now.",
  "That's what you're saying?",
  "Tell me -- all right. Tell me what about their use of race did not fit the narrow tailoring -- not the necessity prong as you've defined it, but the narrow tailoring that Grutter required? How is race used by them in a way that violated the terms of Grutter?",
  "Assuming that the need is there. I know you're challenging the need.",
  "So you have to set a quota for critical mass?",
  "So we won't call it a quota, we'll call it a goal, something Grutter said you shouldn't have.",
  "Boy, it sounds awfully like a quota to me, that Grutter said you should not be doing, that you shouldn't be setting goals, that you shouldn't be setting quotas. You should be setting an individualized assessment of the applicants. Tell me how this system doesn't do that.",
  "So now, we're going to tell the universities how to run and how to weigh qualifications, too?",
  "Could you tell me, again, how race and their use of race overwhelms those other factors in their system as it's created?",
  "Counsel, you are the one who, in your brief, has assumed that they are valuing different races differently. But Asian numbers have gone up, under however they have structured this PAI. And as I understand their position, race is balanced against other issues like socioeconomics, the strength of the classes people took. It's never a standalone. So even a white student, I presume, who goes to an -- an entirely black or an entirely Latino school, who becomes class president, would get some points because he has or she has proven that they foster or can deal in a diverse environment. That's how I understood their plan, that it's not just giving you a plus because of race. It's combining that with other factors.",
  "I -- I put that in the narrow tailoring category, that it is narrowly tailored the way Grutter did -- said, not the necessity prong and not the need prong -- not the necessity prong. I think most of his argument has been centered on that, so - -",
  "Mr. Garre, I think that the issue that my colleagues are asking is, at what point and when do we stop deferring to the University's judgment that race is still necessary? That's the bottom line of this case. And you're saying, and I think rightly because of our cases, that you can't set a quota, because that's what our cases say you can't do. So if we're not going to set a quota, what do you think is the standard we apply to make a judgment?",
  "General, I think, as I take your answer, is that the supposition of Justice Alito's question is truly impossible under this system. There are not two identical candidates because there are not identical mechanical factors that - - except the 10 percent plan. Under the PIA, the factors are so varied, so contextually set, that no two applicants ever could be identical in the sense that they hypothesize.",
  "Because no two people can be the same - -",
  "Is your complaint limited to injunctive relief and the return of the $100? As written, is that what it's limited to?",
  "In Arizonans and Alvarez we said any all -- any and other -- all damages is too speculative. Is what you actually see what I said: Injunctive relief and the return of the $100.",
  "In - -",
  "In Arizonans and Alvarez we said you can't manufacture standing after the fact. Did you ask only for injunctive relief and the $100, specifically?",
  "And you would have paid that no matter what; under any system of admission you would have paid the same $100.",
  "For what, nominal damages?",
  "And then how do you get around Arizonans?",
  "She was going to get a better job because she went to a different university?",
  "You are not suggesting that if every minority student that got into a university got into only the physical education program; and in this particular university that -- that physical education program includes all the star athletes; so every star athlete in the school happens to be black or Hispanic or Asian or something else, but they have now reached the critical mass of 10, 15, 20 percent -- that the university in that situation couldn't use race?",
  "In the holistic way that Grutter permits?",
  "No, it's just that every one of their students who happens to be a minority is going to end up in that program. You don't think the university could consider that it needs a different diversity in its other departments?",
  "Aren't they saying the same thing when they say, when we are looking at the holistic measure, we are looking for that student who is a -- that minority student who is a nuclear scientist?",
  "So you don't want to overrule Grutter, you just want to gut it.",
  "You just want to gut it. You don't want to overrule it, but you just want to gut it.",
  "Now you want to tell universities that once you reach a certain number, then you can't use race anymore.",
  "Excuse me. You use that word, \"regularly.\" Do you have statistics on that? Were they provided in the briefs?",
  "You -- we are discussing the categorical approach, but let's assume he had pled guilty. And in his allocution, he had admitted to not a smaller amount or to remuneration. Would -- would an immigration judge, under the argument you're making today, have to ignore that allocution? Or would he be able to apply the modified approach and find this gentleman an aggravated felon?",
  "That's the issue with this case. None of these immigrants are being let out automatically. They are still felons subject to removal. The only issue is whether - -",
  "Well -- they're - -",
  "-- they're still subject to removal - -",
  "-- either way.",
  "Mr. Goldstein, there are at least 93 cases, all right? So - -",
  "And I don't know and I'm not going to ask you to prove to me how the burden of proof was met or not met in those. But let me give you a different hypothetical.",
  "Let's assume Georgia has the Federal statute, but in -- differently than the Federal statute, it has a sale-distribution provision, and it has a small amount, no remuneration statute.",
  "What would happen in those States?",
  "What's the free pass? The free pass is mandatory as opposed to discretionary deportation, correct? So the free pass is that - -",
  "But those convicted individuals would still be subject to deportation.",
  "And nothing would stop the INS judge from considering the amount of drugs, correct, that the individual actually was involved in, and that could be introduced through hearsay -- through almost any document, correct?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, do you -- do you suggest that the immigration judges don't know that and that they wouldn't weigh that desire heavily in a case in which a -- the convicted individual is proven to have sold the larger amount? You still think they are going to cancel?",
  "Each time you get -- you say that, you get back into the hole that Justice Kagan has been asking you to climb out of. If -- if Congress' intent was to bar discretion, then I'm not quite sure how you get to your alternative to get out of your - -",
  "-- overinclusiveness argument.",
  "I'm sorry, counselor. I -- the government can do it very easily. If you have less than an ounce of marijuana and nothing else from which you can infer an intent to sell or distribute, and you have no proof that this individual's engaged in drug trafficking, what more does a defendant have to show?",
  "How does it raise his burden of proof?",
  "I -- I guess my point is that one, which is don't the facts that the government have either show it or not show it in virtually every instance?",
  "It would be less than an ounce.",
  "Can I go back to your substantive argument?",
  "All right. This is a - - you are right. It's an unusually crafted statute. And really, what the issue is, generally, what you have with lesser included offenses is you have a base offense and then an enhancement that goes up. You commit the base offense - -",
  "-- of burglary, but if you did it with an explosive or you did it with a dangerous weapon, it goes up.",
  "And applying the categorical approach is relatively easy there because either the State offense includes the addition or it doesn't. This is sort of in reverse. You've got a statute with the same elements that can be either a misdemeanor or a felony. And you're saying it can be either under the CSA, but we have to assume it's the greater because - -",
  "-- of Apprendi, because of -- of - -",
  "But that's under Apprendi.",
  "That's the point.",
  "Didn't we -- didn't we talk about the categorical approach in footnote 3 of our case in Carachuri?",
  "Where we said that, in talking about the generic Federal offense, whether it's a felony or not, that we can't look at just strictly the elements of the crime, but we have to also look at the sentencing factors because, when we're talking about what constitutes a misdemeanor or a felony under Federal law, we have to look at both.",
  "But the same elements would go to the misdemeanor. Really, the issue for me is it could be one or both. And when do we tell the immigration judge that he can, should, or should not - -",
  "-- choose between the two?",
  "However you do it, the misdemeanor still has the same three elements.",
  "So how do we choose between it being a misdemeanor or a felony?",
  "Counsel - -",
  "Counsel, under the - - under the -- do you have the same answer as Mr. Goldstein, that the modified categorical approach wouldn't permit the immigration judge to look at the plea allocution to determine the amount?",
  "So that in -- in many of these cases that we're talking about, it is possible that the plea allocution itself would set out the amounts that the alien sold or show that he sold something - -",
  "-- and that would take care of this issue of how many people are escaping automatic removal?",
  "But the vast majority - - the vast majority, in my experience, do -- do say whether the crime was for sale or distribution.",
  "General, is there anybody who has standing? As I read your brief, standing would only arise at the moment the government decided to use the information against someone in a pending case. To me, that - -",
  "-- would seem to say that the Act -- if there were a violation; I'm not suggesting there is -- but that if there was a constitutional violation in the interception, that no one could ever stop it until they were charged with a crime, essentially.",
  "General, I don't know that you've answered my question. Perhaps you have, but I just want to make sure that I'm clear. Given that lawyers are unlikely to be the targets of an investigation, if they -- if their conversations would be intercepted, according to you they'd never have standing.",
  "Now we're back at the same circle we started with, which is the one that Justice Breyer started with. He pointed to one person under -- who has been surveilled continuously, tens of thousands of interceptions. Can you really say that the government's not going to target him under this greater authority that it sought just for the purpose of ensuring that it casts a broader net?",
  "Counsel, I have an issue - -",
  "Could you address - -",
  "Can you go back to being a little bit more specific on this? I think I got it. There is a class of people that they would have spoken to on the phone or e-mailed before because they didn't think they would be covered by other surveillance measures - -",
  "-- that were in effect before this Act?",
  "Can you talk about what kinds of people those are? Because if the targets are always terrorists - -",
  "To that point, you're conceding the government's position that -- on redressability?",
  "That even if they promise you they weren't going to intercept you under this statute, that you would still take the same measures?",
  "Mr. Rosenkranz, can I ask you, just -- it is a practical question, but I think it has a theoretical impact. A manufacturer can choose to contract or a copyright holder choose to contract with someone here to manufacture their goods. They could contract with someone abroad, anywhere in the world, directly. They can choose to license their trademark and permit a distributor abroad to manufacture under their U.S. copyright; or they can permit the licensee to register the copyright abroad and distribute. In your definition of \"lawfully made under this title,\" does \"lawfully made under this title\" apply to all of those situations, i.e. - -",
  "-- I think clearly to the manufacturer who manufactures abroad - -",
  "-- clearly to the manufacturer who licensed a distributor to do it for it. But does it also apply to the -- to the copyright owner who basically gives the copyright to a foreign distributor and lets the foreign distributor -- register it abroad?",
  "That is -- that is broader than I thought. Then I'm not quite sure why you don't mean if this title applied. Because if the - -",
  "-- the manufacturer who is manufacturing under the English copyright, because the distributor has an English copyright, is not manufacturing under the U.S. copyright, they are manufacturing under the English copyright.",
  "I'm sorry. Is your reading now that when the library imports in a book or a film or whatever it's importing in, it goes to the customs agent and it says to the customs agent: I don't have the express authorization of the copyright owner, but I'm a library, so I can import this book in?",
  "I'm -- I'm a person who's bought the book in England and I'm bringing it to my wife? What provision gives me the right to do that?",
  "So deal with the wife.",
  "How does the wife get her book?",
  "No, no. Is there - - what provision gives the wife a right under your reading?",
  "No, to keep for yourself. As far as I understand - -",
  "-- your reading, I brought it abroad, I can't import it in.",
  "Don't those horribles - -",
  "Why is it that a U.S. copyright owner who contracts in England to make books -- he doesn't have an English copyright, he just simply chooses that place to manufacture as opposed to the U.S. -- why is he making that copy under English law and not under his rights of U.S. copyright?",
  "But he's selling it no -- no differently than Quality King was -- or the Quality King - -",
  "Mr. Olson, we know from the Karp exchange that the response was, this is something that we have to study with care, in 1976. The parade of horribles is now causing the Solicitor General and at least one, if not two, courts of appeals to write exceptions into the language to take care of what they perceive as horribles. Isn't it incumbent upon us to give the statute what is plainly a more rational plain meaning than to try to give it a meaning and then fix it because we understand that the meaning doesn't make sense?",
  "Could you point to something in the legislative history to support that?",
  "So you get what you wanted anyway? That's really the bottom line. We undo Quality King, except that the price is that people have to ship their manufacturing abroad.",
  "So doesn't that mean that what's in your home that's not visible to the public has an expectation of privacy as well?",
  "But that -- that is circular. Then why do you need a search warrant? If you have no expectation of privacy in the contraband, why bother even with a search warrant?",
  "Why is that an implied consent? That's a huge assumption. At least in the cities that I've lived in, you have to have a dog on a leash. And you don't give implied consent. If you're allergic to animals, you don't want dogs walking around at your door.",
  "No, no, no. But tell me why that you presume that there's implied consent?",
  "Do you think homeowners freely let dogs just come into their apartment? I mean, there might be some homes that do.",
  "So we're going to treat it like a human being now? You're invited to knock on my door because you're a dog?",
  "So now we tell - -",
  "-- all the drug dealers, put up a sign that says \"No dogs.\"",
  "Isn't it fair just to assume that -- what's logical? I -- I let people knock on my door because they have to say something to me. I don't let a dog come up to my door -- I don't willy-nilly invite it to come up to my door.",
  "That implied consent, does that include them coming up and -- up to your porch and sweeping stuff into a garbage pan?",
  "Mr. Garre, there's no dispute that dogs can smell what human beings can't; is that correct? It's not that we can find a machine to put it on a human being to enhance their sense of smells; dogs can do something human beings can't.",
  "So you have to treat him like a guy, to think that he is not like technology in terms of augmenting what a human being can do.",
  "He's not augmenting what a human being can do. He's substituting what a human being can do.",
  "Could we go back to the concession that was asked of you, what you conceded in the Florida court or didn't? Have you conceded that the police officer sans dog, if he had come up to the door and knocked, that that would have been permissible, that that was not a search or seizure?",
  "Did he have -- did he have a right under the facts of this case? He had been told that in this house they were growing marijuana by a confidential informant. Assume that's all that he had. Would he have had a right to walk up to the door, knock on it, and start asking questions?",
  "Let's -- sans dog, yes.",
  "All right. So you are conceding that he had license to walk onto -- or walk to the door and ask questions.",
  "I guess the bottom line is that are you taking -- it sounds to me like you're saying there's no implied consent to bring a dog on to my property.",
  "You're -- Mr. Garre said differently, that there is an implied consent for your neighbor to bring the dog up for anyone else but a police officer. Is that what you're saying? There's an implied consent for anyone else or there is no implied consent, period?",
  "You're on a really slippery slope with that answer. There's dual motives in everything police officers do.",
  "They knock to hope the person comes to the door and that they can see something from the door. They knock -- they always have a dual motive. So you're suggesting what?",
  "In terms of our rule - -",
  "He knocks, and he says to the neighbor, who are you? I've gotten a report, and I'm smelling drugs, so I know you have drugs in there.",
  "But if he smells first and asks the question second, that's not okay?",
  "I thought what the dog does, according to the police officer's testimony, is he gave him a long leash so the dog would lead him to the drugs. And what the dog did, I thought, according to what I read, was go past the motorcycle to make sure -- I mean, the officer said this -- you don't know if the drugs are in the motorcycle, you don't know if they're in the garage, you don't know where they might be. So the dog is permitted to roam around until he catches the scent. Is that accurate?",
  "But the point is that he's sniffing all the way around to see - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Garre - -",
  "I thought all of these training facilities were private entities that contracted with police departments.",
  "Could I go back to Justice Ginsburg's question? There's no -- what I hear -- read the Florida court saying is there's no national standard for certification. That's correct?",
  "There's no national standard that defines what's adequate training, correct.",
  "So -- let me just finish my question. So assuming there's no national standards, then how do you expect a judge, without asking questions about the content of the certification process, the content of the training process, and what the results were and how they were measured, how do you expect a judge to decide whether the certification and the training are sufficiently adequate.",
  "But you still have to ask what that training was, and the judge still has to determine whether the judge believes it was adequate, correct? That's what the totality of circumstances requires.",
  "So what does a judge do, just say, the police department says this is adequate, so I have to accept it's adequate?",
  "Mr. Garre, I -- I have no problem that this record -- with this record. My problem is how do we rule. Because it seems the me that I'm not quite understanding what -- how -- the legal rule you're asking us to announce. I think the legal rule, you're saying, if the dog has been tested for proficiency by a police department's determination of what's adequate for proficiency, that establishes probable cause. That's what I think the rule you want us to -- to do. I don't know what the role of the judge is in that - -",
  "-- with that rule.",
  "No certification, no questioning of the handler and the handler's training? The judge can't do any of that and shouldn't do any of that.",
  "So it's not enough for you to win by us saying that a court can't insist on performance in the field records, that it has to look at the totality of the circumstances. What other case have -- have we announced, under a totality of the circumstance test, an absolute flat rule like the one you're proposing? Where else have we said that one thing alone establishes probable cause - -",
  "-- that one factor alone.",
  "Counsel, I'm somewhat troubled by all of the studies that have been presented to the Court, particularly the Australian one where, under a controlled setting, one dog alerted correctly only 12 percent of the time. How and when and who determines when a dog's reliability in alerting has reached a critical failure number? And what is -- what do you suggest that number is, and how does a judge determine that that's being monitored?",
  "Well, I'm deeply troubled by a dog that alerts only 12 percent of the time. Whatever -- whether we have a fixed number or an unfixed number, that seems like less than probability for me.",
  "That doesn't answer what happens to the dogs who have -- dogs grow old. They are taken out of service for a reason. So how -- how is a court supposed to monitor whether or not a dog has fallen out of - -",
  "Counsel, I have two separate questions for you. Tying the earlier case a little bit to this one, I am assuming that your position is -- and you'll tell me what the legal standard is - - that a well-trained dog, if he alerts, or walks by a row of apartments, a row of houses, and alerts to drugs, that that simple alert is probable cause for the police to get a search warrant.",
  "So that, without any other information about -- unlike the earlier case or this one, where the police officer saw the individual being nervous, et cetera, et cetera -- that all -- all it takes is a dog alert, despite the fact that there is no study that says the dogs reliably alert 100 percent of the time?",
  "No, I -- I understand.",
  "So -- so shouldn't we be addressing the question whether a -- an alert, especially outside a home in particular, should be, standing by itself, enough?",
  "Well, only because the officer said that he satisfactorily performed - -",
  "-- and what the Florida court said: But we don't know what that means.",
  "I understood the Florida Supreme Court, counselor, to say that the deficit in the training records here was because there was no evidence of false positives, that the reports didn't say, the training reports didn't say, if the dog was alerting falsely. Assume that the record, as your adversary claimed, shows the opposite, that a satisfactory completion means that the dog detected drugs where they were. What -- why wouldn't the training records here be adequate in that circumstance?",
  "I -- I guess what I'm asking you is, as a matter of law you want us to hold that training records are inadequate unless what? Unless -- you're going to specify now a list of things they have to include?",
  "Counsel, how is that any different than a police officer who comes to a car and smells marijuana? He's never going to know whether there is any more in the car or not. It could have been smoked up an hour before. I don't know how long marijuana lingers for, but -- I'm not sure why residual odor affects the reliability of the dog, which was Justice Scalia's point. It's no different than an officer who smells something. He doesn't actually know whether it's physically still present or not, but we're talking about probabilities.",
  "Counsel, the two tests, yours seem to be the immediate vicinity test, and the Second Circuit is as soon as practical test. Your adversaries point out that the Second Circuit test actually focuses on the police officer's conduct, which should be the focus of reasonableness or unreasonableness. Your test just creates an artificial line that is subject to as much play as the other. Why isn't the focus on police conduct the right focus?",
  "Counsel, can I come back to the facts that my colleagues have raised and break it down implicating the Terry question? Here, the officers had a report of something in the house, and they saw the defendant -- two people leaving. I know Terry hasn't been decided, but why do you think -- just the stop, not the detention, not the bringing them back to the house, why do you think that just stopping them was wrong?",
  "Under Terry.",
  "But the court below did.",
  "Well, it goes back to if a police officer saw an individual leaving the house and was concerned about them tipping someone off, et cetera, what would be the problem with the officer stopping the person around the corner, holding them, making sure people got in and then letting them go.",
  "I thought your better answer was the risk of somebody coming back to a house exists whether the person just left it or left it an hour after or before or 2 hours or 24.",
  "When the police walk in, they always have to guard against reentry.",
  "Mr. Wall, would you answer -- direct your first response to that last issue because, as I read your brief, you seem not to be accepting the Second Circuit's rule at all. You seem to be proposing what appears to me to be a much broader rule that says -- at one point in your brief you state that it is the occupant's observed connection to a home subject to a valid warrant, not his physical location at the time that he is detained, that makes him subject to detention. Now, I know police when they're executing warrants often have an advance team that has been surveilling a home, sometimes for days. And they've got one officer sitting there, and they see who they think is the occupant leave, and the team doesn't arrive till 12 hours later. Is it your position that in that circumstance the officers are authorized to go to wherever the defend -- wherever the occupant is, the office, the -- wherever he might be, his mother's home, and effect an arrest there?",
  "You're missing the point, which is that's going to happen regardless, meaning that risk exists whether the person left the minute you got there or a minute before or an hour before or two hours before. That's the whole point, which is the risk is extant no matter what.",
  "But you didn't know - - you don't know that in any search, meaning any time you do a search you have no idea when the -- whether the occupant -- sometimes you know whether the occupant is inside. You'll hear the TV or something else. But often you don't, and you don't know if someone will come back and when.",
  "So why is seeing someone leaving increasing that risk?",
  "Can you tell me what constitutional right entitles you to stop someone from, using the word, \"fleeing\"? You certainly are entitled to stop someone with whom you have reasonable suspicion. But what constitutional right entitles you to stop a person who's just leaving in the normal act, without reasonable suspicion?",
  "Counsel - -",
  "Counsel, the problem with absolute rules like we did in Summers is that they're an exception, and they're absolute. Go back to the question you were asked by one of my colleagues earlier, why wouldn't Terry give you all of the rights that you're seeking on the absolute rule, but subject your police conduct to the question of reasonableness, which is the normal standard of the Fourth Amendment?",
  "I'm -- I'm litigating for you.",
  "So I could very easily imagine that what the fight's going to be like below is, we stopped them because we saw them coming out of the house, and all we want to do is make sure that they don't return. So we're just going to hold them in place. We don't have to drag them in a car back to a place they just left. We're just going to stop them in place to get a phone call that everything's all clear.",
  "Well, we don't know, but why don't we let that develop.",
  "Counsel, my -- I remain with my question, which is, we have a circumstance-driven power, Terry. Your power is really going much more broadly, because you're basically saying if that -- if probable cause exists to search a premise, it exists without being tied to an individual because anybody who leaves the house, whether or not they have been tied to a crime in that house in the past or not, is now subject to being detained. So we have evidence that only a husband is involved in a fraud, and his wife is leaving for work. Because she was observed leaving the house, she can now be stopped a mile away.",
  "So your -- your view is that Summers gave you -- entitled you to hold people merely for purposes of investigation - -",
  "-- without any reasonable suspicion? That's really what your rule is saying.",
  "Mr. Fisher, I'm concerned that creating exceptions to exceptions in Teague is just a throwback to Linkletter standard --",
  "-- where we're making choices among situations and saying, these will be retroactive, these won't.",
  "Answer that concern on my part.",
  "And then answer -- the next step is the Martinez type case --",
  "-- which is what happens with state reviews that are -- that channel IAC claims to their habeas processes. So what trumps what in that situation?",
  "Do you think that's true with respect to both components of the advice, the omission and commission? I mean, it does appear that every court who dealt with the commission-type claim, the fraud, the misrepresentation of consequences, said it's clear you can't lie to your client. Now, is Teague now going -- is our ruling here going to depend on the type of claim that's raised, with respect to IAC?",
  "At least one of our concurrences did, or talked to. So assuming -- assuming -- is your position that is on the retroactivity, that it applies to both kinds, omissions and commissions, and neither is retroactive?",
  "I'm not sure. Are those sources -- when you say sources, it's professional norm sources?",
  "Could you tell me where -- my colleagues were asking about hypothetical future cases -- I'm asking, do you think that every evolving professional norm, no matter how well established it becomes, would never be subject to the Teague rule because -- would always be a retroactive application or a new rule?",
  "Are we frozen in time to whatever the professional standards are that exist today that the Court has recognized so far?",
  "So unanimous error makes right? I'm not being -- I'm not trying to be sarcastic. I'm trying to see -- in almost every case we get here, there are split opinions below. Sometimes the split is significant or closer than other times. The -- where do we draw that line? Where in the next case is any time there is a split below or where there's an unanimity of opinion below, it won't fall under -- it will automatically create a new rule?",
  "We -- we're seeming to go backwards. You -- you seem to be arguing against something that you didn't want previously, that there should be a stay and determine these IAC claims on direct appeal. It seems to be your argument that that's the preferred process now.",
  "Mr. Fisher, can I go back to one of your points? Your red light is on, but it is important. The floodgate issue.",
  "I'm not sure about the floodgates for the following reason. Once we announce Padilla, any pending direct claim and any pending collateral claim that arises after Padilla for something that happened after Padilla would be covered by the rule, so there'd be no bar to those claims. So the floodgate is temporary, if there is --",
  "So is the falsity of the statement common as well?",
  "Can -- can an individual who has -- it has been deemed in -- in a cert certification, that an issue is immaterial, could an individual claimant ever prove it's material?",
  "On the truth-on-the-market -- the truth-in-the-market defense, which is the type of defense that you're raising here.",
  "I'm sorry -- say that you -- a plaintiff can always relitigate the question of materiality. But at the class certification stage, isn't it correct that, if the Court holds that a statement is immaterial, it's immaterial for all members of the class, and the suit has to be dismissed? Isn't that right?",
  "How could that be --",
  "Why don't you answer the question that was asked earlier, if Basic set forth a presumption, and are you disputing that, at the class certification stage, a defendant can prove that the market is inefficient?",
  "So why shouldn't we hold Basic to its position that all of its presumptions can be rebutted as well, not just efficiency? Why do we set out efficiency as the one issue that can be rebutted?",
  "Could we --",
  "Could we get a hypothetical that I actually think could occur, which is not a truth-on-the-market defense, but a known truth to the individual person seeking certification. So that is it's immaterial to that person because they were told this information by someone and still trading. Would that defense be available at certification?",
  "But as Justice Scalia pointed out earlier, so is efficiency or nonefficiency.",
  "So that -- that differentiation, articulating it that way, doesn't move the ball.",
  "Mr. Estrada, could you pronounce for me or give me the legal rule as you want us to articulate it? Let me get you out of Daubert, okay? Because I think you really can't deny that you never raised the word \"Daubert\" below until the very end. Your fight before the district court was on the probity of the model, not on a Daubert issue, correct?",
  "Did you use the word \"Daubert\" before the district court?",
  "Okay. So you didn't use \"Daubert\" below --",
  "-- so let's get out of the Daubert language, okay? Tell me how and what rule we announce, so that district courts find an expert's evidence probative, the other side argues it's not, and when does the district court let the jury decide between the two?",
  "Where is the line that the district court draws between class certification and merits adjudication, so that, at some point, it goes to the jury?",
  "Excuse me. Do you think -- that -- that's why I am trying to get away from the magic words. Why do you disagree with the simple proposition that a district court, by whatever magic words it uses, has to come to the conclusion that the expert's testimony is persuasive? And isn't that, at bottom line, a judgment that it's reliable and probative?",
  "So you are not disagreeing with your adversary on a legal standard. Every judge on a -- this is the simple way I formulate the rule -- every judge before he certifies -- he or she certifies a class, has to decide whether the methods being used are probative and relevant, sufficient to prove common -- common questions of damages.",
  "Counsel, tell me -- you articulate for me what you think -- what the district court found when it accepted your expert's theory as adequate.",
  "What do you think that means, legally?",
  "And so what does \"sufficiently persuasive\" mean?",
  "It sounds nice, but more likely than not --",
  "Counsel, the bottom line is can a district court ever say that it's persuaded by unreliable or not probative evidence. That's really the bottom line question.",
  "Does it commit legal error when it finds something that's unreliable and unpersuasive -- or unprobative?",
  "I -- I think that's a fair reading of what he said --",
  "-- but if we're answering a legal question.",
  "The problem everyone's having is -- I think -- that why do you need Daubert to point out that something is not probative or unreliable? Why -- whether it's an expert or a lay witness testifying, wouldn't you apply that same standard to anybody's testimony?",
  "Do we give credence to how the judge labels what the acquittal is?",
  "But you don't - -",
  "How would they do that? I'd like to go back to Justice Kennedy's question. It's easy when you have a jury because what happens is a judge can decide whether, at the end of the prosecution's case, he's going to dismiss for insufficiency, or he can give it to the jury, and if the jury renders a verdict, set it aside. Jeopardy attaches only if the judge dismisses the case after the prosecution's judgment, but not if he sets aside the verdict, correct?",
  "In the latter.",
  "So what can a state do -- some have done something -- to ensure that, even if jeopardy has attached, that there can be a valid reversal; if the judge is wrong on a legal theory.",
  "So give us an example of what, in a judge trial, a state could do to ensure that a legally wrong judgment is still reversible.",
  "In a bench trial. What could it do?",
  "I thought there were, in your briefs, some examples -- in someone's brief, there were some examples - -",
  "No, forget about a jury trial. Let's go to the bench trial.",
  "You're not helping your argument by saying there's nothing a state could ever do.",
  "Do you know something, Counselor? You're sinking your hole deeper. You're not helping yourself in this argument because how does that help the system?",
  "I don't disagree. You mean no state could ever say to a judge, given - - given -- render a verdict on the prosecution's theory, and then set it aside? If you think the theory is not legally - -",
  "You keep saying, \"mid-trial.\"",
  "What -- what is not mid-trial? Some states require a judge to wait.",
  "Well, what happens in those states?",
  "I keep talking, not about jury verdicts, but about bench trials. I want to focus on the bench trial process.",
  "I'm sorry. I'm a little confused. It was charged with the crime of burning down a dwelling, correct?",
  "Of?",
  "And no specific statute was cited?",
  "Which one?",
  "The dwelling statute, not the -- not the exception to the dwelling.",
  "That's what he was charged with?",
  "So why did the court dismiss, if he was charged with burning down a house? I thought he was charged with burning down a dwelling, and the argument was he should have been - -",
  "-- charged with burning down a house.",
  "My only quibble is you have no doubt -- the defense attorney had no doubt that he burnt down a house -- that someone burnt down a house, correct?",
  "Got it.",
  "It's a sentencing enhancement, is really what the argument is -- the decision was.",
  "That every -- you can be charged with burning down a dwelling and you can only get the enhancement if they prove it's a house.",
  "Exactly.",
  "But many states have a different rule.",
  "And many states permit the judge to reserve it till after the jury verdict.",
  "Counsel, you gave us earlier the statistics of how many judges grant Rule 29 motions in trial. I think you said 76 percent. What's the gross number, relative to the number of actual verdict decisions by juries or the judge himself?",
  "Out of what number?",
  "Isn't that like an amnesty? Isn't that how you described it in your brief?",
  "What's the difference between the two, in your mind, that makes it an element of the crime or a negation of some element of the crime?",
  "So you're a member, you are liable for all the foreseeable acts of your co-conspirators, whether or not you knew they were going to happen, so long as they were foreseeable?",
  "And you can be liable for as long as you stay, until you prove you withdrew?",
  "And that extinguishes your liability for the continuing conspiracy?",
  "Why?",
  "The why is, once you've joined, you're trying to extinguish liability. Why would the government have to prove that you're entitled to amnesty or not entitled to amnesty?",
  "I actually thought your stronger argument in your brief was in trying to explain why it negated an element. I think what you said in your brief -- and you haven't made it here yet, as clearly -- was that, if he wasn't willingly participating during the statute of limitations, then he hadn't committed the actual crime.",
  "Counsel, in a normal case, where it's a robbery or burglary, whatever, you charge the crime happened in X date, and the defendant raises an affirmative defense that it's not within the statute of limitations. Who bears the burden of proving it does, in that situation?",
  "All right. So, if you bear the burden in the normal statute of limitations case, the issue, I think, in my mind, becomes do you continue to bear that burden in a conspiracy crime?",
  "Because -- and you still have to prove -- you're saying that the elements of the statute of limitation there are that there was an agreement to commit a crime, this person joined it at any time during the conspiracy, and the conspiracy continues.",
  "You don't have to prove that the defendant was part of that conspiracy or joined that conspiracy during the statute of limitations; that's your point.",
  "I think his intuitive argument is, I can't be responsible for a crime I wasn't a part of during the limitations period. That really is the essence of his argument. And if it's your job to prove that he committed the -- a robbery during the limitations period, that it's your job to prove that he committed the conspiracy during -- that he was part - - that the conspiracy -- that he was part of the conspiracy during the limitations period - -",
  "I think that -- that's the simplicity of his argument.",
  "So simplify your response to me.",
  "That's not a simple response.",
  "You are already way too fast.",
  "Didn't -- don't district courts always have the authority to award costs for sanctionable behavior like bad faith? So this provision is duplicate, no matter how we read it. It's either duplicative of a power the court already had to award costs for bad faith, or it's duplicate of Rule 54.",
  "It limits Rule 54.",
  "I think your -- your answer is always that Rule 54 obligates courts to give costs. And this rule, as you read it, is a permissive grant only. Even in bad faith litigations, the court could choose not to give costs.",
  "True.",
  "I would assume that, if Rule 54, instead of saying what it currently does, said something like, \"except as expressly repealed in another statute,\" would what happened here meet that express requirement of repeal? It was Justice Scalia's question to you, but reformulated in a different way.",
  "Expressly repealed 54(d).",
  "Am I to understand your simple position to be that what Rule 54(d) does -- says is if another provision deals with costs, you're relegated to that other provision?",
  "Unless, and this -- you're inverting the express -- unless that provision refers you back to 54?",
  "And with that, is that there are some statutes that don't?",
  "So it's not always peanut butter and jelly.",
  "It's peanut butter and honey sometimes.",
  "Counsel, it was thinking about prevailing parties because the predecessor sentence --",
  "But it was talking -- no, prevailing parties. The provision is geared towards prevailing parties in some form. The first sentence says, \"a prevailing plaintiff,\" not whether it's on a substantial basis or any exception.",
  "It says you get fees or you can get fees and costs.",
  "So it then decides to limit what a prevailing defendant can do. Isn't that the natural reading?",
  "You don't think that there's a serious argument that the first sentence does away with the discretionary nature?",
  "So it's a command. 54(d) is permissive, according to your earlier argument?",
  "And so this does -- it's not superfluous because it went to mandatory?",
  "Well, does that mean that, if they gave you a covenant that said, vis-à-vis your company, our trademark, the form of this shoe, is invalid, we won't sue you for anything, either an exact duplicate or any colorable imitation thereof with respect to this design; would that be enough for you?",
  "I know you want to help everybody else -­",
  "-- but why wouldn't that be --",
  "So --",
  "-- what you're saying is you --",
  "But I don't know why -- my solution was that they would give you a covenant that I suggested as a possibility that would say, vis-à-vis you, you can imitate, counterfeit, use this design, only vis-à-vis you. Why doesn't that protect you fully? Because what they're saying to you is, copy the design if you want, so long as you're not using another trademark. But that's not the issue. The issue is whether you're infringing this design.",
  "Ms. Anders, what -- there is a question about why a competitor should have to produce to its competition its future plans of development. I mean, the marketplace, especially in fashion, importantly, likes to keep quiet what it's doing because what -- it doesn't want other imitators to beat it to the punch. So given that interest, why isn't their claim that they're being inhibited because of the requirement to produce their products -- or their intended products -- enough to establish injury in this case?",
  "Well, then what did --",
  "I read this affidavit as saying, we're in the shoe industry, we're going to make new shoes regularly, we want to copy their shoe, we don't think it's protected by trademark, we want to copy it -- they don't say -- and that's something on rebuttal that maybe Petitioner will explain -- that we want to copy it exactly. But what they're saying is, we want to copy it because it's a free form. That's really what I read their affidavit as saying. So if -- why do they have to actually -- do they have to produce their design to prove they're doing that?",
  "But saying it is enough? That's what I thought their affidavit said, and I thought the court below said, no, you've got to show us the product.",
  "Please, now go back to my question. Is it enough to just say it? Or do they have to produce the designs, so that the Court and Nike can decide -- it is Nike, right? -- the Court and Nike can decide whether the shoe is a colorable imitation or an exact copy.",
  "I agree with you.",
  "How do you deal with the point that's been discussed with your adversary, they have to show you everything they intend to produce? What entitles you to that showing?",
  "What if they simply said --",
  "-- you have the trademark, we think it's invalid, we want to copy your shoe? We want to copy just the form of your shoe because that's what the trademark involves.",
  "And once we have the invalidity, that's what we're going to do.",
  "Would that be enough of a showing? We don't have plans right now because your trademark stopped us from having the plans, but the minute your trademark is -- isn't validated, for sure, we're going to do it because it's going to mean great sales if we put our name on it, rather than your name.",
  "The colorful imitations -- colorable --",
  "The colorable imitations are colorable imitations of their shoe?",
  "You haven't promised to not sue them over colorable imitations of your shoe?",
  "I'm making this as simple as I can.",
  "I'm a shoe manufacturer. I want to make new designs, and I want to be free to make the designs that I want.",
  "If this mark isn't validated --",
  "-- I intend to copy as much of it as I can.",
  "I don't have any records of doing the planning because the trademark was there.",
  "But, for sure, given my current shoe --",
  "-- and the fact that they thought I imitated them --",
  "-- meaning, you --",
  "-- you invalidate the mark, I'm going to copy as much of it as I can.",
  "Would that be enough?",
  "In your mind, you're saying --",
  "You could do discovery then?",
  "And the discovery is going to show what?",
  "The president comes in and says exactly what I said. There are no plans --",
  "Yes. You don't have to read to us.",
  "I thought what they were arguing --",
  "You are saying that you've met -- if we decide you bear the burden of proof, you're saying, you -- you could live with that.",
  "And your burden was met by their submissions?",
  "His challenge, you said you had the chance in three different courts to say directly and unequivocally, if the mark is invalid, we're going to imitate, and you haven't been willing to do that. You --",
  "What's your commercial interest?",
  "So are you willing to make the statement he's asked you for? You keep equivocating on the answer. I -- you know, it's like I don't want to say it, is what you're telling us.",
  "You don't think that the grant of powers in this case would permit the hospital authorities, the corporation, to set prices for their services that are below the competitive prices in order to serve the needy?",
  "Isn't that inherent in the regulations?",
  "Tying.",
  "A network is tying products, to tie products.",
  "I -- I guess that just adds on to the issues that we have a price-fixing mechanism, we have a tying mechanism that is expressed, so what's left after that? Just this? Mergers and acquisitions?",
  "At -- at what point --",
  "Could you define \"necessity,\" as you use it? I am harkening back to Justice Kagan. We have plenty of cases that say you don't need to find out whether the exemption is necessary to make the program work.",
  "We don't make that judgment.",
  "The State makes that judgment. Exactly.",
  "And, in your answer, you conceded that whether -- if -- if there is discretion, it's not necessary to make it work because the -- the authority can say yes or no -- it's not --",
  "So what's your definition of \"necessity\"?",
  "Could you --",
  "There's -- there is a problem here, which is, I understand the public mandate to serve the indigent, but you are asking us to take this a step further. You're elevating that public mandate to a public command, that serving the indigent has to override the needs of the majority, in terms of price competition.",
  "And -- and that -- that step -- that further step that the State intended to immunize their -- the monopoly power, is the step we are trying to find in this grant. And that's what I don't see. I see the -- the compulsion to serve the needy.",
  "I hear that much of Georgia is rural, but your adversary says, in most instances, there is only one hospital, so the municipality's taking it over is not going to be a merger issue. To the extent that they step in and take over one of two hospitals, there is no merger issue because it's only substituting one owner for another. This situation, they claim, is a rarity, where there are only two or three providers and a hospital's going to -- and a public -- a municipality is going to then get monopoly power by an acquisition.",
  "Mr. Waxman, I'm showing my ignorance. Is this -- would this merger be subject to the rule of reason?",
  "If it were -- if we were not to find State immunity, would the merger be subject to the rule of reason?",
  "I was embarrassed to ask the question, but I was taught to ask the question. If it is -- I'm going to assume that we'll both be -- we'll both be corrected by our respective colleagues, soon enough.",
  "But -- but if it --",
  "That's likely.",
  "But -- but my question is really more fundamental, which is, yes, I understand that you have a great defense, potentially, to a rule of reason challenge that -- that there was necessity in its truest sense, in its economic sense, in this situation. So why should we undo our decades of writings that say that we should construe immunity narrowly and not broadly, when it comes to displacing our antitrust laws?",
  "Counsel, can I interrupt --",
  "-- you, just a moment, to address a question raised by Justice Breyer, which is your alternative argument?",
  "You have lots of evidence that the authority does very little oversight of these hospitals when they move forward. But is that the issue before us? Is the question of immunity as to what happens in the operation of the hospital or in their merger and acquisition, their actual formation? And -- so that to the extent that we were to conclude that the State has delegated immunity on the basis of merger, why do we need to look any further at whether there has or has not been an appropriate degree of supervision of that decision?",
  "Counsel, may I interrupt a moment on --",
  "-- following up on an issue raised in part by the Chief and by Justice Ginsburg. Assuming that Davis was a direct supervisor, would there be an affirmative defense available to the employer?",
  "That would be your position?",
  "That this could not be grounds that someone who directs an employee's day-to-day activity should be treated like someone who hasn't actually undertaken the threat because the situations are different.",
  "Is that what this fight is about? What if we were to say that the EEOC's test governed or the Second Circuit test governed, but because of the nature of the difference between formal supervisors who take tangible work activities and informal supervisors who the employer would have less control over and less knowledge about their activities, that we would require an employee to complain. Would that be a crazy rule, and why?",
  "Would require, would permit the affirmative defense to be raised by an employer.",
  "No, but there is a difference between those supervisors who take direct activity, tangible direct actions, who are in power to do that, and supervisors who don't have that power, because supervisors who don't have that power are supervised -- their actions are supervised in a way that non-tangible employment supervisors are not.",
  "No, it's whether, whether or not this whole fight is over that issue.",
  "No, because it's also about the burden of proof.",
  "So if we keep the burden of proof with respect to -- to the employer raising the affirmative defense, does that solve half your problem?",
  "Would you tell me what you see as the major difference between the EEOC and the Second Circuit rule, and why one is compelled over the other? It's the regulatory agency charged with oversight of -- of the implementation of the statute. Why shouldn't we give deference to it on --",
  "-- the standard it sets forth?",
  "Do we have a developed record enough to do that in this case?",
  "Do -- do we have a developed record enough? Petitioner's counsel says we don't, that the Seventh Circuit test didn't permit them to develop the record sufficiently to clarify all of these issues. We certainly have snippets or -- or lack snippets, as the case may be. But is the record sufficiently developed for the Court to even pronounce -- make pronouncements of that nature?",
  "Mr. Garre, there is one BSU internal document that -- a note to the file by a compliance officer, who apparently investigated one of the complaints, that says that -- Kimes is recorded as saying -- he's the avowed supervisor -- that he, quote, \"knows Davis has given direction to Vance, and that he just doesn't know what else to do.\" Doesn't that defeat summary judgment on its face?",
  "I think Justice Breyer's question was what's not in the record?",
  "Do you have something that's not in the record that will materially add to this discourse?",
  "Mr. Katyal, if you go to equity, why aren't you bound by equity?",
  "Well, but that's exactly what your bottom line is, which is you have someone else do the work for you and you don't pay them.",
  "So why does your lien have priority to the attorney's lien that is normally created at the commencement of the litigation? Why is the attorney bound by the agreement you signed with the beneficiary?",
  "Counsel, are you conceding --",
  "-- the plan doesn't say it?",
  "I'm sorry, the phrase that you just read says that the benefits are the same. It doesn't say that the reimbursement and subrogation language are the same. So go back to Justice Ginsburg's question and point out in the plan what words you're relying upon, not the summary, but the plan.",
  "I thought it took most of the litigation for the plan to be provided.",
  "In this case, he wrote -- the attorney wrote to you any number of times and finally said, look, unless you come and tell me what your position is, I'm going to go forward. So what are attorneys supposed to do in those situations, just drop the lawsuit?",
  "Rejected it because it had nothing to do with the agreement, but it didn't reject them as a factual matter, that you were contacted.",
  "Counsel, were they supposed to -- if the insurance limit was $100,000, are you suggesting that that was a bad-faith settlement?",
  "The ability --",
  "Or not to enforce it, meaning the equity is to enforce it or to stay your hand. And so the court could decide not to reach into the pocket of the plan participant to pay back money that the lawyer has.",
  "So what -- what's the difference between the two? Meaning -- I take your argument to be that the Court was right before, that freestanding subrogation claims have one set of remedies or rights, and subrogation, by agreement, have another. So what do you see as the differences between the two?",
  "So was the Court in an exercise of futility, in writing what it did in Sereboff?",
  "Counsel, I understand the argument. It's a bit unsettling that you've got two kinds of rights, one implied and one express, and there's no difference between the two? You -- you've got to give them a little bit more body to have a persuasive argument.",
  "Isn't there another line after that, that says something --",
  "Put on the back of someone else, meaning --",
  "-- I may or may not agree that, in terms of your split with the participant, the contract might control. But I still am having trouble with understanding how you can bind a third party, like a lawyer, who's done the effort to recover that fund -- more along Justice Breyer's question, which is not only in -- in all equity, lawyers are entitled, whether by contract or by unjust enrichment principles, to a -- to a percentage of their expenses in recovering something.",
  "Counsel, I'm assuming, because ERISA's in place now, that the many State laws that prohibit this kind of agreement, where insurance plans are seeking full reimbursement, despite an attorney's efforts, that those are void, that those would be enforceable.",
  "The only one who can fix this problem now is Congress, if they --",
  "-- if they perceive it as a problem.",
  "Some circuits have even said that. Some circuits have even said that.",
  "The Second Circuit says that if it's a sentencing error, that the amount of substantial rights and the integrity of fairness of the preceding question is a different balance.",
  "Was Justice Breyer essentially correct that in most of the cases where an error is not plain at the time of trial that the third and fourth prong of Olano almost always take care of the issue? I mean, I've been looking for a case in this Court in which more substantial errors than the one that occurred here -- we are going to put aside the fact that I don't see how this Defendant on the third or fourth could ever win, given that he was begging for drug treatment during his sentencing, so how a resentence would affect the fairness or integrity of this proceeding is beyond my understanding. But isn't Justice Breyer right?",
  "Well, I would say to you that that's more in keeping with the attitude that Justice Kennedy asked about, which is I think most circuit courts believe the fourth prong is more easily met in sentencing than in trial cases. Whether they are right about that, that's not an issue we are facing today.",
  "But why? The very essence of 52(b) is when you don't make an objection. I mean, it's treating two -- it's addressing two different situations; A says when you've made an objection, you just have to prove prejudice; and B says you have to prove that substantial rights are affected.",
  "Mr. Wall, why is this whole test, as you're proposing it, dependent on the smartness or not smartness of a particular circuit and the speed with which a particular circuit reaches an issue or doesn't? I mean, this -- basically, what you're saying is we reward the circuits and the judges who don't reach issues, because if the law is unsettled, then if a substantial right is affected, that's so serious that it affects the fairness and integrity of a proceeding, that is not going to result in a reversal. It seems to me that if I'm a district court judge or a circuit court judge or anyone else or a circuit court, I would try to avoid as many issues as I could because there's going to be as little set of reversals as possible.",
  "And going back to what Justice Ginsburg said, we take cases where the split is 8 to 1, okay, or 8 to 0, because a particular circuit hasn't gotten to -- to an issue. Does this mean, as Justice Breyer said, that the eight circuits who got it right, the defendants have a Johnson plain-error rule, and the one circuit who just didn't get to it doesn't?",
  "But why isn't the focus of the system on the nature of the error?",
  "But 52(b) is about not making the objection. That's -- that's sort of going around in a circle.",
  "Counsel, I guess, I -- I continue to be confused about what makes error plain or clear. I don't know why the pronouncement of a circuit court accomplishes that. Meaning, so we said in Tapia that the statute is perfectly plain, perfectly clear. And so why shouldn't it have been clear to those circuits or to that district court judge at the time of trial? You're equating the plainness of error with what the outcome is to -- in circuit courts, and I'm having trouble with that.",
  "I don't understand how you get that from the rule. The rule says any plain error that affects substantial rights, even if it wasn't brought to the judge's attention.",
  "Counsel, so what am I to make of your transmittal letter which says, in the offer itself, that -- JA 5556, that Petitioners make clear that the offer of judgment, quote, \"was not to be construed as an admission that Petitioners are liable in this action or that Respondent has suffered any damage\"? What -- what are we to make of that --",
  "-- when you're now claiming that you would have accepted a judgment of liability?",
  "How did you pick the",
  "I see in the -- in the FLSA, that it also requires an amount for liquidated damages. Did you include that amount as well?",
  "Counsel, I have --",
  "Counsel, can I ask a fundamental question under Rule 68? I mean, when I was a district court judge, if parties told me about their settlement discussions, I would get quite upset. But, it says explicitly -- explicitly, \"Evidence of an unaccepted offer is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs.\" What authorizes you to use evidence of that offer to argue anything --",
  "-- especially when a -- the statute gives the plaintiff an absolute statutory right to refuse it at a specific penalty? What permits you to use it as evidence of anything, mootness -- I don't care what you're using it for -- except in cost?",
  "This makes no sense to me because, if the offer is for judgment, it has to be proof of validity and amount because, at least you have -- you should be able to get a judgment.",
  "But didn't you just tell me that an offer results in an admission of liability and a judgment for a particular amount?",
  "I have a question for you, counsel.",
  "Counsel, there is -- from the beginning, you never accepted the offer.",
  "What you appear to have conceded and -- is that the amount of the offer would settle your personal claim.",
  "Mr. Katyal, I'm a little troubled that you have given up or argue that the ability to enter a forced judgment is permissible under Rule 68. There is nothing in that rule that gives the court that power, certainly not stated explicitly or even implicitly, because it talks about an entire procedure of accepting the offer or rejecting it, all of it in the hands of the parties, none of it until the entry of the judgment in the hands of the court and only after the plaintiff has accepted the offer in writing. So I can't see anything but an inherent power. So, for me, if there is an inherent power, it has to be under a default judgment because the other side is saying, I give up.",
  "All right.",
  "Let's go from there, at least with me, and that may answer an earlier question about an inquest on damages because that is a part of the requirements for a default judgment, so that if there is a dispute about damages, that can be resolved. But my point is that liability is admitted. Now, let's deal with the Chief's question and Justice Scalia's question, which is in what ways is this comparable to a shared cost, like what motivated our decision in class actions, that the settlement of one existing plaintiff doesn't settle the collective action. How is this similar to that?",
  "-- you could get the step -- the Court had to evaluate whether the offer actually met your personal damages claim, too.",
  "And what you're saying --",
  "-- in those pages is the Court didn't even do that.",
  "But what you're talking about is imputing into this process, a fairness hearing, essentially, to see, by the district court, to determine whether this is a quirky case where you entered a judgment and you don't need a collective action or whether or not this is a genuine case that requires joining plaintiffs.",
  "I thought the case law was fairly clear that, when the EPA changes its rules in your favor, that they can't -- the court can't impose penalties for a past violation.",
  "How do we -- how do we avoid, under your reading -- assuming we agreed with you what the rule says, that there is a difference between logging roads and access roads? The other side raises a lot of question about whether these, in fact, are access roads or not. So do -- do we need to -­",
  "Do we have to reach that issue then?",
  "So how do we -­",
  "It may not -­",
  "It may not be, but these are pipes, ditches, and channels which the CWA explicitly defines as point sources -­",
  "-- that are not part of the harvesting. By definition, they are not. They're -- you're saying public roads and not access roads.",
  "How do you deal with his points about the ex-fact remedies of attorneys' fees and remediation? Why are -- why are those moot?",
  "Is this a -­",
  "So you're disclaiming that you have to go to the court of appeals; you think you can bring a citizen suit to challenge the validity of the regulation?",
  "But that's the -- but that's the whole point, which is if you go back what's the value of the backward-looking construction, if what you're seeking is injunctive relief that has to be based on the new rule?",
  "Does that include a right to intervene and dismiss the action?",
  "Excuse me.",
  "You don't mention Union Pacific in your brief. How can you be calling what you're doing setting your jurisdictional limits? Didn't we say, in Union Pacific, that agencies can't do that? You can't define your own jurisdiction.",
  "Now, you may or may not be able to establish claim processing rules. That, I think, is a totally different question. But why do you continue to use it as jurisdictional language?",
  "Well, in that respect, I think the amici is right. You can't -- if they're jurisdictional, we've clearly said that equitable tolling doesn't apply under any circumstances.",
  "So what is good cause, if not some form of equitable tolling?",
  "Assume for the sake of your answer that the error was intentional. Don't try to go to the facts, but assume the error was intentional. Now, answer Justice Alito's question.",
  "There -- that might be a contradiction in terms.",
  "If this is a claim processing rule, under what theory could you shield yourself against fraudulent conduct -- fraudulent concealment? Under what theory of law would an agency's rule be fair and -- and non-arbitrary --",
  "-- that shielded it from fraudulent acts.",
  "Why do you keep fighting the -- the question?",
  "You keep fighting the hypotheticals. There is an intent to save money and an intent not to use the figures that are specified by statute, and that is concealed. In that set of circumstances, if this were a claim processing rule, would you be authorized to treat -- not to -- not to permit the action?",
  "It didn't talk about the board. It talks about what a party can do, not what the board can or cannot do.",
  "That's not the prototypical limitation that -- that Congress uses when it intends a jurisdictional limit on a court.",
  "We have talked about what the -- the fact that there almost is a presumption of a claims processing rule, rather than jurisdictional, unless Congress is clear about that. What policy supports an argument that we should be reading limitations of this kind as jurisdictional, particularly when, on the same day the statute was passed, the agency, invoking its regulatory powers, treated it like a claim processing? Whatever your colleague argues, a good cause exception, the 3-year exception, everything else is -- is really treating it like a claim processing rule, not as jurisdictional.",
  "That was, in part, the point I raised earlier, which is we look at what the history is to help inform our use of labels. The history here -- you can't ignore it -- is that, from its inception, whether it's trying to disclaim it now or not, the agency has not treated it as jurisdictional. It's used the word --",
  "-- but it's treated it as a claim processing rule by creating these exceptions.",
  "There is -- there is a lot of discussion and confusion between jurisdiction, mandatory claim processing rules, nonmandatory claim processing rules. I could go on and on about the labels. But let's go back to the point Justice Kagan made earlier, which is, assuming we were to treat this as a mandatory claim processing rule, where does that get you? Now, the agency says that means no equitable tolling. Assuming I'm willing to accept that, is equitable tolling the same as fraudulent concealment, which has been treated in the law, not as a -- as a necessary part of equitable tolling, which has to do with what the plaintiff could have done or not done, but with what a defendant has done or not done?",
  "Do you agree with that last statement?",
  "Do you think an agency is not permitted to have mandatory claim processing rules?",
  "Do you believe an agency is not capable of having mandatory claim processing rules, that it limits the application of equitable principles?",
  "Would our review be an APA review, whether the -- the rule is arbitrary or capricious?",
  "Excuse me. Is the miscalculation still going on? I mean, this involved --",
  "-- claims 12 years ago.",
  "But did they continue from that time forward to the present?",
  "Mr. Kneedler, just for point of clarification, the 3-year good cause extension that's permitted under the government's regulations, would that include -- would good cause -- or could a claim be raised that fraud by the agency is the good cause?",
  "That’s what I thought. So it's not as if the government is saying --",
  "So why don't we just remand and let it sort it out under the right understanding of the legal rule? Which is basically what the government is saying, with an added twist because it thinks there is another legal question that I think the Ninth Circuit has answered, but we could go back and forth on it.",
  "Everybody agrees.",
  "So this was a regulatory void?",
  "A regulatory void that these -- that there was no requirement previously that you monitor the outfalls?",
  "So how do you -- how do you envision this permit was -- by the way, just one side question and then on to this one. I thought the Ninth Circuit basically endorsed your view that, under the permit, you're not -- you're only responsible for your own pollution.",
  "So it has resolved this issue?",
  "All right. So that's why I ask why remand and why you're saying why remand.",
  "But putting that aside, how do you think the system was supposed to work before?",
  "Did you have any obligation, once you saw the excess pollutants, to start the reiteration process, to try to figure out who was the cause of this?",
  "You mean the Respondents could have done that here?",
  "I'm sorry, you mean --",
  "You just said there were polluters upstream. Are those industrial polluters upstream --",
  "-- or industrial facilities, are they within your MS4?",
  "But what you're saying is that there are outfalls from different people into the same river.",
  "All right. So we don't know whether the outfall is from your MS4 or from some other source?",
  "Counsel, tell me why remand? I thought -- and correct me at whatever step I'm wrong, okay -- that the district court rejected Respondents' argument that the mere monitoring excesses created liability. What it said is you have to follow the terms of the permit and make the permittee responsible only for their excess discharges, and you haven't shown us any evidence that does that. The Ninth Circuit agreed that the permittee is only liable for its own discharges. It held the permittee liable because it believed that the discharges were within their source -- within their outflow. So what are we remanding for? The legal question of whether the -- the -- the monitoring stations automatically create liability has been answered in the negative by both courts.",
  "How would it --",
  "-- what could it do differently?",
  "How does that change the answer to the legal question that the permittee -- both courts have said the permittee is only liable for their own discharges. And unless this proves that they discharged -- they, themselves, discharged, which it can't because it's in the river and not within the source --",
  "-- how can that, alone, establish liability?",
  "Why should we, in light of the clarity of the permit? That's the question Justice Scalia is asking.",
  "Why wouldn’t it necessarily --",
  "Do we have -- I just don't remember now. Do we have a circuit split on thi issue of whether a permit in a situation like this would impose liability on all permittees?",
  "What you're saying is the return of the child, essentially, back to Alabama?",
  "And so once the child is back in Alabama, that's the remedy, then the State court would be seized of jurisdiction sufficient then to determine the habitual residence.",
  "Whatever the State -- well, presumably, the child only comes back if you win.",
  "So presuming you win, the child would come back, and the Alabama courts could then seize the custody determination.",
  "Was their reasoning that the child was initially removed properly because there had been an order permitting the mother to go?",
  "So it was a lawful removal at that moment.",
  "And what they're saying is, since the case is moot, nothing has vacated the order, but it didn't make her action illegal?",
  "It's a stand-still order there.",
  "Counsel, there is a judgment against your client, isn't there, for $94,000 or so?",
  "Could you break down that figure?",
  "So --",
  "Counsel, that cost that you have to pay for the mother, even though the case was mooted, that judgment is still outstanding for the monies you have to pay?",
  "If you win on this appeal, is that wiped out?",
  "Counsel, what's -- what happens --",
  "Can you tell me what's happening -- what is the status? Given the vacated return custody order -- return order, will the Scottish court ever determine habitual residence?",
  "But that order has been vacated, so can they revisit that question is really the -- the issue.",
  "And at the Hague, it's what was it then.",
  "Could I ask a question? Does it matter? Meaning, whether a stay is granted or not, you are, I don't think, taking the position that only if the stay is granted is the court of appeals seized of jurisdiction. You're saying the case is not moot, correct?",
  "All right. Now, under the Convention, if the child -- if it goes back to the district court now to fashion a remedy, it could order return, it could decide under the Convention that bringing the child back after 14 months presents a great risk to the child under the Convention and not order the return, correct?",
  "So we just don't know what the court's going to do, but some form of relief is possible. That's why you used the word \"possible.\"",
  "But they have the power, if they choose it, but they don't have to choose it; that's the bottom line, correct?",
  "Are you aware of -- I happen to be because I know this area very well -- the English courts have an amici filed with us yesterday, and they are sort of sensibly keeping track of what we're doing and trying to adjust their proceedings accordingly and in the manner they think is most helpful to us. Whether it is or not, I can't comment on. Is this common in the custody area? Is there discussions between courts about what they're doing and the why of it?",
  "And it's required. There is a whole system set up now, right?",
  "Why can't they order the mother to come back with the child? Because the Scottish court stops her? There is competing orders all the time.",
  "Why not? She was here. She submitted to the court's jurisdiction. Doesn't her -- jurisdiction over her now continue until the end of the case?",
  "That doesn't matter. The question is, isn't she seized -- doesn't the court have jurisdiction over her until the case ends? The case doesn't end until there has been an appeal and a judgment and the judgment affirmed or reversed. That hasn't happened.",
  "You are suggesting that the Convention deprives a party, after the remedy's been ordered and effected, of the right to appeal; not because of mootness, but because the Convention takes away a fundamental right to appeal?",
  "You're not going to suggest all those countries that permit appeals explicitly and stop removals until appeals are finished, that those -- that those those treaty -- contracting treaty parties are breaching the Convention, are you?",
  "Counsel, that -- that actually is not accurate. The Convention is full of conditions for the return, the safety of the child, the support of the parent who is returning -- there is a whole set of conditions that have to be met before the child is returned.",
  "I happen to think that -- that one could argue that returning back to the court that had -- was making the decision after an appeal is raised, that that's an inherent condition of a return order. But that -- you're arguing against that. But there are plenty of conditions that could be imposed.",
  "No. You can't -- the Court can't order custody issues, but it can set conditions for the nature of the return. It could say the father pays the cost, the father has to pay for certain expenses in the country the child is being sent to. Those kinds of conditions can be imposed.",
  "Excuse me, can I just --",
  "But asking is not enough.",
  "Because the mother can get on the plane the moment she hears that someone's asked.",
  "Isn't there a Spanish case?",
  "Isn't there a Spanish case?",
  "Not a Scottish, Spain, a case from Spain.",
  "Where the child was, in fact, returned when --",
  "Counsel, there is an amici brief here that says that the Scottish courts will not pay attention to the habitual residence of a child at the time of the removal. The amici brief that was filed with us yesterday, if I'm reading it correctly, suggests that the court believes that hasn't been settled in English law; is that correct?",
  "That that -- so that proposition is not as settled as the amici suggests?",
  "Well, why doesn't -- why doesn't the normal class certification process protect adequately the absent class members? First of all, counsel has to prove he or she is adequate. So doesn't that mean that if they enter a stipulation that is grossly unfair to the class that the judge is not going to certify that case?",
  "You haven't answered. If -- if the court finds the stipulation inadequate for the class, is that class going to be certified?",
  "And then they would get removed to the Federal court, which is what the statute was intended to do.",
  "Well, discovery vis-a-vis the certification of the class is going to happen anyway. My point is that much of your argument in your brief is centered around binding the absent class members. What I'm getting to is that if the stipulation is grossly unfair, there may not be a class at all, or the Plaintiffs who have claims greater than those in the aggregate might opt -- will get notice and opt out. And there is due process challenges if a settlement is entered that is so grossly unfair that it violates due process. So I don't know why the process itself doesn't protect the interests of -- of Congress.",
  "But you -- you chimed into this discussion --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "But it would never involve a judgment that a claim is really worth $50 million and just to defeat this statute, it's being limited to 5.",
  "Well, the only strategic reason according to your adversary is they want to stay in State court.",
  "Mr. Frederick, your answer just doesn't deal with the component that's been troubling, which is that it doesn't protect the absent class members. In situations like the one Justice Alito or the point Justice Alito made, which is they don't really know how much the entire quantity of the class might truly be, and who's protecting them --",
  "-- if it would go your way?",
  "So why can't the case be removed at that moment?",
  "Could you simplify that? Could you simplify that? What do you think the elements of -- just going back to what Justice Scalia said, as I understand your position the elements of a burglary in California law is being in a place with the intent to commit a crime. Whether you got there with permission or without permission, unlawfully or not, is irrelevant. So what you are saying is what he pled guilty to was being in that garage with the intent to commit a crime, correct?",
  "But the unlawfulness is not necessary.",
  "No matter what he said, he wasn't convicted of a generic crime because all he was convicted of under California law was entering and --",
  "-- with intent. That's your point.",
  "But that's my problem, which is you say that, but how to define a missing element from an alternative element is -- overbroad element, doesn't make any sense to me. As I read the California statute, all it says is you have to enter a number of defined things with the intent to commit a crime. It doesn't talk about whether the entry itself is unlawful. That's your colleague's -- your opponent's argument. But you're trying to read into the method of entering that it could be legal or illegal, and so you look at the documents to add that.",
  "So how do you take that position and advocate the answer you're giving here? Because you are asking us to determine or to have courts below determine what are or are not definitions that the judiciary is applying to means versus mode, et cetera?",
  "Could you tell me what the difference is between entering the garage with permission and taking a wrench and walking out, and entering a store with permission and taking an article of clothing. Are they both shoplifting?",
  "They are the same thing. So in answer to Justice Breyer's question, you do admit that under the California definition of burglary, shoplifting could be charged.",
  "I think your adversary can speak for himself, and his brief did point to some convictions for shoplifting under the statute.",
  "There are some.",
  "Mr. Johnson, the last answer by Mr. Horwich to the last question was, it would be simpler if we hadn't done the modified categorical approach; but the reality is we have a statute. The active statute that defines violent felony not with respect to a felony that involved dangerous conduct, but as any crime punishable by imprisonment that has an element that threatened use of physical force. So it's not what the Court created, it's what the statute created.",
  "Clause.",
  "Mr. Liman, I understand your argument, but I have a fundamental difficulty, okay? Bailey and Exploration Company, with statutes not too dissimilar from this one, who read the discovery rule into a fraud claim, both for a civil litigant and for the government. The only way that I can tease out a potential difference between Exploration and this case is somehow that the penalty in this case is not for injury, but for punishment, as you called it. Government as enforcer, rather than government as victim. Some of us would say that the common wheel is injured whenever someone breaks a law, so that that distinction between enforcer and victim makes no sense. How do you answer that point?",
  "It's acting as a sovereign to protect what it thinks is an ordered society. And if you break that order, you are injuring the society. That -- that's the best --",
  "Mr. Liman, finishing up a point you were just on previously, what's your position with respect to fraudulent concealment? Doesn't your theory preclude even the application of that to tolling of the statute?",
  "But tell me about --",
  "This is -- it's nice for you to say that. But tell me, having announced your theory, how the next step is avoidable? Under what theory would we say you can't have a discovery rule, but you can have a fraudulent concealment rule?",
  "Mr. Liman, I'm a little confused in your answer to Justice Scalia. You said that the underlying case has a 5-year statute of repose for a civil claim. If Bailey applies, however, those claimants who have -- under your theory, who have been directly injured. The presumption would apply of discovery, if they were claiming a fraud.",
  "So are you just arguing that under this statutory scheme there is no application of the discovery?",
  "Because of the alternative language of 5 years.",
  "Right.",
  "That's what I thought those involved.",
  "So, this is a very modern problem, but how about the statute of Elizabeth, which talked about penalties as being a criminal sanction, but permitted private individuals, not the government, to seek the penalties and keep it. So you cite the statute of James, and I look at the statute of Elizabeth, and try to find the analogy between which one.",
  "Even though private parties could keep the money back then.",
  "Could I move you to another issue? If a party can defeat the government's claim of discovery by showing that the government wasn't reasonably diligent, how does a party ever accomplish that? Aren't you going to raise the law enforcement privilege, the -- some other privilege to block -- discovery?",
  "Well, if they fail there, don't you think that they are going to also fail because they are not going to be able to look at your records to figure out exactly what you knew or didn't know?",
  "How do you know that ex ante?",
  "How could you ever know that ex ante? I mean, without looking at the individual facts of the case, the 30 percent is going to be underinclusive in some circumstances, overinclusive in others. So how do you deal with our holding that you are not entitled to the overinclusive portion?",
  "Life is never certain, and so I don't even go to that issue. I go just simply to the question, how can you, ex ante, predict -- particularly with a statute that wasn't based on any empirical data -- that 30 percent normally is the right amount? You just picked it out of the air? You could pick 40, 50, 60. How do we draw the line?",
  "Now, how does it have the right to announce that in a FELA case or in a Jones Act case where those injured parties, they have a property right in their protection but this statute applies to that recovery as well?",
  "So they can deny a litigant a property right in that recovery?",
  "I don't know how you can go in and ask for something you don't own. I don't know how the plaintiff can go in and litigate a case if they don't have a property interest that they can then assign to someone else. I've never heard of such a thing, how they would have standing to sue on your behalf if they have no property interest in the recovery.",
  "How do you sue for something you have no property interest in?",
  "So go back to Justice Scalia's question.",
  "There has to be some interest in the 30 percent by the plaintiff.",
  "Could I just clarify one point? Does this rule preclude parties, as we said in Ahlborn, from stipulating to a settlement at all?",
  "Your brief is not clear on that. They can still stipulate. It's only if after the stipulation, it hasn't been allocated that you can recover?",
  "So what you're basically now saying is that there can never be a stipulation.",
  "You're saying that the parties cannot enter into a stipulation.",
  "I didn't hear Justice Ginsburg's question.",
  "Basically you are saying the judge would be required to give you your one-third regardless of what the jury said.",
  "So all those States that have jury verdicts, special verdicts that require a certain amount, they could avoid that by just simply passing this law and avoid the anti-lien statute that way?",
  "16 States already have something close to a presumption of a percentage. Do you have any evidence that in those 16 States where it's only a presumption and not a fixed amount, that they are falling apart because of it?",
  "In the absence of this statute, what did your State do beforehand?",
  "Am I correct that what you believe and what the courts have been doing in your State, the lower courts, is that they won't approve a settlement that doesn't have the one-third, and they won't enter a judgment that doesn't have the one-third? Is that correct?",
  "So I'm right. They just won't accept the private stipulation that doesn't do that, and they won't enter into a judgment that doesn't do that, correct?",
  "Just answer my question.",
  "All right. Going back to Justice Alito's. The jury says it's less or more or whatever of -- of the settlement is medical expenses, it doesn't matter what they say, the court can't enter a judgment for that amount, they have to enter a judgment for either the one-third or the full medical expenses.",
  "And that's what they have been doing.",
  "I know that was argued before. But I read Ahlborn very carefully, and I don't see it. I read the amici briefs that reference different procedures, and not one of them referenced the North Carolina procedure. So I know that was argued before. You didn't argue it in your brief here, and I assume you didn't because you did what I did, which was to read Ahlborn carefully and read what it cited, and I don't see it cited.",
  "I don't see the North Carolina procedure referenced in Ahlborn as something that States could do. It wasn't referenced directly in the -- in the opinion, and it wasn't referenced indirectly by the amici. The amici were talking about substantially different procedures.",
  "But my point is, Justice Kennedy's question was that somehow in that opinion, we approved the North Carolina system.",
  "Is there a direct reference to North Carolina's system - -",
  "-- in that or in any of the amici brief that talked about different State rules?",
  "16 are doing it already.",
  "Is that because they know they are going to be subject to a hearing if they don't reach an agreement?",
  "So there is an inducement for them to do what this State didn't do.",
  "When told to come in, they ignored it. In those States, States know they are going to increase potentially their costs, so they come in more often.",
  "Counsel, do judges do this in non-Medicaid cases regularly?",
  "Let's deal with what appears to be many of my colleagues' gut instinct, okay? This is -- it costs too much, it's too burdensome. We've already answered why not, but in the end, they don't believe you could ever figure out the number. That's really their bottom line, that this number's artificial no matter what you do, so you might as well just throw a label on it, reasonable or not, and leave it alone. How do you answer that argument? Because that's the essence of their -- of their belief --",
  "-- that this bottom line allocation is always going to be wrong somehow.",
  "Counsel, in those proceedings, are witnesses called or is it usually done on papers?",
  "Could you move the microphone so it's a little closer to you?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Yes. Thanks.",
  "Ms. Anders, could you please finish your response, when you said various States do various things. Could you describe some of them?",
  "How many States have North Carolina's rule? Do you know?",
  "So how do -- what do we do with the Federal statute that says, You are not entitled to a lien of any amount that is greater than your medical expenses? And using the Solicitor General's Office example, everybody knows that the true value of medical expenses in a particular case was only 10 percent, you are still getting 30 percent. How do we -- how do we honor the terms of the Federal statute?",
  "How come it took so long for this State to figure out that it needed to do this without a warrant?",
  "The officer testified that he's been making drunk driving arrests for years --",
  "-- and I think in only one circumstance did he need to do it without a warrant. So what made the need here eminent in the sense of impractical to get the warrant?",
  "No, I understand why he decided to do it, to forego getting a warrant. Isn't his testimony dispositive of this case? He had time to get it.",
  "But it took a considerable amount of time for all the years he did it.",
  "And -- and he didn't testify to it -- it causing a loss of any particular case.",
  "What constitutional right exists for a State to get the best evidence?",
  "No, no, no. You, the State, want to strive for that. But what in the Fourth Amendment contemplates that that's a right the State must have, that is has to get the very best evidence it can?",
  "So how can it be reasonable to forego the Fourth Amendment in a procedure I as intrusive as a needle going into someone's body? say this because breathalyzers in my mind have a much different intrusion level. They don't intrude into your body. And I think almost all jurisdictions use breathalyzers instead of blood tests. A small fraction that actually use blood tests. The ruling by us today is going to change that and is going to -- if in your favor is going to change that and is going to -- if in your favor, is going to change that and put sort of a print, the Court's print, on: Use the most intrusive way you can to prove your case.",
  "So the new rule is we have to strengthen -- the Fourth Amendment is going to be suspended whenever the prosecution can't get the best evidence to make its case out?",
  "So do you define reasonableness --",
  "So would the importance of the search warrant suggest, as a constitutional right, suggest that we should judge reasonableness by the people who are the least efficient or by the people who are the most reasonably efficient?",
  "Meaning people, police jurisdictions.",
  "Absolutely, but should they -- should we permit them to vary in terms of inefficiency or should we be encouraging them to vary within a reasonable range?",
  "But there are so many situations in which we require a warrant, nevertheless. When there is drug dealing in a house, every time people enter that house, it's almost a certainty that they're going to use the drugs and that evidence is going to disappear. You rely on hope -- on knowing that there's likely to be telltale signs left over. And that's the same thing you do in an alcohol situation. You rely on the testimony of the police officer, you rely on the implied consent presumption. It's not as if this is destruction of all evidence, and -- and not like a fleeing situation where someone gets away, you have nothing left. This is -- this is vastly different.",
  "So is it okay -- is it okay to let police officers take the blood?",
  "Oh, I bet that if we rule in your favor, we will.",
  "Do you want to be in those rural places and be stopped without an independent magistrate approving a field officer taking blood from you?",
  "Mr. Shapiro, could you tell me, and what I am deeply troubled about in your argument, is you incant the totality of the circumstances test. But what circumstances is the Court actually looking at to determine whether forgoing the warrant was necessary or not under that circumstance? We know one. We know where a fatality has occurred or a serious accident because we -- presumably you have to secure the scene and you have to take care of injured people or have cars towed, whatever else it is. But I'm not sure what other circumstances under your theory would really justify a magistrate -- a court below saying, you -- you know, it's okay, you didn't get a warrant here. It can't be merely because it takes too long to get the warrant because that shows inefficiency. It was part of my question earlier.",
  "Mr. Shapiro, could you go back to what in this conversation we sort of have lost focus of, which is the question presented, and which is the essence, I think, of your adversary's arguments. I'm not sure you've really put forth -- the essence of their argument is that you can forego the warrant requirement when you know for a fact that evidence is going to dissipate over time. Basically, they're saying this process undermines our right to get a warrant because the evidence is dissipating. We certainly have cases that talk about destruction of evidence being a reason to forego the warrant. What makes this case different from those?",
  "Sure.",
  "Does it create an exception for research? Let's assume that a university wanted to do a research project, and it needs subjects. I get solicited for it all the time. Does this exception apply to them, too?",
  "It says, \"surveys,\" not just marketing or solicitations.",
  "I mean, there is a commercial component, but there appears to be a noncommercial component as well.",
  "Does that apply to the States, too, when they want to market against drunk driving, they want to market against -- for their health insurance processes versus private processes for State drug provided --",
  "If the lawyer had said more -- did you buy a car, did you get charged the fee, we're investigating this to determine whether this is -- violates the law -- is that okay?",
  "So the only -- the only thing that's bad is to say, come call us for a consultation?",
  "So what's the difference between that and how you answered Justice Ginsburg, when she said class notice would be okay?",
  "Wait a minute. It's joining the class or opting out.",
  "And, when you join the class, you have a commercial relationship with the lawyer no different than being a named plaintiff.",
  "You -- you said earlier, and it set me to thinking, that why would in anticipation of litigation permit access to all of this very personal information? And I don't know that, yes, it does permit access, but only in anticipation of litigation. So you have to prove, before you get things like Social Security number, driver -- anything else -- all they asked for was name and addresses, I understand.",
  "Well, yes, there is. There is a limitation that you're actually going to use it in relationship to the litigation, number one. And the States are obligated to ensure that what they release is actually covered by one of these exceptions.",
  "But they have to explain why.",
  "No, no, no. As I read, the first one is: We want to see if there is a pattern of overcharging; give us the names and addresses of people who have recently bought a car. That seems, to me, pretty specific as to what they want and why they need it. And I think it's pretty easy for the State to say this fits.",
  "Mr. Clement, I'm not sure I'm satisfied with the answer you gave to Justice Scalia. He said, look, we've got to harmonize; instead of general-specific, solicitation of clients is different than investigation, and we just say they're mutually exclusive. It is a little bit of a general and specific. And that's proven by (b)(2) because, when (b)(2) wants to permit solicitation, it expressly says it, and they didn't expressly say, \"solicitation,\" in (4). That's, I think, your adversary's main argument. And I'm -- I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with the answer you're giving. You're saying they're independent, but why are they necessarily conflicting?",
  "\"Conflicting,\" exactly, or -- or conflicting or overlapping.",
  "I guess it's why are they necessarily overlapping?",
  "Is there a Federal law to that effect?",
  "There may be a Federal law to that effect.",
  "A separate one.",
  "Counsel, I just want to, before you leave, because -- in response to Justice Kagan, I think you've changed positions a little bit. You started by saying there were three ways to draw a line. Getting clients is okay; getting clients is okay if you get a specific treatment, occurrence, or defect. And you didn't mention what the third was. So what's your preferred reading?",
  "Counsel, could you address an issue that's very important to me, the one of stare decisis. And so that -- hone in on that.",
  "Well, the problem is, whether you're right or wrong -- and you're absolutely right, it was a plurality opinion -- your adversary says States have passed laws relying on it, the Federal system is now structured around it, why isn't the damage as great as they claim -- potential damage, I should say.",
  "Address, please, the practical consequences.",
  "How many -- how many Federal courts are you aware are already charging the 924(c) facts to a jury, notwithstanding the -- the fact that it's not required?",
  "Now I understand --",
  "Do you have any statistics, on at least 924(c), of how often the greater is the sentence than the absolute minimum required by law?",
  "So, in fact, your argument is that fixing a sentence is different than giving a judge discretion because it ignores the fact that a judge might have given you less?",
  "So it's depriving you of the constitutional right to have a jury decide what your sentence could be?",
  "Of having a judge decide what your sentence could be?",
  "How about Booker? What did Booker do --",
  "-- to the logic of Apprendi?",
  "Even when the statutes had a higher maximum?",
  "Because the jury was -- because the judge was constrained within a different maximum?",
  "Is that your argument here?",
  "Could I go back to a simple question on the stare decisis, the practicality question? What is so impractical about letting a jury decide an issue that sets a mandatory sentence of any kind? Why -- why are juries incapable of figuring out whether a gun was carried or brandished? Why are they incapable of figuring out how many -- how much drugs were sold or whether someone was driven by any of the factors that States want to commit to judges, but the Sixth Amendment might require them to submit to juries?",
  "But what does that have to do with the needs -- the constitutional need to make sure that juries are driving a fixed sentence of any kind?",
  "You know, but that --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, can I go back to a point you made earlier? You talked about a legislature not attempting to supplant the jury's role on the maximum. You don't see the same danger -- we started out in a country where almost all sentencing was in the discretion of the judge; whatever crime you committed, the judge could decide where to sentence you. As Apprendi and its subsequent progeny laid out, these sentencing changes that have come into existence have really come into existence the latter half of the last century. What -- don't you fear that, at some point, the legislature will go back to the old system of supplanting the jury by just saying what it said in 924(c)? Every single crime has a maximum of life. And all the -- and every single fact that's going to set a real sentence for the defendant, a minimum, we're going to let the judge decide by a preponderance of the evidence. The bottom line of my question is, when Apprendi was decided, what should be the driving force of protecting the jury system? The deprivation of discretion, whether that's permissible or not, or whether a sentence is fixed in a range, whatever it might be, by a jury?",
  "What's the better rule to keep both extremes from happening?",
  "I'm sorry, the historical -- you said, earlier, that most of the historical evidence was that determinate sentences would be decided by juries; they found facts, and a determinate sentence was given.",
  "So what is the judicial discretion now? You find by a preponderance of the evidence, and a mandatory minimum makes you give seven. So where is the judicial discretion?",
  "You think, for a defendant in a constitutional right, that they are more -- that it's constitutional to have a determinate sentence at seven and still constitutional -- and make the jury find it by a -- beyond a reasonable doubt and that it's still constitutional to have a determinative sentence of seven years, but have the jury find it by a preponderance of the evidence?",
  "Those are equal? Those are -- those are equal?",
  "No, I know we said it in Harris.",
  "The question here before us today is --",
  "So how about in O'Brien, if the legislature had said 40 years for a machine gun? Would we -- how do we justify saying, no, that has to remain an element? Under your theory, the democratic process didn't work.",
  "So how -- what would we do in that situation?",
  "Why is the legislature being deprived of that right, if they give it to the jury?",
  "I mean, it seems to me that, whether you give it to a jury or a judge, the legislature protects itself by declaring a minimum sentence.",
  "It determines the sentence, really.",
  "I -- I think what you -- let's go back to that. It was his view that, under Louisiana law to assert his Sixth Amendment right, he had to follow the procedure laid out in the Louisiana rule?",
  "Under the Sixth Amendment, he had to comply with the requirements -- the procedural requirements of Louisiana.",
  "All right. So then how do you -- if he couldn't do it in 2002, '03, '04, or '05, how did he end up doing it in '05?",
  "So why didn't he move to quash earlier?",
  "I'm sorry. What -- is there a law or a regulation in -- in Louisiana that gives it a three-year mark?",
  "How about the reasoning -- is delay because of the lack of funding attributable to the State or not? Or to the district attorney as agent of the State?",
  "So what's wrong with what's been suggested by some, to remand to tell the court below to whatever extent this was the basis of your decision, it was wrong. Now, redo the Barker -- the factors.",
  "So is one factor determinative always in this calculation? I thought it was a weighing factor. And so, if it's a weighing factor, why isn't that, in and of itself, a factor that a court needs to weigh against the others?",
  "But wait a minute. This is a --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Doesn't he say, at the same time, I couldn't do the investigation to make the motion required by the State? So didn't that implicate the funding for investigation?",
  "Were there funds for investigation?",
  "Which funds? Which funds?",
  "Wait a minute. I was told -- maybe I am sort of misreading this record -- that he was ultimately told that fund wouldn't be made available.",
  "Is -- is --",
  "Is that the minimum constitutional --",
  "Counsel, is -- do you want to define constitutionally adequate counsel? Is it anybody who's graduated from Harvard and Yale?",
  "Or even just passed the bar?",
  "I would think -- no, no, no. This is a very serious question which is, I don't know that we have ever defined what the minimum qualification is for qualified counsel. But it is -- some of it has to be that counsel themselves feel adequate to represent a capital defendant.",
  "I know plenty of lawyers who would never either volunteer or would resist being appointed to take on that kind of case because it has many differences to a normal case.",
  "She's a very experienced trial counsel. There's no -- no doubt of that. But was she a capital counsel?",
  "You added the word \"deliberate\" --",
  "How can --",
  "I'm sorry. What's the difference between saying, I'm broke, and I want to pay the prosecutor because they kept paying the prosecutor, I want to pay for the prosecutor's investigation, but I won't pay you? What -- what is the difference in applying the negligence versus deliberate standard? I mean, look, in the end, States are always strapped, but I don't know a State who doesn't make some income. They make a choice about where they want that income to go. And it may be, in your judgment, a more legitimate decision, but why is the situation less negligent -- why is it negligent and not deliberate? Why is the choice one, not the other?",
  "Well, then answer the question. Why isn't the choice to say, I -- I'm broke, so I don't want to pay you, I'm going to pay the prosecutor -- which happened, the prosecutors were being paid throughout. They had enough money to investigate, but we're choosing not to pay the defendants. Why isn't that a deliberate choice?",
  "Available funds to pay the lawyer?",
  "I'm not going to argue the funding issue because I've got to go look at the record again. But let's assume that the record doesn't support your claim because, as I read the decisions below and the record that I saw, there wasn't funding available until -- I think it was 2006 or '7? And so, somehow, there's a disconnect between what you're saying and the record. But let's assume that -- my hypothetical, that there wasn't money, despite whatever you're saying. What's your position then? Then it's not deliberate? It's still negligence.",
  "So there could never be a systematic breakdown, in your judgment, because any time the State gives resources to something else, it's not deliberate -- it's not a systemic breakdown.",
  "There was money allocated, but, if I understood the record correctly -- by the State -- the funding was grossly inadequate to cover all the needs?",
  "As to the murder or as to the independent robbery count? It's not a lesser included offense, the robbery count.",
  "Well, one of the strongest arguments by your adversary has to do with the incongruity between these claims and the Westfall ruling by this Court. It's more a policy argument than a language argument, but how do you address the fact that we will be interpreting, essentially, two statutes that are almost identical, but with different conclusions now, if we were to adopt your view.",
  "Are there any -- I'm sorry. Are there any other tort claims besides the lack of consent battery claim at issue here that could be encompassed by the Intentional Tort Act, as it relates to medical malpractice? Let's assume that it's not an operation, but sexual behavior with a patient in their hospital room, something of that nature. Is that covered under the Gonzalez Act, as a claim against the United States?",
  "This exception you're - - you're talking about is regularly applied in the lower courts?",
  "In the lower courts, this determination is regularly made?",
  "What do you need more clear than \"(h) doesn't apply\"?",
  "I mean, I don't know how much clearer Congress has to get than to say it's nullified.",
  "What more does it have to say; the exception doesn't apply, and then what's left?",
  "Now, what do you do with Justice Breyer's point -- or with your adversary's point? I know you'll tell us don't look at the Congressional Record because it suits you right now, because when it doesn't, you point to it extensively. But what do you do with the Veterans Act record that says, we are modeling ourselves after the Gonzalez Act, including its nullification of the intentional tort?",
  "Counsel, I've had a problem with your argument, okay? From the record, it's very clear that a conservation offer is not considered mitigation because there's still a net loss of wetlands. The policy is abundantly clear, stated, and undisputed. Okay? So, given that policy, why are we even in this case? Meaning whether there was an exaction or no exaction or whatever happened in terms of the denial, you couldn't win on your offer because the policy of the State was clear and, in my mind, unassailable: We have to preserve wetlands. Conservation of other wetlands is not enough. Mitigation means make sure that we get a net gain of wetlands. So why are we here?",
  "How do you normally decide whether the agency has done that right or not?",
  "How do you normally decide? Let's assume Justice Kagan's question -- or Justice Ginsburg's question. No -- it just says, come to us with a mitigation plan. And you say, this is what I offer, and it's enough. And they say, no, it's not enough; denied. Would you go through the State administrative process, to figure out whether that was arbitrary and capricious, whether it was a Penn Central violation? What would you do with that claim in the normal circumstance? Justice Kennedy's question.",
  "It would be an inverse condemnation.",
  "Which -- how does that not address going too far? You just said it. If -- if this is unrelated to the -- the denial of your permit of all uses of your land, and you're saying that's the problem, which is I still have a use, I just want more, why does that entitle you to your lost profits? When were you ever entitled to start with the claim that, somehow, you're entitled to a permit, as a matter of law?",
  "Mr. Kneedler, can I go back to the questions presented for a moment? The court below did two separate rulings, I think. One is there can't be a taking if the -- if the claim is that it's of an undifferentiated money, not a res. And I think you would agree with that. If the only issue is an obligation to pay money, that that's not a takings claim, correct?",
  "Right. There was a second holding, however, which really gets ellipsed by the second, which is a denial of a permit doesn't permit you to raise the Nollan/Dolan case. And it appears, to me, even if there is an easement situation -- so, even if there is an actual takings claim at issue, do you agree with that first holding by the court below?",
  "Assuming we narrow it not to undifferentiated money, but is there a difference between a denial or a grant?",
  "What do we do with what Mr. Kneedler says is a ruling in your favor on this question, that all denials are subject to Nollan and Dolan? What do we do with that? I mean, what's the -- I see an enormous flood gate here and one in which we are sending a signal that, perhaps, States should be more quiet, rather than more engaging. They should just say no because anything they offer is going to be seen as an -- potentially, as an unconstitutional taking. They should just plain say no and not explain why, not engage in any work with you to mitigate.",
  "But they're not. People are asked to pay taxes. Homeowners are asked to pay taxes all the time; development fees, if they want to develop something. People are subject to money exactions all of the time in this society.",
  "So what happens in just -- when the legislature passes a development fee? Are you, now, saying that's subject to Nollan and Dolan, too?",
  "So does that mean that, if the claim in the malpractice action is that the PTO acted unconstitutionally -- assume that set of facts -- how does that change your analysis?",
  "So go back to -- you were going through a list of questions, and I posited let's assume that the malpractice claim does involve a constitutional question.",
  "Then what other factors --",
  "How about fraud on -- a claim of fraud on -- that the malpractice was fraud on the PTO? Lawyer loses that. It's been litigated. Isn't it res judicata, and won't it affect the patent -- or might it not affect the patent in a patent action?",
  "I find that somewhat hard to follow. Let's assume, in adjudicating a medical -- a malpractice claim, the State court finds that the attorney suppressed information. It's a finding of fact. He had this information in his or her file, and they didn't disclose it. I'm not quite sure how the PTO ignores that litigation.",
  "Or the district court doesn’t, if it gets to review that in a later action.",
  "I'm only raising this question to address Justice Scalia's point. You're asking for an absolute rule, and I posited a situation where I think it's not so clear that a State court finding might not have an effect. So do we have to go to your absolute rule?",
  "Then take immigration law.",
  "Don't get in the weeds. Take immigration law.",
  "So patent law cases of malpractice are smaller in number than copyright cases --",
  "Does that make a whole lot of sense?",
  "Well, how about a different one, the one that's being proposed by your adversary --",
  "-- which is define \"substantial\" as to how it affects Federal law, which I think was the bottom line -- or the development of Federal law, the bottom line of Grable. And she says -- you dispute this in your brief -- that it doesn't affect the invalidated patent, that there's no way that a judgment on the malpractice is going to be used in a continuation patent dispute because it's not one of the listed preclusive courts. So how does a ruling affect patent law?",
  "Why is -- who's going to follow it?",
  "Besides the parties --",
  "-- how else does it affect the development of patent law?",
  "Who else is going to follow --",
  "-- this malpractice determination?",
  "So what you're arguing, they're going to make a mistake, and, because we might not accept certiorari, that's binding on everybody else --",
  "-- in the State --",
  "I'm sorry. How does it -- the patent's invalid.",
  "The patent's invalid. Nothing the Court does here is going to change that invalidity. That -- that's what I don't understand.",
  "He's not going to get his patent back from this action.",
  "He's going to get money for losing it, maybe.",
  "So how does it affect the patent?",
  "We're back to that issue. Okay.",
  "Could you answer the one point your adversary raised that -- that gives me pause -- a lot of pause. He says a ruling on patent law of how you should or should not behave in a State malpractice claim will affect all of the lawyers who practice in – in your State because each of them will have to do or not do whatever that malpractice ruling was because that's what the State is going to -- State courts will follow in the future. So it will change those lawyers' behaviors in Federal court.",
  "They are going to present an expert all of the time when they don't need to.",
  "But you can think of an example where -- not perhaps on the facts of this case, but where a State court's ruling could, in fact, establish a -- a code of behavior that's not just belts and suspenders, that's something else.",
  "Mr. Goldstein, could you go back to the question presented?",
  "I have read a lot of briefs in this case, and I don't have any idea what to tell a lower court.",
  "How to articulate the tests or how to apply it.",
  "Given that you started with saying, it's almost impossible to talk about what's jurisdictional and what's an application of jurisdiction. So articulate the test, and tell me what I tell the lower courts.",
  "So that's what the court here did. It looked at the Communications Act. It said, it has the power --",
  "-- to pass regulations with respect to this Act. There is no clear exception. I -- I still haven't quite understood, other than in the academic literature, what the difference between Step Zero and Step One is. And so there is an ambiguity, and, now, the agency is given deference. So where in this conversation is there - -",
  "All right. General, let's go back to the question presented and break down your argument. Is it your position that what the Court asks first is whether Congress has spoken clearly on the agency having authority or not? Is that subject to de novo review?",
  "All right. But tell me what -- what gets deference when and what's subject to de novo review.",
  "So deal with the three cases he mentioned.",
  "General, if the -- if the agency had said reasonable is 30 days, period, and not done what it did, which was create a rebuttable presumption, would that have been appropriate? Would we have had to uphold that? And, if not --",
  "How would we have struck it down? What step --",
  "Counsel, you've argued something slightly different than I took from your briefs. Earlier, in response I think to Justice Ginsburg, you were queueing closer to the Solicitor General's position that this has to be limited in some way. And you said you'll let them establish the boundaries. I don't want to let them establish the boundaries. I want you to tell me, is it criminal law enforcement agents, is it law enforcement agents with -- acting -- as the Ninth Circuit says -- acting within a law enforcement activity? Because I am finding it hard to figure out why we shouldn't permit tort liability on an OSHA inspector, who, in inspecting whatever he or she is inspecting punches someone or does some intentional assaultive act, why they should be permitted to do that. Assuming it falls within the definition of a law enforcement activity.",
  "I think they're saying is arrests, search and seizure, and whatever the third was.",
  "But let's define it more broadly. Let's assume I was willing to define it to include all of the activities that a law enforcement agent would engage in, including protective services, security services, like your officers.",
  "Let's assume that we've defined it more broadly. What's the problem with their position?",
  "And of -- yes, with amicus's or the government's, meaning, instead of limiting it to criminal activity, limited to law enforcement activities broadly defined.",
  "Could you go back and tell me, yet again -- you give a limiting principle, but I'm not sure how it applies. You seem to be saying -- do you agree with your -- with the Petitioner that law enforcement officer includes correction officers?",
  "And why? Because they have all of those other powers, so how is that different from those in the civil area who have similar powers to arrest, search and seize, to --",
  "How about Customs agents?",
  "My problem is park employees I think of as officers when you meet them at the parks. They are guarding the parks.",
  "Or they may also be giving tours. They are usually doing sort of a mixture of --",
  "-- duties.",
  "Let's assume we adopted the definition Justice Scalia just proposed, law enforcement officer engaged in law enforcement activities. Would correction officers be engaged in law enforcement activities?",
  "Well, you can look at it both ways. Are correction officers as officers who are protecting or securing prisoners, are they acting in a law enforcement capacity in your -- forget about what act, what tort they commit, but do they function --",
  "Okay.",
  "I'm sorry. What -- what is it about a corrections officer other than the act that was committed here, which was an alleged sexual act which nobody could, except by some definition of State law, think that that ever happens naturally in the course. But that's an intentional assault. The very definition of the crimes that are covered assumes that it's not an act that's licensed. So, why isn't the correction officer acting in a law enforcement capacity when he's restraining people and securing them?",
  "Well, what happens -- what happens in the police precinct when police officers are holding pretrial detainees? Are they acting as police officers or as security people? Or even when a prisoner comes back to court for a court appearance and there are U.S. marshals who guard them rather than correction officers, what are they serving as in your mind?",
  "The one other advantage of your definition is that it takes us out of workplace fights between two employees, because presumably the officers who punch each other out, if that incident occurs, aren't acting in a law enforcement capacity. I am assuming that is part of your argument as well.",
  "All right. Then it goes back to the question I asked one of your adversaries, which is all of this depends on how broadly or narrowly we define law enforcement activities. If we take it as broadly as the Government is suggesting, at moments, it would -- we could very well say, you are right, it's a law enforcement activity, but not as narrowly as some would have it be. It would include securing or detaining people, or securing or detaining people. And it would include the Park Service person who stops a visitor and punches them out. It would include the military personnel who stops someone and does an intentional tort against them, even though they may just be walking on the grounds rather than serving as security that particular day. So the point is, why should we give it the narrow reading you are giving, and not the broader reading the Government seems to be suggesting?",
  "What's the difference between the officer who punches the prisoner to get him on the ground and pick him up? Would it apply to the officer who files an arrest complaint against the prisoner, and not to the security officer who just merely carries him back to his cell?",
  "Or does some physical injury that's substantial. So the intentional assault gets treated as an exception to this only when the security officer actually files an arrest complaint? Or would it at all?",
  "Yes.",
  "I'm sorry. The Exhaustion Doctrine permits you to use the good that you buy. It never permits you to make another item from that item you bought. So that's what I think Justice Breyer is saying, which is you can use the seed, you can plant it, but what you can't do is use its progeny unless you are licensed to because its progeny is a new item.",
  "Do you mean they don't do any work, they don't lay the soil and the nutrients it needs, water when it needs watering, protect it from animals? They do no work --",
  "-- in growing the seed?",
  "I'm sure if they don't do all of the things I said, it doesn't grow. So aren't they involved in its creative -- in its creation?",
  "Just so I can follow your -- just so I can follow your answer, Monsanto sells the seed to the farmer. And you are saying if the farmer grows the seed, he can sell it to anybody he wants, right?",
  "Mr. Waxman, I want to go back to Justice Breyer's question and reformulate it as a different question, with I think the same answer --",
  "-- but I just want to make sure you and the government are exactly on the same page. Both of you are suggesting, I think -- that was Ms. Sherry's last response -- that we were explicit enough in Quanta and we don't have to address whatever lingering confusion the Federal Circuit may have with respect to conditional sales at all in this case?",
  "You're -- you're telling us we don't need to reach that prong and we shouldn't.",
  "I understand we don't need to, but the question is should we? Is there a need --",
  "-- generally in -- in clarifying some lingering confusion?",
  "Actually then you do have a different position than the government does.",
  "Simplifying this case, you can't take the person who's been given the vaccine and take vials of their blood and keep selling it? Is that your --",
  "Counsel, I'm having -­",
  "Counsel, I'm -- I -­ there is underlying your argument a sort of fundamental belief that you are entitled to relief -- pardon the alliteration -- simply because the statute discriminates between citizens and noncitizens. Is that your position?",
  "So if it's not, what are the two rights that you -- or what rights are it that you're claiming have been violated? You say privileges and immunities. What's the privilege or immunity?",
  "So is this -- is this an as-applied challenge to the -­",
  "All right. MR.",
  "So this is an as-applied challenge?",
  "I -- I'm having a problem, and then I think it's Justice Ginsburg's problem, which is, absent the statute, he can't demand that Virginia provide him with this information because that's how he wants to work, correct? So what's the added value that gives him a right to demand it merely because a statute exists? He doesn't have a right to the information.",
  "Could I -- I'm still trying to tease out what your claim is. Let's suppose Virginia passes a statute that says, We'll let nonresidents have access, but they have to pay all the costs. Nonresidents don't. Would that satisfy you as valid?",
  "Why isn't it just -- you just being costs them more?",
  "That was Justice Ginsburg's point, which is every time you've put in a request, you're costing them more money.",
  "Well, why? You were costing them more.",
  "I'm not sure how you save administrative costs under this statute. They could go to any Virginia resident, it's not illegal, and probably will, it'll cost them something more, but not you, and get the very same information. So how do you justify this discrimination? Because it's so easily -- the administrative cost is going to be imposed anyway.",
  "So you want to give more businesses to Virginia citizens who will now charge out-of-State residents money to process their FOIA requests?",
  "You keep making that argument. But you don't stop residents for asking for the information from someone else. I mean, that's one of the points of your law, which is they can hire a Virginia resident to get it for them. Most of the big people are doing that already. So you're not saving any money if they can get the information simply by paying someone in Virginia to get it for them.",
  "It's only in his Privileges and Immunities Clause claim. MR.",
  "He claims that the dormant Commerce Clause has been effected because he reads this statute as saying only Virginia recording companies have access; out-of-State can't. And it's a fair reading of the statute. It only permits Virginia residents, which include commercial and noncommercial, to access the information. So assume, hypothetically, that the statute reads \"only Virginia commercial businesses have access to this information\" -­",
  "Well, that's the question I'm -- I'm raising the best argument for your adversary, okay?",
  "Because we could call it a direct -- he calls it direct discrimination because commercial businesses are being permitted in Virginia, but not noncommercial. You say it's indirect. How do we draw the line between direct and indirect, when the bottom-line consequence is the same?",
  "So why doesn't the dormant Commerce Clause affect the hypothetical I laid out? Because, directly, this permits Virginia commercial businesses to get something that out-of-Staters can't. The State is putting this instrument into commerce. You say, I don't know that. But make the assumption that we think the record's clear enough on that point. I know you want to fight me on that, but it's hard -- it's a fight with no legs because you have to know that commercial enterprises in Virginia seek these records.",
  "Tell us, under our jurisprudence -- the dormant Common Commerce jurisprudence -- and I have some colleagues who don't -- who don't believe it should exist. Take that argument out. Why is this not a dormant Commerce Clause case?",
  "See, I have a problem with this argument because it assumes a way of looking at this, but it's an assumption. You can look at it in either way. You can look at it as they made too much money, we want a part of that profit, or they paid too little for what they got. And that was the debate going on in Congress. Did they pay too little on the floatation value? Or did they make too much money? And what the government says -- rightly -- is whether you paid too much or too little money depends on the value of the company. And one of the factors that goes into that is how much money has the company made? And so you always have to look at profits, to some extent. So what's wrong with looking at it their way? Why does it have to be your way?",
  "No, you can only do it your way if you do what the amici says, which is to take out from your simplified equation the fact that the time -- the D element of your equation -- is constant. You artificially freeze it the time at which they operated. Only by freezing that number can you come out with your equation.",
  "But there was at least two or three companies that had a very different period, and they paid a huge amount, much further than their gross profits.",
  "Because of that, D changed for them.",
  "But you change the other part of the equation -- or of the tax regulation, which says it has to be true for all taxpayers.",
  "My fear is, as warned by the government and the tax professors, that the rule you want us to announce to help you win is to say anytime a tax uses estimates of profits, no matter how it does it, it is credible -- creditable. That's the rule you want.",
  "So why isn't that to say I want to find the original floatation value, and, instead of estimating what the profits are, I'm simply going to use the ones that happen?",
  "So why is that different?",
  "Well, there -- there is an argument about that because it has two components that you keep ignoring, the floatation value and the time that the company --",
  "The problem with their argument, Mr. Clement, is that you are undermining your own argument. If they are getting three full years at a lesser tax, it's because their floatation value was made more equal by this formula.",
  "So they don't need to be taxed any more, moving forward, because they got it right.",
  "Let's go back to my initial question. What's the rule? If someone uses your actual profits in any way, it's a credit that they are entitled to?",
  "Well, I don't know how you get around it because you seem to be saying to us that, no matter how -- what formula you create, so long as we can simplify it in math to affect which -- take any variables in it and fix them in any way, that's a creditable tax. That seems to be what your argument is.",
  "No, I'm saying to you that any tax that relies upon actual profits, in any way, you say is wrong.",
  "No, the floatation value is not fixed. It was different for each company.",
  "They only fixed the percentage that they're going to use, but the actual amount paid was different for every company.",
  "I mean, could you -- I'm sorry.",
  "So you are accepting the position the government made in PPL v. Exxon. You're not disavowing the position you took there?",
  "Counsel, I don't know that you've answered Justice Ginsburg's question, and so I'm going to take it up because it interests me. Let's assume, as she did in her hypothetical, that a State says -- doesn't have any case law like Texas does, that says, we prefer you to go that way, for non-record-based claims. Is the difference between that hypothetical State that says, you can do either, and the Texas situation, is that Texas, in your mind, puts up procedural impediments to using the direct appeal mechanism and so that, if the other State hasn't done that, has made the development of evidence, has provided a full opportunity for you to develop a record before the direct appeal is over with, that State wouldn't be subject to Martinez, and Texas is subject to it only because it has the procedural impediments?",
  "Counsel, you -- you started to answer this question, but it is something raised by many of the amici opposing your position, which is that, by adopting your position, we're essentially having to examine the 49-plus -- because we have territories that have collateral and direct review as well -- plus systems to see which apply -- to which Martinez applies and which -- to which Martinez doesn't apply. And so the question is: How do we write this to sort of give enough guidance, so that we're not examining each of the 49 -- or 49 systems -- or maybe 48, after we've decided Martinez?",
  "And -- and why should we not fear that outcome?",
  "Could you just please --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Let me understand what you are suggesting. Counsel doesn't have a record. He or she is newly appointed. Can they go into court and say, I don't know if there is an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, but I need to protect my client and abate this hearing now, until I get the trial record, whether it takes 6 months, 7 months, or a year. What will the court do with its rule that requires counsel to provide affidavits setting forth the good-faith basis for a claim?",
  "How many were given an indefinite stay until they got the trial record to set forth the affidavits?",
  "So what do you do with the 75-day rule, which I think is absolute, which says, if the court hasn't ruled on the new trial within 75 days, the matter ends?",
  "Some of them have the information, and some don't.",
  "All right. So --",
  "The guys who do it, it's because they have the information, and so they've exhausted their claim. But we are talking about the people who don't.",
  "That assumes you get the transcript.",
  "No, the 75 days has passed.",
  "Even if you haven't made the new trial motion within the 30 days, initially?",
  "Can I -- can I go back to what you are proposing, okay, and what you are saying this system stands for? If an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is brought on direct appeal, with or without a record -- court says, we don't have a record, it throws it into collateral review, as I have seen it do dozens of times -- are you saying, in that situation, that Martinez applies? Counsel raised it, but was told, we're not going to decide it. Puts them into collateral review. Does Martinez apply there?",
  "No, forget it -- that -- when it happens?",
  "Okay. So they haven't gotten a full and fair opportunity because they’ve presented their case, but Texas has said, we don't want to do it here, do it there. You are still saying Martinez doesn't apply?",
  "So because it can, but Texas chose not to, now there's no protection, there is no full and fair opportunity for the petitioner to have had that claim adjudicated? That's really the end result of what you're saying.",
  "You raised it, and the State said, well, go to collateral review. You're saying, no -- no Martinez protection?",
  "Your counsel was ineffective in habeas in that -- in State habeas, you -- you can do nothing about it.",
  "That's not quite what he's saying. We've had a miscarriage of justice exception for as long as there's been a habeas statute. We've applied it repeatedly. It's not that it trumps it, but that it puts into doubt the evidence you're claiming, proves your actual innocence. It's not the sort of situation where, as reasonable -- as due diligence will do, which is to override even an actually innocent person.",
  "What he says is it -- it really puts into question the validity of your claim.",
  "Where does that leave us?",
  "Let's assume --",
  "It's sort of an advisory opinion, in your judgment.",
  "Sure, it would be because you're telling us that there is no proof of actual innocence.",
  "So why don't we just say that?",
  "It might be its holding, but, as Justice Alito just proved, there's no basis for it because they didn't grant a COA on the substantive merits question.",
  "But that was with respect to successive petitions.",
  "You don't see a difference -­",
  "I'm sorry. I don't understand. I mean, there is a presumption that's been longstanding that, at least with respect to the filing of your first petition, that it is a statute of limitations subject to exceptions, including the manifest injustice one. It would seem to me that if they intended not to have that apply, they would have done what they did with the successive petition, but they chose not to.",
  "I'm not talking about that presumption.",
  "What I'm talking about --",
  "-- are cause and effect and manifest injustice.",
  "Do you have any idea how many actual innocence claims win on the underlying constitutional issue?",
  "How many wins on the attempt?",
  "Not many.",
  "Why -- why is it that the meritorious claim is going to be the one that's going to be hidden?",
  "Meaning --",
  "But you would -- you want to keep it out altogether.",
  "You want an actually -- potentially actually innocent person not to have --",
  "But they don't have the Federal system.",
  "As the first habeas.",
  "Counsel, I see --",
  "Counsel --",
  "Counsel --",
  "The --",
  "But there has --",
  "But there has always been a laches defense until Rule 9(a) was rescinded.",
  "All right. So there's been some form -- not of due diligence, but some form of check on a prisoner waiting so long that a State can't respond, the -- Justice Breyer's hypothetical. So he's asking you, I think, to tell us how to write it. So do we write it by saying there's no diligence requirement -- but there is a sort of common law laches, although that's a hard argument to make because it was based on 9(a) until recently. Or do we just say it's equity, and equity would suggest that, if it's contrived -- the delay is contrived, that the evidence is suspect and doesn't -- and shouldn't be credited.",
  "And I'm having a hard time understanding the bail argument because, in my time, most bail decisions were made at the time of arrest. And, here, the arrest was in April, and the results didn't come up until August.",
  "And, yet, he was detained anyway, correct?",
  "And -- and there might be a case where someone's gotten out, but it would be the rare case.",
  "It's -- you don't use it routinely for the bail determination.",
  "Well, that doesn't include the time to collect the sample, send it to you, or the time to do the match. It's just to do the genome rapid, correct?",
  "All right. So, now, I see two lines of cases, okay? The Fourth Amendment, which says you can't do a search without a warrant and probable cause, and Samson, and most of your brief argument was based on Samson. As I read Samson, it was the special relationship between the parolee or the probationary person, that line of cases, and the assumption being that they're out in the world, I think, by the largesse of the State. So the State has a right to search their home, just as it would their cell, essentially. Why is that true for an arrestee? What about -- what creates this special relationship that permits you to intrude, search their home, search their car, search their person, to solve other cases?",
  "Because you're going to have to tell me why searching their person is different than searching their home or car.",
  "There's no other case, but Samson, in that line that permits searches on this balancing.",
  "So what I want to know is what's the legal theory now? How far do we let the State go each time it has some form of custody over you, in schools, in workplaces, wherever else the State has control over your person?",
  "That doesn't explain why you can't go into his home.",
  "I mean -- you know, if the whole issue is how dangerous is he, you should be able to go into his home, into his car, to any place he has visited, to just sort of run rampant in his life to make sure that he is not a bail risk.",
  "But you are because what you are saying really is law enforcement need, alone, without any suspicion whatsoever of another crime, permits you to take this information from the person and use it.",
  "The key principle is the Fourth Amendment --",
  "Can we go back to --",
  "Counsel, I -- I am really worried about the question you haven't satisfied me with, which is I agree completely that, today, it's used primarily and almost exclusively for purposes of solving other crimes. But let's -- is this -- the question that I think one of my colleagues asked, is that only because technology hasn't moved fast enough? You said we have to look at the constitutional principles 5 years from now, when they will use it to pull up a guy's criminal history, not unsolved crimes, but criminal history. Get to that day.",
  "Tell me what the -- tell me what the -- why you would then say that would still be unconstitutional?",
  "Right. Let's assume we go under a normal Fourth Amendment, you need probable cause to search.",
  "I was interested in a broader thought process, actually. Do you mind giving it to me?",
  "Which is, there is something inherently dangerous about DNA collection that is not the same as fingerprinting.",
  "Is that what your definition of legal consequence is?",
  "Well, so you're taking -- you're disagreeing with the proposition of our older cases that to -- for there to be an ex post facto violation, you have to have a legal consequence.",
  "Well, there's a -- there's a disconnect for me. Yes, I do accept that the district courts have to consider the guidelines. But how do you tie that to the requirement that the punishment has to be tied to the guidelines?",
  "You're assuming that's changed over time.",
  "It wasn't.",
  "Can you just tell me the narrow rule that you would propose --",
  "-- getting back to Justice Scalia --",
  "-- which is procedures-change risks. Having a victim testify at sentences -- at a sentence is likely, if you examined it statistically, to increase -- increase the sentence. So assume that's the set of hypotheticals. You change it; now, victims can. Why is that not -- or is it an ex post facto change?",
  "So why is this not procedural?",
  "Give me the rule where I can draw a line between those changes that are permissible and those that are not, not the general statement you're making because both increase the risk of a higher sentence.",
  "So it can't be that.",
  "You're answering me differently now?",
  "You're answering me differently? I posed exactly the question that Justice Scalia --",
  "I said the sentencing -- the assumptions I made were the sentencing law changes, victims must testify, judges must consider what they say, and, after 5 years, it's proven that, when victims speak, the sentences are higher. Is that a substantive or a procedural law?",
  "But I'm asking you to draw it. So tell me, what's the rule? Do you want something as broad that says even that kind of change can be an ex post facto? And, if you don't, articulate how I draw the line.",
  "What does that mean to you? The number of years in jail?",
  "Is that as limited as you want it to be?",
  "Well, we know that's Miller.",
  "This is not Miller.",
  "Have you had -- are you aware of any circuit court case, in recent time, where a circuit has reversed the lower range than the guideline, basically because the deviation from the guideline was unreasonable?",
  "Why are you fighting this proposition? If the starting point doesn't matter, why didn't you stick to your old position, that judges should start from the old one and simply consider the new one? Why this whole Supreme Court case?",
  "Practically speaking, do you believe it makes no difference?",
  "What is the reason that miscalculating a guideline is considered a procedural error?",
  "That begs the question. Obviously, if we hold it's a procedural error to miscalculate the guidelines, using the guidelines has some significant importance in the process.",
  "You know, there is a lot of dispute, now, about the child pornography sentences. Let's assume -- and this goes back to Justice Breyer's question -- a judge comes in and says, I know child pornography is criminal, but I don't think what the guidelines are imposing are fair, to any defendant, so 10 days in jail. Why would that be substantively unreasonable?",
  "No, I'm giving you exactly what the judge says. You don't think that the appellate court would say that's substantively unreasonable because it's not giving due deference to the Commission's assessment of the seriousness of this crime?",
  "May I ask you a question? Assuming I accept your premise, and there's some question about that, that some portions of the South have changed, your county pretty much hasn't.",
  "In -- in the period we're talking about, it has many more discriminating -- 240 discriminatory voting laws that were blocked by Section 5 objections. There were numerous remedied by Section 2 litigation. You may be the wrong party bringing this.",
  "But that's the standard. And why would we vote in favor of a county whose record is the epitome of what caused the passage of this law to start with?",
  "But facial challenges are generally disfavored in our law. And so the question becomes, why do we strike down a formula, as Justice Kagan said, which under any circumstance the record shows the remedy would be congruent, proportional, rational, whatever standard of review we apply, its application to Alabama would happen.",
  "Interestingly enough, in Katzenbach the Court didn't do what you're asking us to do, which is to look at the record of all the other States or all of the other counties. It basically concentrated on the record of the two litigants in the case, and from that extrapolate -- extrapolated more broadly.",
  "You're asking us to do something, which is to ignore your record and look at everybody else's.",
  "The problem with those hypotheticals is obvious that it starts from a predicate that the application has no basis in any record, but there's no question that Alabama was rightly included in the original Voting Rights Act. There's no challenge to the reauthorization acts. The only question is whether a formula should be applied today. And the point is that the record is replete with evidence to show that you should.",
  "It's not like there's some made-up reason for why the $1,000 is being applied to you or why a different crime is going to be charged against you. It's a real record as to what Alabama has done to earn its place on the list.",
  "Counsel, the reason Section 5 was created was because States were moving faster than litigation permitted to catch the new forms of discriminatory practices that were being developed. As the courts struck down one form, the States would find another. And basically, Justice Ginsburg calls it secondary. I don't know that I'd call anything secondary or primary. Discrimination is discrimination. And what Congress said is it continues, not in terms of voter numbers, but in terms of examples of other ways to disenfranchise voters, like moving a voting booth from a convenient location for all voters to a place that historically has been known for discrimination. I think that's an example taken from one of the Section 2 and 5 cases from Alabama.",
  "I mean, I don't know what the difference is except that this Court or some may think that secondary is not important. But the form of discrimination is still discrimination if Congress has found it to be so.",
  "But that's not --",
  "-- what it did with Section 5. It said we can't keep up with the way States are doing it.",
  "It was on voter dilution as well. It had already evolved away from that, or started to.",
  "Counsel, are you --",
  "Why? Why does Congress have to fix any problem immediately?",
  "I'm going to have a hard time with that because you can't be suggesting that the government sees a problem in one or more States and decides it's going to do something for them and not for others, like emergency relief, and that that somehow violates the equal footing doctrine. You can't treat States the same because their problems are different, their populations are different, their needs are different. Everything is different about the States.",
  "Would you tell me what you think is left of the rational means test in Katzenbach and City of Rome? Do you think the City of Boerne now controls both Fourteen -- the Fourteenth and the Fifteenth Amendment and how we look at any case that arises under them?",
  "Counsel, in the reauthorization --",
  "Do you think that the right to vote is a racial entitlement in Section 5?",
  "I asked a different question. Do you think Section 5 was voted for because it was a racial entitlement?",
  "Do you think there was no basis to find that --",
  "Do you think that racial discrimination in voting has ended, that there is none anywhere?",
  "But shouldn't --",
  "You've given me some statistics that Alabama hasn't, but there are others that are very compelling that it has. Why should we make the judgment, and not Congress, about the types and forms of discrimination and the need to remedy them?",
  "How many other States have 240 successful Section 2 and Section 5 --",
  "Their preference is that they wanted a piece of the action. They still do. They want the profits from that investment. Whether they're entitled to it is a different issue, but --",
  "My problem is the following, which is let's assume he had taken the money and lost it and he never repaid it. What does it matter whether he thought he could take the money or not? I thought the very basic definition of defalcation in every dictionary of the time and forever, one of the three definitions has always been that you cause a loss to the -- to the trust. Why does mental state matter at all, is my bottom line? I think that your stronger argument is that loss to the estate, or the one that you have to -- can direct your attention to, is what is the loss to the trust? But what does it matter whether I intended to lose it or not if I wasn't entitled to lose it?",
  "Well, that's Justice Breyer's point, which is if you took the money and lost it, what does it matter? You took it. Unless -- unless you were drugged and didn't know that you were taking the money and somebody else forced you to in some -- under some sort of duress defense, some outrageous question, isn't the issue the one that Justice Breyer came to? If you're a fiduciary, why should an excuse of ignorance of the law ever save you when you are required to exercise the highest protection of the trust?",
  "Why should you be discharged if you took -- if you knowingly did an act, the actus reus --",
  "-- with its concomitant mental state. You intended to take the money.",
  "Counsel, give me your best answer to the rule that we should write, okay? Forgetting that I don't accept that you need a mental state, okay? Let's go to just the loss issue. If I agree with you that you need to prove the loss, this is a very unusual trust because the measure of what the trust's res should be is fixed. It was the amount of the trust plus the fixed interest, essentially. This is a very unusual trust. In the norm, the trust just says to the trustee invest prudently. And the trustee self-deals by taking the res out, puts the investment in his or her own name and takes the profit. In that situation, how would you measure the loss? In the normal self-dealing where the trustee just has to invest prudently and is depriving the trust of that investment value, would you say in that situation that the loss is measured by the lost opportunity?",
  "Because there is a difference between what the trust loses and the gain that the trustee makes, which under normal trust principles the gain has to be disgorged. Are you separating out those two things and how are you separating them out and how would I -- how would we write -- the Court write this opinion to give loss meaning? What's the -- what's the meaning you want to give it?",
  "So under your theory, the profit to the trustee is never a measurement.",
  "Assume that that is distasteful because for all the reasons the government argues in its amicus brief, the idea that a trustee could self-deal is the height of a breach of fiduciary duty. So give me something that -- that would win your case without upsetting the fact that defalcation somehow should, in the norm, include something as egregious as self-dealing. You don't think your guy did because he didn't know, but let's assume the worst case, the guy knew.",
  "What does it matter if the money is missing? What does it matter the reason why in terms of recklessness or intent? You took the money. Justice Breyer and I both agree you intended to take the money. So why are you adopting the need for recklessness, unless you're trying to avoid the second component that the other side's talking about, which is that you caused a loss to the trust? Because that's where you have a problem here, where you have a problem because there really is no loss to the trust in a traditional sense.",
  "Well, the problem is that, yes, there was a breach of the trust. But in terms of the terms of the trust, the trust got every penny that it would have earned if the money had not been taken. It got the trust plus the fixed 6 percent that the trust was entitled to. So it suffered no loss in its traditional sense.",
  "So are we fighting about the meaning of loss? That's really the question.",
  "Are we fighting about what loss means?",
  "But he did. This is the unusual part of this trust, which is that by the terms of this trust, it was only going to grow at principal plus a fixed interest. Most trusts are not written this way. This is the highly unusual trust, where it never -- should have made more money because taking the Chief Justice's hypothetical, which is he had invested it and just gotten the interest due, why would there be a defalcation? What's the loss opportunity or the loss that you would have suffered?",
  "Yes. But let's assume a different fact scenario, that he didn't make $250,000, that he happened to make just the amount of the interest required, and he paid all of that back just as he did here, what would have been the defalcation under the Chief Justice's hypothetical?",
  "I've never heard of a defalcation that didn't result in some monetary loss. What would have been the monetary loss in the Chief's hypothetical?",
  "Would you just repeat what you said? Your voice turned.",
  "That's what I understood. So you're saying that that is not the case?",
  "But there is two components of the award, the attorney's fees plus the $250,000 profit. And you're representing to me right now that, as a trustee, he was entitled to invest that fund for the trust? And so there was a lost opportunity here as well?",
  "Is it your position that he couldn't have invested this? Let's assume that he knew -- that he knew.",
  "As a trustee for the trust.",
  "Okay. Then you may be losing this case.",
  "Because if he could invest it for the trust, why isn't the loss -- isn't it a loss for the trust that he took this opportunity away from the trust?",
  "Let's assume he could have.",
  "Then why isn't the loss of opportunity?",
  "Let's assume his argument that he could.",
  "Then we have to go back to -- to the first issue, whether a mental state is required or not.",
  "If I see the purpose of the NVRA to simplify registration --",
  "-- how is Arizona's provisions consistent with that objective and purpose?",
  "Given that some of the amici explain that many people don't have the documents that Arizona requires?",
  "Well, but why does one take precedence over another?",
  "So, if something you do conflicts with one of those purposes, why isn't it preempted by the Federal law?",
  "Why would you think that Congress, in doing the short form registration, didn't consider the issue of fraud, and decide that it had arrived at the balance it wanted?",
  "I have a -- I have a hugely great difficulty, which is, the NVRA says that people can mail in this form.",
  "I don't know how your rejection of the mail-in, how you're accepting and using it when you're refusing to register someone when they do exactly what the Federal law permits them to do: Mail it in. There -- there's -- I don't -- I have a real big disconnect with how you can be saying you're accepting and using, when you're not registering people, when they use it the way the Federal law permits them to.",
  "Some of us have -- do believe in legislative history. Some of my colleagues don't.",
  "All right. But at least one of --",
  "Did he point to himself? One of the concurring judges below said that he found the statute ambiguous, but that with the legislative history there just could be no conclusion, but that Congress rejected your reading. Legislation history is very clear that this issue of what States could add to the form was raised and permission to do so was proposed explicitly and rejected. How do you -- assuming that I believe in legislative history, don't argue to me that I shouldn't, okay?",
  "How do you get around that?",
  "General --",
  "-- I'm still having a problem.",
  "Both the Federal law and the State law require an individual to be a citizen.",
  "That's the basic qualification.",
  "Both agree that that's essential.",
  "How do you fit in the question of what documents you use to prove that with establishing the qualification? Meaning citizenship, you either have it or you don't. That's why the Federal form says are you or aren't you.",
  "So there's -- that qualification has been set by Arizona and the Federal system.",
  "Counsel, you have proof, there are people that you have rejected, even without these forms?",
  "Well, that's what the Federal system decided was enough.",
  "Well, you admit that it doesn't let you add things. You have to accept and use that form.",
  "I go back to Justice Kagan. If you don't have a driver's license to put a number down --",
  "-- this list of things says you have to append to the form other items: A copy of your birth certificate, a copy of your naturalization certificate. Why isn't that just creating another form?",
  "Ms. Millett, I want to give up --",
  "So tell me, is -- is it now your position, and it seems to be, that any time the FDA approves a product that there can never be a tort liability claim because the FDA's approval is now the ceiling of what you can do?",
  "They approve nonprescription drugs. They approve a lot of things.",
  "But that's not true with respect to the active ingredients. An active ingredient requires a new FDA approval process.",
  "But -- but we came back to the same point, which is -- and we are sort of dancing around the argument -- which is what happens with a truly dangerous drug, and we can posit one, that has nothing to do with a warning of whether it's adequate or not, but a drug that on its face no reasonable practitioner -- I'm going to the restatement third formulation -- no reasonable practitioner, knowing all the benefits and risks, would ever prescribe this drug. Because your adversary basically took that position at trial.",
  "It doesn't matter -- there were other, safer, one-molecule drugs, no one should have prescribed this, no matter what the label.",
  "We can argue. But let's go to the point I raised, which is, I think what you are arguing now is that no truly bad drug, that shouldn't be on the market, would there ever be a tort claim that anybody could bring --",
  "-- because the FDA approved it.",
  "So what tort claim could they bring?",
  "Both, against, the brand could manufacture and the generic.",
  "How? The FDA approved the design.",
  "And they couldn't change it without FDA approval.",
  "Isn't there a First Circuit --",
  "So without the preemption clause, actually, with an express saving clause, you're arguing essentially complete field preemption. You're basically saying the minute that the FDA gives you permission to sell, it's a right to sell. And -- and it can't be altered by any State police power.",
  "Well, I don't see how you're not saying that.",
  "But that's your -- you're telling me that's exactly what the FDA is saying. You're saying there is no such thing.",
  "And there's no strict liability that a State could impose.",
  "This applies to everything that requires FDA approval, or is this a prescription drug-only rule?",
  "Just -- just to -- because my memory is failing me, is this drug still on the market?",
  "All right. And is it on the market with a different label?",
  "Is your point in this case that obstacle preemption has been waived?",
  "Or were you granted cert just on impossibility?",
  "Mr. Horwich --",
  "That sounds like a jurisdictional argument to me. But I understand the government to be conceding that this statute of limitations is not jurisdictional. It's just a claim processing move.",
  "Assume I accept --",
  "I totally lost that answer.",
  "Could you -- could you go back and talk to me again about what you mean about not having a record?",
  "I'm totally confused. Are you suggesting that the record shouldn't be filed in that case or that the record supports the conclusion that it was untimely? Or neither?",
  "Excuse me. Could you -- could you -- there seems to be a confusion in this consequence conversation. You seem to be assuming that the attorneys' fee award on good faith basis has to do with the ultimate merits, did the vaccine cause this injury? I would have assumed that the award of attorneys' fees has to do with whether the petition was brought in good faith; i.e., was there a reasonable basis to believe that the petition was timely? And on that issue, before the Court can adjudicate the timeliness question, it has to know all of the facts that made the Petitioner believe it was timely. And so I'm a little bit confused as to what additional factfinding the Court has to do. It has to be told by a lawyer, your cases say because reasonable basis has to be in fact and law. The law says first symptom. She experienced X, Y, and Z, and we thought the latter was the starting point of the statute, not the former. What more does the Special Master need to know to adjudicate whether that's in good faith, that belief is in good faith?",
  "Now, I understand.",
  "So how do you answer the argument about a shadow trial?",
  "How were the records accumulated and when?",
  "How were the records accumulated and when?",
  "So is your bottom line that the record is already there for the shadow determination?",
  "They are arguing that they don't need to, and why should be -- why should they be put to the burden of doing that?",
  "Do you have any idea from the cases what the ranges are?",
  "For rates.",
  "I know that civil rights rates, for example, are far below market rates for most law firms. Is that the same for this, or is it market rates generally?",
  "Market rates for general litigation.",
  "Right.",
  "Do you have some evidence -- numbers -- to tell us how complicated the fee award disputes are generally -- putting aside because it hasn't until recently been an issue for cases dismissed -- but for other cases, particularly those dismissed on -- other procedural grounds.",
  "But there have been dismissals on other procedural grounds.",
  "Could I -- could I just stop you on a factual matter --",
  "-- because it has confused me. As I look at the captions of the cases, there appear to be two different partnerships: One partnership, known as Raisin -- doing business as Raisin Valley Farms, has Mr. Horne and his wife as the partners. Larsen Valley, the producer -- not the producer, the handler -- has four other, the Hornes, plus two other people. So who owns the raisins? Isn't that the first partnership of the husband and wife? And isn't the handler a second partnership that does the business of handling?",
  "But the estates have been substituted.",
  "So isn't it two legal entities, one who owns and one who handles? One partnership produces, one partnership handles?",
  "Well, I don't care if they did or they didn't. I mean, we should know. Are they two separate legal entities? One who produces --",
  "Well, that's -- you know, in the cat -- you get some limited liability by creating separate entities, so the creature who owns is one partnership, and the -- and the entity that produces, that handles, is a second one.",
  "Well, it does to my mind because what is the claim, assuming that the producer owns -- the producer entity owns the raisins. What exactly is being taken from the handlers? Is it the percentage -- it can't be the raisins because they don't own them.",
  "What -- what do they own?",
  "What is it that's being taken from the handler entity?",
  "All right. So go back. What is the -- what was taken from them -- you're saying it's just the fine, that the fine is a taking or -- what was the interest that they're claiming was taken by the government? They didn't own the raisins, so they get paid a fee for handling.",
  "But the problem is that they weren't entitled to that money. Meaning they had to pay it over to the producer. The producer was going to pay them a handling fee, but that money didn't belong to them. It belonged to the producers who supplied them with the raisins and expected payment for them --",
  "-- if they were sold in the ordinary course.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "In the Horne model, the handlers buy -- buy the free raisins and then pay the producers, is that what it --",
  "Oh, so that's the difference in this model, they don't take title to the raisins is what you're saying?",
  "All right. Let me -- let me --",
  "What is -- what is the value in permitting a party who doesn't own property to raise a taking claim on behalf of other people? Meaning, doesn't the system have an interest in ensuring that people comply with their legal obligations, and to the extent that you choose to violate the law the way they have here, that the fine is punitive and not compensatory. Meaning, you don't own the raisins, but you were obligated to put raisins aside for someone else. You were their agent and you failed to meet a government obligation that was independently on you.",
  "So I go back to my question: What was the taking? Since you didn't own the raisins, the taking is the fine is what you want to call the taking.",
  "But they're not your raisins. They’re not your raisins.",
  "Mr. McConnell, in -- in -- if the producers had decided to challenge this as a Tucker Act violation, they would have had to hand over the raisins? Or could they have just held on to the raisins and said, I'm not handing it over until I get just compensation?",
  "All right.",
  "Well, the point is that under a normal takings claim, you have to hand over your property, you've lost the value, and you want the government to pay it back to you, correct?",
  "Excuse me. Can I --",
  "All right. It almost seems to me, and I'll ask Mr. McConnell when he gets up at rebuttal, that there is some sort of due process challenge going on here that's been created by the labels they did in this new situation -- in this new business venture. In the normal situation, the handler, I'm being told, would actually have title to the raisins, and they would pay the producers for the raisins. So there would be property taking. In that situation, where the handlers actually own the property, would they be able to raise a taking defense?",
  "So they are missing a business opportunity because they can't take title to those raisins. And yet you're asking --",
  "This really does sound to me -- and I think that both Justice Scalia and Breyer now are being more and more convinced -- there has to be a place to challenge this scheme.",
  "Whether it's a taking -- whether there's a takings claim for the handler because the handler is being asked to do things --",
  "The short answer is, yes, reach the merits only if I win. That -- that's really what you want us to do.",
  "No, no, no. I need to ask you this question because do you want us to reach the merits if we're going to have you lose? You got to want one or the other. Do you want us to reach the merits, period, is really the question?",
  "Do you think we should reach the merits, which is a very different question?",
  "Only if you win, right?",
  "Well, they've conceded that it doesn't apply to handlers.",
  "Yes, and so they've conceded there is no --",
  "Not payment over towing, payment over storage.",
  "If this was a consensual contract, he asked -- Justice Scalia's question. They contracted for the tow. What State laws would be preempted under the FAAAA with respect to that private contract? Would there be any?",
  "How about, do consumer fraud laws apply to that contract between the parties?",
  "That's the basis of his claim here.",
  "Ah, so you're arguing that those laws would be preempted.",
  "That gets back to whether the services include storage, which is what the New Hampshire court said it doesn't.",
  "That the movement of property or towing doesn't include services for storage.",
  "So why don't you answer that question? As I read the list of things that are preempted, they have to do with storage during transportation. Why should we read it more broadly than that?",
  "Exactly.",
  "That's your problem, which is, what is it directed to? And that's the real issue in this case. Yes, it's preempted with respect to any towing activity. The issue is, is it -- is it preempted, as the New Hampshire court, said to storage and sale?",
  "How do we draw the line, that line that you just asked us to draw between direct and indirect? How do we articulate that line?",
  "Because now you're -- now you're articulating a different line. You are saying this -- the hypothetical that Justice Kagan posited is not storage-related, it is something else-related. It's towing-related. What's the difference?",
  "I think that Justice Breyer is -- I may be speaking for him -- he's thinking that that State contract or that State regulation that permits towing companies to do this is preempted in some way. That would be his argument because it affects --",
  "No?",
  "Mr. Waxman --",
  "That's my question. Did you never -- you never argued that it was beyond the power of the arbitrator to decide this question, did you?",
  "And do you take the position that this is a -- always an arbitrator's question when all disputes are supposed to be submitted, or was just -- was there just a mistake here?",
  "So why should we rewrite our standard of review to accommodate your client's error? Because that's really what you're asking us to do.",
  "More than once we have said an error of law or fact is not a basis to say that an arbitrator exceeded his or her powers.",
  "Mr. Waxman, how wrong does an arbitrator's decision have to be to become an issue of law? Meaning -- because that's the rule you're proposing. I used to think that exceeding your powers was deciding an issue the parties hadn't agreed to arbitrate, but here you've conceded that you gave the issue to the arbitrator. So he hasn't exceeded his power to construe the contract with respect to this dispute, do you agree with that?",
  "All right. So what instead you're saying is that \"exceeded your powers\" means that an error the arbitrator makes has to be of what quality?",
  "Can I --",
  "Can I see --",
  "Counsel -- counsel, you seem -- I don't know. I see two questions here. The first was an arbitrator exceeds his power if he decides a question is arbitral when it's not. And -- but here there is no dispute about that because you are right, your adversary submitted this question to arbitration. And that's what I'm hearing you respond. He did, there's no question, he said the arbitrator has to decide this issue. Justice Breyer raised the second question. Assuming he could, is there any remaining power in the Court to overturn his decision? And Justice Breyer said, if the standard is manifest disregard of fact and law, why would you still win? Because your adversary is saying, the law is clear. You have to find some hook in the agreement to agree to class action -- arbitration, and he says there is none. That's basically his position, that the arbitrator's decision on its substance manifestly disregarded the law. So that's the question that I believe is extant still.",
  "Was it a hypothetical?",
  "No, I want to say why there wasn't. I want you to explain why there wasn't one.",
  "Mr. Stewart, can we go back to Justice Breyer's question -- initial question. It's rare that we find a per se antitrust violation. Most situations we put it into rule of reason. You seem to be arguing that this is price fixing, a reverse payment like price fixing so that it has to fall into something greater than the rule of reason.",
  "But why is the rule of reason so bad? As an -- and that's really my bottom line because you're creating all -- I think that's what Justice Breyer was saying. I mean, for -- for example, I have difficult under -- understanding why the mere existence of a reverse payment is presumptively gives -- changes the burden from the Plaintiff. It would seem to me that you’d have to bear the burden -- the burden of proving that the payment for services or the value given was too high. I don't know why it has to shift to the other side.",
  "So answer the more fundamental question, why is the rule of reason so bad?",
  "Why isn't this that? Meaning there is no presumption of infringement. There's no presumption that the item that someone else is going to sell necessarily infringes.",
  "And so what you're arguing is that in fact a settlement of an infringement action is now creating that presumption.",
  "I don't know, but I don't know why we would be required to accept that there has or would be infringement by the product that has voluntarily decided not to pursue its rights.",
  "But there, you know that they're not sharing the profits.",
  "Meaning there you know that a -- a product's been licensed and the -- that's normal. The infringer is now paying the other side money to sell that product.",
  "A reverse payment suggests something different, that they're sharing profits. I don't know what else you can conclude.",
  "But not many for reverse payments.",
  "Is that in all cases or just Hatch-Waxman cases?",
  "Because it does skew the dynamics a lot.",
  "You know, the Second Circuit recognized, even though it accepted your scope of the patent, that there was a troubling dynamic in what you're arguing, which is that the less sound the patent, the more you're going to hurt consumers because those are the cases where the payoff, the sharing of profits is the greatest inducement for the patent holder.",
  "For whom? And -- and -- you know, the government is basically saying, we really don't want reverse payments, period. We want people to settle this the way they should settle it, which is on the strength of the patent. And that means settling it simply by either paying a royalty for use or settling as most cases do, on an early entry alone, so there's no sharing of -- of -- of profits. What's so bad about that? I mean, it doesn't deprive either side of the ability to finish the litigation if they want to.",
  "Well, in the normal course, if the patent's really strong, if you get a year or two earlier entry, that has an inherent value, and that's what you'll pay for is what the government is saying. That will be the determination the two parties will make, which is at what point is earlier entry worth it --",
  "-- for the very strong patent holder.",
  "Well, they pointed to most settlements and say that is the vast majority.",
  "Well, we do know that these reverse payments, except for recent times when people figured out they were so valuable, were the exception, not the rule.",
  "They have been increasing in number, not decreasing.",
  "I see that as an argument that there is an economic reality in Hatch-Waxman that would require us not to apply any rule we choose or accept here to other situations, only here. That's the argument that you're creating for me, that there's a different economic reality here that requires a different rule.",
  "Oh, but it does because in Hatch-Waxman Congress decided that there was a benefit for generics entering without suffering a potential loss to enter the market more quickly.",
  "And any settlement in these cases deprives consumers of the potential of having the benefit of an earlier entry.",
  "Exactly, and what you are doing with permitting settlements of this kind is not permitting the process to go to conclusion.",
  "It's encouraging infringement suits.",
  "But can you tell me -- that's a factual background with respect to their right to put the ballot initiative on the ballot, but how does it create an injury to them separate from that of every other taxpayer to have laws enforced?",
  "At least one of the amici have suggested that it seems counterintuitive to think that the State is going to delegate to people who don't have a fiduciary duty to them. That it's going to delegate the responsibility of representing the State to individuals who have their own views. They proposed the ballot initiative because it was their individual views, not necessarily that of the State. So --",
  "-- Justice Scalia proffered the question of the Attorney General. The Attorney General has no personal interest.",
  "He has a fiduciary obligation.",
  "Why isn't the fiduciary duty requirements before the State can designate a representative an important one?",
  "Well, generally you don't need to specify it because generally the people who get to enforce the legislation of the government are people who are in government positions elected by the people.",
  "Here these individuals are not elected by the people or appointed by the people.",
  "Outside of the -- outside of the marriage context, can you think of any other rational basis, reason for a State using sexual orientation as a factor in denying homosexuals benefits or imposing burdens on them? Is there any other rational decision-making that the government could make? Denying them a job, not granting them benefits of some sort, any other decision?",
  "All right. If that -- if that is true, then why aren't they a class? If they're a class that makes any other discrimination improper, irrational, then why aren't we treating them as a class for this one benefit? Are you saying that the interest of marriage is so much more compelling than any other interest as they could have?",
  "So you -- so what -- I don't quite understand it. If you're not dealing with this as a class question, then why would you say that the government is not free to discriminate against them?",
  "Actually, I'm not even --",
  "I'm sorry, where is that --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Mr. Olson, I think the bottom line --",
  "Mr. Olson, I think that you're not answering the fundamental fear. And so -- and -- and the amici brief that sets forth this test of fiduciary duty doesn't quite either. The assumption is that there are not executive officials who want to defend the law. They don't like it. No one's going to do that. So how do you get the law defended in that situation?",
  "So why -- why isn't this viewed as an appointment process that the in -- the ballot initiators have now become that body?",
  "That your argument - -",
  "Mr. Olson, the bottom line that you're being asked -- and -- and it is one that I'm interested in the answer, if you say that marriage is a fundamental right, what State restrictions could ever exist? Meaning, what State restrictions with respect to the number of people, with respect to -- that could get married -- the incest laws, the mother and child, assuming that they are the age -- I can -- I can accept that the State has probably an overbearing interest on -- on protecting a child until they're of age to marry, but what's left?",
  "Is there any way to decide this case in a principled manner that is limited to California only?",
  "General, there is an irony in that, which is the States that do more have less rights.",
  "How would the record be different elsewhere?",
  "But they are not the only ones.",
  "I think that begs your -- Mr. Olson doesn't really focus on this. If the issue is letting the States experiment and letting the society have more time to figure out its direction, why is taking a case now the answer?",
  "We let issues perk and so we let racial segregation perk for 50 years from 1898 to 1954.",
  "And now we are only talking about, at most, four years.",
  "Who else is going to be aggrieved if she is not? Meaning another person who is -- whose benefits are withheld, tax refund is withheld, is going to be in an identical situation to her? Who else could come in?",
  "Counsel, could you not run out of time on the BLAG standing? I know we -- we didn't permit Ms. Jackson to -- to address it. So don't run out of time on that.",
  "All right. Let's go to the BLAG issue.",
  "And the issue wasn't joined. So what do you think we meant? And I know Justice Scalia doesn't care what you think we meant.",
  "But what is your reading of what that means, that Congress can --",
  "-- intervene in situations in which its interests are injured?",
  "So are you accepting the amici's formulation that somehow the representative has to be of both houses and not just one?",
  "So you take the position that Congress --",
  "Well, I want to know what you're conceding.",
  "Let's assume this very case. Would -- who would ever have standing on behalf of Congress? Anyone? Or are you saying there's never standing?",
  "Mr. Clement, Chadha was somewhat different because there was a unique House prerogative at question. But how is this case any different than enforcing the general laws of the United States? There's no unique House power granted by the legislation.",
  "It's a law of the United States and the person who defends it generally is the Solicitor -- Solicitor General.",
  "Well, then, why shouldn't -- why shouldn't taxpayers have a right to come in? And we say they don't.",
  "Can you tell me where the authorization is here? I know that there is a statute that gives the Senate specifically authorization to intervene. And there was consideration of extending that right to the House. But the appointment of BLAG is strange to me because it's not in a statute, it's in a House rule. So where -- how does that constitute anything other than a private agreement among some Senators, the Senate -- the House leadership? And where -- from where do they derive the right, the statutory right, to take on the power of representing the House in items outside of the House? I know they control the procedures within the House, but that's a very different step than saying that they can decide who -- or to create standing in some way, prudential or otherwise, Article III or otherwise.",
  "What other House Rule creates the power of the majority leaders to represent the House outside of the functions of the House?",
  "This would be, I think, sort of unheard of, that --",
  "We don't even have a vote here.",
  "But only if the State recognizes it.",
  "There is a common law, Federal common law definition?",
  "I thought it was reverse, that if the State law recognized common law marriages, the Federal law --",
  "But that's begging the question because you are treating the married couples differently.",
  "You are saying that New York's married couples are different than Nebraska's.",
  "I picked that out of a hat. But the point is that there is a difference.",
  "But what gives the Federal government the right to be concerned at all at what the definition of marriage is? Sort of going in a circle. You're saying -- you're saying, we can create this special category -- men and women -- because the States have an interest in traditional marriage that they're trying to protect. How do you get the Federal government to have the right to create categories of that type, based on an interest that's not there, but based on an interest that belongs to the States?",
  "So they can create a class they don't like -- here, homosexuals, or a class that they consider is suspect in the marriage category, and they can create that class and decide benefits on that basis when they themselves have no interest in the actual institution of marriage as marriage. The State's control that.",
  "No, I'm -- I'm assuming --",
  "Assuming I assume the States can --",
  "-- what creates the right --",
  "General, I have a question. You think, I think from your brief yesterday and today, that on some level sexual orientation should be looked at on an intermediate standard of scrutiny?",
  "All right, heightened in some way. Going back to the Chief's question about a law that was passed recognizing common law heterosexual -- homosexual marriages. I think even under your theory that might be suspect because -- that law might be suspect under equal protection because once we say sexual orientation is suspect, it would be suspect whether it's homosexual or heterosexual. The law favors homosexuals, it would be suspect because it's based on sexual orientation.",
  "Exactly. And so when we decided race was a suspect class, people who are not blacks have received --",
  "-- strict scrutiny on whether the use of race as a class, whether they are white or a black, is justified by a compelling interest.",
  "General, your bottom line is, it's an equal protection violation for the Federal government, and all States as well?",
  "Is there any argument you can make to limit this to this case, vis-à-vis the Federal government and not the States?",
  "Now, the -- the discriminations are not the sexual orientation, but on a class of marriage, is that what you're --",
  "So I pose the same question I posed to the General to you. Do you think there's a difference between that discrimination and this -- and the discrimination of States who say homosexuals can't get married?",
  "It doesn't really matter --",
  "Excuse me. Does this issue go -- it doesn't go to whether you should apply the prejudice prong because either under normal harmless error or plain error you have to get to whether it prejudices someone.",
  "One of the most powerful arguments of your adversary is that in the most common of situations -- and it's how I read the advisory notes -- it's going to be awfully difficult to say that a judge's intervention hasn't influenced a defendant. This is the unusual case where you might actually have a no prejudice argument because of the unique facts. But it -- there is a purpose for keeping judges out of this, and that's because the subtle influence that judges exert is not so subtle. It's very palpable and does influence most decision making, both by lawyers and defendants. So if that's the standard, why isn't it a rebuttable presumption that prejudice exists?",
  "It has to be an awfully high presumption, otherwise, you make mockery of the rule, in my mind.",
  "Well, I don't disagree that one doesn't' have to use the word \"rebuttable presumption,\" but there has to be a strong prejudice factor --",
  "-- whether rebuttable or not, assumed in a judge's intervention.",
  "You're creating a sui generis structural error analysis. You're basically -- because even with respect to constitutional violations that we have found structural error in, we've created the plain error rule that still requires a proof of -- of prejudice. So you're asking us to create something that's really sui generis in saying it's always a structural error.",
  "Assume I accept that argument.",
  "You're -- you're saying this is a structural error always.",
  "Mr. Yablon, I agree with you totally. I'm not as much convinced by the delay in pleading because defendants often think about it and I can imagine a hypothetical where the lawyer comes in and says, I told him to plead guilty and he said to me, I don't want to, but the judge told me to. So I don't think the time limit -- we don't know if that happened. But what did happen is that the defendant made a motion to withdraw his plea and he directly said, \"I entered the plea because I strategically decided that the government would eventually have to come forth and vacate the charges against me.\" He said it himself with no pressure by a lawyer because he was making the motion. How do you get past that statement?",
  "But that is the whole point, which is this may be IAC, but I don't know how -- how you prove that what the magistrate judge said to him led to his decision.",
  "That's only if we don't accept that prejudice is a consideration here.",
  "That's the first time that has happened.",
  "Do you disagree with how the Fourth and Seventh Circuits and other circuits apply a prejudice analysis, but one that says that it's highly unlikely that you're not going to find prejudice? Do you disagree with their analysis and approach?",
  "No.",
  "Can you tell me why their test wasn't given a patent? I know the method of extraction wasn't, and why. Why would the tests -- would the tests be subject to a patent?",
  "Then -- then explain when you said you can't narrow. You said earlier you can't narrow.",
  "All right, that individual claim is invalid.",
  "But the patent with respect to claims that are not invalid would still stand.",
  "The primers and probes stand.",
  "That's the whole point, isn't it? The isolation itself is not valuable, it's the use you put the isolation to. That's the answer, isn't it?",
  "And so that is the answer, which is in isolation it has no value. It's just nature sitting there.",
  "That's a failure of the patent law. It doesn't patent ideas.",
  "Can we go to -- can we go to cDNA a moment?",
  "That is artificially created in the laboratory, so it's not bound in nature. It's not taking a gene and snipping something that's in nature. And yet you claim that can't be patented. The introns are taken out, the exons are left in, and they're sequenced together. Give me your argument on that. I read your brief, but it is not a product of nature, it's a product of human invention.",
  "But that goes to obviousness. That does not in my mind go to the issue of whether it's patent eligible. You may have a very strong argument on obviousness, but why does it not -- it's creating something that's not found in nature at all.",
  "Well, that's a separate question --",
  "-- about whether this claim is too expansive because it's claiming every 15 nucleotides and nature produces 15 randomly. But assuming the claim was for the entire mutated gene and not the small snippet that they want to capture the whole gene with, that's -- that whole gene without the introns is just not found in nature.",
  "Are we fighting over nothing? Are you fighting over nothing? If -- if they can patent this cDNA in the way they have, what does it matter, since it appears as if research has to rely on the cDNA to be effective?",
  "I understand --",
  "I understand why you are saying cDNA is patentable as a subject matter. I am looking at the way the claim is phrased, however, and it says that it's patenting a DNA segment 15 nucleotides long or longer. The reality is that 15 nucleotides doesn't necessarily bridge a sequence that goes between exons. It -- it can -- one exon can be 15 or more sequences long. So are you arguing that this claim as written is sustainable?",
  "So you are not taking the position that this claim as written is patentable?",
  "Because as I understand it, 15 nucleotides long exists naturally in nature. They get reproduced in that sequence of 15.",
  "Is that on the basis of a new extraction process?",
  "I -- I have a sort of analytical problem. I find it very, very difficult to conceive how you can patent a sequential numbering system by nature, in the same way that I have a problem in thinking that someone could get a patent on the computer binary code merely because they throw a certain number of things on a piece of paper in a certain order. I always thought that to have a patent you had to take something and add to what nature does. So how do you add to nature when all you are doing is copying its sequence?",
  "How do you add to it besides process or use?",
  "Look, I can bake --",
  "I can bake a chocolate chip cookie using natural ingredients -- salt, flour, eggs, butter -- and I create my chocolate chip cookie. And if I combust those in some new way, I can get a patent on that. But I can't imagine getting a patent simply on the basic items of salt, flour and eggs, simply because I've created a new use or a new product from those ingredients.",
  "Explain to me --",
  "-- why gene sequences, whether in the actual numbers, why gene sequences are not those basic products that you can't patent.",
  "That's the cDNA.",
  "So I put salt and flour, and that's different?",
  "So if I take them apart, now you can get a patent on the salt and now you can get a patent on the flour?",
  "Well, I guess --",
  "But you're not suggesting if you cut off a piece of the liver or a piece of the kidney that that somehow makes that piece patentable.",
  "So what's the difference? I mean, if you cut off a piece of the whole in the kidney or liver, you're saying that's not patentable, but you take a gene and snip off a piece, that is? What's the difference between the two --",
  "Is there some value to us striking down isolated DNA and upholding the cDNA? If we were to do what the government is proposing in this case, what's the consequences?",
  "Now, how do you understand Judge Bryson's dissent with respect to cDNA? I think he's saying that a gene created from -- into cDNA as a whole is okay, but that he had a problem with the description of that claim because it included 15 nucleotide long segments or fragments which he says reoccur in nature.",
  "Now, I'm making your job harder. How could they write it to do what he thinks would be patentable?",
  "So assuming we believe that there is some human invention in this process, whether it's obvious or not, separate question. But he's not creating -- the cDNA is not in nature naturally. So make that assumption. Make the assumption that they can make a claim for it. How do we avoid his problem?",
  "I know you are helping your adversary by answering this question.",
  "I am putting that aside.",
  "Only if they do a recombinant DNA, that's what you are saying.",
  "Can I break down your arguments into two components, if you might? Whether or not the market participant exception exists at all, and if it does, how far does it go? So let's get to the first question in my mind. Seems almost impossible for me to believe that the States couldn't require someone to put a little placard like you get at the -- at almost any building that you go into to park your car. They ask you to put a little placard in the front of your window so they know who you are and where you're going in the Port, okay? Why is the placard requirement here any different than that requirement generally? Because if you enter property, you have -- most people tell you put a placard in the window to tell us you got permission to come in.",
  "But even if that, if we didn't have a market participant, why couldn't the State say, when you come into the terminal, you just got to put a little placard in so we know that you're not parking here overnight when you've already been unloaded or something else?",
  "Could the terminal say, we have a pollution problem and only modern trucks can come and unload here?",
  "So they have to take trucks that are too heavy for this crane to lift?",
  "Except in Boston Harbor, we said that there was a presumption in favor of it unless Congress explicitly indicated to the contrary.",
  "Do we need to get into the market exception if we find that this is -- has the force or effect of law rather than being a private contract?",
  "It's one or the other -- or both, but we could choose.",
  "Do you think the city could pass a regulation like Justice Breyer suggested, that says, stay off residential streets?",
  "So you -- do you think that a statute that says if you're a trucking company operator and you have three violations of X safety regulations, you just can't use our highways because we don't trust you, is that okay?",
  "Why? Why isn't it a standard fact that States and cities use to stop people from repetitive violations to tell them, if you keep doing this and don't remedy what you've done, we're just not going to let you do X, Y, and Z? Why wouldn't the safety violate --",
  "Could I just go back because --",
  "-- the theoretical questions. The agreement requires the operators to have offsite parking.",
  "All right? It has to do that for a reason. It means that if its trucks don't use that off -- off-site parking, that the operator is in default? Is that the City's position?",
  "I just wanted to make sure. What you're saying is if trucks park anywhere else, then the operator's in violation of the agreement.",
  "All right. With respect to the placard, as I read the provision it says you have to have the placard coming in and going out. Is this like one of those parking placards that people can affix temporarily or does it have to be a permanent?",
  "Well, how does that help you? Meaning to --",
  "So how is the public going to use that plaque?",
  "How is the public going to use that? The public hangs around the Port as it's loading to call in complaints?",
  "Are you suggesting -- I don't know that the parties -- I know that the government has said that (f) doesn't apply to the father, but (d) does, so there's not a full concession on your point. But putting that aside, if it is a father who has visitation rights, and exercising all of his support obligations, is it your position that -- that because that father's not a custodian, he has no protections whatsoever under (d) or (e)? The State can come and take the child away from an unfit mother or father if they're the ones with custody, and that responsible parent who only has visiting rights has no protections under (d), (e), or (f)?",
  "I'm not asking about State law --",
  "-- I'm asking about Federal law.",
  "Well, (d) doesn't talk about custodial rights. I do agree that (f) talks about continued --",
  "-- custody.",
  "Well, you don't think that a parent with custody -- well, you do think a parent with custody is the only definition of family, but why wouldn't a noncustodial parent with visitation rights be considered a family with that child?",
  "I'm not going to State law --",
  "Well, there is a support obligation on that unwed father.",
  "Why isn't that a parental right? It's one of the parental rights the States enforce whether or not you want to provide support or not.",
  "So what do you do with the States that do give unwed fathers the -- that don't support their children and who don't have an ongoing relationship the right to be considered first for adoption? Why should we follow the definitions of South Carolina or those other States? Why shouldn't we just give it a Federal meaning?",
  "As --",
  "What's the difference with a sperm donor? I mean, I know that you raise that in your brief. But going back to Justice Scalia's point, if the choice is between a mother, a biological father, or a stranger, and if the father's fit, why do you think that the Federal statute requires that it be given to a stranger rather than to the biological father when the statute defines \"parent\" as the biological father?",
  "What do you do with the lower court's determination that one of the factors of the best interest calculus was the Federal policy to ensure that Indian children, children of biological Indian parents, at least one, should be raised with their parents? Because the lower court said it thought it was in the best interest of this child to stay with its birth father, in light of the Federal policy. So I disagree with your colleague that there wasn't a best interest --",
  "What do I do with the lower court's finding that this father, despite not being married to his prior lover, had children, was attentive of those children, had the resources to raise the child? What do we with -- why are you --",
  "But they looked at something else that everybody's ignoring --",
  "Mr. Clement, can I go back to that best interest calculus? There's two timeframes in my mind to look at: In January, when he asserted his parental rights and 2 years later when the trial was heard. If there's serious emotional harm, I think the court below said, we're not looking at what happens at the time we're deciding the custody issue because otherwise, we're going to give custody by estoppel. We're going to encourage people to hold on to kids and create the serious physical harm. In January, when he asserted his rights, that's what we're looking at. What was in the best interests of the child at the time the issue was raised, and that was 4 or 5 months after the birth of the child.",
  "So we're going to freeze it at that point or are we going to freeze it today, after the child's been with his -- with her father for 2 years?",
  "I don't want to be that judge, by the way.",
  "Tell me why you are fighting Justice Breyer? He said, I see -- and your -- Mr. Clement said the same thing -- that \"good cause\" under 1958 has a variant of best interests of the child or factors that are considered. I see (f) as doing the same thing, allotting however a burden of proof that may or may not be higher than other States. I mean, in -- in -- some States may have clear and convincing evidence, some States may have preponderance. Some States -- I don't know if any have beyond a reasonable doubt. But it's an allocation of burden.",
  "Counsel, there are two forms of the EIFD doctrine, the existing Indian family doctrine. One applies directly to this case, what's the status of an unwed father, and they seem, under that doctrine, to apply the definition that a parent who hasn't been involved in the care during pregnancy is not a father. But the other side of the doctrine is the one that addresses, I think, the Chief's concern, which is you don't only have Indian blood, but you've been a father who's actually been a member of an Indian tribe, an active member. We don't have to reach that separate issue here, that EIFD -- that part of the EIFD doctrine.",
  "I don't disagree.",
  "Counsel, this Act, in terms of voluntary surrender of Indian children by parents, says that it's not final for an adoptive parent until the court does the adoption decree. It gives the mother the right -- or father -- to rescind the voluntary adoption till the very last minute. Has that stopped adopt -- voluntary adoptions?",
  "Mr. Fisher, may -- I have a number of problems. The first is your rule would be seen to be giving noncustodial defendants more rights than those defendants in custody because you're arguing that -- I think -- that a greater degree of expression, other than silence, would be needed to show the invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination.",
  "Or are you trying to equate the rights that a defendant has to custodial and noncustodial, with respect to invocation?",
  "The problem -- I have an easier problem understanding this argument with respect -- and I'm going to ask your adversaries -- with respect to the situation in which someone is approached by the police and said, come in and talk to us. I have a hard time understanding how the refusal to come talk to them could be held against them. There, I understand it. But, here, your defendant went in and talked. So, once he chose to do that, why does he get more rights than Berghuis did, who remained silent for 2-and-a-half hours? The Court wasn't willing to find that that was an invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination. Why would it find the refusal to ask one -- answer one question indicative of the privilege against silence -- or the privilege for silence?",
  "I know --",
  "How would you deal with another common situation where a defendant meets up with the police, gives a story, and then, later, changes the story. And the question is asked at trial, you never volunteered that story to the -- to the police when they questioned you. Would that be silence, to you? Would that be an invocation of his right not to incriminate himself? Or would you -- would the prosecutor be barred from arguing to the jury, as often is done, he chose to say this, but not that, so this is a made-up story.",
  "Now, sometimes, they come back and later do a different confession.",
  "I -- I'm assuming, now that I'm thinking about your argument, you would argue that, even in a custodial setting, a prosecutor couldn't say, I asked him, did he shoot his wife, and the prosecutor can't argue that, because he refused to answer, that makes him guilty.",
  "Well, in fact, at most trials, district court judges tell juries the evidence is not the unanswered question. It's the question plus the answer.",
  "I guess, as I understand your rule -- I'm sorry. I'll ask it on rebuttal.",
  "But why, counsel? I mean, really, what you're saying is, merely because I asked you the question and you choose not to answer, it makes you guilty.",
  "It -- no problem. Here, you're asking about the crime of investigation. But you could have asked him, did you kill Joe Blow on another street, and, if he had remained silent, you would be arguing that proves he is guilty, I could introduce that at trial. And you would be arguing it would be sufficient to convict him, that you merely asked the question and he remained silent about it shows his guilt.",
  "It's a little scary to me that an unanswered question is evidence of guilt.",
  "He is not arguing that the physical response is not admissible. He is just arguing that the mere asking of a question and a failure to answer it, you can't argue, as a prosecutor, that that shows someone is guilty.",
  "Your -- my hypothetical that I posed earlier, if the police call you and say, come in for questioning, and you ignore them, is that an invocation of the right to silence or not?",
  "Why -- why could you argue that that's --",
  "They -- then they're arguing what the legal theory of guilt is in that situation.",
  "All right. So why is it -- would it be admissible that someone decides -- someone comes in, and they say -- police say to him or her, we are investigating this crime, help us. They start asking questions, and it's clear from the first question -- there is a waiver of Miranda, and, from the first question, the first question is, did you kill this person? The guy remains silent. They ask a whole bunch of other questions, and he remains silent. Had -- has he invoked his right?",
  "So a prosecutor could go into the jury and say, he waived his Miranda rights, and he is guilty because he refused to answer our questions?",
  "Where does the compulsion line come in? Your adversary points out that, under this scenario, the police can ask you questions and say to you -- you know, if you stay quiet in this question, I'm going to use it against you at trial, that police will actually to that, that they'll actually come in and tell defendants who are telling the story -- you know, either answer or it'll be used against you.",
  "So why can't you say that a call from a police officer to someone who says, come in and talk, that that can't be used against them at trial as -- you gave me a different answer. You said it wasn't probative, but you didn't say Griffin would protect that.",
  "That is such a radical position, that silence is an admission of guilt. That's really what the argument is. I certainly understand that speaking can implicate you, and, if you choose to speak, clearly, whatever you say can be used against you, unless you're in custody and unless you've invoked the right before. But this is radically different. We are -- we are -- you're trying to say acts of commission and omission are the same, but statements are different than silence because, then, you're making the person who is asking this question your -- your admission. You are saying you're adopting their statement as true.",
  "What's not administrable about telling the police you just can't argue to a jury that merely not asking a question is guilt? What -- what lacks administrable?",
  "I'd like to go back to what Justice Ginsburg argued because there is an argument here that there wasn't an invocation of the right, that, by physical conduct, there was a statement. Would you have had a problem if the prosecutor had argued at trial -- you know, when he was asked about this testing, he didn't remain silent, he got nervous?",
  "And that shows his guilt.",
  "What's the limit of that power? How -- for any Federal conviction, whether it's related to sex offense or anything else, Congress could impose any kind of registration requirement?",
  "Could it ask every convicted Federal felon to come in for a DNA test because we know that people who have been convicted of a crime are more likely to be recidivists?",
  "So what -- what is the limit? Is it just safety? It can't be just safety of the public because you just said that it doesn't apply to recidivist Federal offenders, generally.",
  "I don't understand. I just posited a civil registration for Federal offenders of any kind. That's not ex post facto under your theory, so --",
  "Well, I don't know if I agree with that, but accept -- accepting that hypothetical.",
  "No, you know, that's settled law. Whether it's right or wrong is a different issue.",
  "As broad as that authority is, perhaps I'm going back to Justice Alito's question, which is if you put aside that it's part of the punishment because you say it's not part of the punishment, you want us not to look at it as punishment because otherwise you'd run into the ex post facto problem, you're saying we have a need today. Outside of protecting the public from a recidivist, what's the interest? Because that wasn't enough in Comstock. We made it very clear that wasn't enough. So if you take out all of the punishment aspects of this, which you should have done at the time he was sentenced and not now, what remains in terms of the Federal interest?",
  "What's promoted?",
  "But that was -- why did we even bother going through anything in Comstock? If that stands alone as a Federal interest, then anything we do at any point with respect to any person who's violated a Federal law would stand in the same shoes.",
  "You could do whatever civil penalties you want for as long as you want. We go back to my initial question and Justice --",
  "Could I bo back to – to a primary question, are you challenging – you didn't on appeal, but it seems as if you're accepting that the Federal government has the power to impose this requirement as part of a Federal sentence.",
  "All right. Are you -- if it's not part of a Federal sentence, but part of release, it's not announced at the sentence, but it's announced at the time the prisoner is put into supervised release or release from jail, do you think the government has the power to impose it then?",
  "Well, SORNA today becomes part of the supervised relief terms.",
  "I'm not talking about SORNA today.",
  "I'm talking about just any prisoner who has been in jail, but it's not made, has not been paid, part of the punishment.",
  "I -- I don't know of that power, but do you have a statutory --",
  "All right. So that power -- I guess then what the government is saying, as I understand their argument, if you have the power to do it at that point, why can't you have the power to do it later?",
  "Are the same factors that compel permission for the government to do it then?",
  "How would you write this opinion if you wanted to protect against what Justice Breyer was concerned about, constricting the Commerce Clause, which has been since Madison more broadly defined than he did, or Justice Alito's example of ensuring that you're not closing off other things that can be done after someone leaves, that might be related to, like punishing a crime that you find out about afterwards. How would you write this opinion?",
  "Well, it wasn't really helpful because it -- it doesn't give us a limiting principle like -- I don't know if it's possible -- that if you're relying on just recidivism, Congress has to have an independent basis, a power for the imposition of -- of criminal or civil sanctions on someone.",
  "Your argument is he was released on condition of State registration. Isn't your argument dependent only on that there was no Federal registration requirement?",
  "The bottom line is you don't think the Wetterling Act applied to him. Is that your point?",
  "The Wetterling Act didn't apply to him; is that --",
  "At all?",
  "So why not just say that? If that was Congress's intent, why limit it to a specific form of State borders involving divorce, annulment, et cetera? Why not just simply say in 80 -- 80705(e) that any court order could change the order of precedence, if that was Congress's intent?",
  "But that's --",
  "I'm sorry. Finish answering him, and then I'll --",
  "The problem that I have with that answer is that it doesn't cure the organization's need to stay true to its own beliefs because if -- and I think this is what Justice Breyer is trying to get to -- if it’s truly an independent organization speaking, then that's that organization's belief; it's not an alternative under Rust to the needs of that organization to have its own personal views. And -- and so I have that problem, which is how is it an alternative for that organization to be able to have its views? Let me posit a hypothetical that I'm actually very troubled by. Let's assume a city government is undertaking a campaign to prevent teen pregnancy and its associated problems, and it wants to promote the use of contraceptives that protect from contracting -- you know, diseases, things like that. And some of its programs involve the distribution of contraceptives, but others involve parenting classes for teenage mothers and offering them free daycare. And a church seeks funds for the daycare part and the parenting part. Can the city now say, because we have this really important need to avoid sexually transmitted diseases, anyone who seeks our funds also have to say they believe in the use of contraceptives?",
  "The church there would say, we don't believe, and why should we say we believe?",
  "Excuse me. That's my problem, which is I'm trying to tease out what your position is, okay? I -- I have an understanding of you're saying, you can't compel me to say I don't like something. And -- and that's like a oath of loyalty. That -- that's understandable. But, if the government said the following more clearly -- this is an oddly phrased policy, okay, because it seems to be requiring this oath. But if it simply said, if you're an organization that wants our funds, you have to say that you're not going to promote actively the contrary policy, would that be okay? You're not going to go out there and do things to promote the legalization of prostitution because that's going to undermine our message. Those are two different positions, so tell me where you draw the line.",
  "Yes, that's Rust.",
  "This is a step further.",
  "So --",
  "No, no, no. I cut you off. But -- but I guess what I'm -- I keep going back -- you keep going back and forth on this it -- it's not okay to tell me to take an oath of loyalty. But would it be okay for you to step outside the doors of this program and pass out literature that promotes the legalization of prostitution? Am I making my question clear?",
  "Which is how do you -- how do you answer the question of why does the Constitution bar the government from saying, look, if you're going to work with me, you can't go out there and promote a -- actively promote --",
  "-- a different message?",
  "Well --",
  "I would have less problem accepting your message if there weren't four major organizations who were exempted from the policy requirement and -- medical science -- vaccinators are exempted. There seems to be a bit of selection on the part of the government in terms of who it wants to work with. It would seem to me that, if you really wanted to protect the U.S., you wouldn't exempt anybody from this.",
  "Excuse me.",
  "No, no. Finish. But I - -",
  "I think under your argument, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, that Louisiana could decide it doesn't want to wait for the flow of water to come to it, and it could just go right into Oklahoma, in which it shares no border, and I don't know how it's going to do that, and take its 25 percent. Does that make sense in terms of the language?",
  "I mean, you're talking about Texas, but Texas shares a border and so it may be a little easier to cross the borderline. But what's Louisiana going to do?",
  "So I'm sure -- you're -- you're saying that the State of Texas can take water directly from the main stem?",
  "That's my point, yeah.",
  "So what do you think is the remedy? Meaning --",
  "I -- let me just posit the point, okay? I understand your point to the Chief that there's been no proof that Texas doesn't get its 25 percent or that it couldn't get it from the main stem or somewhere. I accept that. But let's, for the hypothetical, say that there's a major drought and Texas can't get it from its portion. What's its remedy?",
  "So that -- that it's not getting --",
  "-- 25 percent --",
  "-- as the Compact entitles it to.",
  "It says, \"shall have equal rights to the use of runoff originating in Subbasin 5.\"",
  "So how do you deal with all the provisions she was mentioning with respect to the 60/40 division? I can't make rhyme or reason of those provisions that don't use within State boundaries, but it has to mean that.",
  "Mr. Clement, what is -- I'm sort of trying to figure out why you're trying to get the word \"property\" to do the work of the \"obtain\" part of the statute because when you answered Justice Alito you were using the terms of \"obtain\" to define property, which is in my mind a sort of strange way to do things, okay? Property generally means value of some sort and you don't use any of those words in your definition. So what you're using in my mind, and not illogically, is to say that the second part of the statute has to do some work, so it has to mean that you're taking something of value away from someone else. That makes logical sense to me. And I understand the second piece of your argument, which is the recommendation -- not the recommendation, but his honest services were -- wasn't being given to your client, it was being given to the employer. So your client obtained nothing of value for himself. He didn't get anything transferred to him. And that -- that argument makes eminent sense to me. And I tease it out of your brief, but I don't know why you're trying to get our definition of \"property\" to do that work.",
  "Why isn't the work in the \"obtain\" part?",
  "So take the Government's definition that property is anything of value.",
  "All right. And let's assume because it -- as I said, that seems to have some sort of conceptual appeal. Then make the argument for me.",
  "Then make your argument for me why this isn't an obtaining.",
  "I -- I -- going back a little bit to Justice Breyer's question, how do you gain possession of someone's advice or how they do their job when it's not giving you a direct benefit, it's something that belongs to someone else?",
  "That's the problem, this obtaining controlled concept.",
  "Because you're -- you're equating taking control with possession. And that's where I'm having difficulty.",
  "I didn't think they circled recommendation. They circled his honest advice, didn't they?",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Mr. Clement, when you finish --",
  "Let -- look, I think if we take your argument to its logical conclusion, what you are telling us is, do away with the Second Circuit's Tropiano decision, and the large progeny of cases that come from it. The most common is the threat to a business that says pull out of this market because we don't want you in it. And we want all the customers. And courts routinely have said that is a Hobbs Act violation. You're using the threat of force to tell people to keep out of a particular market. Today you are telling us that under your theory of the Hobbs Act and your definition of property, that doesn't count as a Hobbs Act violation.",
  "Oh, I think when I sat as a district court judge, I would have been insulted by that.",
  "Okay. It's really is, for you.",
  "I'm sorry. I somehow lost what you were saying. Isn't the law -- and our presumption in Jackson -- that, when we talk about discrimination on the basis of race, that it includes retaliation, generally?",
  "Well, different because it was the beginning of this sort of endeavor on creating a statute.",
  "I'm -- I'm not sure what difference it makes.",
  "I mean, other than in the outcome you want here.",
  "Where do you see that anywhere in the legislative history?",
  "Well, but it -- it calls it the same thing it calls the substantive discrimination charge, an -- it's a -- an unfair employment practice. I mean, I don't understand how you -- where you get to your policy point --",
  "-- from the fact that it calls it the same thing on both substantive.",
  "Calls it both identical things, an unlawful employment practice.",
  "But that policy argument just says Jackson's wrong.",
  "It just doesn't make any -- much sense to me that, in 1991, when they were thinking about Price Waterhouse burdens, that, somehow, they thought that it should now apply that burden differently to retaliation.",
  "What about the Michigan Court of Appeals? There's only one court of appeals, right?",
  "That seems a little strange, for the following reason -- just as I think this case presents an example, you're claiming it's clear because the supreme court said it was clear, but the court of appeals in -- in Mangiapane, whether or not it assumed it or not, did an analysis that clearly says that it believes that the definition of legal insanity includes diminished capacity. Its holding didn't need that analysis, because it could have assumed it and then just said, but no notice was given, so the defense fails here. It took the time to analyze just this question and came to a contrary conclusion. Its contrary conclusion was that \"legal insanity\" was a broad enough term under Michigan law to encompass this defense. The court of -- the State supreme court has now said, no, it's not. But I don't know that that makes the statute any less ambiguous, merely because a court announces that it thinks it's not.",
  "That's -- that's your whole point, isn't it?",
  "You can't prove a negative because, if everybody accepts, after Mangiapane, that the defense exists, then trial courts are not going to be excluding it on the basis that the statute excludes it because --",
  "That's the whole point you are making.",
  "Do you have any -- is there any evidence of a trial court holding an exclusion?",
  "Or even suggesting one?",
  "I'm sorry. Then you're arguing that Lynch was wrong to begin with because what you are arguing is that it created a common law defense that the courts say you can't do under Michigan law.",
  "No, no, but you're saying to me it was wrongly decided under this general Michigan --",
  "So how ­­ how broad is the word \"benefit\"? Because that's really what this case comes down to.",
  "Assuming we accepted your narrow test, which wouldn't address every situation that the other circuits have talked about, but let's ­­ let's ­­",
  "Well, that was the Madoff situation, which was different from this one.",
  "Well, but that's the Line case where, I am told by the government, you were trying to ­­ I know that Justice Scalia doesn't think it's important, but I do. Okay? If someone tells me, sell your securities, give me the money, I will buy securities for myself and give you a fixed rate of return later, I think that's in connection with the purchase and sale of securities, even though it's not legally purchased for my benefit.",
  "Let's assume they were.",
  "Zandford is a case like that. That ­­",
  "Would you ­­ among all the circuit courts, which test would you adopt?",
  "Except Judge Sutton in the Sixth Circuit.",
  "I'm not sure you see the distinction or ­­ or you're facing the distinction. The right not to be tried is one of qualified immunity.",
  "But you can have a constitutional violation and still not have a remedy, which is what this question involves. So how do we deal with the concept that other people who have motions to dismiss that are denied still undergo trials, still experience the expense, and yet, we've said, repeatedly, an interlocutory appeal is not warranted. And so what makes it warranted here, where a court has already said that there was a ­­ or at least there's enough evidence to suggest a constitutional violation and that a reasonable officer wouldn't have believed his or ­­ a person would have believed his or her conduct was appropriate?",
  "I'm sorry. I ­­ the only issue that's before us is whether someone who's exempted from the ADEA still has a 1983 claim, correct? That's what the Seventh Circuit said. If you're not a part of the statute, then you still have your 1983 rights?",
  "I don't know if you've satisfied my colleagues. I'm not sure that you've answered directly. I think your adversary is right, that the Seventh Circuit held that no one is precluded from a 1983 claim, whether they're an employee or a non­employee. That's the way the case was litigated. That's the way they decided. The broad statement, whether he's an employee or not an employee, he doesn't have a 1983 ­­ he has a 1983 action. You've come in, and you've said he's not an employee, so he's entitled to his 1983 claim.",
  "All right. My colleagues are asking you, that only takes care of half of this problem because the circuit said, even if he was an employee, he would still have it. And so you're being asked are you giving up that part of the claim, that he's not an employee?",
  "Can you tell me what the authority is for Congress to extinguish a right for a constitutional violation? Meaning ­­",
  "­­ assume that someone ­­ it was the question that Justice Alito asked you ­­ someone under of the age of 40, someone who's not covered by any statute, someone who's part of an employer under 20, what would suggest to you in ­­ in this statute that Congress intended to extinguish those people's rights?",
  "I'm sorry. Restate that again, so I understand what you are saying.",
  "Absent the GERA ­­",
  "­­ would people who are executive officers, et cetera, absent the GERA ­­",
  "­­ would they have retained a constitutional right?",
  "Counsel, years ago, one of my colleagues, not on this bench, but a different one, said to me ­­ you know, there's much to­do about judges basing credibility on demeanor. And he said, no one does that. What you base it on is the internal consistency and logic of the testimony and how it's corroborated by circumstances. And he said, otherwise, you just rarely hear anybody say, story makes sense, nothing corrupt­­ story doesn't make sense, the story's not corroborated, but the guy looks like he's telling the truth. I'm reading all the decisions that you cited for me and not one, including in this circuit, relies simply on that kind of statement. Every one of them is based on comparing the testimony to other factors; to logic, to evidence, to objectives. So I don't know what rule it is, what objective evidence means. Do you need corroboration the way you need to prove a murder? Is that what you want us to announce?",
  "It said it, but it didn't do it.",
  "Well, counselor, that's what juries do all the time, selectivity. That doesn't move me. What I want to know is, why do we announce a rule that, somehow, suggests a limitation that can't exist? Meaning what judges look to, to determine credibility relies on factors that you can't sum up in one word?",
  "Every court says that.",
  "But isn't that ­­ I mean, the court didn't say that the court ­­ that the court below ­­ the Sixth Circuit didn't say that the court below had to accept the reoffered plea agreement. It seemed inherent in Lafler and Frye that what the Court was saying is that the court below has to use its judgment on whether offer ­­ accepting the plea is ­­ is right or giving another remedy is right. All of these arguments should be before that court, not before us, as an absolute rule.",
  "So that's your only point, which is that that should be an issue for the court below?",
  "But some remedy has to be offered ­­",
  "­­ if there is a violation.",
  "I agree with you ­­ I agree with you and so does your adversary, but he says there is nothing in this record to show what research was done or not done. The fact that the prior counsel's record wasn't reviewed doesn't say that he didn't talk to the prosecutor, doesn't say that he didn't look into other record evidence, any of the discovery that had been filed with the court, or any of the other circumstances that could have informed him adequately.",
  "Well, that's ­­",
  "Ms. Newman ­­ you know, I ­­ I'm ­­ this may be the first case that I have been involved in as a judge ­­ and there might be others, but myself, personally ­­ where, in a situation like this, the defendant has not put in an affidavit to explain what happened. There is some force to your adversary's argument that there's a really sparse record here, and AEDPA deference requires the burden on you. You can't deny that. I guess ­­ I don't know if you were responsible, but what other circumstances that would occasion a defendant not saying, this is what I was told?",
  "But they didn't ask for the hearing in the court below. They only asked for it at the court of appeals.",
  "I ­­ I don't understand what you're saying. The other side says ­­ and I think it's the standard ­­ that you look at the totality of the circumstances.",
  "And what you're saying is they didn't do that here. It's not that ­­ they use some objective evidence, you're saying they didn't use other objective evidence. I am ­­",
  "I'm a little confused, okay? I'm confused because we're talking in the abstract. This decision was based on a motion to dismiss, and there is a huge colloquy about what happens and doesn't happen. We don't have a record below.",
  "I mean, I can go into the news, as Justice Breyer suggested. It's very hard to think that any candidate doesn't know the contributor who has enough money to give, not only to himself or herself, but to any of his or her affiliates who are supporting him or her. I mean, it's nearly common sense, hard to dispute. So you're saying it can't happen, but I don't see charges of coordination going on that much.",
  "You're taking a position ­­ you're taking a position that the law stops corruption. And you're suggesting that the government is incapable of showing facts that the law doesn't work?",
  "As it is? Don't you need facts to prove that or disprove that proposition?",
  "Then how is it that ­­ I’m sorry.",
  "Excuse me. I thought I understood that to be your point in your brief, but I ­­ there is one thing missing from here. I also thought you were saying that you could impose the penalty before the amount was determined on the partnership level, that the tax that you could, without a notice of deficiency, require a payment upfront.",
  "That is the incongruity of your position in my mind. You claim that the decision of ­­ of whether or not or what the true value is of the basis and how much needs to be paid can't be determined until the partnership level ­­ until the partner level determination, yet you're claiming that you're entitled to an amount of money beforehand, before that decision is made. There's a tension in my mind about that.",
  "Mr. Stewart ­­",
  "Mr. Stewart, what ­­ what is this case a fight about? And ­­ and ­­ I'm sorry. Perhaps I'll just ask it on rebuttal, so you can save your time for rebuttal.",
  "Let me ask you something. There's no reason to go into a sham transaction, except to misstate the outside basis in the individual partnership level, so I ­­ it's low­hanging fruit, according to the D.C. court. But why shouldn't you be able to pick it?",
  "I mean, it's sort of obvious, just as it's obvious that, if a partnership item has a miscalculation that the partner is going to include it in their tax return later. That's why we permit the penalty to be imposed up front and to pay the tax up front because you're making an assumption that it's been included erroneously on the partner level.",
  "Could you give me a concrete example? Because I'm not quite sure about what you're talking about.",
  "I'm ­­ I'm a little confused on this example. Presumably, it's only if they carried forward, which we're assuming they would have done, carried forward the outside basis, the penalty would have been determined just on that one transaction.",
  "Could you ­­ could you go back just one moment to the practical point that your brother made? Is this issue only about whether you collect the tax beforehand or after? Because he says that they are bound in a partner­level proceeding to the finding that the outside basis was ­­ benefit was claimed in the partnership level it was zero.",
  "The law travels with ­­ the law of the transferring State travels to the transferred State. So they've undone ­­ they're taking Texas law, if you go under 1404, to Virginia.",
  "And that would defeat the purpose of the venue selection to start with. That's part of your argument?",
  "But your ­­ your adversary is not taking that discretion away. It's saying ­­ your adversary, I understand, is conceding that Virginia has the ability to apply 1404 in it's judgment, but you should honor the contract. I have one fundamental problem, which is slightly different. Under Bremen and Carnival, if the forum selected was arbitration or a State court, then the court has no 1404 power. It must transfer to those venues. If we accept 1404 as applying, then we're disfavoring commercial parties from picking Federal courts because they're going to have to accept that a non­selected venue will have the power to make the decision whether to transfer or not. That seems to me to invite ­­ there may be people who think that's a good thing, get cases out of the Federal court, even if they are international commercial cases. But isn't that what you are inviting?",
  "Well ­­",
  "You use 12(b)(3), not 1404.",
  "In those other cases, you ­­",
  "­­ you use 12(b)(3).",
  "In other words, that issue has not been decided by them.",
  "Excuse me. Are you saying that, by filing in Texas, you're not going to arbitration?",
  "So what's more favorable about Texas other than your convenience? What's more favorable about arbitration in Texas other than your convenience?",
  "That's the only thing. It's convenient for you to be in Texas.",
  "So they would be ­­ the only people collecting that $160,000 are going to be the lawyers.",
  "You took a contingency case in a contract matter?",
  "If it's under 12(b)(3), then Stewart stays, and it's Federal law that controls and the judge decides, right?",
  "We permitted that in Container Corp.",
  "We permitted that in Container Corp. We permitted California law to tax the parent California corporation for the earnings of all its foreign subsidiaries. And we said the due process clause wasn't offended by that.",

  "Where else have we done it in the personal jurisdiction context, define the limits of the due process ­­ Federal due process, in accordance with State law?",
  "Didn't we create tests in International Shoe, in Burger King, separate from State law?",
  "So what do we do with all the amici briefs that points to countless articles that talk about the corporate veil­piercing as the most arbitrary of State laws out there?",
  "I don't know how ­­ how corporations get any sense of comfort from a law that's so irrationally applied, according to some.",
  "Could you tell me why we just don't rely on the tests we apply in the tax cases? It's a Federal test, and it says, if you're functionally and economically tied together and you control the other entity ­­ the parent controls the subsidiary, your earnings are subject to the Due Process Clause and can be taxed by an individual State. It seems like a fairly simple test. And if you break down the complicated California test, really, that was the essence it was getting to. So why do we go to the vagrancies of State law, and why don't we just do the true and tried?",
  "California ­­",
  "I mean, in most agency relationships, titles stay with the principal. So I don't know ­­ or ­­ or when it doesn't, it transfers to the agent, but for the benefit of the principal. So I don't know what the sale in Germany has to do.",
  "Well, it seems an odd thing to say given the page and a half that the lower court went through on the various ways in which Germany controls this subsidiary. It appoints all its officers. It approves all its operating procedures. It approves all of the people it hires and fires. It seems like there isn't much left for what ­­",
  "Do you really care how we do it? Given that so many issues have not been adequately briefed, conceded when they are, obviously, fallacious and unsupportable, why don't we just say, simply, exercise of jurisdiction is unreasonable in this case?",

  "Holt had nothing to do with an antidiscrimination law. It had to do with a remedy, defacto segregation. Why isn't this identical to Seattle?",
  "You don't think that the proponents of affirmative action are attempting to do the same thing? One of the bill sponsors here said that this constitutional amendment will bring back desegregation in Michigan, and it appears to have done just that.",
  "I ­­ I thought that in Grutter, all of the social scientists had pointed out to the fact that all of those efforts had failed. That's one of the reasons why the ­­ I think it was a law school claim in Michigan was upheld.",
  "It's always wonderful for minorities that they finally get in, they finally have children and now you're going to do away for that preference for them. It seems that the game posts keeps changing every few years for minorities.",
  "I don't see the distinction. Bussing could be viewed, and was viewed, to benefit only one group. It was a preference for blacks to get into better schools. That's the way the case was pitched, that was its justification, and to integrate the society. Affirmative action has the same gain. We've said that in Fisher, it should be to diversify the population, and so it favors diversity as opposed to desegregation.",
  "But I don't see how the argument would be any different here. One of the main sponsors of this bill said it was intended to segregate again. The voters in Seattle were not all filled with animus, some of them just cared about their children not leaving ­­ not having outsiders come in. I mean, there's always voters who have good intent.",
  "In Seattle as well. So it wasn't the issue of animus that drove Seattle.",
  "So what do we do with the statistics from California? An amici from California, their attorney general, has shown, another State with a similar proposition, has shown the dramatic drop.",
  "So why is it okay to have taken away ­­ not okay to have taken away the decision to have bussing from the local school boards, the people on the ground, but it's okay to take that power away from the people on the ground here, the board of regents, who are also elected like the school board was in Seattle?",
  "The general population has feelings about many things, but the only decision that they're ­­ educational decision that they are taking away from the board of regents is this one: affirmative action. Everything else they leave within the elected board of regents.",
  "You've done something much more. You are basically saying if ­­ because Fisher and Grutter ­­ we've always applied strict scrutiny.",
  "All right. So it's essentially a last resort, within some reason. But what you are saying, if all those other measures fail, you're by Constitution saying you can't go to the remedy that might work.",
  "Well, but you're ­­ but this amendment is stopping the political process. It's saying the board of regents can do everything else in the field of education except this one.",
  "It can't be that because the normal political process imposes burdens on different groups. I thought the line was a very simple one, which is if the normal academic decision­making is in the dean, the faculty, at whatever level, as long as the normal right to control is being exercised, then that person could change the decision. So if they delegate most admissions decisions, as I understand from the record, to the faculty, but they still regularly, besides race, veto some of those decisions, and race is now one of them, then the Board of Regents can do that normally. So could the president, if that's the way it's normally done. It's when the process is ­­ political process has changed specifically and only for race, as a constitutional amendment here was intended to do, that the political doctrine is violated. Have I restated?",
  "Diversity does, but when you take away a tool for diversity that's what Seattle is saying is wrong.",
  "You can't take the tool away simply because it may include race as a factor, simply because you are changing the playing field.",
  "I'm sorry. I thought the court below said that that was irrelevant to the resolution of this case, that even if they accepted your date for when the proof of loss started, that you would still lose.",
  "I'm a little confused because it would be the same no matter what rule we instituted.",
  "Meaning, you would never know when the administrative ­­ you really never know when the administration process is final, just like you're arguing you don't know when the proof of loss date is final. But at least the advantage of proof of loss, you know you got three years from at least the beginning of the process.",
  "That can only help you. That can only help you. It gives you more time, but it doesn't take time away from you.",
  "You have three years, no matter what. From the first date, you have three years.",
  "If you need more time, you have a potential out.",
  "Counsel, if we rule in your favor ­­ I'm sorry, against you ­­ and just say the plans can do this, do you see any reason why the government couldn't pass a regulation saying you've got to give people at least a year from the end of the administrative process to file?",
  "I'm going to ask them that question.",
  "But are you aware of anything that would stop them from doing that?",
  "If we rule in your favor, however, they would be estopped from passing a regulation requiring something different than what we say, correct?",
  "Counsel, I could be more troubled by this case if the proof of loss provision required a suit to be brought in a year because as I'm adding up the timeframe, it's about 15 months if no exceptions remain for the administrative process. Could you answer my question on whether you see any impediment if we rule against you in this case, to the department saying something like, you've got to give at least a year, from the finality of the administrative process? Could you pass such a regulation later?",
  "Well, what would your argument be if ­­ if this ­­ if ERISA said there is a minimum 3­year statute of limitations? Would your argument be identical today or would that be a clearer demonstration that Congress intended that the background principle that that starts from, the exhaustion of administrative process, be incorporated?",
  "So do you require an explicit agreement that the start is going to be different as well?",
  "That you can shorten or lengthen a limitations period, but this is not about shortening or lengthening a limitations period. This is about changing a start time for the limitations period. Do you require something explicit ­­ an explicit statement as to that as well?",
  "Right.",
  "So you think Congress would only legislate in that way?",
  "You think Congress would only legislate that way? Do you have any examples of that, of Congress saying the limitations period starts at the end of the administrative process and is for 3 years or 1 year?",
  "That's much better.",
  "What case is that?",
  "I—I see the government's strongest argument as being that um the grand jury finding of probable cause is sacrosanct, and a hearing like the one that you are proposing would call the validity of that finding into question. Why don't you address that because we­we ­­ you were talking about, in bail, the validity of the charges are not at issue, just one factor in the court's determination of whether to restrain him or her is the strength of the government's case. Are you trying to draw a similar analogy here?",
  "There is at least five who are ruling similarly to yours.",
  "Just as a footnote, one in a million, which might be your case. I think that's the point.",
  "We would, presumably, if ­­ like here ­­ if there's a legal dispute and the government thinks the judge is wrong, they would try the case and go up on appeal and say to the appellate court the judge below was wrong initially.",
  "You would have lost the money in that case, but ­­",
  "Do you have to go that ­­ I mean, your adversary just said that there was a judicial finding of no probable cause. I­ I don't know why that judicial finding has any legal effect, other than to release the money at issue. The judge is basically saying, like he does in a bail hearing, this evidence is not the strongest I've seen. In balancing the government's desire for restraint and the fundamental right to hire a lawyer of choice, it's not strong enough in this situation with money. I don't see it, as a legal determination, of no probable cause. I see it as defining the word \"may\" in the statute. If the judge has discretion, that discretion has to be informed by something.",
  "How often has that happened in the five circuits?",
  "And that's the whole point, which is you talk about compulsion on the government, but the compulsion of the defendant not to have a hearing because they are required to say something that could put them at greater risk, whether it's because of the enhancements for obstruction of justice or merely from losing the advantage of their defense at trial, that's why these hearings are so rare. I think it's less about the government not wanting to disclose its case and more about the inducements against the defense wanting to preview its case.",
  "Can I go back to the line drawing?",
  "Can I go back to the line drawing?",
  "A question that some of my colleagues have focused on. If we're to say that this was not compelled speech, presumably, there'd be no reason the government couldn't use this report, whether or not the defendant put his or her mental state at issue, because if it's not compelled, you could use it as affirmative evidence, correct?",
  "Seems a somewhat ­­",
  "If I may finish?",
  "Assuming that I'm troubled by that holding, then what's the line we draw with respect to the question Justice Kennedy asked you as to when it is permissible. You're saying, let's just rule on the base. When the defendant puts on an expert, we can rebut with an expert. But the broader question of if he puts his mental state at issue without an expert, could you do it? Could you still put on his examination? I'm not sure you've really answered that question ­­",
  "­­ which is how broadly do we hold? There's a waiver whenever you put in your mental state at issue, or is it a waiver only when you use an expert, and then the government is free to respond with a compelled statement?",
  "Well, I'm presuming that if a defendant takes the stand and says something completely contrary to what he tells a government psychiatrist, that you would rely on the Brown line of cases, that you could cross­examine him on the contrary statement to the psychiatrist.",
  "Well, that would be a different issue. I'm just talking about whatever statements he made. But don't ­­ the light is on.",
  "Mr. Katyal, assuming the incredulity of my colleagues continues with your argument, which way would you rather lose?",
  "On a waiver theory or on a lack of compulsion theory? And pick one and tell us the reason why that's preferable to the other.",
  "But that's scope issues. That's not right issues.",
  "I'm not quite sure I understand why we shouldn't follow the Simmons analogy because, as I understand it, we haven't ruled on the last question of whether you can use the compelled statements as impeachment. But if we assume that to be the case, most circuits who have addressed the issue, and I think it may be all of them, have said you can because there's a waiver of your Fourth Amendment right when you take the stand to impeachment. Why couldn't we follow a similar reasoning here, which is, you're compelled to ­­ I'm sorry. Forget it. I can answer my own question.",

So I agree that a definition that says anything that covers the body might go too far. But I do have a problem with things that look like clothes. If I don't buy your ­­ your argument that fire­resistant pants and shirts are not clothes, where would you propose I draw the line?

  "Does that include a SCUBA tank?",

  "­­ the statute requires named plaintiffs as opposed to ­­ named or unnamed plaintiffs, but plaintiffs.",
  "So how do you remand a case when it involves unnamed plaintiffs? Not a proposed class because you ­­ if you have a proposed class, that could be persons, and you could identify those. But under your theory, what does a court do to figure out which of all of those unnamed people have claims above or below $75,000?",
  "You know, this language is very reminiscent in what's in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20, the joinder rule.",
  "And if I look at the joinder rule, it uses \"persons\" and \"plaintiffs\" essentially in the same way. It's talking about persons being proposed plaintiffs, as opposed to unnamed people ­­",

Assume that I believe that if you have knowledge of the gun, and that I am participating in the crime with your knowledge of that gun, whether the knowledge is secured before the crime starts or during the crime, if I continue to participate in the crime knowing that you have a gun, then that's knowledge of the gun and intent to facilitate. I thought the example that you were relying on here or the issue that got confused in the briefs was whether or not, from the sequence of facts in this case, you can actually discern that intent to facilitate the crime because the alleged shooter, which your client said was someone else, jumped into the car and the car took off before anybody could abandon the crime. That's what I actually thought this case was about: At what juncture do you instruct the jury to say that you have to be a participant with knowledge of the crime? But you're saying something different right now. You're almost suggesting that there has to be a pre­knowledge that the gun will be used.",
  "I'm hard to imagine that. Give me an example.",
  "What would the instruction look like?",
  "To ­­ to ­­ what would it look like to capture the difference you're trying to convey?",
  "Well, then you come ­­",
  "­­ you come up against the government's argument that you don't have to facilitate every element.",
  "Could you talk practically about what the difficulties are for the government in these scenarios? It's nice to put hypotheticals in where you know, where you say someone knew X, Y and Z. The reality is in most cases you don't. Occasionally you get a co­conspirator that will tell you, but in most cases you have just the act. A defendant is present during a crime, a gun is pulled, and he leaves with his cohorts. You don't know whether he had advance knowledge that the gun would be used because he wasn't carrying it and he may have done nothing but be present during the crime, left, and got a split of the money later, correct?",
  "That's your point, right?",
  "That's your ­­",
  "So isn't this really an argument about how you define facilitation? You are not arguing that ­­ that some form of participation in the crime with knowledge that the gun is being used is required. You are really arguing about how far the proof has to go.",
  "Because your adversary keeps saying mere knowledge that the gun's being used is not enough.",
  "What is so hard about saying, did you have knowledge that the gun would be used, either ­­ and you facilitate ­­ but you continue to facilitate the crime?",
  "­­ the underlying crime.",
  "Knowing that a gun would be used. You had to intentionally participate knowing that a gun would be used.",
  "Finish.",
  "What do you make of the language in Randolph about pretext?",
  "Yes. Does it help you in any way?",
  "Sure. Because all they have to do is arrest and remove people.",
  "So what's left of Randolph if we accept your rule­­ all the police have to do is arrest anyone if they have probable cause, and if they don't, all they have to do is remove them from the premises and just talk to the co­tenant even though they've heard an objection?",
  "When is Randolph ever going to survive after this, assuming we accept your rule?",
  "So there's nothing left to Randolph. The police just remove the person.",
  "Remove them to the stoop, into the police car, to the station? How far before Randolph dies?",
  "Did Matlock ­­ there was no objecting defendant.",
  "It's the presumption that still survived, that absent an objection you have a consent, you assume whoever has control over the premises has consented. That's a different situation. That's not Matlock. Matlock doesn't control here.",
  "I'm ­­ I'm a little confused. I thought that when the cotenants gave permission to search, that gave permission to open anything in the premises, to search the entire premises. You're talking about a locked closet or a locked box. Why would it ­­",
  "I own the house.",
  "I'm letting the person use it by sufferance, not by ­­ but it's still my closet.",
  "I would certainly recommend to every married couple now to have a prenuptial agreement on access rights.",
  "Why did they need to search?",
  "Why did they need to search? I mean, to look around the house, yes, but if this is a search only for purposes of domestic violence what in her story made them think there was evidence anywhere that was locked up that had ­­ that there had been any time to lock it up or dispose of it?",
  "I think this was just a pure: We want to ­­ we want to find something else.",
  "So they were looking for evidence not on the ground that they arrested him on, but on an independent crime?",
  "Did they have probable cause to get a warrant?",
  "Once he was identified, did they have probable cause to get a warrant?",
  "How about a clear answer? Getting a warrant.",
  "Get a ­­ when you have probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, and here clearly you admit there would have been probable cause to search, there's no exigency, there's no looking for evidence related to the crime that drew you particularly there, the screaming, but you've just got to secure the premises and get a warrant. I don't know why that's so difficult for police officers to understand. Your first obligation under the Fourth Amendment is get a warrant.",
  "So why isn't that the property that Justice Kennedy referred to? They ­­ the union paid $100,000 to get the items that the employer gave them. So aren't they valued, something tangible, valued for what the union paid for it?",
  "But why? Well, the ­­ the argument that Justice Scalia and Kennedy are referring to it, is that the employer paid with the employee list, the access to the facility, the promises not to strike to get the 100,000.",
  "I think that is the essence of ­­ because the union paying money is not a violation of the Act.",
  "Right.",
  "Counsel, it's clear that there's some difficulty in defining the limits of property. There are some things that I think have value even though they may not have market value. For example, a union—­ a­­ an employer bribing a union steward by offering him a favorable work schedule or ­­ or days off that are a weekend or something that's valuable to the worker but doesn't necessarily have an objective value. The government cites Credit Suisse v. Billing in its brief. When you get up on rebuttal, I want to talk to you about the ­­ the law that has developed in that case and why it doesn't apply here.",
  "Isn't Billing your best argument, the framework of Billing?",
  "Some people have suggested that Billings is limited to the antitrust area.",
  "And how do you respond to that belief and ­­ and how do you convince us to expand the doctrine outside its traditional context?",
  "Counsel, why don't ­­ why doesn't the Billings ­­ Billing framework apply beautifully here?",
  "What it holds is that where there's a regulatory framework, and here there is, that produces standards of conduct, going to Justice Kagan's point, that almost all of the three things that you're arguing against are standards of conduct that have been approved by ­­ have been approved by the government, and when those conflict with the separate Federal statute, then they are implicitly preempted, essentially. Why doesn't that doctrine do the work here?",
  "But we have conflicting provisions within standard statutes anyway, so why doesn't the concept behind it still apply?",
  "You would argue that the three items in dispute ­­ the access to property, etc. ­­ that the consideration is the agreement to go into arbitration, first of all, putting aside the hundred thousand dollars.",
  "The arbitration of disputes that was promised by the employer and the union under this agreement.",
  "Not to strike.",
  "Mr. McCracken ­­",
  "If I understood the circuit below, it was suggesting, like the government, that an exchange of agreements for purposes of peaceful recognition, terms that were given for that purpose were legal, but that things given for ­­ that were not solely for recognition, but had value outside of that, like money, would be wrong. That 100,000 is troubling to me because I think what the circuit was saying is if the 100,000 bought the peaceful recognition provisions, then that's corrupt, and that is outside the exemptions that the law provides. That's how I read its decision. Tell me why I'm wrong about that and tell me how I deal with that niggling problem I have about the $100,000, because it does feel like a bribe to the employer.",
  "I don't think it ­­ it was puzzled by the provisions at issue. I think it was puzzled by the 100,000.",
  "Mr. Goldstein, do you take the position that parties can't, by contract, say, this particular precondition is ­­ goes to my ­­ to the parties' consent to arbitrate?",
  "All right. So if the issue is what did the parties ­­ as I see it ­­ what did the parties intend on this question, why isn't the first options Howsam divide the one that we should follow in this setting? The Solicitor General is suggesting that we shouldn't follow that. We should give some sort of heightened deference to the foreign state, but I'm not sure why because the issue is always about what did the parties intend. And, if the issue is always about that, don't we look at the text, the custom and practice of the industry, the behavior between the parties? Don't we look at all of the factors we normally look at in deciding whether something goes to a substantive or procedural issue?",
  "All right. So it's not that we hold, absolutely, that in every situation a precondition is subject to an arbitral decision. We look to those ­­ to the issue of consent, don't we?",

  "Could you finish your answer?",
  "Counsel, before you go on, could you address the jurisdiction question for me? I'm not sure why you're here. The only injunction that I see was entered on behalf of Little ­­ Little Traverse's and not on behalf of the State. But ­­ and so, the counts that you're arguing about were added after the injunction was issued. How do you have jurisdiction to act ­­ to argue someone else's injunction?",
  "That, in fact, is not what the district court said. The district court explicitly said in its order granting the injunction that the State hadn't filed an injunction, hadn't intervened, and had only filed supporting papers in support of Little Traverse's case. I'm a little ­­ I'm very, very confused as I look at what the district court said. It explicitly said you weren't part of the order.",
  "I think \"consolidated\" can have two meanings and ­­ and ­­ to be heard together or to be joined together. I don't think the district court understood that this was going to be joined together. Why did it say what it did?",
  "So why didn’t you file an injunction ­­ why does your brief say that you filed it only in support of Little Traverse and not on your own behalf?",
  "I'll ask ­­ I'll ask your opposition, but I don't see why the district court would have made the point it did, if it believed that it was dealing with both of you as parties.",
  "No, but we have to ­­ we have to, if we're not sure, raise any jurisdictional issue.",
  "Well, it wasn't eminently clear to the district court who entered the order.",
  "All roads lead to one issue, I think. If you had gotten a declaratory judgment, they would have had to stop their gaming activity.",
  "But you wouldn't have gotten their property; isn't that what this suit is about, you trying to take over the ­­ the casino?",
  "So why not Ex Parte Young? You point to one or two cases in the lower courts that suggest there not might be Ex Parte Young jurisdiction, but those cases are distinguishable. So why not go after just the officials?",
  "But all you wanted to do was stop them from doing the gaming casino.",
  "You would have gotten that.",
  "Could I ask you a question?",
  "Could I ask you a question? What ­­ what would happen if this were Indian lands, and they went ahead and did exactly what they did? They ­­ there was no dispute that these were Indian lands. Would you have had grounds to object to them building a casino on these lands.",
  "You would not?",
  "All right. The issue of what constitutes Indian lands is between the Federal government and the Indians, pursuant to the Land Trust Settlement, correct?",
  "Well, I know you do, and I know why you do. But ­­ but what defines the lands is the Settlement Trust, correct?",
  "Put ­­ put this aside of gambling. Let's assume that it was just their buying this land.",
  "Could you have stopped the buying of this land or unravelled it? Didn't we have a recent decision that said no?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, wouldn't you have had to follow ­­ if you were going to object to this land being taken into the land trust, wouldn't you have had to follow the administrative process?",
  "How do you win in an arbitration when the gaming commission has said it's not Indian lands? I mean, I actually am not sure that the ruling of the district court was right on this, okay? But putting my own beliefs ­­ or questions about that ruling, how do you win if the Federal government has said it's not Indian lands?",
  "But how does the arbitration board change the mind of the gaming commission? Aren't they the final deciders of whether this is trust land or not?",
  "Just so we understand ­­",
  "What happens if you can't convince the Federal government that these are Indian lands, and despite the gaming commission's final ruling, there is no other way to overturn it, you decide to operate the casino, it's not Indian lands by the Federal government, you haven't convinced them otherwise, what occurs at that moment?",
  "Who can stop you and using what mechanisms?",
  "Well, the compact only comes into play if it's Indian lands. But, if the Federal government has said it's not Indian lands, that's what I'm asking.",
  "Then go back to the beginning question. You have remedies you don't like, but the waiver under IGRA is not for damages. It's only for injunctive relief. You have that in Ex Parte Young. Why are you asking us to waive sovereign immunity with respect to damages?",
  "Did a unitary contract?",
  "I'm not sure I understand that point.",
  "Mr. Clement, you're making ­­ you're making an assumption. The claim here is not whether he abused or didn't abuse the program. His allegation is that the only reason you terminated with a contract was because you wanted to get rid of these high flyers in your merger negotiations with the other airline. That's the same as saying, they didn't terminate me because I abused the program, they terminated me because I was of a certain race, or I was a woman, or I was handicapped, or some other improper consideration. So are you suggesting that this contract permits you to use that kind of self ­­ that kind of ground, one not grounded in the contract, but grounded in your whim and caprice?",
  "Even if you have absolute discretion, isn't there a limit to that? Isn't there a limit of reasonableness to that absolute discretion? That's the whole question of ­­ otherwise, you have a contract with no substance.",
  "Could I give you ­­ I'm quoting the Minnesota ­­",
  "So let's go back to a simpler standard.",
  "My simpler standard comes from quoting Hennepin. \"Does the implied covenant claim extend to actions beyond the scope of the underlying contract, or can it override the express terms of an agreement? If the answer is no, it's not preempted.\" Is that an okay statement.",
  "So, if that's what Minnesota law says, it's okay, and it's not preempted.",
  "What was the lack of good faith that you are claiming? If they thought he was abusive, or are you saying ­­ what are you saying was the bad faith, what action?",
  "It can't be that ­­",
  "­­ because there has to be ­­ what are you saying was the bad cause here? Assume their answer, that he was abusing the program.",
  "That's ­­",
  "So you are doing exactly what he is saying. You are saying that their judgment of abuse is not enough.",
  "Tell me why the answer to that question doesn't end this case here? You're disparaging the goods of a person. You're saying that it's illegal to use that person's products. It seems to me that's the essence of the Lanham Act, as it's now written.",
  "Except there are two remedies under this statute, injunctive relief and damages. And to the extent that proximate cause always limits the recovery on damages, it doesn't limit injunctive relief issues. And so the question is, why should we be reading into a statute a limitation against bringing any action based on your proximate cause point when there are other remedies in this statute?",
  "So what's wrong ­­ what's wrong with the tests adopted by three circuits, the reasonable interest test?",
  "What do you see as the difference between reasonable interest and zone of interest? What do you ­­ I haven't quite understood what the difference is between the two.",
  "Could you tell me how that would affect a situation that I read about in the papers, where a company like ­­ not to suggest that they have, but only using this as a hypothetical example ­­ McDonald's says, in its advertising, we, in fact ­­ our calorie count is less than ­­ than 200, so buy from us. Consumers, under your theory, can't sue under the Lanham Act. Assume that's absolutely true ­­ false. Who would be ­­ who would have a permissible ground to sue in that situation?",
  "All right. So fit in that into your definition of what \"standing\" is ­­",
  "­­ how do we not get it to be the local ­­ or maybe you say it's okay ­­ the ­­ the local restaurant that has no franchises, that does healthy meals, which is actually true of many restaurants today, particularly in Washington.",
  "But I'm not sure that I can ­­ that I follow that completely. When I look at the list of items mentioned in the statute ­­ reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation ­­ I don't think of command separate from operational control or being run by and used by the military. Each of those terms has an operational quality to it that mere ownership, which I equate with command, doesn't. It makes no sense, in answer to Justice Alito's question, to say you need notice, unless that facility has a military flavor to it that someone could know about. And you talk about this particular camp, but you've got a whole green line around it to tell people which sections you are actually considering the camp, and he was found outside of that green area. You've got a public school, a public highway. I'm not quite sure how you can keep a person off of lands that the military is not using in its operations.",
  "Well, you close down ­­ you close down roads for parades. You close down areas for other public needs.",
  "He couldn't go to the public school, though? Or the stores or any other facilities that the public's invited to?",
  "It seems such an odd thing for a Class B misdemeanor to be used to protect the national security; that Congress has determined that the threat is so great, that the only thing you need is a Class B misdemeanor to protect the U.S.",
  "There are some pretty severe ones.",
  "Why are you buying into the real property being the definition here at all? I mean, it seems to me that when I read the ­­ the other definitions of the statute, I keep going back to that it's a function analysis and not a real property analysis because that would answer why this particular electrical meter reading ­­ that area still being operated by the military for a military function, that's what forts do, reservations, yards, I don't know why we would read installation any differently. But you're buying into this real property as being the defining term.",
  "I'm sorry. I have the same problem that Justice Breyer has. PXes belong to the military, generally, the land, but they are run by outside contractors, sometimes. Are you saying because they've given up exclusive control of the PX, that they fail your test? So does the utility company. I don't know if it's possible that military bases generate their own utilities, but I presume that, somewhere, they don't, and they have an easement to drive up and read their meters. There may be easements for repairs of certain underground things that ­­ that supply the base. That's not exclusive control, so I'm ­­ or possession. So what ­­ what does your test mean?",
  "So that ­­ that road for the public utility for which there is an easement of travel is not exclusive to the U.S.? So anybody can travel into the base at any time they want to?",
  "I'm sorry. What's so difficult about simply saying he's angry? Why choose the word \"mentally unstable\"? Isn't it with an intent to connote something more than the facts?",
  "Well, yes, but from facts. So isn't there a difference between saying someone's angry and someone's mentally ill ­­",
  "­­ has a mental problem or is mentally unstable? Don't you think that the intent is to convey something else?",
  "Then you disagree with Justice Scalia? He drew a distinction between two forms of materiality, whether something's materially false, meaning is it misleading; that, presumably, would go to a jury. But whether or not this misleading statement would be material to the TSA or to security officers is a question for the court. You disagree with that position by him?",
  "I ­­ I actually would like your opinion, the SG's opinion, on whether this is an issue for the court or the jury. I mean, you don't have to fight us. What ­­ what is your view?",
  "So other than proving at trial that these statements were misleadingly false ­­ or false, how did you prove that the statements would have had an effect on a reasonable security officer?",
  "How do you ­­ what's the evidence that you expect parties to present and what was it you presented to show that their response would have been different?",
  "I'm sorry. Tell me the difference between having a huge effect on that listener's mind and the listener taking a different action? I'm not sure how ­­ what the difference is.",
  "I'm more upset ­­",
  "­­ but ­­ I'm more concerned, but I'm going to take the identical action?",
  "I thought I read somewhere that, after this incident, there was a discussion between or among Mr. Doyle and various government agencies to figure out how to avoid something like this in the future.",
  "Who testified? Doyle?",
  "And what was your sense ­­ I don't remember the testimony now. What ­­",
  "Well, how do we decide what a reasonable security officer would do?",
  "How does ­­ how ­­ how do we as judges? I'm not sure how juries would do it, I'm not quite sure how judges would do it. So what evidence did you proffer? He says he had an expert. What did you have at trial?",
  "Yeah, but we don't decide whether it was reasonable force, if we think there's a question about that.",
  "No, no. Not a question of historical ­­ if there's a question about how a reasonable officer would respond. There's competing experts. Who decides that question?",
  "And there are some levels of ­­ of force that we can say, as a matter of law, don't qualify as excessive, and we have said that. But when have we said that what might be excessive to one ­­ to some, is a jury question ­­ is a judge ­­",
  "Wouldn't this view contradict 54(d)(2)? What do we do with that? If we accept your analysis that we should superimpose just a flat rule that all fees are not ­­",
  "I ­­ I'm a little confused. So is your rule that if a fee is made by ­­ if a request is made by motion, whether it's contractual or statutory, that that then becomes a separate judgment and not a part of the final merits?",
  "All right. So you're not blocking a party from coming in and saying, you've got a ­­ how will a union know or a claiming party know whether or not you'll come back later and say you should have given it to the jury?",
  "So what do we do with the auditor's fees, which aren't traditional attorneys' fees, and those hadn't been decided in this case? So why is the judgment, nevertheless, final, putting aside the attorneys' fees question? Why is the merits final when the auditor's fees weren't?",
  "So articulate, again, for me your rule. Would it go something like this: To the extent that a party leaves attorneys' fees for after trial, it then ­­ that's a separate judgment that will not run the finality of the prior judgment?",
  "But ­­ but you're proposing not to estop parties if they choose to put this issue to a jury?",
  "If you’re saying, if they don't, then they have to treat it as the judgment that comes out of the contract dispute as final, the other aspects of it.",
  "You would argue to the contrary, no, that a rule that says wait till the end of everything that needs to be decided in the case, that's the finality rule, and that's the idea behind the finality rule.",
  "Let's be a little more precise. Your notice of motion referenced ERISA alone. The supporting affidavit mentions both, and the district court opinion mentioned only ERISA.",
  "So you didn't mention the contract in your notice of motion.",
  "Would you tell me what page you're reading from?",
  "Of the Joint Appendix?",
  "Mr. Stewart ­­",
  "Mr. Stewart, below, the government conceded that there was a theoretical possibility that some States could be overcontrolled, that they would be implementing measures that would reduce their contributions to pollution below the one percent. Assume that ­­ I think there's a theoretical possibility of that ­­ but that your approach was basically fine. What would we do about that? First of all, are there measures States can take to get out of the FIP, if it's inappropriate to them, because of overcontrol? And if not ­­ and how do they do it? I mean, what's the process? If we think there's a flaw, do we vacate the rule? Do we leave it in place? What do we do? And what ­­ and what's our power to do it?",
  "If we were to rule against you and affirm the decision below, how long do you think it would take to get a new rule in place?",
  "But you're not prevented from giving a counter SIP, is what they were being told. You can ­­ you can counter, is what the government is saying, and so it's not clear, to me, that they've estopped you from doing your own SIP.",
  "So what's the difference? If you think they're wrong, you give a counter SIP, and you duke it out with them in terms of what you think ­­ where you think they are wrong as applied to you. But let me ask you something fundamental about this. Are you challenging the transport rule using cost? Or are you just challenging the process in which that was achieved? Because, if I understand all the amici briefs and the theory of this, not even you would want a command­and­control regulation; is that correct?",
  "It'd be crazy if they didn't, right?",
  "Right. And for some of them, it would really be a bad idea, wouldn't it?",
  "But they were doing that with respect to the NAAQS. I thought that was them saying they had to quantify the NAAQS.",
  "Haven't some States already challenged that? Isn't that pending below? Why should we be looking at that issue here, when States have challenged that?",
  "I don't know why the rest didn't, but three of them have. So why should we enter the fray anticipatorily? Isn't that an issue we should wait and see what EPA says below?",
  "No, no, no. This is a very discrete question, that they've already approved some ­­ some SIPs. Three States have already challenged the fact that they shouldn't be required to meet a new standard because they've already had an old standard approved. That seems, to me, a very discrete challenge, and three States have undertaken it.",
  "Well, I don't know why, but that's a different issue. Even though it has, wouldn't it be more prudent for us to wait for that administrative process to finish before we venture into this question? That's my ­­ my point.",
  "Isn't that the issue that the three States are challenging below, just that discrete issue, about whether the EPA can call this a corrective action or not? Isn't that entire issue being determined in ­­ in those proceedings?",
  "But that issue is what's at issue there, part of the ­­",
  "Do you battle Mr. Stewart's point that Congress surely didn't intend to shut down these plants if they didn't or couldn't feasibly reduce their contributions?",
  "So if they couldn't feasibly do it, doesn't the words \"significantly contribute\" have to take into account, in some way, the cost of reducing the amount?",
  "Well, they found a way to do that with the cost tradeoff with the cap and trade system ­­",
  "­­ because the industry itself can make that choice, with the State, presumably. They're not stopping a SIP that stops a State from participating.",
  "They say that's not a theoretical possibility, under the numbers they've worked out. So why isn't this taken care of in the process that permits individual States to challenge this as applied?",
  "I'm going to let you answer his question, but, yes, they had a regulation, so why didn't they copy the regulation?",
  "It would have been much, much simpler to say this is limited to F2A beneficiaries than to write it the way they did and say this is to everybody who ages out.",
  "Answer him, and then ­­",
  "That is strange because I look at (h)(3), which talks about automatic conversion of battered spouses, of widowed spouses, and I think, under your reading, you're basically saying Congress was not intending to let those people jump the line. Am I correct.",

  "Oh, there's automatic ­­",

  "That they ­­ that they were entitled to the same benefits of automatic conversion as (h)(3)?",
  "So you can have automatic ­­",
  "You can have automatic conversion only in the situations that give you other ­­ other statutes.",
  "Is that for F2A children as well?",
  "These steps, are they applied to F2A?",
  "Yes ­­ not derivatives. I'm talking about the children of spouses.",

  "All right. You're only talking about his second argument.",
  "Do you think it would have been okay for the trial court to instruct the jury that they could use the defendant's silence against him? Would the affirmative statement have been constitutional and not a violation of the Fifth Amendment?",
  "No, I didn't ask about Kentucky law. Do you think the Fifth Amendment permits the judge to have said, use silence?",
  "Use silence to punish him because he's just a bad person.",
  "I mean, that doesn't ­­",
  "Well, there was a factual dispute as to how much the witness ­­ the victim had suffered. How about a statement about that?",
  "Could you call him, to ask him if he feels sorry? If he has no Fifth Amendment right, could you call him to the stand and ask him, are you sorry?",
  "I'm sorry. What did you just say?",
  "But Mitchell did, though, the sentencing aspect.",
  "Mitchell was about sentencing.",
  "Nothing ­­ zero equals zero.",
  "And the zero just can't be added onto or taken away from. Zero is zero, not a positive, not a negative.",
  "So you can't take away from the zero, create evidence from his silence, just as you can't from his silence outweigh the aggravating circumstances; correct?",
  "But we could ­­",
  "Did the prosecutor argue that?",
  "So how would they have put that on the scale?",
  "If the only criteria to determine harmlessness is the gruesome ­­ gruesome nature of the crime, it appears to me that, in almost every death­eligible case I've come across, gruesomeness is inherent. By your argument, there's never a case in which a defendant can prove a harmful sentencing error.",
  "But the mitigation was very close to Wiggins.",
  "Was very close to the Wiggins case.",
  "The mitigation evidence offered here was very close to the Wiggins case ­­ similar mitigation.",
  "And there, we held there was harmful error.",
  "I'm sorry. That's turning legislative history, in my mind, on its head. They considered directly, if you study the SG's brief, a discovery rule that would have codified equitable tolling. And there was lengthy discussion about it and a decision that they wouldn't do that, that, instead, they would expand the period to a year where automatic return was required, and they introduced the best interest of the child after that year, and that that was now a balancing of all interests, the parents' and the child's. And you're right, they had other provisions that would affect the possible return or lack thereof, and they never wanted to stop a court from returning a child if it in its equitable discretion decided it was appropriate. But you're turning that legislative history on its head a little bit.",
  "Don't use up your time.",
  "What's the fairness ­­ you're each ­­ you're each using the child as the tool in the objective that you have in representing the parents. On the one side is the allegation of inequitable conduct in concealment. On the other side is the interest in settlement. That's a dispute between the two parents, and the child is being used as ­­ as ­­ I don't know what ­­ you know, a tool in implementing those conflicting considerations. And to the extent that the Convention was designed to deter that kind of kidnapping, it adopted a ­­ a fairly strict rule. And you're each trying to say, oh, the rule doesn't mean what it means because, don't worry, we'll take those considerations into account in addressing custody; and on the other side, well, don't worry because there's not that much difference between 12 and 13. So how are we supposed to decide between those two conflicting considerations of the parents while maintaining the paramount concern, certainly not the exclusive one, but the significant one, in the interest of the child.",

What sense does this make when ­­ that a child who ­­ a suit is filed within the year, but the litigation takes two or the child who ­­ the filing is a day after the year, and the litigation takes a year and they're both in the same situation. Why should those two children be treated differently? Why should one have the benefit of settled now and the other not have it?",
  "What sense does it make when, as Justice Alito indicated, part of the central purposes of the Convention is to avoid the kidnapping of children?",
  "So why isn't Article 13 enough protection? It has to do with ­­ and unlike Justice Scalia, I don't think it's psychological or physical harm necessarily by the parent, but by the situation.",

  "That's the one year.",
  "Counsel, whatever fears my colleagues have, I've only found two ­­ or I should say my clerks have only found two published decisions in which courts have returned the child, so it's not as if they are ignoring the settlement issue. In fact, some might say that they are not giving abduction enough weight in ­­ in enough cases. But I ­­ the Hong Kong court who said there might not be discretion to return a settled child was not the highest court of Hong Kong, either.",
  "And so, if we're going to give uniform meaning, the uniform meaning of international weight is that abduction is one factor for a court to consider in its equitable weighing on settlement because that's the whole purpose of the Convention. That's a central reason in the preamble.",

  "So what do you need ­­ why does the President have to adjourn the House in your example?",

  "My problem is ­­ my problem is that I read the sentence and it lops off its beginning.

So how could a party legitimately, whether the trustee or anyone else, make any claims to the exempt property?",

  "That's your strongest argument, that Justice Souter ­­",

So if the code doesn't permit full recovery for fraud, why should a court be permitted to do it?",

  "It reviewed this case de novo.",
  "And it decided that there were no issues, no factual issues in dispute and that the law clearly applied the way it did. I don't understand why that option was taken away from it on appellate review.",

  "Johnson relied on a number of things, but the two were the use of felony and the use of the word \"violent force,\" which is not what this statute does. It just ­­ it uses a common law term, the use of physical force. That's why you are asking us to import the common law in this context.",
  "You're asking us to use the terms in their common law sense because of the nature of this ­­ of this provision.",
  "You're suggesting that you can commit a crime of violence because you have to use violent force. You could commit it simply by using an automatic weapon that requires no force to pull the trigger.

But when the misdemeanor ­­ when the ­­ when the State ­­ when this exemption uses the words or this requirement uses the word \"misdemeanor domestic violence,\" why should we stray from the common law there?",

  "Can you give me an example of that? I mean, I think most statutes I know just say causing physical injury.",
  "It doesn't say any level of pain. It says any level of physical injury. So assume physical injury has been caused. We can argue on the margins of what ­­ what qualifies as physical injury.

  "So let's break this down. You're not arguing that there's something wrong with a union qua union. Is there anything wrong with the State saying, we're not going to negotiate with any employee who's not a member of the union?",
  "All right. Is there a problem for the State to say ­­ the union, to organize, has a certain amount of costs. So putting aside fair representation laws, could the State say, this is what we're going to pay police officers, $100, but we're going to pay union members $110 to reimburse them for the cost of negotiation. Would that be okay?",
  "So there's no problem here with the representation. Your problem is with the fair share?",
  "But what stops the ­­ the non ­­ the people who oppose a union policy from sending a letter, asking a meeting, expressing their disapproval in any forum they want and in any way they want, to whatever policy a union is advocating? Is there anything that stops them from doing that?",

  "Mr. Smith, I think that there's ­­ I must say that I might have labored under it. From your adversary's statement, it appears as if there's a belief that the Federal Government sets a fixed amount, and that's what the State has to pay.

And so that's the kind of policy I'm talking about, which is break down the remedies and tell me ­­ I'm more moved by the fact that someone could take over your copyright than I am by your injunctive relief argument.",

  "Well, if it has not, then we're back to the point I made. Are you disagreeing with the Government's position that the Court has equitable power in injunctive relief to decide how much you pay forward?",
  "I don't understand. Why didn't you just go in and get a declaratory judgment when you first heard from her?",
  "Counsel, she was going to get this copyright when her father died. Under no circumstance, even if she had sued in '92, could she have brought a claim in the 1960s. She didn't have a copyright then.",
  "Your complaint is not against the witness dying. Your complaint is about what Congress does, which is to give a person the right to keep a copyright or renew it when the individual with whom you probably dealt with is dead. That's always going to be the case.",
  "That is true about the Ninth Circuit, but between the Second, Sixth, Tenth, and Eleventh, I always ­­ I thought those circuits announced laches are available, but only in an exceptional circumstance. And I actually don't know how many cases they barred suit ­­ copyright suit on ­­ completely on the basis of laches.",

  "White suggested that we don't have an absolute rule with respect to requiring independent corroboration of the actual illegal conduct.

  "Could I ask you a follow­up to Justice Kagan? Now that's a fifth interpretation by your side. That to me is the quintessential ambiguity in a statute where we give deference to the agency. So if your side can't even come to one interpretation, why shouldn't we defer to the agency?",
  "Well, it hasn't rewritten them. All it has said, as I understand it, and I don't understand ­­ other than your view that there are too many people it's regulating, is that we can't implement it immediately, because it would overburden us administratively. It hasn't said that over time, with streamlining and with other adjustments, that it can't do this. It's just said we can't do it right away.",

  "So what do I do with the examples in the brief of the 144 permits that have already been given, people who have managed to come into compliance under BACT?",
  "Counsel, I have two related questions. The first is, what your client got was money, and I don't know why it's impossible, impractical or inadequate to measure the loss by the amount he got and order him or her to pay it. He can pay it on a payment schedule, on any ­­ in any way that the court wants him to pay it. So I don't know why we're in (b)(1) or (b)(2) at all because I don't see where the impracticality comes in. Answer that. But then, secondly, it's not clear to me that we're thinking about this right. There seems to be no dispute that a loss to the victim is the amount that the victim is spending to sell the property and recoup the money, and you don't seem to be taking issue with that.",
  "And 36 ­­ 3663(2) appears to be the return of the property at sentencing or sometime thereafter.",
  "So it doesn't seem to be controlling earlier return of property, and yet we're sort of stuck in that model that somehow it has to be an either/or. The earlier date of return or on the date of sentencing. But shouldn't it be ­­ and this follows up on Justice Kennedy's question ­­ shouldn't it be at the time the investor can reasonably secure something from the return of that property, the date of sale? If we're letting them recoup the expenses of sale, why don't we just simply recognize the value on that date? And if an investor who takes property inadequately decides to hold on to it or ­­ or with no reasonableness holds on to it or gives it away to their mother or sells it to somebody for a nominal fee, then it should be the date at which they got rid of it or the day ­­ or the value of the date ­­ on the date of return or something like that, or the date that they should have done something with the property. Why are we stuck on these ­­ isn't the whole idea is to make the victim whole? Don't you make the victim whole on the day a reasonable investor would have gotten rid of the property?",
  "But money is fungible.",
  "That's my whole point. That may not make the seller whole. What makes the seller whole is on the day that he or she sold the item and received money. That's the Government's point.",
  "But ­­ well, that's not the Government's point, because the Government wants to value it as of the date of the sentencing. But the ­­ but whatever the seller received on the day he or she sold the bat, that's the value that it ­­ that the seller has put on that item.",
  "Then that's ­­ that's the question. That ­­",
  "Well, not really. Not in ­­ not in this case. Because in this case, the property was sold. It was sold late. But it was not ­­ it was not ­­ it was sold before the sentencing.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, that was my question earlier, which ­­ was it reasonable for that seller to hold on to the property that long?",
  "That wasn't the hypothetical.",
  "What happens if they decide to give the house to ­­ the banker, to his mother or grandmother?",
  "No, no, it doesn't bring into principles. You ­­ you have to give ­­ they took a property that had a value at some point ­­",
  "­­ perhaps through the entire period. What date does the judge use to determine the value of that house?",
  "So you ­­",
  "You're ­­ you're ­­ yes, the judge would use his or her discretion and decide what would have been a reasonable value at that ­­ of that house at a time when the lender should have sold it.",
  "Not when they received it, not when the sentencing happened, not after the sentencing.",
  "But on the day the court decides whether a reasonable investor who's taken back the property should have converted it to cash.",
  "Exactly.",
  "That's ­­ that's my point exactly.",
  "But it also goes back to how do you measure and when do you measure this. It's easy if the property is returned on the date of sentencing or 90 days after, or not returned then. Because then the judge could basically figure out what's a reasonable time, the date of sentence or within the 90 days, the day they sold the property.",
  "Right.",
  "But ­­ but the question becomes what happens when the house is done before ­­ given over not as a part of sentencing, but independently.",
  "And that ­­ and that's why I don't think any of these provisions really answer that question.",
  "And so why don't we go back to the basics? Why should the victim ­­ I think you agree with this ­­ why should the victim suffer the loss attendant to selling property that decreases in value because during the time that they were teeing it up for sale, the market dropped, and you say the victim shouldn't.",
  "All right.",
  "But let's assume that the market dropped and they sold it. What's the value you give to the ­­ to the victim? It's the date that the victim sold the property, no?",
  "Now, Justice Breyer asked you what happens if on some day, they did something unreasonable. They just kept the property. They gave it to a grandmother. They sold it to someone for a nominal amount. A sham transaction. What does a judge do then? They kept the property because they just didn't want to sell it. They just let it die because they were lazy.",
  "Is that a case the victim should be made whole for their loss?",
  "So where do you value for the person who ­­ the ­­ the creditor, the secured creditor who acts unreasonably? Let's assume an unreasonable act, and you said it might have been commercially unreasonable to hold on to the property after somebody offered them twice the amount of their mortgage.",
  "So ­­",
  "­­ what do you think of this test? In calculating a creditor's loss resulting from a secure transaction, the restitution order ­­ award should be offset by the amount that a reasonably diligent creditor, under the same or similar circumstances, could or would ­­ or did ­­ could, would or did obtain for the collateral?",
  "What does the defendant do if they act unreasonably after that order?",
  "If the bank does a nominal sale and only gets $100?",
  "If we undo ­­",
  "Mr. Katyal, if we were to overrule the Brooks Furniture standard ­­ you've just heard the argument where that issue is being presented to us in Octane. If we were to do that, how would that affect this case? Wouldn't it essentially moot the question because you wouldn't have this objective reasonableness test controlling the outcome?",
  "So when does that become a pure question of law?",
  "Even if I assumed that ultimately the claim that you made might have been ­­ might have had a basis, like the court below agreed, as I read the district court's decision, it wasn't basing its decision merely on that. What it was basing it on, and it goes through a whole laundry list of things that it thought constituted abusive litigation ­­ very little prefiling investigation, continuous switch of claims because of the lack of that investigation, pursuing a theory that your expert didn't even agree with ­­ that all sounds to me like a factual basis, basically saying this litigation was abusive. And I don't understand how that doesn't feed into the objective unreasonableness, meaning that if you had done the investigation you should have, you may have had a claim or thought you had a claim, but you would have learned much earlier that even your expert disputed things and you're likely not to have brought the suit. That's how I read the district court's decision.",
  "I'm sorry. I'm ­­ I'm a little confused. With respect to winning or losing the case, you're going to get de novo review because the Federal Circuit here looked at the claim construction, under de novo review agreed with the district court that it had construed the claim properly and that you lost. So you got de novo review. The issue on a reasonable ground to pursue the litigation, whether it was objectively reasonable or not, I think that's Justice Breyer's point, which it generally has factors that are independent of winning or losing, and that's why I kept going back to what the district court said in this case, which you seem to ignore. It, at one point, recognizes that your claim was a difficult one, but it says that doesn't excuse the fact that you maintained the 52(c) claim, the one at issue here, even after both the master ­­ special master and your expert had said a particular claim wasn't sustainable. And it continued with a long example of behavior ­­ examples, multiple ones, that it found unreasonable, having nothing to do with the ultimate reasonableness of your last argument before the appellate court. So, again I ask the question: Why should this objective reasonableness be considered a pure question of law? Because it's not about right or wrong and legal answer; it's about behavior during litigation.",
  "What is the difference between the Federal Circuit's use of objective reasonable ­­ objectively meritless and your standard?",
  "I know that you've been arguing that they shouldn't be using subjective intent, so I'm putting that aside. And you can tell me why Kilopass doesn't answer that now. But what's the difference you see?",
  "So is there anything other than the objectively baseless and bad faith of the Brooks Furniture test that you would change? Doesn't all of the other factors that the Court uses ­­ litigation misconduct, all of that other stuff ­­ encompass all the factors you're talking about?",
  "That it has to be a combination, a combination of factors, and ­­",
  "By the way, I thought ­­ I thought the Federal Circuit said that you only use the objective unreasonable if there isn't one of the other things. So it seems to be saying that ­­",
  "And could you spend a moment on clear and convincing, and ­­ because there's not a whole lot in your briefs on that part of it, although you do mention it in passing.",
  "How different is this from sanctionable misconduct? It seems to me that under the way you're articulating things, the conduct has to be sanctionable before you can give attorneys' fees under this provision. So why bother having the provision?",
  "Mr. Phillips ­­",
  "Please ­­",
  "So where does the bad faith come in?",
  "Where does the bad faith come in? Rule 11 doesn't include bad faith. It just ­­",
  "Would you address the clear and convincing?",
  "I know your argument that it's not ­­",
  "Mr. Waxman, a line has to be drawn somewhere. And we did say in Atkins that we would leave it up to the States to determine the standards for this issue. So what's the rule we announce today? We tell them 70 is not okay, but 75 would be? I'm not quite sure. How would you announce the rule?",
  "This is not clinical; this is statistical criteria with the tests you're relying on.",
  "You keep saying clinical, but the SEM is not a clinical judgment. It's a standard error of measurement. That's the test maker's.",
  "No. This has nothing to do with best practices. It has to do with what the test givers say is the right way to look at their tests.",
  "No, no. They're not challenging the two standard deviations; they're saying if you are going to preclude functioning abilities and the other two factors of your test based on a score of a test that says it has an SEM of 5, then you have to use the SEM. It's very different. They're not saying you have to take that number and declare that person mentally/intellectually challenged. You just have to apply the other factors.",
  "Since when ­­ I know that there's less emphasis now on the IQ test than there was before. But when the IQ test was used, did they always use it as a fixed number or did they always include the SEM as informing the clinical judgment?",
  "Since then they have not changed.",
  "That's been the same in all medical diagnosis.",
  "They're not arguing for that. They're just arguing that we should stay where it's always been, which is using the SEM.",
  "That's why you have the other two prongs.",
  "That's why you have the other two prongs.",
  "And at every juncture when you have a fixed cutoff, you have the ability to defeat the other two prongs, but you're stopping them on a test based on a test score that has a margin of error recognized by the designers of the test.",
  "Of those eight, how many actually have a fixed cutoff and how many have a SEM? I thought it was only four that didn't have consideration.",
  "But by judicial decision, they've considered ­­ well, we ­­ that ­­ that's something that ­­",
  "Exactly. That's what I'm saying. Only four have it interpreted without the SEM.",
  "I thought only four had interpreted without using the SEM?",
  "Only four, like Florida.",
  "Could I ask ­­ could I go back to a question the Chief asked earlier, which is, is the use of deadly force always permitted in a high­speed chase?",
  "Let's assume a set of facts that's different from here, that they had surrounded the car and it had not moved. Could they have done what the police officer did here, fire into the car to get the guy to open up the door?",
  "Could have been in a ditch or something?",
  "I'm sorry. I did see the film, and most of the ­­ there were the three initial shots and then the shots after the car was moving away from the police officers. How could you say most of those 15 shots were in a stopped, controlled position?",
  "The last 12. Let's ­­",
  "­­ divide it ­­",
  "­­ between 3 and 12.",
  "So why do we have all these other officers in here? They didn't fire any shots, Forthman, Ellis, and Evans.",

  "But that goes back ­­",
  "That goes back to my 12­shot sequence, which I still have a problem with. In answering Justice Alito's question, he has already gone 100 miles an hour when he ­­ the car moved away, even though that part of the street was deserted. Why would a reasonable officer not be suspicious that more reckless driving is going to occur ­­",
  "­­ to escape them when they finally get back into their cars?",
  "Just to clarify one thing, Mr. Mosley. When were the three shots fired? When he had moved backwards?",
  "I'm sorry. I don't know that you answered my question.",
  "Yes. I don't care about the seconds. I just asked the car ­­ I thought the shots were fired after he had moved backwards away from where the officers had initially stopped him.",
  "Got it.",
  "In a class action, how do you prove loss causation without proving price impact? I know that there are some individual cases with individual misrepresentations that have a different form of loss causation. But I'm talking exclusively on a ­­ in a class. How do you prove loss ­­ proximate cause or loss causation without proving price impact?",
  "Well, but that makes no sense.",
  "Because if they relied on their statement, then that's ­­ they have to prove loss causation in the same way that the class does. It's only if they're relying on a separate statement, which isn't part of the class, that would entitle them to a different calculation of loss causation.",
  "How?",
  "With the same misstatement at issue?",
  "I don't see how this is a midpoint. If you're going to require proof of price impact, why not do away with market efficiency? The whole premise of the other economic theory that you rely on is that the market efficiency is irrelevant. Some information impacts the market, whether efficient or not, and some doesn't, whether efficient or not. I think that's the basic economic argument the other side's making, correct?",
  "So why bother with Basic at all if we're going to do what you're suggesting ­­",
  "­­ turn the ­­ turn the class certification into a full­blown merits hearing on whether loss causation has been proven?",
  "Mr. Boies, I don't know that I fully understood your point in your brief as to why proving price impact was so difficult. Is it equal to proving market efficiency? Is it less burdensome, more burdensome? Why can't it be done at the class certification stage?",
  "And the question I asked your adversary: If we believe price impact is necessary, why keep Basic if we're going to put it in a class certification?",
  "I thought ­­",
  "I thought there were two questions, and I don't know that you've really answered the two. I thought your colleague was talking about less than 1 percent, whatever the figure was, is of cases that were certified as classes, how many go to trial. You said something different, which is that not every class is certified. Do you have a percentage for the amount ­­ the number ­­ for that number?",
  "Do you know any article that talks about that ­­ those numbers?",
  "So your preference would be to make the plaintiff bear the burden or just for defendants to be able to rebut the price impact ­­",
  "­­ at a class certification?",
  "How many of those other items are immediately withdrawn? Meaning, the Roth IRA has the 10 percent penalty if you withdraw it.",
  "No. Because the taxes have already been paid. But there's a penalty. How many of those others?",
  "How would a retirement fund ­­ except in this situation an inherited one, wouldn't that always be a debtor's?",
  "The name is generally a debtor's.",
  "I'm not sure why tax exemption is the point. I thought the point of retirement funds was that you would keep the money to a certain designated age, 59­1/2. I think that's what your opponent is arguing. The tax consequences are irrelevant to the Roth IRA, so it can't be that tax exemption is the meaning of a retirement fund.",
  "But why? This includes Roth IRAs.",
  "They are tax exempt, period, because taxes were paid when the money was put in.",
  "But that's true of a beneficiary who receives a retirement fund from an employer­sponsored retirement account. And there is at least one amici, Tribune, who says that makes ­­ why would we impute into ­­ to Congress a desire to treat employer­sponsored retirement funds differently from employee­sponsored funds?",
  "But an inherited IRA is tax exempt. It's ­­ it can't be alienated. So in bankruptcy, that would still be protected.",
  "Why are you fighting Justice Ginsburg? I just need to understand what you see as a difference.",
  "Is your claim limited to sensitive materials like contraceptives or does it include items like blood transfusion, vaccines? For some religions, products made of pork? Is any claim under your theory that has a religious basis, could an employer preclude the use of those items as well?",
  "How does a corporation exercise religion? I mean, I know how it speaks and we have, according to our jurisprudence, 200 years of corporations speaking in its own interests. But where are the cases that show that a corporation exercises religion?",
  "Well, but they were really arguing about things that affected their membership, not them as a corporate entity.",
  "So the dissent in this case, in the Tenth Circuit case, said how do we determine when a corporation has that belief? Who says it? The majority of shareholders? The corporate officers? The ­­ is it 51 percent? What happens to the minority? And how much of the business has to be dedicated to religion? 5 percent? 10 percent? 90 percent? Just assume not a business like yours ­­ you picked great plaintiffs, but let's assume ­­",
  "Let's assume just a business that sells 5 percent of religious books, doesn't play Christmas music, doesn't give off ­­ works on Sunday, you know, does nothing else religiously.",
  "That's the most dangerous piece. That's the one we've resisted in all our exercise jurisprudence, to measure the depth of someone's religious beliefs.",
  "I thought more importantly was whether a burden was substantial or not. That we've never acceded to the person claiming a religious exemption, a belief in how substantial the burden might be.",
  "Is there ­­ is there a different way of looking at it, the leeway? In U.S. v. Lee, we said, \"When followers of a particular sect enter into a commercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity.\" So isn't that really the answer, that we've never considered a for­profit corporation as exercising religion?",
  "Well, that's an interesting question, because the briefs on both sides here are written as if the penalty for not having a health insurance policy that covers contraceptives is at issue. But isn't there another choice nobody talks about, which is paying the tax, which is a lot less than a penalty and a lot less than ­­ than the cost of health insurance at all? These employers could choose not to give health insurance and pay not that high a penalty ­­ not that high a tax.",
  "Well, if they want to do that, they can just pay a greater salary and let the employees go in on the exchange.",
  "It's not called a penalty. It's called a tax. And it's calibrated ­­ and it's calibrated ­­",
  "May I just put a footnote on this. I thought the average price of providing insurance for a single person is $4,000, and it's $12,000 for a family ­­ for a family. So the 2,000 tax ­­ that's what it's called ­­ is to help the government provide subsidies to people on the exchange that don't have employer insurance. So it's a tax because it's ­­ it is to do exactly what your client wants, to get the government to supply the contraceptives, not the insurance companies.",
  "Counsel, your attorney ­­ one of the attorneys below on behalf of your clients admitted that the grandfathered policies weren't going to be around very long because any change to an existing policy ­­ and he said these changes happen on a yearly basis. And we already know from the government's statistics that it's up to 40 percent now have grandfathered out. Your own client changed its policy, and that's why it's not grandfathered. And he changed it to drop contraceptives it was covering.",
  "And so my point is, since when does a transitioned grandfathered exemption and one that everybody knows will have to change, because premiums by definition will change or co­pays will change, something is going to change ­­ it's a very short transition period. Since when does that prove that the need is not compelling?",
  "I'm not sure that ­­ that squares with Lee. The ­­ the statute created the right to Social Security, and there the Court said you can't deprive employees of a statutory right because of your religious beliefs. So Lee is contrary to the point you're making.",
  "Those are alternatives that you're asking the government to incur or the person to incur. There isn't an alternative that doesn't put a cost on someone else.",
  "I'm sorry, General. You answered yes to Braunfeld. It was Jewish merchants, but it was the merchants themselves ­­",

  "So we go back to the start of my question, that would be essentially the same for vaccines, blood transfusions, non­pork products, the government has to pay for all of the medical needs that an employer thinks or claims it has a religious exemption to?",
  "Because those things are more important?",
  "It's really the amount of money ­­",
  "Well, but they ­­",
  "­­ they make exemptions for vaccines, presumably, to some people on some basis, but we have a tax code that applies to everybody, but we have a million exemptions. Does the creation of the exemption relieve me from paying taxes when I have a sincere religious belief that taxes are immoral?",
  "Will your clients claim that filling out the form, if ­­ you're saying they would claim an exemption like the churches have already?",
  "May I ask a question? So were the pro­Bush demonstrators. In fact, the pro­Bush demonstrators were across the street pretty much at a diagonal to the President, and they were permitted to remain there the entire time. He ­­ they had a throwing distance of a bomb or a shooting distance as well.",
  "That was after the second move, not the first.",

  "All right. What you don't think is clearly established is a mixed motive case.",

  "I'm sorry. But ­­ but what it appears to be, it sounds like you're trying to revive the patenting of a function.

  "What this Court did after the ­­ after ­­ or before this statute ­­ this statute was passed before the Court's interpretation of the mail fraud statute.",
  "Every court that had looked at it at the time the statute was passed had determined there were two separate provisions. So why would Congress have any reason to believe they were passing a singular case, a singular charge?",
  "What is the thinking of those courts?",
  "What's the thinking of those courts? What's the rationale?",
  "And the courts don't hold this way, but hold, as the court did below, that it's an intent to deceive anyone so long as the scheme is ­­",
  "But here the bank is not the victim. That's the whole point. In these con ­artist cases, the bank is incidental and ­­",
  "So what do you do with the case, the second part of the hypothetical that Justice Breyer didn't repeat where the person knows the bank is not going to pay a cent because there's no money in this account.",

  "In what case, what Federal statute criminalizes a con game?",
  "A con game. What Federal statute ­­ 513 criminalizes altering checks, but what other Federal statute makes it a Federal crime to engage in a con game without a check?",

  "Mr. Yang, if we are concerned about federalizing every case involving a check, okay, you ­­ your brief does give us an alternative.",
  "My problem is, I can't locate that alternative in the language of the statute.",
  "So are you asking us just to make it up? Or if not, how do we reach it?",
  "No, no, no. Please answer, how do we get to your reading from the text of the statute.",
  "So far I'm with you, but you haven't answered my question.",
  "Which part of the statute are you interpreting with this limiting principle, the \"obtain\" part?",
  "\"By means of.\"",
  "I take your point that the words on the page look very good for you. But we also know that Congress didn't intend for those differences in spacing and numerology to have a difference in meaning, don't we?",
  "Could you please tell me why ­­ what your objections are to the \"by means of limiting principle\" the government gives as an alternative?",
  "But I don't understand how, if the falsehood is made to Target, who gives the person the DVD off the shelf, how you prove that that's an intent to defraud the bank as opposed to defraud Target.",
  "So what's the charge you give to the jury to get to that? I think the limiting principle is the charge that they want to get.",
  "This does ­­ this plan didn't require you to invest solely in employer stock, did it?",
  "It gave you the option to do it and to go above the 10 percent. But it didn't require you to buy only employer stock, did it?",
  "Could you point to the part of your plan that did that? Because I looked at it and I didn't see the plan requiring 100 percent investment.",
  "You use the word \"primarily.\" There's an allegation here that you should have stopped buying stock once you understood that there was a serious condition in the company. That you've breached your duty of loyalty, not of prudence. What do you do with that allegation?",
  "It doesn't say you have to. It says \"primarily.\" It doesn't say you have to continue buying.",
  "So what's wrong with following the law and disclosing that material information to the public and stopping the ­­ the employees from losing more money in worthless stock ­­",
  "­­ or almost worthless stock?",
  "That's not an ERISA responsibility. It's an SEC responsibility. It's 10b­5 responsibility. Aren't you supposed to disclose any information that a reasonable investor ­­",

  "So what's ­­ what's wrong with a rule that simply says a fiduciary has to do whatever it's ­­ possible to protect beneficiaries within the bounds of the law?",
  "And so if the law required you to disclose it, and you didn't, you've breached your duty of prudence and of loyalty, because you've protected the company ­­",

  "You ­­ you don't ­­ you're ­­ you have an absolute duty to the beneficiary.",
  "Let me just continue to Justice Breyer's question. There are some legal duties. I don't know of a trustee who has to break the law. They can't sell on the basis of inside information, and that's a legal prohibition.",
  "So your claim rises and falls on the fact that you think they're ­­ they've breached their duty of loyalty by having the inside information and ­­ or exactly what is your claim? What could they have done that wouldn't breach the law?",
  "How would they ­­",
  "Mr. Kneedler, a stock drop in and of itself, I don't think, can prove a lack of prudence because ­­",
  "You agree with that?",
  "Exactly. It's true almost anywhere because you can't outsmart the market.",
  "So how do you deal with what has been vexing us, the issue of what a fiduciary should or can do when they are an insider and have only inside information, not public information?",
  "So where is the breach of fiduciary duty? Where's the breach of loyalty? What can it consist of, and what does someone have to prove in a complaint? Because this has to do with a pleading presumption and a merits presumption.",
  "I'm sorry. Investigate what, the nonpublic information? Investigate ­­",
  "I ­­ I appreciate that. But if I'm listening to the government carefully and understanding its position, it's basically saying if there's been a violation of a securities law that a fiduciary knows, then why shouldn't it be liable both under the company, under 10b­5, and the director of the plan or the trustee of the plan as a breach of loyalty to ­­ or ­­ or of prudence to the beneficiaries?",
  "It's like ­­ yes, it's a double remedy, but there's lots of things that provide double remedies. So if that person should have disclosed.",
  "Well, it won't as a trustee.",
  "It will against the company.",
  "Obey the law. I think that that's the simple answer.",
  "You know they created the conflicts.",
  "I'm not shrugging my shoulder out of lack of sympathy but out of reality. The loyalty is to the beneficiaries. If you're going to place someone there who comes to inside knowledge, you're going to create potentially a problem.",
  "But I think your adversary was saying that's a self­induced problem, not one that the law should excuse you from following whatever the law is.",
  "If there is no private cause of action to enforce the FDA label standards, only the FDA can bring a proceeding to say that an ad violates its regulations, how does a Court below, without interpreting the regulations, go about deciding whether or not a particular ad doesn't comport with the regulations and hence would be subject to the Lanham Act?",
  "Maybe that's a better question for the SG, but I'm trying to figure out ­­",
  "Excuse me. I'm not sure that ­­ I mean, the argument is you can't even taste these flavors. That's their point. And you are taking a contrary point, that the flavor doesn't mean what you taste, flavor means something else.",

  "And if they decide they don't comply, that's when they can could permit a Lanham Act claim?",
  "Well, let's ­­ let's assume the following. The FDA just wanted to know what the name should be. That's all they are regulating. That's the only requirement. And it's not even a requirement.",
  "It's an authorization. And that's where I'm having a little bit of difficulty, because it's not that you have to use this name, you're permitted to use this name under their regulations. But why are you permitted to use it in a misleading way? That's really the ­­ I think the government's position, which is, if you're using the name in combination with other factors in a misleading way that's not a subject to the regulation, just the name, then it's actionable under the Lanham Act.",
  "Could the government ­­ I think what the government is saying nothing about our permission goes to the size of the name on the label ­­",
  "­­ that you can break up the name of the juice into two different sizes so that you are deemphasizing it.

If you use the color of apple juice and grapes, it would be a light color.",
  "You basically are talking about field preemption.",
  "How do we square this with Wyeth?",
  "Wyeth, the FDA actually approves, looks at the label and says, this one is okay. Not only is it not misleading, but it complies with all health requirements, and because the producers of drugs have the ability to change the label without FDA approval, there was ­­ we found no preemptions and no impossibility. How is Wyeth any different? The FDA here ­­ it's even worse, this case. The FDA doesn't approve the labels. It never looks at them and says they are okay or not okay unless they decide to enforce the statute. How is this better than Wyeth?",
  "You assume people would pick a label and stick with it. The Lanham Act would ­­ if a Lanham Act claim is bought, and it's upheld, you change the label nationally.",
  "Aren't those issues of privilege? And didn't the Court below permit you to raise those questions as individual items came up? As individual accounts?

  "It doesn't seem to me that the narrowing was ­­ we've been assuming that what we're talking about is discovery related to commercial property. But the subpoena is written much more broadly than that. It's asking for every piece of property that Argentina has anywhere in the world.",
  "So I was right. This is doing exactly what the Solicitor General is saying, it is asking for an accounting of everything that Argentina owns regardless of what its purpose is.",
  "So just answer yes.",
  "Mr. Olson.",
  "If I am understanding your position, you ­­ I think what you are saying, the judgment here is only for money due, whatever the amount was. And that's the judgment you have. How you get that judgment paid depends on where the assets are located, correct?",
  "And so any ­­ any protection to those assets has to be provided by the jurisdiction in which they're located.",
  "So your position, whether this is a sovereign or an individual, is that if they get a homestead exemption in New York, if the property is in New York, they're entitled to it, but if they have property in Florida and Florida doesn't give a homestead exemption, they can get that home ­­ they can't get the home in New York, but they can get the home in Florida.",

And then I would have figured out and asked you enough questions, without holding a hearing, just through your attorney, until I got to a point where I decided whether or not your answers, like the district court did here, made sense or not.",
  "And if they didn't make sense, then I would say, no, let's go a little further.",
  "So why not ­­ why not make life very simple ­­ and I think that's what your counterpart ­­ simply to say you have to point to facts from which a reasonable inference of improper motive can be drawn.",
  "Counsel, I'm ­­ you know, what the Eleventh Circuit is doing is a little confusing to me. I understand what motivated it. You use the word \"evidentiary hearing.\" In my mind, evidentiary hearing by definition is live witnesses. Is that your definition?",
  "So define what \"hearing\" means to you.",
  "But that's the problem. I think the Eleventh Circuit means a live hearing because of its jurisprudence in this area, which has barred any other kind of evidence to be sought from the IRS. It has a case that says you can't have depositions, you can't have discovery, discovery in its traditional sense, documents or other things. But I don't know; has it also said you can't have affidavits.",
  "Not you. Them, the IRS.",
  "Not you. I'm talking about the government, because I started by asking you, are you looking to cross­examine IRS agents.",
  "That's what I thought you ­­",
  "In Powell we said similar allegations weren't enough. The fact that the documents had already been reviewed or that the statute of limitations has passed, that that wasn't enough. So what have you given us that ­­ here, what have you alleged that's greater than Powell?",
  "If I look at the statute you cited and come to a contrary conclusion, you're right, it takes a showing of fraud ­­ what's the words ­­ fraud, malfeasance or misrepresentation of a material fact ­­",

  "But since ­­ yes, but that's a really big issue, because I think an IRS agent who says I want to make sure there's none of those things and that's why I'm issuing the subpoena has a legitimate basis. So if I don't think it's an abuse of discretion or that you showed me much with respect to that issue, what's left for you? What ­­ what other fact would you ­­ could you plausibly have stated? Because we already said in Powell that the expiration of the statute of limitations doesn't make a difference.",
  "They can always have a legitimate statement of wanting to make sure that none of those three things happened. So what else in your allegations stands up?",
  "In the facts. Yes, all right. So what ­­ I'm sorry.",
  "All right. The evidence that was submitted.",
  "What else?",
  "There's an IRS regulation that says they can't use it in the criminal ­­ in a criminal prosecution.",
  "So even if it was a dual purpose, what difference does it make since they can't use it?",
  "It was aware of it because the study group used the two terms and they knew there were two different statutes because they were told. Now, how you make assumptions, I'm assuming that if there's a report, as there was with this, that people would be responding to it in the legislation that's being drafted.",
  "I don't know why you are ­­ you are even caring. Isn't the applicable limitations period, as far as you are concerned, the period in which you can bring a suit? And that would be the shorter one under all circumstances. And aren't you saying that statutes of repose are preempted because you couldn't bring a suit?",
  "Was Congress doing away with ­­ I don't know if any such State exists, but assume a State said, nah, we're tired of environmental claims. You can't have them. We're not going to have one at all. Was Congress preempting that decision?",
  "So why isn't a repose like that? Why isn't a statute of repose simply a decision that you just can't have a claim at all if it's older than 20 years old?",
  "Counsel, that last argument about, you know, liability 30, 40 years later, I think 46 States have that. Have it that way. And Congress wasn't all that worried about that and there isn't a very strong policy argument that ­­ that says it's not ­­ that it's so fundamentally unfair that you shouldn't do it.",
  "I don't think the majority or the ­­ or the concurrence or the other side disagreed with that. The only question was whether it was part of the specifications or not. I thought that was the only difference between them. They both agreed ultimately that the electrodes had to cancel out ­­ was it the EMGs?",
  "So they both agreed that that was part of the scope. The only issue was, was it part of the specifications or part of the claims,no? But both of them make up the scope of the patent.",
  "What would be the purpose of the invention if it were only covering spacing without the function of canceling the EMG? I can't understand, if I read this patent, what it would do unless you add its function.",
  "Did you ­­ did you proffer any evidence below showing that a person with ordinary skill in the art did not understand what this claim meant? Your brief seems to rely only on the dispute between the majority and the concurrence. But was there ­­ did you proffer any evidence below?",
  "Now, I have a really big problem, which is we as Justices disagree on the meaning of things all the time, and one side will say, this is perfectly clear from the text of the statute, from its ­­ from its history, from its context. And we do all the statutory tools, and there’ll be one or more of us who will come out and say, no, we think it's a different interpretation. Would we have any valid patents in the world if that's the standard that we ­­ that we adopt? That if any judge on a panel thinks that there's another interpretation, that that's sufficient to invalidate a patent as indefinite?",
  "But the majority ­­ but the majority here said that it was clear from the prosecution history, the specifications, and the description that this was definite. I don't know on what basis I would have to overturn their review of that issue.",
  "There is a subtle ­­ no, there is, if you read that language carefully. It seems to be saying that what has to be reasonably definite is the court's construction, and it takes the emphasis away from whether a skilled ­­ someone skilled in the art would be definite. There is a big difference between can I read this and give it a construction and whether or not a construction is definite enough so someone skilled in the art could understand it.",
  "That's my problem with the Federal Circuit's articulation and as you read its decisions. Its focus is not always on that question. Its focus seems to be on the reasonableness of its construction, as opposed to the reasonableness of a skilled artisan's or whether skilled, someone skilled in the art could reasonably construe the scope of this patent.",
  "So what do you see as the difference? He says that the concurrence's definition is different from the majority's. The government ­­ explain ­­ I read your brief. I know what you think the difference is, but ­­",
  "He says there is a difference in scope, so address that.",
  "Why don't you see that as being a difference of importance?",
  "Why are you ­­ why are you running from ­­ the working here is that it cancels out a signal, correct?",
  "And so what the majority said is that that function is part of the understanding of the spacing. Isn't that what the majority said?",
  "So I don't know whether it has to be equal spacing or one could be one inch and the other half an inch apart. The bottom line is that to work, it has to cancel out, that that's part of the scope.",
  "Now, the concurrence said, no, you don't have ­­ you can't ­­ I'm not looking at the specification.",
  "I think it's definite without it.",
  "All right. I don't see how it could be. That's what I think Justice Scalia is saying and Justice Breyer is saying, that if we don't understand what the purpose is, how can that spacing be definite enough to make this thing work. So tell us why you think that the concurrence's interpretation is wrong. What's he missing?",
  "Mm­hmm.",
  "Result that the specification ­­",
  "Do you agree with your adversary that the prosecution history is that at the time the patent was issued and not on re­examination or anything else subsequent?",
  "No, no. I didn't ask that question.",
  "Explain that. Because he says, and it seems logical, that you're going to stifle inventiveness if people can't, once the patent is issued, know how to get around it.",
  "The Federal Circuit seems to say that if there's two reasonable constructions and one would make the patent valid, I think this goes to Justice Kennedy's question, that they're obligated to pick the one that makes the patent valid.",
  "Uh­huh.",
  "Is that right?",
  "So they're wrong in that as well.",
  "So I think you're ­­ let's use the quintessential example, police officers or lab technicians. Generally they are called by the prosecutor, but occasionally they are called by defense attorneys. So when are they immunized and when are they not? When are they acting within the scope of their duties and when are they not?",
  "So what happens in a situation where a police officer gets on the stand and in testifying honestly admits to corruption, admits to ­­ or does it in a slovenly way, comes to court dressed in a clown suit? Could the employer fire him then?",
  "That means the Eleventh Circuit is wrong. Should the employee be victimized because they were following circuit bad precedent? Whether it's good or bad doesn't matter under our jurisprudence.",
  "I go back to my point, which is they got it wrong. But do we expect the employee to know they got it wrong or under what circumstances do we expect them to know?",
  "All right. Tell me what you want as your rule. Anyone subpoenaed in a criminal trial is protected?",
  "Well, wait a minute. What are you doing about the truth­finding functions of the ­­ of a trial setting when you're saying or telling people, employees, don't go and tell the truth because if the truth hurts your employer, you're going to be fired?",
  "That there's reason that the employer can point to under Pickering or otherwise, but what kind of message are we giving when we're telling employees, you're subpoenaed for any reason in a trial, go and tell a falsehood because otherwise you can be fired?",
  "You mean the Constitution doesn't protect someone in a trial from telling the truth? That it's not a matter of public concern that an employee tell the truth?",
  "Why should it matter then if an employee's job is to investigate corruption? If that's their job and they are called by you to testify at a corruption trial and then they are fired for it, should it really matter that it's part of their job or not?",
  "But that seems counterintuitive to me. Why do we let ­­ why do we put people at risk for telling the truth?",

  "Look, I certainly understand people ­­ government being able to tell people don't go out and talk to the newspapers about this, don't go out and talk about X publicly, because we should be able to control those kinds of disclosures.

  "But that can't be. Already we know and the Kansas court knew the dissent pointed out that a burden for mitigating circumstances of a preponderance of the evidence is okay, so they can't believe that no burden is required by the Constitution. They know that there is no requirement because the cases mentioned by you and Justice Scalia say that. So it has to be their view of State law.",
  "What is this Court supposed to do when it's told its own lower courts three times before this case, or two, you must give this instruction? What ­­ what ­­ what's the Court supposed to do?",
  "Yes. Whether the Constitution requires it or not, it has said the better practice is to give this instruction. What's a court supposed to do? Say, willy­nilly, my lower courts can disagree with me and not do it?",
  "Didn't the Kansas Court say, yes, we have that, but the only burden of proof in any of the instructions was in aggravating circumstances and that the State bore that burden? And it pointed to the fact that aggravating and mitigating were mentioned in the same clause 5 or 6 times with no explanation of what the burden was for mitigating. The Kansas Court thought that the jurors could be confused or would be confused by what burden of proof was needed.",
  "I ­­ I think what they're saying is that some jurors would be confused. And certainly, there have been jury ­­ jury studies to indicate that jurors are often confused, generally, about burdens of proof.",
  "Well, the jury instructions don't have to be devised necessarily for the Court. They should be understandable to jurors. And I doubt very much that any juror has heard of that maxim. But putting that aside, the Kansas Court, which has much more experience than we do with trial court decisions, has determined that confusion exists or can exist. Why isn't that enough for us?",
  "Well, the prosecutor in Carr did tell the jury, I'm going to create reasonable doubt as to the defendants' mitigating evidence. So that prosecutor didn't do what you said.",
  "What a ­­ what a wonderful system we've created. We give ­­ even when a State court is wrong in convicting somebody, so long as they're reasonably wrong, we uphold them. And when they're wrong on a legal conclusion applying our test, we jump in and reverse them, right?",
  "The other States that have no mitigating burden, do you know how many of them require an instruction just like this one?",
  "Mr. Katyal, Kansas has already answered this question, hasn't it? Its requirement is that a jury be instructed both that mitigation need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and, second, that the jury be told it has no ­­ that there is no burden of proof.",
  "So why don't we have jurisdiction to answer that question?",
  "How do you differentiate this case from Standard Oil?",
  "But we did say that that State could define the exemption any which way it wanted.",
  "And so it could ­­ it's almost identical here; we would announce what the Federal law is, send it back. The State has already said it's going to follow Teague, but I guess it might or might not be free to change its mind about doing that.",

  "That he wasn't ­­",
  "Uh­huh.",
  "Personally.",
  "All right. That's ­­",
  "I'm sorry. How ­­ how is that, when Florida law says that the judge has to find an aggravator to make someone eligibility for the death penalty?",
  "Could you tell me how this is different than Arizona?

Unlike Arizona, every Florida ­­ every court that has looked ­­ every judge who's looked at it, not one of them has said that they believe personally it's constitutional. Even the courts affirming ­­ affirm on the basis of the prior precedent, and you have a little less than half the Court directly saying it violates Ring. So what's the jury finding when it says seven to five?",
  "Even when it says a murder has been committed, felony murder wasn't. Felony murder was charged, but we don't know if they found the robbery, right?",
  "So how do we know which one they picked?",
  "Which ­­ how do we know which one they picked? Which makes them eligible for the death penalty?",
  "But you do agree that that ­­ it doesn't require a unanimous jury?",
  "It ­­ and ­­ a simple majority is all you need?",

  "I want to clarify. You think a seven­to­five recommendation is finding an element of the crime that makes you eligible for the death penalty by a unanimous or functionally equivalent unanimous jury?",
  "Well, then what do you do with the statement in our case law that says a simple majority is not a unanimous jury?",
  "And they don't agree with which one?",
  "So we don't know whether it was premeditation or robbery. It could be four to three or two to five. It could be anything.",
  "Right.",
  "We don't know. What does the seven to five tell us the jury found?",
  "Not the same one?",
  "Not the same?",
  "But you believe that a simple majority is a jury unanimously or functionally unanimously finding that element beyond a reasonable doubt?",
  "What about ­­",
  "How about if that jury ­­ I'm sorry ­­",
  "Can I ask you two separate questions on this?",
  "Number one, whenever have we said that a jury waiver on an issue is based on the lack of a challenge by a defense attorney? Don't we require waivers of jury trials to be explicit and by the defendant him or herself?",
  "So where have we ever said that not challenging something is an admission of that something?",
  "We take plenty of appeals where people are saying, assuming the state of facts, I'm entitled to X. And then when they go back down, they argue that that goes ­­ that assumption is wrong. Why isn't this the same?",

  "They're not in the retail market.",
  "They're ­­ they're generators selling to intermediaries. The intermediaries are the ones who are in the market with the retailers.",

  "But they all ­­ each of them affect each other.",
  "Well, wait a minute. That's the classic choice that we give agencies. They had expert testimony, Dr. Khan, who was undisputed to be a leading expert in this field, say the opposite. I mean, how do we choose to go into the weeds of something as technical as that ­­",

  "Mr. Garre, the only way that I see a court entering judgment in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is a Rule 56 judgment. Someone moves and says, you got everything you're entitled to. The other side comes back and says, no, I'm entitled to attorneys' fees, I'm entitled to whatever. And the court says, no, you're not; this is a full satisfaction; I enter judgment.

  "Right.",
  "Mr. Garre, I am so confused by your argument.

  "That ­­ that is ­­ that's all I needed for you to say.",
  "Okay? Let's stop there.",
  "So a court gets involved ­­ a court gets involved no matter what. Right?",
  "All right. So you offered and they wanted an injunction. The court can enter that injunction. I'm putting aside the class action. I'm ­­",
  "The court can't ­­ all right.",
  "But it can't just say the case is moot and not enter the injunction. The terms of the settlement, the terms of the lawsuit, were that an injunction would be issued and you'd pay $1,500; correct?",
  "That's just ­­",
  "­­ poor usage of words, counselor. It can't enter a judgment ­­",
  "­­ unless there is jurisdiction.",
  "I'm sorry. You're saying ­­ contrary to one citation, you're actually ­­ Ashby v. White ­­ that it isn't a right that Congress has given you? I ­­",
  "I mean, most of the common law rights, like property rights, are ­­ are given to you by statute. They're not given to you by the common law. Most people are coming in to sue on the basis of a statute.",
  "So if I have a dozen or more cases that didn't involve property rights, where we didn't require economic harm, those would mean nothing to you?",
  "Those legal rights, we just decided through the centuries, all those cases wrong?",
  "Isn't that ­­",
  "Isn't that, though, a question of the application of the statute?",
  "It doesn't invalidate the injury here because this is the quintessential violation of the statute. He's saying they don't have reasonable procedures to check their accuracy. We know from the purpose section of the statute that that's what Congress wanted, reasonable procedures. He's going to have to prove that. Number two, he says, the information about me is false. I'm going to assume, for purposes of this argument, because we have to, that ­­ and so does the court below with respect to standing ­­ that much of that information is inaccurate. I will tell you that I know plenty of single people who look at whether someone who's proposed to date is married or not. So if you're not married and there's a report out there saying you are, that's a potential injury. Now, I know the court below said it was speculative, but that's what Congress was worried about: both creditworthiness, and ­­ and your stature as a person, your privacy, your sense of self; that I can identify myself with some ­­ others can identify me with some accuracy.",
  "So I guess my question is, we've now taken a word, \"concreteness,\" that the Court in recent years has applied to injuries by citizens and when they can bring actions or not. A generalized grievance, we said, of a taxpayer is not concrete enough. We've taken this doctrine, and you're trying to superimpose the word \"concrete\" into legally­created rights. But for ­­ for two decades ­­ on, I mean, two centuries, we've always said in our case law that injury in fact is the breach of a legally­recognized right. Where do we have a right? I think that's Justice Kagan's question.",
  "It's a requirement.",
  "\"Any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed upon this subjecter with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer.\" So it's not the whole world; it's the consumer that you dealt with ­­",
  "­­ or that the agency ­­ that the agency dealt with.",
  "Isn't there always a materiality question? In every violation there's always a materiality question: What is the falsehood? Is it material to anything? It could be a transposition of a telephone number.",
  "So are we ruling on the outcome or are we ruling on the reasoning?",
  "I think ­­",
  "See, I look at this case slightly differently. I think the breach of any legal right you're given is ­­ gives Article III jurisdiction. There is a difference between that and whether you're within the zone of interest of a statute. And so what you're saying ­­ I ­­ I guess that's why the circuits below have said you have to be able to allege some falsity in the credit report to get recovery under the statute because those are the people the statute was targeted to.",
  "But here you ­­",
  "Mr. Bright, did the court, in your judgment, do de novo review? Didn't it say that it did ­­ basically, it was going to do step three of the Batson charge ­­ challenge?",
  "So that's a ruling on the merits.",
  "Well, it ­­ I think it said after ­­ after redoing ­­",
  "Mr. Bright ­­",
  "Mr. ­­ Mr. Bright, Mr. Lanier ­­",
  "­­ answered yes when he asked ­­ when during the ­­ during the trial when he was asked whether he had done ­­ I don't know if it ­­ oh, no, it was on the motion for a new trial hearing ­­ whether he had done the same extensive background check on all the jurors, white and black.

  "So ­­ so your ­­ your understanding of that statement was that all ­­ he had only done an extensive search on the blacks on the list?",
  "During the trial, did defense counsel, when he made his initial Batson challenge ­­ not in the papers, but at trial ­­ did he again say that this was part and parcel of the prosecutor's pattern?",
  "I was just surprised that we didn't hear about this preparation for a Batson hearing until ­­",
  "­­ the habeas.",
  "Mr. Bright ­­",
  "­­ I have found some circuit courts who have a rule on appeal or on habeas which is if they can find one legitimate reason for striking a juror ­­",
  "­­ that's enough to defeat a Batson challenge. Do you believe that's an appropriate rule? Are you suggesting a different approach to the question?",
  "Well, the problem is I don't think this is discretionary review. The Eleventh Circuit found it's not under Georgia law. Read its opinion. It seems pretty grounded in the stated law of Georgia.",
  "Could you give me the ­­ the Reed v. ­­ what?",
  "Well, why would we ­­",
  "I'm sorry. I'm so confused I can't even ­­",
  "The State habeas process is different than the regular appeal process.",
  "On the regular appeal process, they look at each case ­­ each case with discretion.",
  "Okay. In State habeas they have a rule, an internal rule that says, we'll take every habeas case unless it's ­­ has no arguable merit, right?",
  "In the positive.",
  "So what would lend us to believe that they didn't look at the merits and say there was no arguable merit? That they just said, we're too busy. We don't care if there is arguable merit. Do you believe they did that?",
  "I'm sorry. What?",
  "So that is a decision on the merits. There is no arguable merits.",
  "Okay.",
  "Now it's clear.",
  "Why?",
  "Were we told that the only three people who did the investigation on Batson were the two prosecutors on the case and Mr. Lundy? So if Mr. Lundy says I didn't make that list, it has to be one of the two prosecutors.",
  "Didn't the habeas court ­­",
  "­­ provide an excuse and say ­­ I'm sorry.",
  "Didn't the habeas court accept that he didn't know at the time of trial, but he just knew that Lundy didn't want her?",
  "But that was his explanation for why the prosecutor didn't know about the prior arrest, correct?",
  "That Mr. Lundy didn't want her.",
  "That Mr. Lundy didn't want her. He never credited or never said that he knew this ­­ that he knew about the arrest.",
  "Mr. Lundy did, but the prosecutor didn't.",
  "What did they do with the failure to ask Ms. Garrett any questions about the issues that troubled the ­­ troubled, for example, her cousin's arrest. There's an assumption that she has a relationship with this cousin. I have cousins who I know have been arrested, but I have no idea where they're in jail. I hardly ­­ I don't know them. So ­­ but he didn't ask any questions. Doesn't that show pretext? I don't ­­ I'm not going to inquire because she might get off the hook on that.",
  "Well, stealing hubcaps, in my mind, is decidedly different than murdering people or attacking them the way this case was ­­ this case was about. I ­­ I can imagine a ­­ why can't you imagine a father saying, it was stealing hubcaps ­­",
  "­­ he should have been punished?",
  "That's what the record supports.",
  "I'm sorry. I didn't hear that. Then this Court?",
  "There ­­ this ­­ this provision applies to an entire list of multiple crimes, right?",
  "And so for most of those crimes there is no jurisdictional element at all.",
  "So if you're looking at this as superfluous to not this individual subprovision, one subprovision of many ­­",
  "­­ it's doing a lot of work.",
  "It's doing a lot of work because there are a lot of other crimes that qualify under State law, correct?",
  "I mean, your brief and the solicitor general's sort of tunnel in on this one provision of many. But I'm wondering why? I'm looking at the entire provision has many State court analogues that don't involve interstate commerce, correct?",
  "On those other ­­ the ones that are not stated in the statute, it's presumed. It doesn't have to be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, correct?",
  "Can I have ­­ I'm going to sound like my colleague, Justice Breyer.",
  "I became interested in the argument of the National Association of Criminal Lawyers. And basically, their position is that the definition here that says, an offense described in 844 ­­ what ­­ of that title, relating to explosive material offenses. And they argue that that takes arson out of this section. Why ­­ I don't see that argument in your brief. Are you disavowing it? And if so, why?",
  "I'm not ­­ I'm not even on your point.",
  "All right. Did you read the National Association ­­",
  "All right. They don't argue that point at all.",
  "They're just saying that this ­­ this is not covered by ­­ the fire, the arson is not covered by the statute at all by the enhancement ­­ by the statute at all, except under the arson provision that requires a sentence for a year. That's their argument.",
  "Forget about interstate or anything else. So tell me why you didn't make that argument.",
  "All these examples you gave me in your brief, either it's clear explicitly that jurisdiction was excluded by the statute or the nature of the offense gives jurisdiction or the Assimilated Crimes Act, it makes sense, because the whole purpose is that it's ­­ that Federal ­­ that a State law is going to apply when there isn't a Federal law. So applying jurisdiction makes no sense.",
  "But ­­ so I don't take much from your arguments, which is the fact that it drops away in other sections. Congress didn't just say it dropped away here.",
  "Isn't ­­ go ahead.",
  "Well, I ­­ I don't know why you say that, if it has to have substantive work, otherwise it wouldn't be in the statute.",
  "It ­­ it is picking a crime that only Congress would prosecute, which is following up on Justice Alito's point, substantive because it's more serious. It has ­­ we have to protect people who are affected from interstate travel, or that affects interstate travel. You could ­­ even following the model penal code, you could still call this substantive.",
  "I'm sorry. Can you give me the number again?",
  "Well, we ­­",
  "I can't square this with the categorical approach. I ­­ I ­­ you know, we've been very clear. The categorical approach says, every element of a crime that has to be proven to a jury has to be included in the State offense. But now you're saying it's every categorical element that's not jurisdictional. Where do you get that from?",
  "What do you do with ­­ if we rule your way, that it won't address the child pornography possession laws or that it won't address some of the explosion laws?",
  "No, I want to know where the overlap is for the child pornography.",
  "Well, why not just say ­­ drop the \"abusive\"? Just say \"sexual conduct with a minor or a ward\"? Because now you have to deal with the adjective \"abusive.\" So how does that get you to consent or no consent?",
  "My problem is, why would they include adults as a predicate for the minimum in Federal crimes but not in straight State crimes.",
  "I know they have done it in other situations.",
  "But why here? If they're worried about the abuse of children, why would they not capture every conceivable person or every conceivable abusive act towards kids?",
  "In terms of one of your purposes, why isn't the government's concession that in no circumstance can a fee 20 percent be taken until ­­ unless it's above $10? Why doesn't that take care of your problem?",
  "No, what the government ­­ I understand ­­ and they'll correct me ­­ is I think they are saying that if you pay a ­­ the initial filing fee, and you're down to $8, they can't take another 10 ­­ another 20 percent.",
  "That's how I understood their concession.",
  "If you're at 55, you take 10.",
  "Actually, I ­­ I didn't realize the back end of this. Forget about the prisoner. I'm thinking about the courts. Basically, you're saying the last court that brings him over 10 ­­ the moment he has over $10, the court who gives ­­ no. That doesn't happen. The court ­­ he pays a filing fee. He now has more than $10 in the account. That court gets more money than the other courts?",
  "But does all of this by all of the States, all of the prisons? Because your adversary says that some are going below the $10.",
  "Be clear about your policy. And I think your adversary agrees. Under (a), the 20 percent has to be paid on all five cases whether the amount is above 10 or ­­ the amount in the account is above 10 or below 10, correct?",
  "So those five cases would always wipe out the $10.",
  "So ­­ and so the $10 floor starts once the account goes up ­­ you have to ­­ a bottom. You have always $10 in your account, but any dollar that goes into your account after that, 20 percent has to be paid.",
  "But you would take 20 percent. Let's say there's $10 and ­­ there's $11. The one extra dollar is paid to whom?",
  "Let's assume there's five cases there.",
  "Would take that entire $1?",
  "On what basis are ­­ it sounds to me that you're giving a meaning to not required that was different to the meaning we gave to it pre­1976. Am I correct?",
  "I ­­ he took out the adjectives, descriptors from our case law: \"Insubstantial,\" \"wholly insubstantial,\" \"frivolous,\" \"obviously or essentially frivolous.\" I mean ­­",

  "Do you want to give me a list of those cases with ­­ I'm going to continue it.",
  "Answer Justice Breyer.",
  "For my edification, what are the cases ­­ I know Bailey is one. What are the other ones you're relying on?",
  "I ­­ I have no idea where you think this lien attached. Do you think it attached at the fund, immediate ­­ the whole 500,000, or the amount of that 500,000 that ended up in his pocket, or that 500,000 minus what, if anything?",
  "So your position is at that moment it goes to the lawyer, it's his money, all 500,000. You're entitled to whatever ­­",
  "The ­­ the essence of Great­Western ­­ I don't know if I'm reading it rightly or not. I'll certainly be corrected by the author and dissenters if I'm not. But it seemed to me that they're basically saying, whatever remedy you have has to be an equitable remedy.",
  "The most that I read about a substitution decree or deficiency decree is that it's an ancillary jurisdiction to issue those. Is that consistent with saying it's equitable? Isn't it just a legal claim that equity sometimes permitted an ­­ an equitable court to exercise, but wouldn't it still be legal ­­",
  "­­ and not within ­­ within the ­­ the scope of ERISA?",
  "I'm still a little bit confused by all of this. In my mind, you get money when somebody gives it to you. And I ­­ I know that a lawyer is an agent, but the agent is keeping a piece of the money. You can still go after the client for the piece the lawyer took?",
  "Mr. Phillips, I'm completely at a loss as to what you're complaining about. That's exactly what you did. And what this expert did ­­ I mean, as far as I could tell, between your expert that you used to calculate \"gang time\" and \"K­time\" did exactly the same thing this expert did. You came out with a lower number, but you used fewer people. At least their expert used hundreds of people instead of the few that you did. I'm ­­ I'm just completely at a loss. Would you suggest that if one plaintiff came into court, that he could not use the ­­ this expert to prove his case circumstantially to show that in fact, the average is this, and he doesn't really know how much time he took? When he does it now, it may be 12 minutes instead of 10?",
  "Oh, no, no. But they know what they worked. They know that people were working over 40 hours because there were time records with respect to that. What you're basically saying is that Mt. Clemens is completely wrong. You can't estimate your time when the employer doesn't keep records.",
  "There were time records to that effect here.",
  "No. There were 200­and­something­odd people that their expert showed didn't work above 40 hours. The jury knew about those.",
  "I'm sorry. I'm having difficulty understanding your point. There are records, aren't there, of how many hours they worked without donning and doffing the equipment at issue, correct?",
  "All right. So I thought that Dr. Mericle's using those actual records figured out how many people worked over 40 hours.",
  "Well, you didn't have an expert to say that?",
  "Jury rejected ­­",
  "Why do you have standing? I mean ­­",
  "­­ the jury, obviously, rejected something. It obviously was told to exclude people who were not entitled, and it did it. You didn't object to a ­­ the failure to have ­­ you objected to proposing interrogatories. So this has invited errors; it sounds like invited error. But, finally, how do you have standing ­­",
  "­­ to argue that the issue of who gets part of that money?",
  "Why?",
  "You tell me, except for those people ­­",
  "­­ who opted out, there are people who opted in?",
  "Opted in. So you know all of the people who are bound, all the people who've opt ­­ who were ­­ who opted in.",
  "So why do you have to know whether ­­ there can't be more.",
  "They were allowed to participate; they just didn't opt in.",
  "I've never heard of a case where absent class members are somehow bound by a judgment in this case, when they didn't opt in. I hope that ­­ I thought that was the whole purpose of not opting in, so you're not bound by this judgment.",
  "Mr. Frederick, I ­­ I'm not sure that you've answered the ­­ the two substantive questions that I see my colleagues asking, okay? With respect to whether you're a knife wielder or not, if you are assigned to ­­ to bear a knife during the day, you're going to be paid for that time anyway because you're on the start­to­end day, okay? So you're not going to get FSLA for that. So it's only the people who start out the day being required to don those outfits.",
  "All right.",
  "I'm ­­ I'm going to try to phrase what I understand the question my colleagues have been posing that I don't think either counsel has sort of gotten at, or maybe it's so obvious that we're missing it, okay? Clearly, the expert here, Dr. Joy, said ­­ I'm using a hypothetical ­­ there's 10 minutes of overtime. And the figure that comes out with 10 minutes of overtime is a million dollars. Now the jury comes back with half a million dollars. How do you know that what they said is ­­ I half the time ­­ five minutes, or the jury said, I think it's eight minutes or ­­ for slaughterhouse and three for production line people. So it averages out to five now, okay? How do we know what ­­ how the jury calculated that half million?",
  "That's what my colleagues are saying. So the question is, your adversary is claiming that there might be some people on the three­minute side who are going to come and collect a pro rata share who really weren't injured because they had worked 39 hours and 57 ­­ 56 minutes, something like that. So why is it that it's fair to distribute this ­­ this award pro rata?",
  "Didn't they standardize walking time? That's what I thought they used.",
  "There's a standardized walking time because some people are faster than others, correct?",
  "I have the ­­",
  "So you really don't have a statutory argument. You're making a Sixth Amendment argument because if it were a statutory argument, it would be you can ­­ you can restrain ­­ you can't restrain untainted assets.",
  "I guess I'm ­­ I understand what you're going to say because I read your brief.",
  "But the logic of your argument would suggest that you can't freeze untainted assets for anything, because you're saying the government has no property right to it. It's untainted. It's your money; it's not their money until they secure a judgment. And so the logic of your position would be, I think, they can't restrain untainted assets, period, constitutionally or statutorily.",
  "I know you don't because it's very nice that you limit it. But once we announce a rule, we have to carry it to its logical conclusion. And if the rule is it's untainted assets and it belongs to me, how do we then limit it?",
  "I know this is not part of the question asked, but I know that it ­­ it's suggested in the fringes of the briefs. How does the district court ensure that she doesn't use every penny for defense costs when the district court thinks that that's not reasonable, for example?",
  "Well, we have a new statute. 853 made a difference between ­­ and still does ­­ between tainted and untainted.",
  "This section came later, and it says substitute property.",
  "Do you really ­­",
  "Kaley was a question of tracing, because it was ­­",
  "But you don't have any tracing problem here. As soon as he commits a crime that you say was worth $45 million, you can freeze $45 million worth of assets, correct?",
  "I respect that, and ­­ but ­­ but you agreed that these particular funds were untainted. I'm told by your adversary ­­",
  "Mr. Dreeben, you're taking Monsanto out of context, because 853, by its nature, was limited to tainted funds. This is the first statute if ­­ that I know of that permits the government to come in and take untainted funds. The incidence of the tainted funds concept was, you can't spend another person's money. You stole this money somehow, and you can't spend that money because it belongs to someone else. It really doesn't belong to you. But it's not until a judgment ­­ and this is what your adversary is trying to say ­­ that the money that's untainted, the money that ­­ or the property that he bought before this crime, this untainted property becomes yours. It's not until that moment, the judgment, that the property is forfeitable.",
  "You can't forfeit it beforehand. So now the issue is ­­",
  "Well, but ­­ but still the question becomes, is there a substantive difference, and I think Justice Breyer is expressing ­­ the problem with this, as Justice Kagan said, this intuitive sense, which is where do we draw this line?",
  "Does the right to counsel have any meaning anymore?",
  "Frankly, I expect within three to five years, if we rule in your favor, 853 will be changed to have this same language.",
  "Yes, but not pretrial.",
  "But that's true of every judgment.",
  "Every judgment gives you a right to substitute property of some sort.",
  "On the basis of the argument in this case, I didn't think there was any argument that the government tried this case solely on the theory that he encourage others to exceed their authority.",
  "That's how they argued the case. That's how it was indicted. So why isn't it harmless error?",
  "It's not sufficient to support the conclusion that he exceeded authority.",
  "But it is more than sufficient, if not the only theory they could have convicted on, was that they ­­ that he had encouraged others to exceed their authority.",
  "My problem is that I don't know that it's rational to say that a jury in ­­ that sufficiency of the evidence has to do with what was charged as ­­ what was charged to the jury as opposed to what was laid out in the statute and/or in the indictment. If it's sufficient under both, what you're trying to say now is it may be sufficient under both. You're conceding it is. You're conceding it is a possibility the jury found what was charged in the indictment, but the government now has added an element to the crime.",
  "Do you have any case where we've held that or anything close to it?",
  "Have you had any case discussing sufficiency of the evidence where we look to the jury instruction as opposed to the statute and the indictment?",
  "The court below ­­",
  "The court below ­­",
  "­­ is by waiver. I ­­",
  "I'd like to get to the substance of your argument, but as I understand your argument, this wasn't a waiver which the court found below. You're arguing it's a forfeiture.",
  "Forfeiture because it was unintentionally done.",
  "And so you are going under plain error.",
  "All right.",
  "So you're saying when there is plain error, when there isn't an intentional ­­ you don't disagree with the government that there are intentional waivers that you can't raise on appeal of the statute of limitations. We've gotten a few of them here.",
  "All right.",
  "So let's assume this is under plain error. Now let's go to what ­­ what made this plain. Okay? We have a bunch of cases that say that this is a statute of limitations as opposed to a jurisdictional bar. Why would it be plain that this is jurisdictional?",
  "I'm sorry. I ­­",
  "­­ I ­­ I ­­ I'm having a very hard time accepting that argument. If we say that it ­­ it wasn't plain, that this was a claim­processing rule ­­",
  "Let ­­ let ­­ let me ­­ I've been trying to break this down. Let's assume that this had been charged as \"or.\"",
  "In the jury instruction.",
  "And you concede there was no evidence of the second prong of the \"exceeding authorized.\" How would we look at the case then? It's not A plus B, and we know they had to have found A and B, and if they were wrong on B, they still found A.",
  "This is ­­ we're not sure which they did, A or B.",
  "And B is not actionable, let's just say, or there's insufficient ­­",
  "But that's interesting because I ­­ I ­­ I'm not sure that that's true.",
  "My hypothetical was that B is not statutorily proper.",
  "Yes.",
  "How do you deal with his argument that we should ­­ if, in a civil case, we make a presumption that a statute of limitations is a claim­processing rule? In a criminal case, we should have the opposite presumption because of, A, the rule of lenity and, B, because it is on the ­­ a question of the power of the government.",
  "Could you summarize for me your position on three arguments he made.",
  "I ­­ I know the jurisdictional one.",
  "But then there's the ­­",
  "­­ the other two.",
  "So what would you argue if this was brought up on habeas?",
  "Let's assume counsel comes in and says, I just didn't notice it.",
  "Yes. And ­­ and it's very clear ­­ and the evidence was super clear that this was past the statute of limitations. I don't want to get into the facts of this case.",
  "I ­­ I somehow feel you've given up too much. You can charge a discriminatory termination, correct? And that's the employer making a decision that he is going to fire you for reasons that are not legitimate; they're discriminatory. Isn't a constructive discharge that the moment that the environment has gotten so hostile that you feel overwhelmed and have to leave, isn't that the discriminatory act as well?",
  "So that that discharge itself is discriminatory because it ­­ the employer has proceeded in a pattern that has led you to that decision?",
  "That's what I'm saying. I don't think ­­ I think it's ­­",
  "You keep talking about it as two separate elements.",
  "That's the precipitating ­­",
  "It's not a breach.",
  "The agreement says if he hasn't taken all the steps, if it does not occur, Mr. Green will report for duty.",
  "In Wyoming.",
  "Why not have the second sentence there?",
  "Why have the second sentence there at all? Why are you giving him an option if he's ­­ if he hasn't retired?",
  "There was not reached by the court below, correct?",
  "Frankly, I'm a little less moved by that because, from my personal experience, those stale claims generally don't make it past a motion to dismiss.",
  "Very few of them are appealed because if they're really that stale, those constructive discharge claims are usually thrown out.",
  "The case is litigated on other grounds.",
  "I'm sorry. That's true, and that's why I thought ­­",
  "­­ that was an open question. But the government, Mr. Gannon says that in fact the district court said that you chose to retire on ­­ in December, and you didn't appeal that finding by the district court.",
  "I just don't understand how.",
  "Meaning under Pan Am, we looked at the operative paragraphs of the complaint, not the general pleadings or background. We looked at what remedies were sought to determine whether you were looking to enforce the law. Each of the causes of action here are under State law. How is that seeking redress under Federal law?",
  "No, it looked at the operative paragraphs. Why should ­­",

  "Isn't that what the State court's going to do when it hears this action? There's nothing about the alleged causes of action ­­ they allege theft and fraud. So they're going to have to prove theft and fraud under State law as defined in the sections that they've cited.",
  "All of that.",
  "Now, that might be something you could object to at trial if they try to say State law is the same as Federal law and can't prove it. You then appeal that decision if it's wrong. If State law is different, you prove it's different. I'm just not sure what that has to do with the well­pleaded complaint that ­­ that they are saying this is a duty that arises under the theft and fraud provisions of New Jersey's uniform Securities Act.",
  "Over ­­",
  "I'm sorry. I always thought violations had to do with criminal law. And the whole structure of this provision talks first ­­ in the first half of the first sentence it talks about violations of the law. The second sentence parallels it, says criminal.

  "I don't know that ­­",
  "It talks about criminal proceedings.",
  "The issue ­­",
  "The issue that that case settled or addressed was whether exhaustion was required at all. Minimal research would have shown that every other court at that time who had addressed the issue had required exhaustion. Now, we'll go later to exhaustion­when. That's a separate question. So how could you reasonably rely on a lower court decision that hasn't gone through the crucible of appellate review without having done any research on whether its premises were subject to dispute, reasonable dispute, and rely on that?",
  "But they raised the argument just lost. They raised the argument that the exhaustion requirement didn't meet the commonality prong of class certification. So they did make an argument against it.",
  "I know that's what you believe, but every other court up until that time had said no, you needed to exhaust. Now, we can go to a separate question of exhaust­when later. But how could you at that point rely on that case to think that you didn't have to ­­",
  "Actually ­­",
  "­­ that's not quite true. There's a circuit split which hasn't been addressed anywhere in the briefing. Some of the circuits do it the way you say. They stop the clock and restart the clock at the end of the tolled period. In those circuits you would win. You could wait the entire six years plus however long the other case was pending. But another series of circuits looked to diligence throughout the period. And so you'd be asking us to make an assumption about which ­­ or make a decision about which tolling applies. You are taking a risk no matter what you did.",
  "Well, let's go back to Justice ­­",
  "­­ Scalia's question ask you a question.",
  "All of these decisions, were they made with the advice of a lawyer? And I have a sense that the Tribe was concerned about its resources and that they were just getting together and talking about this and deciding, we're not going to win under the law, so we're not going to file. And it was only when Cherokee Nation was decided by this Court that they realized they had a viable claim. So ­­ but answer my question: Was there legal advice sought?",
  "If we disagree that that was ­­ if we think that was unreasonable, what ­­ your reading of what class counsel said, what would happen?",

  "No, in the prior case.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, no, no, no, no. You said that the lawyers had told you that there would be class action tolling. That was the general ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "But you haven't answered my question. That's the only advice from a lawyer you received.",
  "How did it know that, in Cherokee Nation? He claims that the only decision was on ­­ under Rule 23, and that presentment and tolling was not at issue there.",
  "Well, let's talk about the American Pipe tolling. It would seem to me, as has happened in a number of litigations, that at the time that the complaint is filed, it doesn't mean that every member of the class has to have exhausted, because if that's what it means, then there can never be a class action.",
  "All right. So that issue is still open under the law, because it would seem to me, and I could be wrong, that if you still have time on the clock when the complaint is filed, that you can ­­ before you receive any remedy under the class action suit, you can present ­­ exhaust then, and recover, if you've done it during the period that ­­ the six­year period plus tolling. That's what some courts have done. They've defined the class as people who have exhausted, or who still have time to exhaust.",
  "Well, this is a slightly different argument. You're saying they can't get equitably tolled for exhaustion of the administrative process.",
  "Even if they could get tolled for filing a lawsuit.",
  "That it's settled in all 13 circuits. They've all ruled one way. You don't think it's reasonable to give advice based on that ruling, that that might be an exceptional circumstance?",
  "So how about it's not 13, it's 12, but you're in a circuit that hasn't ruled. You mean that it's ­­ it wouldn't be an extraordinary circumstance in that situation?",
  "That's one circuit. I'm talking about the vast majority.",
  "12 out of 13.",
  "Fair. Fair answer.",
  "There ­­ there are so many people who don't have resources to pursue a litigation. How do we differentiate you from those millions of people with lack of resources who choose not to pursue claims, either because they think, at least up till then, they're going to lose, because that's the state of the law, or for whatever other reason they're waiting? How ­­ how do we ­­ how do we articulate an equitable tolling principle that won't open a floodgate to making a statute of limitations basically a nullity?",
  "If it was reasonable, why didn't you litigate that?",

  "Can I address that for a moment? States appoint judges. Sometimes they're elected, but often they're appointed.

  "Sometimes.",
  "So ­­",
  "We've gotten off on a side trip. Mr. Kneedler, some of my colleagues have been expressing a question that I am sure you haven't answered, which is how can, or how does the Constitution, particularly Article III, which gives every citizen the right to have their claims adjudicated before an Article III Court, how does Congress have the power to let ­­ to place adjudicatory powers over a nonmember, non­Tribe member in a tribal court?",

  "It makes ­­ you're ­­ you just want to cherry pick what \"sovereignty\" means.",
  "Because if they're sovereign, the United States can have treaties with people that basically say in your land, you do what you want; I'm not going to enforce your judgment if I don't think it's consistent with due process here. But we don't dictate to other sovereigns what kind of systems they should have. You're right we have the power to do that, but it's still something that we don't have to exercise.",
  "I'm sorry. The system that you're advocating ­­ just so I get it right ­­ you're saying constitutionally any ­­ every State is immune from any acts that they commit ­­ this is the point that Justice Ginsburg is making ­­ from any acts they commit against a noncitizen even if they've waived sovereign immunity within their own State.",
  "All ­­ all ­­ all I have to do is what? There's no noncitizen of ­­ of a State who can ever be held ­­ who could ever sue a State for whatever bad acts they've had.",
  "What ­­ what's the ­­",
  "Why would they do that?",
  "I ­­ I ­­ I could understand them getting together, which they haven't done, to agree upon limits to each other's or waivers of sovereign immunity. But what would induce them to come together to do that?",
  "If they ­­ if they don't think that they're forced to?",
  "And we have here 34 states tell us that they didn't like this rule. How come they haven't gotten together and done an agreement among all of them?",
  "There's no question that they gave ­­ this is why the Eleventh Amendment ­­ they gave up a lot of things to the Federal government. And I can understand why they thought they needed the Eleventh Amendment. But what makes you think that they gave up their sovereignty with each other with respect to these kinds of issues?",
  "It's not in the Constitution.",
  "You ­­ I'm ­­ I'm even further confused. I ­­ I understand that you gave up any racial or ­­ or political gerrymandering case. This is just a voter­dilution case.",
  "Now, I understand there's one case you're relying on that was summarily affirmed, but is there any other case from this Court that has ever said that a ­­ a deviation of this amount is significant? I think we've always called it anything below 9 percent de minimis, correct?",
  "I ­­ I don't actually understand. I don't know of any case where we've required an explanation under 10 percent.",
  "Well, in fact, they have. They've pretty much used 10 percent. We've not discouraged them from doing that.",
  "Why bother having a minor? Don't you think this will lead every single plan to be challenged as voter dilution?",
  "The problem is that ­­ what you're forgetting is the dual interest. There is a voting interest, but there is also a representation interest, and it's that which has led us to ­­ to accept the total population base because States have to have some discretion to figure out who should be having the representational voice. Burns made it very clear that we were deferring to the State because it had a legitimate reason for its need. And ­­ but Burns was in the 1960s, when we picked total population as a perfectly legitimate way because there's a representational need at issue as well. Not just voting. A State has to be able to say ­­ I think just as the Federal government did ­­ we're ­­ the legislature is protecting not just voters; it's protecting its citizens ­­ or noncitizens. The people who live there.",
  "What's interesting is in Reynolds is the reason they caved was because, constitutionally, the Arizona Constitution required total population. It's that fact that they deviated from their own Constitution that led them to court. So it wasn't a caving compelled by Federal law. It was mostly a caving compelled by State law.",
  "No. But what I'm saying is that we ­­ we acceded on the ground that using total populations was permissible.",
  "You had an expert say it, but you didn't have an expert prove it. He did not come in with a map that did that.",
  "How is ­­ does practical possibility play into this discussion at all? I mean, the ACS, which you posit is the way that you can find who the eligible voters are, has been ­­ has been ­­ I think almost decisively been proven as being inadequate. It only measures cities with populations or places with populations over 65,000. Just on that ground alone, there are going to be districts that can't rely on it.",
  "It's flawed on many levels. We could ­­ take my assumption. It's flawed. Does that practicality have any play in our decision?",
  "Do you think they did that invidiously? Did they do it purposely?",
  "They knew that, and they intentionally decided to have deviations greater than 10 percent? That's what you're saying?",
  "That goes both back to my point that they decided that they wanted to make this a representational matter. But do ­­ so they were precluded ­­ intentionally decide to exclude it?",
  "Well, we have ­­ we have plenty of case law that says you can have deviations greater than 10 percent ­­ Hawaii did ­­ if you have a legitimate reason. And so why would ­­ the great representational need that Justice Kagan was talking about not be an adequate reason?",
  "You're ­­ you're now ­­ you're now saying 10 to 20 percent is okay instead of 10 percent when we use total population.",
  "Well, how about ­­",
  "How about children who are citizens when their parents are not, which is fairly common in many areas?",
  "Could you explain why the ACS ­­ your adversary says ACS is fine; it's used in Section 2 and Section 5. Why would it be inappropriate to use it in ­­ in deciding the impact on an equal voting analysis?",
  "That's not quite accurate. For ­­ for most States, too many, they disenfranchise prisoners, except for those who come from that locale, which is quite rational. Most States disenfranchise the mentally ill. So how are they ­­ who else are they going to disenfranchise?",
  "Assume need was proven. I know. You're ­­ you're ­­ you're ­­ we're putting aside need. What's wrong with this plan if need is put aside?",
  "No, no, no, no.",
  "I know you're saying they don't need to do it. I said put it aside and answer Justice Ginsburg's question.",
  "If they had to use race, how are they using it improperly?",
  "My God, that sounds like it's using race more rather than less than this plan does.",
  "How does that ­­",
  "You still haven't answered why this is worse than Bakke. I mean ­­",
  "How is race given ­­",
  "How is race given a plus? I ­­ I thought that what they're looking for is leaders in diversity, not just of race, but of experiences generally.",
  "So how ­­",
  "I think your brief admitted that this isn't in favor of any particular race, that white people in some situations can show leadership, as ­­ as well as black or Hispanic or Asian or Native American. Any race could benefit from this plus factor. So how is this ­­",
  "­­ worse than Bakke?",
  "I'm sorry. I thought that the study they did showed that in 1996, they had more participation in these smaller classes.

That was a ­­ but there were more of those classes in 1996 than in 2003 or '2 when they were looking at that study. It would seem to me that that suggests that there's less ­­ what they took from it, that there's less exchange of ideas in a classroom rather than more, based on this race­neutral policy.",
  "What's wrong ­­ since you have to infer these things, you can't use a quota.",
  "You're saying we can't ­­ they can't use demographics. So they use a study that shows there's less classes. There's less people in classes. They talk to administrators, faculty, and students. They're having racial incidents on campus where students of color are complaining that they feel isolated, that stereotyping is going on, on campus. What more do they need?",
  "Could I ­­",
  "May I ask ­­",
  "I'm sorry. I thought you said ­­",
  "I'm sorry. I'm not sure where you get that number. As I look at it, between 2004 and 2006 ­­ '7, it nearly doubled from 3.6 of the holistic class to 6.8. For Hispanic students ­­ that's for blacks ­­ it went from 11.6 to 16.9. I don't think that's ­­ that small a change. In 2008, two ­­ 20 percent of all black students and 15 percent of all Hispanic students were offered admission through holistic review. Black and Hispanic admission and enrollment rates have increased since 2005. This is on ­­ on holistic review. The only exception was 2008, and that was because 92 percent of the class came in under the 10 percent plan.",
  "When your number ­­",
  "­­ that's not small.",
  "Well, wait a minute. I don't understand how that can be. If the 2004 number was that much lower than the 2007 number, race has to have some input in that fact ­­ in that ­­",
  "Could I ask you a different question now? I fear something. I know there is an educational debate on the benefits and costs of a 10 percent plan. I don't want to get into that debate, but I do have a worry, which is: If you're reading proof of a compelling need, or proof of a compelling need, will any holistic review ever survive? Because as I'm reading your answer, to narrowly tailor, schools have to use nonracial means of doing it. And if the 10 percent plan is the only thing that achieves a greater number in minorities, won't every school have to use a 10 percent plan?",
  "So your answer is yes. If there's no other ­­",
  "­­ way of doing it, then the only other race­neutral way ­­ if offering scholarships, which this university did, increasing outreach to minority neighborhoods, they did and continue to do ­­ there's a list of about six or eight other things they did that didn't increase the admission of minorities.",
  "One of the ­­",
  "Let me ­­",
  "Mr. Garre, this is the fundamental problem that I think Justice Alito is pointing to, and you're sort of talking past each other. So maybe I'll explain his view.",
  "Strange, isn't that?",
  "I think I'll explain what his view is. He seems to think that you didn't study the 10 percent admittees enough before ­­ to make ­­ to see whether that group was diverse in and of itself, whether you had enough people within that group that were change agents, that were ­­ had ­­ were not just poor people, but people with college­educated parents, whatever other diverse view factors. He's ­­ I think he's saying, you didn't look to see if the 10 percent plan did enough for you.",
  "And with deficits that plan created, that you should have filled in the holistic­looking. So he thinks it's fatally flawed.",
  "All right? Because of that. So that's his view, I think. So assuming that view, what's your answer?",
  "I know. He said it wasn't, right?",
  "That was with the ten ­­ so seven years ­­",
  "Race­blind ­­",
  "­­ and a certain number of them were with the 10 percent ­­",
  "Do you think ­­ do you think that change has to happen overnight? And do you think it's ­­",
  "I ­­ I ­­ I ­­ what you're saying, basically, is, is this is what the Fifth Circuit concluded and which the school basically agrees, okay? If you don't consider race, then holistic percentage, whatever it is, is going to be virtually all white.",
  "All white.",
  "And to say ­­ no ­­",
  "Oh, but there is ­­",
  "No, it's not ­­",
  "It's not, because the reality ­­",
  "­­ that Justice ­­",
  "­­ Alito wants to rely on. Let me finish my point. He's right. For their educational needs, there are competing criteria. They need to keep a certain SAT, or whatever that's called, AI index, that has to be high because of the quality they want to keep the school at. That does discriminate against blacks on some levels, because the difference in numbers are high. So if you have something like this, you're ­­ what you're saying, basically, is, and what he's proposing, is change your educational needs across the board, and focus in only on race, and make sure that your school is black, Hispanic, or whatever on numbers that are going to reduce its educational quality. That's basically what you're arguing, isn't it?",
  "Why? What we know is ­­",
  "­­ the school doesn't have enough ­­",

  "How is that different ­­",

We've already permitted subsidization of bar associations, of government programs. We've permitted assessments on a lot of different levels, so why can't the government, as employer, create a State entity? Because this union under California law is a State entity.",
  "Oh ­­",
  "­­ I ­­ I beg to differ. Hold on, Mr. Carvin. I'll get you the section.",
  "It says, \"When recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative, a union assumes an official position in the operational structure of a school.\" So it seems to me that ­­ and California tells the union what topics it can negotiate on, it requires them to do training, and in the end it accepts their recommendations with respect to ­­ to the issues of employment at its own will, meaning the State is creating the union as part of the employment training and other responsibilities.",

I'm not sure about their credibility, but I believe he's guilty because he wanted to get rid of this guy because of a ­­ a drug deal gone bad. Would that violate due process?",
  "Well, this isn't speculation. The judge said who ­­ Larry Owens knew he was a drug dealer; Larry Owens wanted to knock him off; I think the State's evidence has proved that fact; finding of guilty of murder. Proved that Larry Owens wanted to knock him off?",
  "I'm not sure ­­ you know, the problem is that you're making an allegation I'm not sure about. They had trouble with one of the witnesses. They wrote it. Correct?",
  "All right. So that leaves it to a one­witness ID of a witness who ­­ who, at best, saw the defendant once, when he turned around to leave the scene for a few seconds.",
  "Right. I mean, once. Fleeting look. How can you draw a reasonable inference that the judge wasn't troubled by the witnesses when he says I think all of the witnesses skirted the real issue.",
  "Well, except that evidence failed to identify him in court.",
  "It's pretty easy to ­­ to identify a defendant in court. They sit next to the defense attorney. I've always thought it's been a wonderfully ­­ a ritual with no meaning. But putting that aside, I guess my question is: You say that Johnnie's testimony was sufficient. I don't disagree with that. But what they didn't say was that it was credible, or that the judge found it credible. Those are two different findings.",
  "No. All the judge had to say was, I'm not sure he's credible. And what takes me over the line is this motivation, this theory that I have.",
  "This is quite interesting. You can draw an inference about a defendant based on no evidence. No one said he was a drug dealer, I presume. Did he have any convictions for drug dealing?",
  "He did not. So the judge could just make this up out of whole cloth.",
  "And that's not extraneous evidence.",
  "That's a new theory. I didn't read that in your brief, that somehow, the judge was right. He can ­­ he can assume that Owens knew that the defendant was a drug dealer.",

  "I ­­ I don't think I understand the difference between general and specific. Evidence is evidence. And you draw inferences from all sorts of circumstances.

Would we ­­ you draw a general inference that the corrected Guideline would have made any difference on that sentence?",
  "So what changed the judge's mind in terms of the facts? He gave you the max when it was 80 to 100. What's going to change his mind about 70 to 100?",
  "Let's assume I don't believe there's a presumption, okay? It's very hard for me to understand what difference between 70 and 100 and 80 and 100 could make. In this case, I have a difficulty understanding what difference the ­­ the Criminal History Category would make. But I'll give you another example of overlapping Guidelines: a defendant who's never committed a crime and a defendant who has committed a crime. I would be more inclined to say that an inference from the facts is that a defendant who's never been committed of a crime, that the judge might take that into consideration, even in an overlapping Guideline case, and send it back. Because we don't know how much mercy that judge might have shown. But if a defendant like yours has many criminal convictions, I'd be pretty close to saying I don't think he's going to make much of a different choice.",

And there are a number of circuits who have said that. Overlapping Guidelines, you can never prove. That ­­ that seems that that's an assumption that's wrong, under your articulation of plain­error review.",
  "So let's go to Justice Alito's point. The more concrete here is that the parties were fighting about extremes. Sentence him, the government said, to the high end. The defendant was arguing he's entitled to the low end. There is some additional proof there. The judge picks the low end. If the Guideline is an anchor, which I think is almost undisputed, isn't that enough to say it affected substantial rights?",
  "Except the judge ­­",
  "­­ knew that he could have departed upwards under the old Guideline, because this criminal history was pretty serious. You argued he was entitled to the ­­ to the ­­ and should sentence at the upper end, and yet the judge sentenced him at the low end. So the ­­ the criminal history has less effect on the judge than it has on you, or perhaps on me.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, why is this different than the Chief Justice's example?",
  "But for only this case.",
  "And only this sovereign.",
  "Does the government have a position on the Respondent's argument that we have an alternative ground to affirm on? And that would be that their ­­ these assets were ­­ could be executed under Section 201(a)?",
  "Mr. Landau, there's something you said that resonates with me, 'cause I've been trying to find a definition of \"sovereignty.\" And one has been created in the briefing by saying that states are sovereign; yet if you look at international usage, they wouldn't consider states necessarily sovereign because they can't order their foreign affairs. They can't print money. They can't do lots of things that others would consider them sovereign for. So I guess the Constitution does something else with that word. What is it ­­ what are the elements of sovereignty with respect to the Double Jeopardy Clause that you think are commanded by our case law? There ­­ there's more than just the Puerto Rican people say.",
  "And it can't be that it's the compact alone. So what is it? What are the principles ­­",
  "­­ that you meet that would create sovereignty in the Double Jeopardy sense?",
  "Now, I'm looking at Lanza, and it says ­­ I think Lanza says, and it's a Double Jeopardy ­­",
  "­­ Clause, that for Double Jeopardy Clause purposes, sovereignty means, one, that the separate entity possesses the authority to determine what shall be an ­­ an offense against their peace and dignity; two, can enact laws without the interference of the other; and, three, draws authorities to punish the offender ­­ and this is the one that you've been arguing ­­ from a distinct source of power from the other sovereign.",
  "And ­­ and you keep saying it's the Constitution. It's the \"We the People.\" It sounds a ­­ a bit histrionic to me. It ­­ there's something else. What is meant ­­",
  "­­ by this distinct source of power?",
  "Going back to the political issues. And ­­ and ­­ and that's what I think Justice Breyer is trying to stay away from. This is a very simple question.",
  "All right? Can the Federal government override a Puerto Rican law?",
  "Can they ­­",
  "Can they veto a Puerto Rican law?",
  "All right.",
  "Who makes these laws?",
  "The laws were made by Puerto Rico's comparable Congress.",
  "But that was not true of many of the territories that were admitted as States. They came in to Statehood and were conferred by a ­­ the sovereignty was conferred by a ­­ agreement with the Federal government. And States were admitted by agreement, and sovereignty were confirmed on them by agreement. And so are you telling me that if ­­ let's say one of the islands in the Caribbean. I'll make one up. Okay? Atlantis has been ­­ never kicked out its foreign colonial status 200 years ago, but it really doesn't have many resources. And it comes to the United States and it says, I want a treaty. You'll take care of all of our external affairs. We'll follow whatever you say with respect to external affairs. We're even going to use the American dollar 'cause it's convenient, but you can't touch our internal affairs. And Congress approves that treaty. Would that, for Double Jeopardy purposes, not be a sovereign?",
  "But if Congress has that treaty power, why does it have similar power under its Rule and Regulation Clause of the Constitution? There's no limiting principle of what rules and regulations Congress can make.",
  "Under that ­­",
  "I'm sorry. You ­­ you're saying to me that Congress can't make Puerto Rico independent?",
  "So if it can do that, why can't it have other arrangements with Puerto Rico the way it has with everybody else? Why are we saying that with respect to territories they don't have that power?",
  "You think that doesn't have meaning? In most municipalities, their offenses are treated as criminal offenses and not criminal infractions. They can only pass laws with respect to a very limited amount of issues. The States have control over many, many other things. They are substantially different. Why would we have bothered talking about the structure of Florida's system with municipalities in Waller? We went through how the State controlled all of the ­­ most of the internal affairs of municipalities, and we said they are not separate sovereigns because of this control. All we could have said is what you want us to say now, which is municipalities' ultimate source is the State government. But we did something very different in that case.",
  "I'm sorry. They haven't issued that. In all of those cases, Grafton and all of the ones pre­1952, the Court pointed to the fact that, when these islands pass laws, they could be vetoed by Congress or ­­ or were ­­ that was the Organic Act. In all of these places, Congress was appointing their legislature, in part, or they were appointing colonial governors. And we went through, in each one of them, very carefully, what the issues of control that remained, that didn't make them sovereign in any way, that made them classic territories. So it's not that we didn't ­­ we eschewed looking at that.",
  "But you forget that Congress could veto those laws.",
  "Before 1952, Congress could veto Puerto Rico's laws. It has relinquished that right.",
  "Mr. Landau, would you explain what \"estado libre asociado\" means in Spanish?",
  "Literally.",
  "Do you know why they didn't use that phrase in the compact with the United States?",
  "I believe, because I've seen the Act, that they didn't because States have a different meaning in the United States.",
  "The Solicitor General's office claims that Grafton says that when we're looking at double jeopardy, we're looking at something different. We're looking at territory versus state. Do you agree with that reading of the Shell case and of Grafton?",
  "And how about Shell?",
  "I'm sorry. I thought there was an unwritten policy.",
  "How could he? If we say there's no First Amendment right, what civil right has he ­­ was violated if ­­ if what Mr. Goldstein says is the ­­",
  "­­ is the state of the law attempting to violate civil rights? What right, if we say there isn't the First Amendment?",
  "Well, if we say it doesn't exist. You lose this case.",
  "Just that, the right you're claiming.",
  "We're off on a tangent because there's no injury in this situation when the law doesn't go into effect. But coming back to what Justice Breyer, I believe, is attempting to say ­­",
  "I don't know, Mr. Goldstein, that I understand either. And I think Justice Kagan asked you this. Why does it matter ­­ and we don't care whether someone is a Republican or not in Elrod and Branti and those cases ­­ and you say it's only because it's a policy. The intent of the government is to say I'm not going to promote anybody who is not a Democrat or not a Republican.",
  "Well, someone, they have come along and not promoted people.",
  "All right? So you have to have someone come in and say I'm not a Democrat?",
  "I'm not a ­­",
  "­­ Republican? Or you need someone to tell you what they are?",
  "So why isn't it simple to say, I'm not hiring you, or, I'm demoting you because you politically associated? And doesn't that chill the person from even walking by a campaign? Doesn't it chill others who do want to associate marginally?",
  "I'm assuming there's no policy in place, or that there's not ­­",
  "There's nothing to prevent this otherwise, like the Hatch Act.",
  "I'm sorry. You have to ­­ you have to show some facts to draw that inference.",

  "To show some connection between the firing and ­­",
  "­­ the political belief.",
  "I'm ­­ I'm so totally confused. I know it's the way it was presented to us, but I thought he testified that he had made a choice not to get involved in the campaign but that Spagnola was his friend and he supported him. So he wasn't neutral; he just wasn't engaging in associational conduct by choice. That's what I thought.",
  "Well, this is not a traditional trust, because this is shareholders and not beneficiaries.",
  "It ­­ it's a very different sort of concept. So now you're asking us to come and place trustee law above our general rule, that you're either a corporation or you're not.",
  "And only the corporation can have a place of business or an ­­ a place of incorporation.",
  "I thought the shareholders owned the property. They had the legal interest in the law.",
  "Do you have any definition of what the common law trust was? I'll ­­ I'll give you the ones I understand, and you tell me how you don't. I thought in a common law trust, the trustees had legal title. They owned the assets. They could be sued individually, and ­­ and they could sue in their own names. In this REIT, as I understand it, the assets are in the name of the Trust, not in the name of the individual trustees, and it is the Trust that sues or can be sued, not the individual trustees. Am I wrong about those ­­",
  "All right ­­",
  "­­ so go ­­ I'm right on the first part.",
  "Do you have a section for that? I'm going to look it up, so.",
  "Because that's not how I originally understood things, but ­­ that's all right ­­",
  "­­ you can give it to me on rebuttal.",
  "Thank you.",
  "So you're claiming a right not merely to use the hovercraft in the nonpublic lands. You're claiming that there's no residual right to control navigable waters in the Federal lands area?",
  "So what do you do about the ANILCA provision that says that boating and other water activities within public lands, within Federal public lands can be regulated?",
  "That's not what it says. It says any waters in the jurisdiction of the United States.",
  "Well, it could apply to both, is what I'm saying. What says it excludes navigable waters?",
  "Your reading on a practical basis with respect to the navigable waters makes almost no sense to me. I'm looking at a map attached to the petition of the State of Alaska. It's attached to the end of the brief. And it seems like these national parks are spread along the coast of Alaska in a haphazard way, meaning the national parks have jurisdiction over a small strip along the coast of Alaska. Presumably you're not arguing that this agreement controls the U.S. servitude of navigable waters around those strips.",
  "So you're saying that the U.S. can't control the navigable servitude in any part of that coast.",
  "Can.",
  "And so what do you take the words in ­­ in 103(c) to mean, the boating exception, when it says \"in the jurisdiction of the United States\"? \"Waters in the jurisdiction\"? You don't think navigable waters are within the jurisdiction of the United States in Federal lands?",
  "Repeat what you said. I didn't quite hear it or understand it. I'm sorry. Say it again.",
  "So you're not ­­ I'm sorry. You're not saying that the Coast Guard couldn't come in and say no hovercrafts around the Alaskan coast.",
  "How about if they wanted to say, in this alcove, the Coast Guard, not the Park Service, says you can't have hovercrafts, that would be okay?",
  "If it's wrong. And ­­ and ­­ and walk it through, their argument, and tell me why they are wrong. I think they start with that Federal lands, as defined under the statute, are only lands that the U.S. has title to. Do you take ­­ do you disagree with that? And if so, why?",
  "How? Read the statute ­­",
  "­­ and ­­ and ­­ and tell me how ­­",
  "­­ in the statute ­­",
  "­­ you can read it more broadly.",
  "I'm going ­­ I'm in the definition section.",
  "I'm with you so far. That gets you to regulating the waters in Federal ­­ in ­­ in ­­ in Federal units, because the U.S. under ANILCA only controls lands within the conservation units that are public lands.",
  "In the United States.",
  "So ­­ and does the no­hovercraft rule apply to the nonpublic lands? Is that the position you're taking, that you have the right to regulate that as well?",
  "Why? You're ­­ you're conceding that the waters are outside of that?",
  "Can you tell me whether that statute violates this statute?",
  "Some might argue that your proposed regulations on oil contravene the intent of this provision. So assuming we do, how do you deal with that? Assuming some people do. I don't ­­ I don't know that ­­",
  "Well, the specific would overcome the general. So if Congress passed a new statute, it could limit or expand 103 as it chose, correct?",
  "No. That's you winning. I think Justice Alito has been asking you this question from the beginning.",
  "What do you think the Ninth Circuit meant? And do you agree with its interpretation? As he pointed out ­­",
  "­­ you spent 49 pages of your brief arguing other things ­­",
  "­­ putting you to the test.",
  "All right. So what do you think it held?",
  "Do you think the Ninth Circuit was right?",
  "This tax was not imposed by the Tribe ­­ Tribe. This was a statute of Congress that permitted the Indians to do this, correct?",
  "Without jurisdictions, Tribes can't tax at will. They have to get approval for taxation, correct, from the Federal government?",
  "What ­­ what else ­­ what else do you lose if this ruling is against you? We've already circumscribed the powers of the Tribes on their own reservations greatly, so what powers do you lose? You've already ceded to the Federal government criminal prosecution powers. So you're not losing out on that. What are you losing out on?",
  "I'm sorry. The Tribe has acceded to State sovereignty and the environment and in all sorts of things. Have they threatened to take away the State's activities in this village?",
  "This Tribe is awfully small. You think they are going to have the power to implement all of these things that you are fearful of? To do substitute services to ­­ they can't tax for it without the government's permission. So how are they going to do all these, and why would they do all these horrible things?",
  "I mean, it's nice to have the power of taxation, but they still need the government's approval.",
  "Well, the question of the City of Sherrill says if they try to exercise their powers in a way that's harmful to settled expectations, they might have a remedy in law. That's what City of Sherrill says, but that didn't take away ­­ the City of Sherrill didn't say the Indians weren't sovereign. It just said they can't exercise the sovereignty. It didn't say it was a diminishment. What they said is they couldn't exercise it because of latches.",
  "If the City of Sherrill did apply ­­",
  "If the City of Sherrill did apply, hypothetically ­­ I'm not nay­saying all the differences you're pointing out ­­ would you lose?",
  "Explain why not.",
  "Tell me what was objectively reasonable about it.",
  "I mean, the police officer admits that the person he saw coming out of the house in question wasn't doing anything. He didn't know that he lived there, he didn't know what he had done, if anything. He didn't even really know that there was drug dealing going on in the house. He was trying to figure that out. So what was objectively reasonable about stopping this man?",
  "It would be interesting if he waited to see whether this was also a short­stay visitor.",
  "I don't see how this is any different than stopping the first person you see.",
  "What's going to stop police officers ­­ if we announce your rule, and your rule seems to be, once we have your name, if there's a warrant out on you, that's an attenuating circumstance under every circumstance. What stops us from becoming a police state and just having the police stand on the corner down here and stop every person, ask them for identification, put it through, and if a warrant comes up, searching them?",
  "Well, if you have a town like Ferguson, where 80 percent of the residents have minor traffic warrants out, there may be a very good incentive for just standing on the street corner in Ferguson and asking every citizen, give me your ID; let me see your name. And let me hope, because I have an 80 percent chance that you're going to have a warrant.",
  "Don't you think it's enough of a deterrence to say to a police officer in this situation, you should have reasonable suspicion? You know the Fourth Amendment requires it. So before you do an intrusive act demanding identification, you do what you're permitted to do, which is just to ask the person whether they'll talk to you. Don't you think that that would improve the relationship between the public and the police? Wouldn't that be the appropriate encouragement we would give, if we don't let police do these things in questionable situations?",
  "We're begrudging them now from doing that. We're saying if you have questionable probable cause, go ahead and do it because we're not going to make you take that extra step of just merely stopping someone and saying, will you talk to me, please.",
  "So isn't flagrancy ­­",
  "This is a non sequitur. When you talk about an intervening circumstances ­­ we've looked at it in the case law ­­ it's always been something different than the actual stop. Another police officer comes by and says, oh, I've been searching for that guy. I know he has ­­ I ­­ I have a ­­ an arrest warrant for him. A witness walks by on another crime and says, he just robbed me down the block. Those are intervening circumstances because they are something outside of the stop. This location of evidence was a direct product of the stop.",
  "It would never have happened except for the stop.",
  "Mr. ­­ you know something? Finding the baggie of cocaine gives the officer reasonable ­­ probable cause to arrest, but we don't let that cocaine come into evidence merely because it was a ground for the arrest. We look at how the evidence was secured before deciding whether it's suppressible or not. And I don't see how this is any different than not letting someone be arrested ­­ or suppressing DNA evidence, fingerprint evidence that leads to other crimes. We've suppressed those things because they've been the product of an illegal stop.",
  "I'm sorry. I don't understand why. If there's an arrest warrant for someone, for whatever reason, you can arrest them. What you can't do is stop them illegally to effect an arrest. So it's not as if they're going to get away from whatever the underlying crime was. There's an arrest warrant, they're going to go back and serve their time on whatever circumstance existed warranting that arrest, why are they getting away with anything?",
  "Of another crime that the police would never have found. But we do that ­­",
  "But that's true of all evidence we suppress. Now you're attacking our suppression jurisprudence. We understand there's a cost to suppressing evidence. But we believe, as we've been taught by our precedents, that there is value in ensuring that the Fourth Amendment is respected.",
  "So what's our rule now? Now you don't need reasonable suspicion to stop someone. You only need questionable reasonable suspicion to stop someone.",
  "And now ­­ so we've now lessened the standard ­­ the Terry stop standard, which is fairly intrusive to stop someone. I ­­ I suspect, and I don't know whose brief it was, yours or your ­­ or Petitioner's, but someone said the public will stop this if they don't like police stopping you with no cause. I think the public may end up stopping things but in a way the police are not going to like.",
  "No. But ­­ but we're not saying ­­",
  "Now, we've gotten to the point where we no longer have reasonable suspicion at all, because you keep defending this stop. And I keep going to back to he has an anonymous call; he does see a certain number of short­stay visits, but he stops someone who he doesn't know has been a short­stay visit, has not seen there before, knows nothing about this person, and is doing a complete intrusive stop ­­ not just a hey, will­you­talk­to­me stop, but a formal investigatory stop ­­ on nothing else.",
  "Why wouldn't it? Why wouldn't it? Now, look at our case, Rodriguez case. We assumed that the check there was to ensure the safety of the officer.",
  "All right.",
  "If the stop here is purely investigatory, isn't that different? Can you have an investigatory stop based on no suspicion? You were right when you said he stopped to check for the warrant. The question is Justice Kennedy's question, which is: Is that legitimate?",
  "Yes.",
  "Without.",
  "In order to run the warrant ­­",
  "You're ­­",
  "There was no suspicion here. He was ­­ your client wasn't frisked.",
  "No. There was no activity that the officer is alleged to have seen that would put the officer in fear of any ­­ that this gentleman was violent or was going to turn on him or do anything else.",
  "Correct?",
  "So the purpose, as I understand what you're trying to say is, he is now routinely checking every single person that he stops, whether with or without reasonable suspicion. There can't be any other reason other than he wants to find the warrant or not.",
  "So part of the stop may be to investigate, but the other part of the stop is he's doing this routinely, with no reasonable suspicion, with no articulable fear of his ­­ for his own safety. He's demanding peoples' names, and he's running a warrant to do what? You're saying to find the warrant.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Well, all he did was go from the house to a convenience store, not in a car but walking.",
  "He walks to a convenience store, he's stopped in the parking garage but without a car. And I go back to this is not coming up to a parked automobile and getting shot, correct?",
  "I'm very surprised that Justice Alito doesn't know that most of these warrants are automatic. If you don't pay your fine within a certain amount of days, they're issued virtually automatically.",
  "It's routine practice to ­­ to run warrant checks. Every stop, legal or illegal, he says it's ­­ he runs warrants, on the street or in a car. Meaning, that's what the police officer testified to.",
  "So we now have a new rule. We've taken running warrants for traffic stops that we've thought were legitimate because they had to do with highway safety. Now we're saying to police officers, run warrants on any name you get because all you have to do is wave the flag of safety.",
  "You did ­­ your client stipulated away the cost that it would have been entitled to after winning before the GAO, correct?",
  "So there was relief. You just gave it away, essentially.",
  "Your client is still an FSS vendor and is still competing for contact ­­ contracts that the ­­",
  "Okay.",
  "The government takes the position that if we rule in your favor, that means that we're doing away with, effectively, the FSS. Is that your view?",
  "Can it tell from that database whether or not a particular vendor is a veteran or a disabled veteran?",
  "Well, there's two databases. There is the general database and there is the FSS database. Are we talking about the same one?",
  "Which ­­ and then you are wanting to do away with the FSS?",
  "So they go through the FSS and find the veteran­owned businesses?",
  "Hasn't the SBA been using it?",
  "But you're not talking about just the small value contracts. You want the supply to all contracts, to all orders. So to tell me that it works for the small ones is not answering the questions of my colleagues. How much is it going to complicate the big ones?",
  "What's the ­­",
  "I don't quite ­­",
  "So why is it that you call these order ­­ order contracts? I look at ­­",
  "I look at your history, and you, yourself, the government itself, calls these orders order contracts.",
  "It's not a kind. It is a contract.",
  "So tell me what kind of contract do you have, absent the order with the FSS vendor?",
  "How difficult is it for you to take the database that you have with respect to what are veteran­owned businesses. Take that database, look at it, look at what it is you need, a stapler, and see if ­­ how many vendors on that list supply staplers, and then check that against the FSS?",
  "If there's no veteran that matches the FSS list, then you go to the FSS. What's the problem with that ­­",
  "No. You didn't listen to me. You go to your veteran­owned list; you're looking for staplers. You find five veteran­owned businesses on your list that sell staplers, but you want to ­­ you need an FSS supplier, because you don't want to negotiate a new contract. You don't want to do all that hard work. You check whether there are two or more of those five on the FSS list.",
  "Exactly. Exactly.",
  "I don't care about the merits of whether it wins or loses. I'm talking about the legal issue. What is so difficult about that?",
  "I don't ­­ I don't ­­",
  "Except the FBA has interpreted this contrary to you; so has the GAO.",
  "But I don't understand your policy argument. Why is it so tough for you to ­­ to get those things from an FSS ­­ from an FSS vendor if it's a veteran? I mean ­­",
  "This year ­­",
  "Could you please ­­",
  "­­ explain to me ­­",
  "And you still haven't answered my question fully. If we limit that to preexisting orders where there is two or more veterans ­­",
  "­­ on the same practical consequences.",
  "Like we limit everything else. Once we say what we think, Congress then decides what it's going to do in the future.",
  "Right now, there are no statutes like that.",
  "The Small Business Administration has read it the way Kingdomware ­­",
  "Tell me how you articulate this. And I ask because the SG is talking about describing it as egregious conduct. You're saying something about willfulness and recklessness. And I don't know if this is all a matter of semantics, but I think the SG is right. Even if you give discretion to the district courts to make a judgment of when to enhance penalties, we have to give them some guidance.",
  "It can't be that they can give enhanced penalties on whim.",
  "All right? So if it's not whim, what is it? How do we articulate a test that protects what Justice Breyer is concerned about, which I think is a legitimate concern, but doesn't entrench a position that just favors you?",
  "And by that, I mean, you know ­­",
  "So how do ­­",
  "Help me ­­",
  "No, but that ­­ that ­­",
  "­­ you know, that these tests understands life a little ­­ is more ­­",
  "­­ complex than that. Okay? Because you can often use the conduct of someone, after the time, to reflect what they thought. And so if you're seeing that someone is withholding information, you might be able to infer that there wasn't good faith at the beginning.",
  "So your articulation doesn't really give life to the complexity of this inquiry.",
  "This is all the Read Corporation factors that the district court here did in the Stryker case.",
  "That's very nice, but I don't want to adopt that test. How do I articulate this in a more generalized way?",
  "That avoids the use of the word \"willfulness.\"",
  "That avoids the use of the word \"willfulness.\"",
  "But the bucket is there.",
  "Why isn't that post hoc defense necessarily ­­ you're almost reading it as unreasonable, by definition.",
  "I'm sorry. Doesn't the statute exempt out enhanced damages for pending applications?",
  "So why are you here?",
  "Mr. Phillips, I ­­ I ­­ there's a whole lot of worry articulated by Justice Breyer and reflected in your briefs about protecting innovation.",
  "But there's not a whole lot of worry about protecting the patent owner. I can't forget that historically enhanced damages were automatic, and they were automatic because of a policy judgment that owning a patent entitled you to not have people infringe willfully or not willfully. And I accept that at some point there was a different judgment made that ­­ that good­faith infringers should be treated differently than other infringers, willful infringers. But I don't know that that swung things so far the other way that it can only be that, if you come up with something, any defense whatsoever in the litigation that's not frivolous, that that gets you out of enhanced damages.",
  "If I'm there ­­",
  "If I'm there ­­",
  "­­ and I don't think that the Seagate test is ­­ is ­­ is appropriate but I am still in the balance of how do we get ­­",
  "­­ a similar protection without an artificial test that I don't think is right ­­",
  "­­ where ­­ where do I go?",
  "Well, the different court called it differently in the second case.",
  "Mr. Yang, I'd like to ­­ for you to explain to me what the difference in charges are between this robbery and a regular robbery, let's say of a business. Because as you've noted, there are many circuits that say if you just rob a person individually, that's not a Hobbs Act robbery. But if you rob a business, it is. So how does a judge charge in a regular Hobbs Act case and this kind of case?",
  "I understand the charges, counsel.",
  "Engages how, either by buying goods in commerce ­­",
  "Let's assume that that's true.",
  "Is the jury charged that this particular robbery had to affect that?",
  "Right.",
  "So ­­ so the jury is charged to make that determination, that this act of robbering the money hindered the commerce in some way?",
  "So how is that different than his argument, your adversary's argument that ­­",
  "But ­­ but I have to say that they also looked at a long­term contract ­­ FERC did, and PJM ­­ in the PJM Interconnection order, and it determined that a seven­year lock­in period for a new generator was unfair, unjust and unreasonable. It's something it can do. Why didn't that end what you're doing? You're arguing that you're not affecting price. FERC disagrees, because you have no incentive to bid anything other than zero. I don't understand why this case is not ended by FERC's determination that locked­in contracts are unjust and unreasonable.",
  "How is it different than your contract?",
  "I know the years are different, but I'm talking about the mechanics.",
  "I'm sorry. How would this ­­",
  "How would this work normally? Meaning forget that a lawsuit was started. You enter into this contract. Do you have to submit the contract to FERC?",
  "Can somebody protest here?",
  "Mr. Clement, can you tell me how I write this opinion? And I'll ask you why.",
  "As I look at the relevant statutory provisions, what it says is that FERC has the power to ensure that rates that are set are fair, are just and reasonable. So it doesn't say it gets to set the rates. It says it can do rules and regulation that control how the rates are set so that I'm not sure how this is field preemption. At best, I think it might be conflict preemption. And so if I think it's conflict preemption, that something about Maryland's plan conflicts with the system that FERC has set in place, how do I articulate the rule in this case? What is it that conflicts with FERC's rules and regulations with respect to setting ­­ participating in the market ­­ in the auction?",
  "Because as I understand it, and I don't think you ­­ you've told me any differently, that the people who are auctioning in the market can and do enter into contracts with States on a regular basis.",
  "Exactly.",
  "All right. Voluntary contracts outside the market.",
  "Why is this involuntary? Because of the State ­­",
  "All right. So is that what conflicts? I'm ­­ I'm trying to articulate the preemption rule in some simplified way. I'm a little bit like Justice Breyer on this. I'm not quite sure how everything is working, but I don't think it can be field preemption, because you have to explain what field we're talking about and what rule we're setting in the future. I think it's conflict preemption.",
  "So give me a simple ­­ sir, when I write this opinion ­­",
  "­­ give me ­­ give me the first paragraph. This conflicts with what?",
  "So that's the conflict?",
  "That's ­­ that's because ­­ you're articulating it as ­­ and correct me if I'm wrong ­­ that the conflict is in affecting the bid price in any way. Requiring it, affecting it, or ­­",
  "­­ determining it.",
  "But for ­­ that ­­ that answers the earlier question: No, they can't give money to build a generator because that changes the incentives. The generator's cost by definition change if it's receiving subsidies for free.",
  "I'm sorry. Intentionality, in my mind, is misperceived, because you think ­­ you're talking about intentionality as the act of causing the injury. But I understood common­law battery to be the intentional act that causes the injury; i.e., if a husband threw a bottle at a wife, doesn't intend to hit her, but the bottle smashes against the wall and the glass embeds itself in her face, under the common law that would have been a battery because the act, the intentional act, was to throw the bottle. It wasn't ­­ it wasn't to cause the injury, but the act caused the injury.",
  "I know. If we end up disagreeing because the government points to many examples where this is the case, how do you win?",
  "But ­­ but the point is that the contact was in ­­ was ­­ some contact had to have occurred.",
  "The question is whether there was an act that caused that contact regardless of whether it was intentional or reckless.",
  "Well, we were talking about common­law battery as it applied to ­­ definition as it applied in a domestic setting. So I'm talking only about a domestic setting ­­",
  "­­ which this is.",
  "Don't you have to look at this in the domestic violence context? Because the definition, \"use of force\" as put in terms of a misdemeanor under Federal or State triable law, means ­­ so it means a domestic violence. And isn't it prototypical in many of these domestic violence cases where much of the violence employed is not direct violence, not hitting some ­­ there's a lot of that, but there's an awful lot of the examples I raised of reckless conduct that leads to violence, either from drunkenness or from other conditions. You're using \"use of force\" as it's being defined in other areas. Why does it fit into this domestic violence case?",
  "That's the offensive touching prong. That has nothing ­­",
  "That was the offensive touching prong. I'm talking about, here, the use of physical force prong ­­",
  "­­ that causes injury in some way.",
  "Can you please go back to the question Justice Kagan asked you and not using the shaking somebody, because I don't understand how shaking someone doesn't constitute the use of physical force. It may not be great force, but it's ­­ it's touching. What other example do you have of a reckless act that wouldn't involve the use of physical force? You're ­­ you're sort of saying ­­",
  "­­ it has to be intentionally offensive.",
  "­­ as opposed to ­­",
  "It always involves, however, the touching.",
  "And the use of force to constitute the touching.",
  "So what difference does it make whether it's intentional or reckless ­­",
  "­­ in terms of the culpability involved?",
  "But the ­­",
  "­­ use of force ­­ and ­­ and we're giving examples that are not domestic violence examples, but that has caused a sufficiently offensive touching to constitute a crime. So that's going to be prosecuted.",
  "Counsel, am I correct that Mr. Draper, his accomplice, did not come forward until later? So he didn't know that the accomplice would say that there was a different story to tell at all, correct?",
  "And he did not know that the sexual abuse could form a very potent defense to a death penalty because there was independent proof of it.",
  "The prosecutor, in fact, told the trial judge that there wasn't any independent evidence of sexual abuse by this man of other people, correct?",
  "And in fact, the records show there was.",
  "What do you think of our jurisprudence that says you can't be judge ­­ you can't be prosecutor and judge. And so I'm ­­ I'm ­­ what does it mean to be a prosecutor, if you're not taking responsibility personally, as he claimed during the election, for the decision to execute someone, whether by policy or by individual review? And there was clearly individual review here. At ­­ at what point do we give meaning to the constitutional command that you can't be prosecutor and judge? I know there's so many different kinds of recusals. This is the ideal case for someone to make a due process claim, because the judge here actually signed his name to his review of the facts and his decision to seek the death penalty. What ­­ as I'm looking at most of the ethical codes, most of the ethical codes would have said you get off if you made this decision.",
  "Why?",
  "Do ­­ do you think that the public would find it unusual that someone who makes a decision as to whether to seek death penalty or not, that the public wouldn't perceive that as a great probability ­­",
  "­­ of actual bias? Now, I don't want to talk about ­­ I don't, for the moment, the history that there is some cases he disagreed with. But don't you think, as a reasonable probability, that that appearance of impropriety is just present?",

  "In what did he concur?",
  "Did all 2000 murders ­­",
  "Did all 2000 cases get the death penalty treatment?",
  "Were there cases where he said no to some death penalties?",
  "Were there policies he's established to establish when death penalty was appropriate?",
  "Ah, that's an interesting use of words.",
  "Somehow, someone had to make a decision of where to cut the line.",
  "I presume they looked at mitigators, too.",
  "Well, the memo required them to talk about some mitigating ­­",
  "Well, this memo ­­",
  "But in the other cases in which that was the case, no one knew that he was actually signing off on a review of the cases.",
  "I'm a little confused by this, and this line of argument. What is Pennsylvania? Each individual judge decides whether to recuse, correct?",
  "All right. That's really wonderful. And how about if they got it wrong?",
  "Meaning ­­ it doesn't mean that if a whole court looks at something, it's got it right.",
  "If there's an ethical standard that says the judge who's been involved in a case shouldn't be there, then they got it wrong on their own rules. If ­­ if there's a constitutional standard, it doesn't mean they were right, either. They got it wrong if they let him sit.",
  "But they have to do it no matter what, meaning if ­­ if the State is telling them look at this, and recuse someone if it's appropriate to do so, then the State has imposed that obligation on them.",
  "Nothing about a decision in this case would require that. That's ­­",
  "That's a feature unique to Pennsylvania. In many other States, including this Court, it goes up to the individual judge.",
  "I'm totally confused because I think ­­ I was following you up until that last statement.",
  "All right? I was following you up to when you said that it has to be a debt you obtain by fraud from the person.",
  "Whether I agree with you or not, that's a different issue because I'm not sure that you fully answered Justice Breyer. But I don't understand where the inducement comes into this. Why ­­ why did ­­ you can commit fraud against a person directly in a variety of different ways that don't require a misrepresentation. And we know that actual fraud doesn't, as a matter of fact, require a misrepresentation.",
  "That leaves out every conspiracy theory that exists. I mean, if you're helping someone by accepting the money, you're committing a crime.",

  "That one creditor has ­­",
  "­­ the expense, et cetera.",
  "Are you limiting actual frauds to just fraudulent conveyances? Are there other deceptive schemes that you would include?",
  "I'm curious. You responded to Justice Ginsburg that he did violate State law. Could the United States have asked for an extradition based on the State law violation? Is this a permanent hole or did they just pick the wrong law to seek extradition under?",
  "No, no, no. I'm saying, they asked him to be ­­",
  "­­ returned from ­­ where had he fled to? Philippines.",
  "Under the SORNA violation ­­",
  "­­ could they have asked for him to be returned under the State law violation?",
  "So is that a yes?",
  "So really what we're talking about is that they asked for the extradition under the wrong law.",
  "I find interesting the new legislation. As I see it, it's getting away from where you reside or anything else. It just says if you're going to travel to a foreign place, you have to tell the United States, correct?",
  "Is there anything in that ­­ in that law that requires the U.S. to tell the State the person's left ­­ that they've left?",
  "I didn't ­­ I didn't have a complete chance to go through it.",
  "So the problem at issue here has been completely resolved by new legislation?",
  "What's the page, please?",
  "What's so interesting is that regulation tells the States to do this.",
  "It doesn't tell the sex offender that he's obligated to do it. It says the States must do it.",
  "I'm ­­ it's a little bit odd.",
  "So now a sex offender is supposed to understand what \"involved\" means and read a directive to jurisdictions in your regulation and say, ah, that includes me, too.",
  "Jurisdiction is supposed to do this, but now I've got to do something more.",
  "What makes it a State as opposed to a Federal crime? That's really what's at issue here.",
  "I understand it's a crime.",
  "The question is which kind of crime.",
  "Can I walk through the burden a moment? There's two types of early abortion at ­­ at play here. The medical abortion, that doesn't involve any hospital procedure. A doctor prescribes two pills, and the women take the pills at home, correct?",
  "I'm sorry. What? She has to come back two separate days to take them?",
  "All right. So now, from when she could take it at home, it's ­­ now she has to travel 200 miles or pay for a hotel to get those two days of treatment?",
  "All right. Let me ask you something about that two­day wait, okay, or ­­ or that travel time. How many other States and how many other recognized medical people have testified or shown that there is any benefit from taking pills at the facility as opposed to taking the pills at home, as was the case?",
  "If the Chief may permit me to finish my two­part question?",
  "The second is the D&C, the dilation and ­­ what's it called? Dilation and ­­",
  "­­ curettage. What is the risk factor for a D&C related to abortion and a non­abortion D&C? D&Cs are performed in offices for lots of other conditions besides abortion. Is there any evidence in the record that shows that there is any medical difference in the two ­­ in the ­­ in the procedures that would necessitate an abortion being in an ACS or not, or are abortions more risky than the regular D&C?",
  "So your point, I'm taking, is that the two main health reasons show that this law was targeted at abortion only?",
  "Is there any other ­­",
  "I'm sorry. Is there any other medical condition by taking the pills that are required to be done in hospital, not as a prelude to a procedure in hospital, but an independent, you know ­­ I know there are cancer treatments by pills now. How many of those are required to be done in front of a doctor?",
  "It includes ­­",
  "When there's a need. Meaning, where are you taking an account in the undue­burden analysis the value of the need being ­­ of being imposed? Meaning, even if I grant you that in some circumstances travel time is necessary because you just can't get any kind of abortion clinic to go into a particular area, so you might have to impose a burden that might be undue in other circumstances. Where do we evaluate the benefit of this burden? What ­­ what's the need? You ­­ you seem ­­ your brief seemed to be telling us that there's no role for the Court to judge whether there's really a health benefit to what you're doing.",
  "I'm not talking about the doctrine. I'm talking about the question I asked, which is, according to you, the slightest health improvement is enough to impose on hundreds of thousands of women ­­ even assuming I accept your argument, which I don't, necessarily, because it's being challenged ­­ but the slightest benefit is enough to burden the lives of a million women. That's your point?",
  "That's interesting.",
  "Well, wait a minute ­­",
  "Well, do you think ­­ would you put ­­",
  "By hospitals? Underreported ­­ most of the complications you're talking about were reported at hospitals, correct? Yes, there is some evidence of not reporting other things outside the hospital, but you know the number of ­­ hospitals are accurately reporting.",
  "Complications within their clinic?",
  "What's the percentage of 210 from 70,000? My math is pretty horrible. It's pretty small.",
  "I don't mean to ­­ to negate that one should try to avoid injury to anyone, and ­­ and don't take my question as that, but there are people who die from complications from aspirin. May be unusual, but there's a certain percentage that do that. Yet, we don't require that people take aspirins in ASC centers or in hospitals.",
  "There has to be some tie between the benefit and the burden, doesn't there?",
  "Well, don't you think that you can read that from the fact that there are so many other medical treatments whose complication rates are so disproportionately higher, and the legislature is only targeting abortion when there is nothing about the figures before it that show a risk so unusual that it needs greater attention?",
  "Can I ask: Were they opened as a result of the law, or were they planned to be opened before the law went into effect? Because I think that makes a difference to me if they were planned to be opened. It takes quite a while to dig up the money, get the investors, buy the land, do the building. It seems to me that they must have been planned for a while. And if they were, it was because there was a need independent of the number of abortions.",
  "In other words, it's fortuitous that they've come into existence, but it was in ­­ their need was not there ­­ was independent of the reduced number of facilities elsewhere.",
  "But most of them don't choose to provide abortions.",
  "So what you don't know is what ­­ do you have enough resources to open up an ASC if you're going to do abortions? Are you going to get enough developers to ­­ to invest in your work?",
  "Can I ask about McAllen? There was testimony in the record that at least four doctors had ­­ from that spot had asked for admitting privileges. Well, the Fifth Circuit's remedy only provided for one doctor, Dr. Lynn, who's past retirement age, to be the only doctor performing abortions in that clinic. Now, if the clinic had ­­ I don't know how many it had, but it had at least four people before ­­ it seems rather callous to say as a remedy that we're going to make that one doctor do the work of four, or maybe more doctors who didn't get admitting privileges. Why is even the Fifth Circuit's remedy reasonable?",
  "But that ­­ but ­­ if ­­ yes. As applied, the A ­­ ASC law is affecting this clinic because it can't get its doctors certified. So why does it require a named plaintiff to relieve that clinic of the obligation of going without admitting privileges?",
  "But you just lift the requirement because you know that it's the only clinic in the area.",
  "So if any doctor who's licensed appropriately can get admitting privileges, they should be permitted to work in that clinic. Why does Dr. Lynn have to become an indentured slave to ensure that women in her area are provided with their fundamental right to choose?",
  "But she wants to leave ­­",
  "All right. Counsel ­­",
  "But, I'm sorry ­­",
  "It's valid only if it's taking care of a real problem.",
  "Well, no, no, no. A real problem, meaning, Gosnell, the governor of Pennsylvania, said was a regulatory failure. And only in that, not ­­ this clinic had not been inspected for 15 years. He ­­ the doctor was fabricating his reports. That could happen almost in any setting. Anyone who intends to break the law is going to break the law, whatever the regulatory rules are. You're going to have doctors, as happened pre our laws, who were performing abortions without permission in their offices or without licenses. And I don't want to suggest that we should presume that's going to happen, but it will happen.",
  "Well, but ­­ yeah, but ­­ but you have to see, as Justice Breyer asked you earlier, why are the problems? Isn't this a self­created problem? What happened in Texas independent of Gosnell that raised the Gosnell­like situation in Texas that made ­­",
  "­­ the legislature so concerned after so many years about taking care of this greater risk in abortions, as opposed to all the other procedures that are performed in non­ASC facilities?",
  "But there's complications in colonoscopies, and colonoscopies are, what, 15 times ­­",
  "28. Justice Breyer just corrected me.",
  "28 percent higher. I mean ­­",
  "Why isn't that self­evident in any area that's ­­",
  "This area of western Texas, it's as big as California. No? Bigger?",
  "Huge area.",
  "Why isn't it self­evident if you have a law that says you can only be an ACS provider, and who's going to come in and say, I can't be an ACS provider, but it's an undue burden on me, or it's an undue burden that's self­evident on the women in that area?",
  "Exactly. So why don't we take this lawsuit as those women saying just that?",
  "You can't have a law that has marginal, if any, medical benefit be applied to this procedure anywhere where there's an undue burden on people ­­ on women.",
  "Can you tell me why Planned Parenthood left the western area? The General says that Planned Parenthood ­­ that ASC and the ­­ and the admitting privileges had nothing to do with the closures in the western area of Texas.",
  "But it ­­ but it made District 3 more compact.",
  "Well, this district was never compact to start with.",
  "I mean, it's ­­ it's contiguous only by water, not by land.",
  "And it runs a very unusual route.",
  "The new plan ­­",
  "­­ splits less districts. It ­­ all of these plans have their flaws, but the new one at least splits less districts, and it is more compact under traditional criteria.",
  "Would you spend a few minutes on whether this case is moot or not? As I understand it, the vast majority of the districts of the representatives who are parties to this action have not been changed in any meaningful way. Forbes is the only one who had a ­­ who had, perhaps, a live claim, but he's decided to run in another district. So how do we have a live claim or controversy?",
  "But he has decided not to run.",
  "Is he going to go back and run in the old district?",
  "Are you representing that if the map goes back to the enacted form, not the new one, that he will run in his old district?",
  "So we announce a rule ­­ so we announce a rule ­­",
  "We announce a rule that every change that affects an incumbent gives the incumbent the right to challenge the line of change.",
  "Just answer the question yes. Every ­­ this is now an incumbency protection standing rule.",
  "Every time your district is changed and you believe it hurts you, you have a right to go to court and say what?",
  "But ­­ but I ­­ but that's the rule. Do you have a right to claim? It's one thing to say I'm a voter and I've been racially discriminated against. What is the incumbent claiming? It's not racial discrimination against.",
  "Let's not forget that there was ­­ counsel, I'm over here ­­ you're skipping over it. And I'll bet the map might have been slightly different. It still was going to be different ­­",
  "­­ if you had not used race.",
  "That's the whole purpose of the exercise, correct?",
  "If you're race neutral, you move people not on the basis of their skin color, but on some ­­ some neutral principle. And you have shown that in at least five precincts were moved where it wasn't on the base of partisanship, it was on the basis of race.",
  "Can I ask you a question? And that is ­­ meaning ­­ the only claims that are exempted under the Act are Bivens claims, which are constitutional violations. Why is it that an employee who has committed a constitutional violation is now immune from suit merely because the plaintiff's lawyer made a mistake and didn't file a Bivens claim first?",
  "I don't blame you for that, but you didn't litigate multiple times here. The exemption applied immediately, and the case was over.",
  "The Bivens claim was brought shortly thereafter. They were both simultaneously pending before the court.",
  "So if the court had elected to address the Bivens claim first, the bar would have been avoided.",
  "That still doesn't answer my point, which is, if the district court had chosen to answer the Bivens claim first, there would be no bar in place.",
  "That just means that we're ­­ we're giving district courts the option to foreclose or close the courtroom door, because the work is too hard to get to?",
  "Could you point out where, in that case, we explicitly addressed that language and rejected it?",
  "Let me just ­­",
  "I'm sorry. How does any of this save you from an individual suit? Meaning under any reading you give this provision, an individual who chooses not to go under 1346 and simply sue the individuals involved could do that ­­",
  "­­ either under a Bivens claim or under the Administrative Act, et cetera.",
  "What you're saying is, you have the opportunity, as the United States, to step in if you choose. Is that it?",
  "Putting that aside, how does your reading save you from all of this definitional discussion we've had for the last five minutes? It's still going to happen, or can happen. Why does the reading being proposed by the other side create a difficulty?",
  "Is there any compact with those other Territories that precludes them from using their Territorial power to reorganize their debts?",
  "I know that Guam and the Virgin Islands have Federal courts.",
  "And they have Federal judges. Are they subject to constitutional provisions? Is it an open question of whether they are subject to the Contract Clause as well? To the contract provision limitation, I should say?",
  "Well, that's the open issue that ­­",
  "­­ has to go on remand.",
  "Mr. Landau, I'm not sure I understand that argument, so you're going to have to back up a minute.",
  "It's, I think, critical to your point, which is, Justice Kagan asked a direct question: Why couldn't Congress have said much more directly, under 101, the term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico except for Chapter 9?",
  "If Puerto Rico is not a State for Chapter 9, then it couldn't have authorized its municipality to file under 109. It would have reached the same end, but more clearly saying that Puerto Rico is not a State.",
  "But in all those provisions, debtor, creditor, State play active roles in implementing the provisions of those chapters.",
  "So in all the other 40 places, the State is involved ­­",
  "­­ by ­­ inherent in the definition of what a debtor and what a creditoror is, the State has rights and responsibilities under those provisions.",
  "What you ­­ what I'm understanding you to say is, Puerto Rico has been kicked out of Chapter 9 altogether. It doesn't even get into the gateway.",
  "And so to read it as being involved as a State, the only other place that's used is here.",
  "In 903, you have to be part of it in some way.",
  "Mr. Landau, this is not very different from what we did in ­­ last year in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. the EPA. We had one general definition of a statutory term, and then we looked at it and its play within other sections, and we said can't be given the same meaning, because the definition applies to one generalized feature of the Act, and the use here is in a more specialized way.",
  "But you didn't cite Utility Air. Is there a reason you didn't?",
  "Why not treat it like ­­ why not treat it like every other Territory?",
  "That's the mouse in ­­ that's the mouse in ­­ in the hole ­­",
  "­­ which is if you're going to treat it differently, wouldn't you expect them to say that? We're going to treat it not like a State and not like a Territory.",
  "Have you given up the Government Development Bank's position and that of some of the amici that the provision of 903(1) applies to States only when a debtor is in a Chapter 9 proceeding because of that provision use of creditor?",
  "Are you rejecting the argument?",
  "Well, no State has possessed the power to impair contract rights under the Constitution. Nothing about the Bankruptcy Code changes the application of the Contract Clause. They have to go into Chapter 9 to impair contracts ­­",
  "­­ in a meaningful way, correct?",
  "All right. So what makes you think that Congress intended to let Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia have free reign in whatever they wanted to do? Wouldn't they be subject, in your judgment ­­ I'm sure you'd be arguing they're subject to the Contract ­­ Impairment Clause.",
  "Exactly.",
  "So you think Congress intended to stop Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia from passing emergency legislation that said don't shut off the lights tonight; that ­­ that Congress intended that that kind of temporary provision could only be subject to Congress, who may be on recess, who might be wherever it is, that it could not do that?",
  "Well, it decided to overrule it by giving States the opportunity to go into bankruptcy, and that would be a temporary state to start with.",
  "And it never gave ­­",
  "And it never gave the Territories that. So the Territories can pass a law that stops the lights from going out today until Congress comes into effect, 'cause it can't do a permanent impairment of the contract.",
  "Doesn't the definitional section of the Code tell you who qualifies as a debtor, who qualifies as a creditor, who can go into what chapter or not? It tells you if you're this kind of creditor, you go into that chapter. If you're that kind of creditor, you go ­­ I'm sorry. If you're this kind of debtor, you go to ­­ individual goes here, business goes there, this one goes here. You have options. Isn't it what he describes as a gateway that tells you where you're a part or what you're a part of?",
  "Oh, but it is, because it tells you what kind of debtors can make use of what kind of provision.",
  "It is always. That's what the purpose of a gateway is.",
  "So if the ­­ if the definitional section defines \"State\" to include Puerto Rico, and you say even though it's not a part of Chapter 9 by definition in 109, it still remains a State for purposes of this reservation of State powers? Why aren't we using \"creditor\" in 903 as it's used in the Bankruptcy Code?",
  "If you're going to be literal as to \"State,\" why aren't you literal as to \"creditor\"?",
  "But let's go back. If you're going to take the literal meaning of \"State\" definitionally, why aren't you taking the literal meaning of \"creditor\"?",
  "So how do I read into the statute?",
  "Well, you actually can't do that, meaning you can't do that according to our prior precedent. It is inherent in State sovereignty that States have to have some method, their own method, of controlling their municipalities. You can have uniform bankruptcy laws, but if you don't make them available to a municipality because the State hasn't approved it, can you rob a State under State sovereignty of all power to regulate its municipality and to save it from ­­ from bankruptcy?",
  "Actually, so why do so many major commentators, bankruptcy writers, district and circuit courts, the Sixth Circuit included, have said that that's impossible; that you can't rob a State of the power to regulate its municipalities if you're offering it nothing in return?",
  "And then we said in Faitoute that you can't force States ­­",
  "­­ to go into bankruptcy.",
  "So you believe that the States that don't permit their municipality to become debtors are limited in what they can do by 903? In other words, their ­­ their municipalities are not debtors? Their sovereign powers have been cut off? They cannot reorganize the debt except through Chapter 9? Then we're talking about a coercive provision. We're saying you can't do anything about the composition of your debt. If 98 percent of the creditors want to reorganize their debt with you and those 2 percent vultures are saying no, and a Court would say it's not an impairment of a contract to redo this debt because of the need, everything else that we've said in the past, you're saying States can't do it if ­­ if ­­ they can only do it under Chapter 9?",
  "Assume ­­ I assume it doesn't. Assuming. You're saying 903 intended to preclude States, solvent States and solvent municipalities, it ­­ it intended to stop States from doing any reorganization of any debt, even if it doesn't impair the contract clause, it can't do it until every creditor approves, whether or not their municipality is in Chapter 9 or not?",
  "All right. And what's not coercive about that? What's the choice for States that Congress is giving?",
  "It's like the Tenth Amendment right of States to deal with their municipalities consistent with the Constitution. Where does that leave ­­ you can make uniform­bankruptcy laws, but nothing about that permits you to impair the rights of States so drastically?",
  "Could you explain to me the analogy with military objectors during the war? Many of them felt that ­­ genuine belief; they were pacifists ­­ that if they registered as pacifists, that that would mean other people would have to serve in their lieu. They were going to jail, and many of them did go to jail, because of this belief. Why is going to jail less burdensome or less important than paying a financial penalty?",
  "Let's stop there.",
  "To the extent that a conscientious objector's good faith belief is that if I register, someone will serve in my lieu, what burden is it on the government? Meaning, if ­­ if you're looking at it in terms of strict scrutiny, the government sends out how many notices to people to come and serve? Ten ­­ you know, 1,000, 1,200. Do you really think it makes a difference if it knows whether or not one person is not going to show up? And if we're going down that road of what's the difference, why would that law survive?",
  "Well, then, isn't that the same thing here? If you don't know who can pay, or who ­­ who's not eligible, or who's eligible to pay, how does this system work?",
  "The churches have to tell us that their church plans ­­ have to tell the government their church plans. Somebody has to tell the government who's eligible or not eligible.",
  "How is that different from military service?",
  "Well, but the client, then ­­",
  "What I don't understand, Mr. Clement, is when will any government law that someone claims burdens their practice ever be insubstantial? Because every believer that's ever come before us, including the people in the military, are saying that my soul will be damned in some way. I'm not naysaying that that is a very substantial perceived personal burden by them. But if that's always going to be substantial, how will we ever have a government that functions? How will we ever have anything that the government can demand people to do in objecting ­­",
  "­­ that won't be a problem?",
  "Well, it's the side of the debate that settles, which is if we are not asking you to do anything except identify yourself, and if who is going to do the action is either the government or a third party, that that's the balance that we have struck, that it's not a substantial burden if someone else is going to do the act that you're objecting to.",
  "Well, we could also just ­­ why don't we assume that if they are part of the ­­ if the majority are part of the religion, that they are not going to buy contraceptives? That's their religious tenet. And so why are we worried about this case at all?",
  "We are worried because there are some women who don't adhere to that particular religious tenant, and who have ­­ we perceive the government has determined, have a real need for contraceptives.",
  "What is the utter absence? there is plenty of evidence that was relied upon to show that when contraceptives are provided to women in a seamless way, that the number of unintended pregnancies dramatically falls, as does the number of abortions. And so that health risk to women who want contraceptives who can't get it is proven, scientifically and otherwise.",
  "But you know that we exempt certain employers of certain size from Title VII, and it's not because we don't believe that racial discrimination is a bad thing, and it's not that we're not committed to eradicating that problem, but because at a certain point, we have assumed as a society, or as a government, that you can't do everything. So you can't take care of the health needs of a hundred percent of women, but you can of a significant number. Why is that a judgment that is not entitled to some respect?",
  "So your answer to Justice Kagan is wrong. Basically you're saying, even if all you do is an opt­out, I raise my hand, I tell you that I'm a religious objector, and they somehow, from this suit, they know who your third­party administrator is, they have a general law that requires now all ERISA plans and insurance companies to tell them who their clients are; that if your insurer is involved in any way, you object?",
  "General, can we go back to the substantial burden question? And I think that Justice Breyer has been talking about how to draw this line. When is it that government has to act to accommodate, and when doesn't it have to act to accommodate? There is some amici that have suggested a line that at least to me helps draw some clarity to the cases, our cases, which is, if what your religious belief is asking the government to do is to change its behavior with respect ­­ its regulatory behavior with respect to others, then it can't be a substantial burden, because we live in a pluralistic society in which government has to function. And hence, you're a military objector. You can't tell the government, no, you can't draft someone else. You have to ­­ you can't spend your money on war. We don't have to use you to promote the war. But if you want to use others to promote the war, you're entitled to do that as government. Does this line make any sense to you?",
  "Because here, what the religious groups I understand are asking is the government not to use its regulatory power with third parties who don't have a religious objection, and forcing a burden on the women who its trying to help, third parties that don't have the same religious objection, and burdening them to do other things.",
  "They're not on the Exchanges.",
  "That's a falsehood. The Exchanges require full­service health insurance policies with minimum coverages that are set forth that are very comprehensive.",
  "We're creating a new program.",
  "General, the ­­ we've used ­­ the hijack analogy has been mentioned. Can you explain why you don't see this as a hijacking?",
  "Mr. Francisco, I think, earlier said if Aetna offers a separate policy giving insurance, that he thought that that would be an adequate ­­ an adequate accommodation.",
  "No, no. I meant ­­ I meant: He says, generally, if Aetna, under some other policy, offers it on the Exchange to women who might want to go on the Exchange and buy that policy, that's okay if they ­­ if that's the ­­ what they do. What's different from that from what happens here? It's basically the same thing, isn't it?",
  "Well, it is two policies instead of one because the contraceptives are being provided by government regulation. The only seamlessness is that I think the woman doesn't have to apply and pay separately or something else.",
  "Would it have been better to say, churches, you've got to tell us you're going to claim an exemption, because not every church is religious, has the same religious tenets. So is that what you would have preferred? Is that the ­­ the sort of incentive you want to put out there? Is that the message you're giving, which is, there is lots of rules that apply differently to churches because we recognize they are special? Others may be special like them, but it's clear to tell what a church is."
