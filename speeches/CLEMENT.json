[
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Qualified immunity has an important role to play in Fourth Amendment unreasonable force cases just as it does in Fourth Amendment unreasonable search cases and in other constitutional contexts. The decision below effectively merged the qualified immunity and Fourth Amendment tests in the case of unreasonable force cases. The court reasoned that because both tests are framed in terms of objective reasonableness, the qualified immunity test had nothing to add to the underlying Fourth Amendment test. This Court rejected a virtually indistinguishable line of reasoning in Anderson against Creighton and with good reason. The Fourth Amendment and qualified immunity tests are distinct and serve different purposes. The Fourth Amendment test governs primary conduct. It looks at the force used and asks whether that force was reasonable. The qualified immunity test by contrast looks at the preexisting law and asks whether that preexisting law would have put a reasonable officer on notice that his or her conduct was unlawful. Qualified immunity thus recognizes that even competent officers will make reasonable mistakes and government officials should not be held personally liable when they make reasonable judgment calls just because their judgment turns out to be mistaken.",
  "Well in many cases, once the case is -- the issue of qualified immunity is brought before the judge, the judge can rule on whether there's a qualified immunity protection in the case and there'll be no issue that needs to go to the jury in that case.",
  "It would depend on the circumstances of the case. In some cases, the judge may want to try to isolate the factual issues that are at stake in the qualified immunity context and just have the jury focusing on those factual situations.",
  "Well that may actually end up being the only issue that jury really needs to focus on. If I could give you an example, in a recent Tenth Circuit case called Cruz against City of Laramie, the Tenth Circuit decided that the use of a hog-tie restraint was unreasonable when used with an individual who exhibited signs of diminished capacity. In that same opinion, they reserved the question about whether that restraint was unreasonable when used on an individual who did not exhibit signs of diminished capacity.",
  "In many cases, I think the jury will not really, if there's no liability -- I'm sorry, if there's no issue about injunctive relief, it may just be a situation where the court can simply decide what the clearly-established law is and instruct the jury on that clearly-established law and then the jury can make its determination. To pick up the example from the Tenth Circuit case, if in a subsequent decision, the Tenth Circuit extended its rule and applied the rule to all individuals, saying the hog-tie restraint is never reasonable, I think because the court had previously expressly reserved the question of whether the hog-tie restraint was reasonable when applied to an individual who did not exhibit signs of diminished capacity. In that case, the issue for the jury would be whether or not the individual who was arrested exhibited signs of diminished capacity and that would really be the only issue the jury needed to decide because if the individual had exhibited signs of diminished capacity, under the court's prior decision in Cruz, that -- that conduct would be not only unlawful but clearly established. On the other hand, if the jury decided that the individual had not exhibited signs of diminished capacity, then in that instance, although the conduct was unlawful, by virtue of this hypothetical second decision, the conduct would not be clearly established and there'd be no liability in that situation.",
  "I disagree. I think that in Anderson against Creighton itself, this Court noted that there's not a requirement that the previous case law be on all four --",
  "I'm not sure if that's the only case where that's going to be true. I think there other cases where the preexisting law, although not showing the way with pinpoint accuracy, it still provides the officers with sufficiently clear notice that there's no real rule for qualified immunity in those particular cases.",
  "I think the judge in this case would charge by using the language from this Court's previous qualified immunity opinions, language from cases like Malley and Hunter against Bryant and would charge the jury with finding -- in order to find liability in this case, the jury would have to find that the individual officer exhibited -- either was plainly incompetent or exercised judgment that was outside the range of professional judgment. I'm not sure it would really be necessary in a case where the only issue is liability to really direct the court's attention a great deal to the liability standard because that issue's going to effectively drop out of the case. To be sure, the jury may need to be instructed on what the relevant law of excessive force is, but once that instruction is put in place as sort a background instruction then the real question that the jury needs to focus on is the question of whether or not the officer's conduct was so unreasonable that it put it outside the range of professional --",
  "All I meant by that is that since there will be no liability imposed in the ordinary case without a finding that the officer's not entitled to qualified immunity, it'll be the qualified immunity question that will really be the ultimate focus of the jury's attention because that'll determine whether or not they find sufficient cause to award damages.",
  "I don't believe so. No, I'm sorry you're right. If they do find that there's not qualified immunity because the conduct was clearly established. I don't know that they really need to go further because that perforce will already incorporate the underlying Fourth Amendment test.",
  "No, all I'm saying is that in the ordinary case --",
  "I'm sorry. I think -- perhaps my focusing on the cases that go to the jury, we're obscuring the fact that the real virtue of qualified immunity is in many of these cases, even under the plaintiff's versions of events, the conduct will not be so clearly unconstitutional by virtue of higher precedent that the court can just end there. And after all, as this Court emphasized in Harlow against Fitzgerald and subsequent cases, the qualified immunity is not just an immunity from liability, but it protects the officers from the chilling effect of the inconvenience of having to stand trial in those situations where prior decisions have not clearly marked the individual's conduct as being unlawful.",
  "I think both questions certainly could go to the jury. It just seems to me that the second question actually entails the answer to the first. So if the jury's instructed and finds that the officer's conduct was so excessive as to put it outside the range of the conduct of a reasonable officer under the circumstances it would necessarily entail a finding in liability. And because by hypothesis I'm talking about a case where all the individual plaintiff seeks is monetary damages, the court may well have a forum that asks the court -- the jury to find the liability -- I'm sorry, the constitutional issue.",
  "That's right. Nothing will turn on the underlying constitutional issue because it's --",
  "I guess what I'm envisioning is that the jury would first be instructed on what the law is of excessive force based largely on this Court's decision in Graham against Connor. Then at the end of the instructions, the Court would focus in on what it is the jury needs to find in order to find liability and impose liability on the officer.",
  "Sure. I think the instruction, I mean the instruction that the Government typically uses in these cases or typically offers in these cases, is based on this Court's decision in Malley and Hunter against Bryant and it asks the jury whether or not the officer's conduct was such that it was plainly incompetent under the circumstances and the use of force was outside the range of professional and competent judgment. And then the jury -- that's the question that jury ultimately focuses on.",
  "No, that's the qualified immunity question because that's what makes the difference between whether the jury in a specific case imposes damages or doesn't impose damages.",
  "The difference is -- well there's a couple of ways of expressing it, one way to express it is that the Fourth Amendment test looks only at the conduct and asks whether the force used was unreasonable. The qualified immunity test takes a broader look at what the preexisting law was and asks whether the officer was on notice that his or conduct violated clearly-established law. Another way of looking at is that the question in the first case is simply, looking at what the officer did, was what the officer did reasonable?",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's also correct.",
  "No, I mean -- and I think that raises two important points. First of all, this issue of what issue goes to the jury and how does the underlying Fourth Amendment issue interact with the qualified immunity instruction is not unique to the context of excessive force claims. The same issues are raised by the probable cause and exigent circumstances issues --",
  "Nothing.",
  "Nothing went to the jury, which is the second point, which is this would be a particularly poor vehicle --",
  "That's exactly right.",
  "That's exactly right.",
  "Certainly not in our view. I mean, our view you can take every fact in this case in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and the proper analysis should still be that the Petitioner was entitled to qualified immunity. And the Court of Appeals below simply refused to undertake that analysis because they thought the two standards were effectively merged.",
  "With all respect, I --",
  "First of all, an example would be in the Tenth Circuit situation where the court finds in the same case that the hog-tie restraint when applied to someone who's exhibited signs of diminished capacity is unreasonable.",
  "No, the should have known aspect of the test is precisely what qualified immunity adds.",
  "The substantive test is whether or not the use of force under the circumstances was unreasonable. The should have known aspect --",
  "The reasonableness test is taken from the perspective of the reasonable officer and it grants the officer deference and allows for reasonable mistakes of fact. What it doesn't allow for is reasonable mistakes of law. If the officer's in a position where he's confronted with a situation and he makes a factual mistake. He thinks the suspect is resisting arrest, but he's really not. The Graham against Connor standard takes the perspective of the reasonable officer and grants deference to the officer. But in a situation where there's no question. The person wasn't resisting and the court announces a rule that says that, absent that kind of resistance, the use of force in this case is unreasonable. The officer may still be entitled to qualified immunity, if the prior law did not put the individual officer on notice that that use of force under the circumstances, was unreasonable.",
  "That is the relationship, but I would hesitate to add that it's not limited to the jury situation and I think that same difference allows the Court --",
  "And we submit this is an appropriate case to resolve even before the jury that the facts and circumstances of this case, even if they constitute a Fourth Amendment violation, which I think is a reasonable question under the facts of this case, they nonetheless were not so clearly established that the officer was on notice and qualified immunity is appropriate.",
  "I think that's right. I mean there may be situations where the claim is fairly well- decided, but there's some reason why a reasonable officer would be entitled to rely on the prior law. I mean, the example of a case where the court previously expressly reserves the question, even if in a subsequent case, the Government doesn't have a great argument why the court shouldn't extend the rule, I think it would still be appropriate to give the officer qualified immunity under that --",
  "It would depend on the circumstances.",
  "I wish I could give you a clean answer.",
  "In this very case, it's a little hard to apply those principles. If I could back away to the -- in the Tenth Circuit example, if the only issue is whether the individual has exhibited diminished city --",
  "Well in this case, it's a little hard to understand what the Ninth Circuit's reasoning was why there was a violation here.",
  "I think they would be instructed on both, but I think they would ultimately only be asked to decide the ultimate qualified immunity test because there's really --",
  "I think that's right. I think that the instruction on the given law of the Fourth Amendment would be necessary background information for the jury to make its decision, but I'm not sure there would be any real purpose served by having the jury say, yes there was a Fourth Amendment violation. Certainly a judge could ask that question, but where the rubber meets the road in these cases is whether or not there's qualified immunity because that will determine whether the plaintiff has --",
  "I'll get to that right now. I think one way to focus on this case is, if the Court of Appeals had done the proper analysis, how would they have defined the Fourth Amendment violation in this case? It seems to us that one of the things they would have focused on is the failure of these officers to announce their intention to take Mr. Katz out before they actually grabbed him and took him out of the area. Now that kind of speak first or warning requirement, at least in a nondeadly-force context, seems to us to be a new rule or something that's certainly not clearly established on which a reasonable officer would be on notice of. If the Court of Appeals had approached it that way, focused in on that as being the key factor that made the actions of the officers here unreasonable then we could very legitimately ask the question, was that clearly established? And our position would be of course not. But other people could take a different view.",
  "Absolutely. I think the first thing to recognize is the Ninth Circuit took an extreme view, that qualified immunity is never appropriate in excessive force cases. The first and most important thing this Court can do is to disabuse the Ninth Circuit of that notion. Then applying the principles to this case, it could usefully decide whether or not there's qualified immunity in this case. In doing so, it could very well follow the reasoning that I just outlined which is to say what would make this case an example of excessive force, if anything, must be this failure to warn first. Now, the Ninth Circuit -- this Court can either decide that issue if it's liked or just kind of, for purposes of the annunciation of the rule, assume it, but then it could say that principle is not clearly established. If possible, I'd to reserve the remaining to time for follow-up.",
  "I would stop you there. No, I would stop you there. The first question is simply to ask whether on those facts the use of force from the perspective of a reasonable officer was reasonable. Now if the court thinks not --",
  "That's a fine statement of the qualified immunity standard.",
  "What I was focusing on though is that I think if you really want to address the order that the judge should address the issue. First they should address the issue of liability because that's what this Court has said on a number of occasions, including Siegert against Gilley and --",
  "Unless the underlying facts are in dispute.",
  "Yeah, that's right. I'm sorry. Now one thing I want to add though --",
  "Yeah, and all I want to emphasize is I think that misses the Fourth Amendment step that this Court has said has to proceed the qualified immunity test and it's helpful to establish what the qualified immunity violation is because that's helpful in identifying whether or not the officers had fair notice that that Fourth Amendment principle actually applied.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Like to make three points. First for those of you who have reviewed the videotape, the very fact that this Court could disagree with Ninth Circuit about whether there was excessive force used in this case underscores the need for qualified immunity for officers in the field because clearly Graham against Connor did not answer every case and did not provide officers on crystal clear notice of where the lines were in the excessive-force context. The second point I'd like to make is simply that jury instruction issues and the question of what goes to the jury and what the judge should decide, those issues are not unique to the excessive-force context. Those same issues arise under probable cause and exigent circumstance in Anderson against Creighton. And Mr. Boyd's actually correct that some of the Circuits have taken divergent views on that. It may be appropriate for the Court eventually to take up that issue, but as Justice O'Connor has pointed out, this case would be an incredibly poor vehicle to do so since we're here on summary judgment and the Ninth Circuit's denial of summary judgment and the Government's position continues to be that that grant of -- that denial of summary judgment was inappropriate and this Court should reverse that. Finally, I want to clarify that despite what may have been said here it is not accurate to say that the Ninth Circuit, or at least Graham itself, incorporates the test of Anderson against Creighton. Graham itself does allow officers the benefit of the doubt when it comes to reasonable mistakes of fact. It doesn't grant them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to reasonable mistakes of law. And it doesn't incorporate into its reasonableness test the notion of what the preexisting law was and it's a good thing that it doesn't because if that were the case, then the Fourth Amendment law would be frozen in place.",
  "I don't think that's what we're asking, with all due respect Justice Kennedy. I think what we're asking is that the officers be put on fair warning that their conduct is unlawful. Justice Souter in an opinion for the Court in United States against Lanier addressed this issue in the context of 18 U.S.C. 242 and made clear that what's required in that context, and he noted that the same rule applies in qualified immunity, is the officers have fair warning because the principles, the general principles, have been made specific is the term he used, by application through prior cases. The Eleventh Circuit in a case called Lassiter against Alabama A&M expressed the same concept by saying that what you need is the prior case law that's materially similar.",
  "And that's why I want to insist --",
  "Absolutely. Absolutely, because Graham against Connor itself does not build in reasonable mistakes of law or take into account what the preexisting law was.",
  "That's exactly right, because if it were otherwise then the very fact that prior law didn't put an officer on notice and there was unclarity would itself mean that the conduct was lawful and then there'd be no mechanism for the law to provide clarity in the Fourth Amendment context. It's the same idea as to why this Court asked lower courts to deal with the liability -- the constitutional issue first and only the immunity question second. The last point I'd like to make is in response to Justice Ginsburg's question about what the rationale of the Ninth Circuit below was in a subsequent case decided last week.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent Waffle House and Eric Baker agreed to arbitrate rather than litigate disputes between them. That agreement precludes Waffle House and Baker from having an action take place between them in court. But the EEOC was not a party to that agreement. Accordingly, the agreement does not preclude the EEOC's ability to bring a public enforcement action against Waffle House, nor does it limit the remedies available to the EEOC in such an action. Title VII gives the EEOC a public enforcement action that's independent of and, in many respects, superior to the individual employee's cause of action.",
  "We believe the Government would still have a cause of action in that case, though we admit it would be a much more difficult case.",
  "Because in the case of settlement, of course, judicial or arbitral resources have already been expended. There's an agreement of the parties that specifically extinguishes the individual's right --",
  "The -- the damages could go to the individual. I think, to give you an example of the kind of case --",
  "That's right. But let me give you an example of the kind of case we have in mind, and it may help illustrate why the Government thinks it still may have a cause of action in that situation. If you can imagine a case where an employer has retaliated against an employee and -- simply for filing a charge with the EEOC, and then that employee settles that retaliation claim for a nominal amount of money, without any judicial supervision, let's say, it may be that in that kind of case, the EEOC has a legitimate public interest in, nonetheless, bringing an action, getting some additional amount of damages to really take the employer --",
  "Well, in a case like that, I'm sure as a matter of its prosecutorial discretion, the EEOC would not bring that case.",
  "Well, in that case I think they would have cause of action. But again, I want to make clear that we think that's --",
  "-- a much more difficult case.",
  "I don't think that would follow. But again, I want to make clear that's a much more difficult case because there there's been --",
  "Well, let me do -- let me make two responses. One, let me try one more time to defend the general principle, which is simply that Congress in Title VII gave the EEOC a distinct cause of action, and so the extinguishment of the individual employee's cause of action shouldn't automatically extinguish the EEOC's cause of action. But let me hone in on why I think that's so much more of a difficult case because in that case, the individuals settled their claim, so they have no claim to damages in an arbitration proceeding. And so, it might make some sense to say that the EEOC has no claim to damages in a litigation proceeding. What is so anomalous about the decision below and the rule that respondent seeks in this case is that it seeks to limit the EEOC's ability to get victim-specific remedies in court even though those victim-specific remedies are available to the employee in the arbitration. All of the cases that respondent cites --",
  "And I guess I do think there are two reasons why they would still have a cause of action in that situation. One is that Title VII does give the EEOC an independent cause of action. It's quite a remarkable statute in that respect. It's unlike statutes this Court has analyzed in, say, the Newport News Shipbuilder case where it specifically contrasted Title VII as being the rare statute that gives the EEOC a duplicative cause of action to the individual. The second reason, though, is that generally, as a matter of privity, res judicata principles, the reason that you hold one party in --in -- to a judgment that they didn't participate in to the consequences of that is because the party in the first action adequately represented the interests of the party that wasn't present. I --",
  "My understanding is that the EEOC picked this case because this case -- the events here took place in 1994. So, the ADA was still quite new at the time that this -- that this case took place, and I think the EEOC was concerned that employers were not sure of what their obligations under the ADA were. So, they picked this case to litigate to help establish what employers' obligations were under the EEOC --",
  "That's fair enough. But again, Congress has specifically allowed the EEOC to use its modest litigation resources to vindicate the public interest both in pattern and practice cases or cases that seek injunctive relief and victim-specific cases where there's some aspect of the case that helps illustrate an important principle of law.",
  "Well, I had taken the import of the hypothetical as being that the individual had already sued and settled and then, only after that had taken place, that the EEOC decided to initiate a duplicative action. But your question certainly highlights the anomaly of having this predispute arbitration agreement --",
  "That's absolutely right. The statute gives the EEOC the exclusive right to initiate a cause of action for the first 180 days and then, for an extended period, until a right to sue letter issues. And that's why in light of the -- the congressional determination that -- that EEOC had not only a different action, but one that took primacy, that they had the right to initiate the action once they found that there was a determination that the suit would serve the public interest, it seems particularly --",
  "Well, allow -- allow me to make two responses. One is it's clear that under the ADA and Title VII, it's not that the EEOC's filing of a suit simply extinguishes the individual's cause of action entirely. They -- the individual has a absolute right to intervene in the EEOC's action. So, if those actions were 100 percent duplicative, there would be no need to allow the individual to intervene in the suit.",
  "I mean --",
  "I respectfully disagree because, unlike the ADA, the ADA does not make the EEOC suit the exclusive vehicle and extinguish any cause of action or any basis to get into court for the individual. They can still intervene in the EEOC's action.",
  "No, we do not take that position. To the contrary, we think that the arbitration agreement does preclude in this case Mr. Baker from intervening in the EEOC's action. And I think that's quite a persuasive answer to the argument that the other side has made that somehow allowing the EEOC to sue in these circumstances renders the arbitration agreement a dead letter. It doesn't.",
  "Well --",
  "It may be, but I think that is the consequence of the arbitration agreement and the implication of the FAA.",
  "Well, even if you disagree with me on -- on that particular point and you say that the FAA does not prevent Baker from intervening on this action, it's still true that the arbitration agreement is -- has a meaningful benefit to Waffle House because before Waffle House entered that arbitration agreement with Baker, it was subject to a suit in court by either the EEOC or Baker. The agreement with Baker limited Baker to an arbitral forum. But absent a similar agreement with the EEOC, Waffle House has simply no expectation and no basis to keep the EEOC out of court or to limit its remedies in court.",
  "Well, with respect, if Waffle House wants to stay out of court, then it needs to reach an agreement with every party that has a statutory right to get them into court. And as a practical matter, I still think --",
  "Yes, and we think there are good --",
  "And I do not think it is. And it's -- and I think in fact the text of Title VII is quite clear.",
  "That's exactly right, and that's -- that's a well-established principle. I mean, look at -- look at Firefighters Local No. 93 against -- against the City of Cleveland. The Court says it's a fundamental principle that a settlement cannot bind non-parties to the litigation.",
  "I think in all of those cases, the statutory scheme works effectively the same. There are independent causes of action given to the Government entity and to the individual. And this Court held in the Tony and Susan Alamo Foundation case that just because the individual forswears a cause of action or right to sue under the Fair Labor Standards Act, that does not preclude the Secretary of Labor from bringing their own independent action.",
  "I -- I don't think that's necessarily true. It's certainly not going to be true in every case. And Congress specifically made all forms of relief available to the EEOC in its public enforcement action. The court below drew a distinction between equitable relief on the one hand and victim-specific relief on the other hand to avoid a perceived conflict with the FAA. But with respect, I don't think there is any conflict.",
  "That is true, but I don't think that is particularly anomalous or limited to this area of law. Take, for example -- I mean, this Court has held that an individual can agree to arbitrate his or her civil RICO claim. I wouldn't think, though, that that agreement to arbitrate the civil RICO claim would in any way prevent the Government from bringing a criminal RICO action or prevent the Government from getting a restitution order that agreed to give restitution directly to the victim.",
  "No. Let's -- let's take this -- let's make it parallel to this case where the individual --",
  "Well, actually they could get the order, and then there are specific provisions in the Federal restitution statute that allow a set-off for amounts that have already been paid or that will be paid.",
  "But I don't think it --",
  "Again, we don't think the agreement is binding, but let me give you three reasons --",
  "Let me give you three reasons why I think it's a harder case.",
  "Okay. Let me give you three reasons why I think the settlement case is more difficult. First, there's already been some expenditure of resources in that case, either -- likely, either judicial or arbitral. Second, Title VII seems to place particular importance on the EEOC's ability to be able to initiate the action and consider the early stages of litigation. If, for whatever reason, we've gotten to the point where somebody has filed a claim and it's settled, that role has already been filled. The third reason is another particularly important function of the EEOC under Title VII is to act as a safety valve, so if for some reason the individual is not willing or able to sue, maybe out of a fear of retaliation or something, in a particular case that vindicates the public interest, the EEOC has the ability to step in and fill that gap. If there's already been a settlement --",
  "Well, I actually think there is a reason to treat that one agreement different, which is the agreement to settle a case extinguishes any claim to relief. An arbitration agreement does not. It's simply a forum selection provision. And the anomaly of the Fourth Circuit's ruling is they take an agreement that limits Baker's access to a judicial forum, but does not limit his remedies and somehow transmogrify it into a rule that limits the EEOC's available remedies but not their access to a judicial forum.",
  "Again, we have no -- absolutely no objection to having the agreement bind the parties to the agreement.",
  "Actually the EEOC is of the opinion that the -- that the individual could bring an arbitration action at that point. That is a consequence, though, of the view that they cannot intervene in the EEOC's enforcement action. I think -- I think they --",
  "-- they have to have one action or the other.",
  "That's equally, of course -- I mean, I -- I agree that there is that problem. That is equally a problem with the Fourth Circuit's rule, of course, because they said that the EEOC could be in court seeking general injunctive relief while the individual is arbitrating his claim for victim-specific relief.",
  "But -- but I think --",
  "And -- and --",
  "Well, and -- and I think that -- I mean, that may be a product of -- that happens when you have an arbitration agreement that limits some parties but not others. That seems to be the case in -- in Moses Cone.",
  "Well, fair enough. But in this case, the Government did bring suit first. Baker has never arbitrated. So, that position would lead you to the conclusion that the Fourth Circuit was wrong, that the EEOC can pursue this case, seek victim-specific relief and general injunctive relief, and that it's up to you to determine whether or not Baker gets to intervene in that action. But that is -- that is certainly a result that the Government is quite happy with. It seems to me what's really sort of indefensible about the Fourth Circuit's reasoning is they take this forum selection provision and turn it into a restriction on remedies. The -- the ADA and Title VII have concurrent jurisdiction. Suppose that an employer and an employee agreed to litigate their case in State court, not Federal court. It wouldn't seem to me that that forum selection clause would bar the EEOC and bind the EEOC and limit them from bringing their public enforcement action in Federal court. It certainly wouldn't seem to me that that agreement to litigate in State court would somehow prevent the EEOC from getting victim-specific damages in Federal court if in fact there was no State court action. But -- but in principle, there's no difference between the arbitration agreement and that forum selection clause agreement that picks the State court.",
  "Well, in fairness, I don't think that the FAA embodies a self-executing preference for arbitration. The --",
  "Well, that's true. But I think the purpose of the FAA, as I understand it, was to put arbitration contracts on an equal footing with other contracts, not to give them some special private place. And we think that that forum selection clause that picked the State forum would be enforceable between the parties, but we just don't think it makes any sense to say that that agreement between the parties somehow leaps out and bars the EEOC from bringing a Federal enforcement action, or even more puzzlingly I think, restricting the remedies available to the EEOC in that public enforcement action. It seems to me that at -- at bottom Title VII gives the EEOC a right to bring a public enforcement action.",
  "With fairness, I think that's a position that Congress rejected in Title VII itself. If Congress wanted to say that the only time that the EEOC vindicates the public interest is when it seeks general injunctive relief, it would have been quite easy for Congress to limit the EEOC to general injunctive relief or limit it to bringing pattern and practice cases. Instead, it gave it the right --",
  "Well --",
  "Again, with all respect, I disagree. I think restitution statutes reflect and vindicate the public interest, even though the restitution goes to the victim, and not the Government. It's the fact that the --",
  "That's absolutely right. I mean, every time a wrongdoer pays money, the payment of that money serves a public interest that's independent of the destination of the payment, whether it goes to the individual who was wronged or some sort of public enforcement action. And again, I suggest the example of a retaliation action. In a retaliation action, when an employer has retaliated against an employee for filing a charge with the EEOC, the EEOC clearly vindicates the public interest when it files suit to take the employer to task for the retaliation. And that's true even if the retaliation and the most effective remedies are victim- specific. In a case like that, you really need the victim-specific remedies because, after all, it is clear as day from Title VII itself that an employer can't retaliate against an employee for filing a charge. So, to simply get an injunction that says that is of somewhat limited utility. On the other hand, to get back pay, compensatory and capped punitive damages I think does vindicate the public interest.",
  "I guess I would point --",
  "Yes. I would -- I would direct you to Local No. 93 v. City of Cleveland. There's a statement in that case that I think was just meant to reflect a general principle that parties to a litigation can't, through a settlement, bind a non-party to the litigation.",
  "I'm actually aware of no case where that's happened.",
  "This is all hypothetical. And what we're concerned about is a case like this one where there is an arbitration agreement, but the individual has never even sought to arbitrate. I think that's a much easier case. I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to first pick up on Justice Souter's hypothetical about the contempt proceeding. It seems to me that if that were enforced by civil compensatory contempt, rather than a criminal contempt action brought by the U.S. attorney, that he'd -- he'd have the same problem at the end of the day. Respondents invoke the proposition that the EEOC has to take the victim as we find him. The problem with that is that principle applies with respect to damages problems, like a failure to mitigate, that apply to the individual employee whether or not he arbitrates or litigates and applies equally to an EEOC enforcement action and to the individual claim. What's so unique about this is that respondent is attempting to take an agreement that does not restrict Baker's ability to get any remedy in the arbitration proceeding and turn it into a restriction on the remedies available to the EEOC in its action. The problem is, this is not, at bottom, a restriction on damages or a problem with remedies. It is a forum selection clause. And you have a statutory structure that allows two people to initiate an action. When one of those parties has signed a forum selection clause and hasn't even initiated the action, it seems that even in the general case there would be no reason to restrict the other party's access to forums or their remedies. That would seem to be a fortiori true for a statute like Title VII that gives the EEOC a right of first refusal over the initiation of the action. Another point I'd like to emphasize is that, as Justice Stevens made clear, there are currently no suits pending against employers in a situation where there has been a previous settlement. In fact, there are only 450 suits currently in the entirety of the EEOC's docket, and I think that puts this case in perspective. In the literally 99 cases out of 100, an employer's arbitration agreement will govern and the only Title VII claim that will be brought is the employee's claim in arbitration. In the 1 case out of 100, in the extreme case where there's some important public principle at stake or there's particularly egregious conduct, the EEOC's public enforcement action serves as a valuable safety valve that allows it to preserve the possibility of precedent-setting in public judicial proceedings. The third and final point I'd like to make is that whatever the answer is in the settlement context, there's absolutely no reason to take a restriction that only restricts the available forum and not the remedies and turn it into a restriction on remedies but not the forum. Here respondent seeks not only to bind the EEOC to the results of an arbitration, but to prevent the EEOC from seeking all remedies even when there hasn't been any arbitration proceeding initiated at all. For those reasons, we ask you to reverse.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court: In 1996 Congress updated the child pornography laws to keep pace with technological developments. Congress extended the existing prohibitions on visual depictions of actual children engaged in sexually explicit conduct to cover virtually indistinguishable images in material pandered as child pornography. These provisions are constitutional for the same basic reason that other laws prohibiting child pornography have been upheld. They protect real children from real abuse. They do so in two important ways. First, by preventing the publication and production of materials that are as effective as traditional child pornography in seducing children, and second, by allowing the government to effectively prosecute cases involving traditional forms of child pornography. First, these provisions allow the government to attack material that poses the same risk of enticing children into illicit sexual activities and to pose for child pornography as traditional child pornography. The government has a clear and compelling interest in targeting such material; indeed, this court in Osborne against Ohio used that rationale to uphold Ohio's prohibition on the possession of child pornography. Second and equally important, the government has a clear interest in promoting the effective prosecution of the traditional laws against traditional forms of child pornography. The advent and increasing availability of computer technology has allowed individuals to generate computer images that are virtually indistinguishable from traditional photographs. This allows criminal defendants to inject reasonable doubt arguments into virtually every case.",
  "No case has been lost on that ground but that is largely a result of the 1996 Act, which has taken that argument away from criminal defendants. And to give you one very specific example, the case that the Fifth Circuit heard in the Fox case, United States against Fox which is one of the cases where the lower courts upheld this law in an as applied context, the government's expert witness, Special Agent Barkhausen was forced on cross-examination to admit that she could not tell definitively whether or not the image was of a real child. Now that concession prior to the 1996 Act would likely have been fatal to the government's prosecution.",
  "That case was because she couldn't tell it was a real person.",
  "In the cases where the line that the courts are concerned with is the line between 18 and 19, there's an additional aspect of the statute that clears up many of the problems and that's the affirmative defense which allows individuals to produce and distribute materials if they make clear they involve actual individuals who are over 18.",
  "That's certainly true, but I think Congress in recognizing an affirmative defense for materials that were produced using people who had reached the age of majority struck a balance and recognized that this Court has provided additional protection to pornographic depictions involving actual adults.",
  "I think there are at least two reasons for that differential treatment. One is with respect to age that's a fact that's uniquely verifiable and in a lot of contexts we recognize that somebody's age is something that one can verify. And in fact what we're really talking about in most of these cases where the affirmative defense for age would be implicated are films and the like where there would be witnesses who could testify that somebody was of a particular age on a particular date.",
  "Well, in most of the cases when you're talking about somebody who's going to make the claim that they actually generated the photographs themselves, there will be no witnesses. But I think more important than the presence or absence of witnesses is --",
  "And I do think that age rather than whether an image is computerally generated is something that is uniquely subject to verification and this Court in its Ferber decision confronted the argument that the New York statute was overbroad because it didn't limit its protections to photographs and images that were produced in the state of New York. And the court rejected that overbreadth argument for two reasons; one, that it would be virtually impossible for anybody to prove what was the state of origin for the photo. And I think the same analysis applies for a computer generated image. The second reason, of course, was that even materials --",
  "Because, again, in sort of the stylized case that the person who's computer generated an image, that's not something that requires a film crew to be brought in so there aren't necessarily going to be witnesses. In the case --",
  "Well, I'm not sure it's absolutely unique but I do think age is uniquely subject to verification. And if I could get to the second reason that this Court pointed out in Ferber why you didn't need to have a limitation just to pictures generated in the State of New York, the Court recognized in footnote 19 that those materials, even if produced outside the State of New York, pose harms and potential risk to children inside the State of New York.",
  "That's right as a matter of the statute. There's no express affirmative defense for possession.",
  "I believe that's true.",
  "I did see it.",
  "There's no affirmative defense for possession but I think what the statute does is it effectively makes it so that in virtually, in the vast majority of cases where the producers and distributors of a film will be able to claim the affirmative defense, the individual possessor will be able to claim the affirmative defense because of a failure of the government's ability to prove scienter, because if you think about the affirmative defense it gives people the ability to distribute a movie if it involves actors. But if they have the right to distribute a movie that nobody can lawfully possess, it doesn't give them much, that's not much comfort to them.",
  "There's two reasons. One is precisely in order to deal with this anomaly that they don't want to be producing a film that nobody can lawfully possess, the affirmative defense gives an incentive to producers and distributors to make it clear in the marketing of the material that those scenes that you're talking about were scenes that were produced using adults or scenes used with body doubles, and so in that sense through the marketing of the material they can make it clear to people that it involved adults.",
  "Exactly.",
  "There is a requirement, though, that the government prove scienter with respect to age in any prosecution for possession and I don't see how the government could prove scienter as to age in the case of these films where they're marketed in a way where it's clear that they involve adult actors. There's a second aspect in which this Court could find the affirmative defense to cover individuals and that -- individual possessors, and that is the statute does give an affirmative defense for receipt and as the government argued in its briefs that naturally would cover possession incident to receipt. What it doesn't cover, though, and why I think Congress didn't have a blanket affirmative defense for possession is it doesn't apply to somebody who receives some material that's marketed in a way or has a disclaimer that makes it clear that it involves adult actors, but then the individual somehow modifies it, strips out the disclaimer. In that case, the possession is covered by the statute and I think rightly so.",
  "Well, it would trouble me if the statute had that effect but it doesn't have that effect. The affirmative defense makes it crystal clear.",
  "Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said 18.",
  "Well, I think it's 17, but in any event it doesn't trouble me if it's a 17-year-old is prohibited because they wouldn't be prohibited from playing those roles if -- the studio would have two options. They could either not include the sexually explicit conduct which is all that's covered by the statute, and I think it would be possible to have made the film Traffic without involving simulated sexual activity. But putting that to the side, the other option is to use a body double and make it clear in the marketing of the film that that's precisely what you've done.",
  "Not at all. You could not be guilty because the government could not prove scienter and because you would have lawful --",
  "And again --",
  "You are not guilty for the two reasons that I've said and let me just say that you would have the same problem with respect to the statute at issue in Ferber.",
  "Well, certainly if it was just the hand and certainly -- I think there would be certainly a number of ways --",
  "To the contrary, the government has argued throughout this case that it's all unprotected -- speech because it's child pornography. And I think",
  "Well, I want to be clear, I think government would take the position that virtually all the material covered by this statute is independently obscene, but that's not how the government chose to regulate it.",
  "No, I don't think that would be covered by the statute.",
  "I think you have to read the term simulated sexual intercourse in conjunction with the other terms in the statute.",
  "That's certainly true but I think if you read the statute in context, I think there's some requirement that the sexual intercourse that would be depicted would require some display of nudity in the process. Certainly -- well, it doesn't -- it may not say that and the statute itself may not address that case. And I would suggest that the proper way to resolve that case is in an as applied challenge. Wait for the government to bring that prosecution. In fact, I think the government won't bring that prosecution. I mean, it's interesting to talk about the film version of Lolita and the like but that involves just a tiny fraction of materials covered by this statute, and if you want to bet --",
  "Absolutely, and that's why this material that we're talking about is all probably virtually, the government could capture it as obscenity but of course if it tried to do that it couldn't ban the possession, and child pornography was treated as a different case in Ferber.",
  "Absolutely, like obscenity, what this Court said in Ferber is the reason the statute was permissible is because it defined a category of conduct that could be proscribed and was outside the protection of the First Amendment.",
  "Well, let me just clarify one thing because the statute in Ferber itself also covered simulated sexual activity so all these line drawing problems about what, you know, at what point does the scene in Traffic come under the coverage of the statute also applied in Ferber because it also captured simulated acts involving adults. So the only difference between the coverage of this statute and Ferber is that this statute does attempt to prohibit materials that do not involve actual individuals but are virtually indistinguishable from --",
  "With respect, I don't think that's what Ferber meant to say. I mean, Ferber, after all, was decided in 1982.",
  "It did, but it was decided in 1982 before this technology even existed. And interestingly, if you look at footnote 20 in the Ferber opinion the Court went out of its way to invoke the general doctrine that you don't apply cases before they arise and you don't adopt a rationale any broader than necessary to decide the case before it. And it just seems to me --",
  "No I think you read it in the context --",
  "-- with respect, I think you treat it in the context of what was prohibited by the New York statute and the technology that was available at the time. And I think what's important here is any avenues for speech that were left open in Ferber are left open by the statute in conjunction with the affirmative defense. The only materials that are covered by the statute and not covered by Ferber are materials that didn't exist at the time of Ferber and it seems to me that Congress is entitled to update the tech -- the pornography and obscenity laws to deal with technological developments. The first federal obscenity statute in 1842 didn't cover photographs because the technology wasn't in widespread use at the time. Subsequently Congress added photographs to the cover to the obscenity statutes because technology developed and new problems arose.",
  "Well I think there's -- I would make two responses. First, I think this Court has never strictly limited itself to the protection of the child depicted in the image and it recognizes that legislatures in Congress have an interest in protecting all children but secondly --",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Well, I don't know that we have to answer that question in this case because we do have that, because this statute enables the government to continue to prosecute effectively cases involving traditional forms of child pornography, because the advent --",
  "Well, I'm trying to and I think that, I mean, first of all, even in an overbreadth challenge the burden does lie on the party challenging the statute and they have to show things from actual fact in order to challenge the statute and I don't think they've carried that burden. Second, this statute is responsive to the problem of protecting both the children depicted in the image and all children who can be seduced or enticed into this kind of activity can be depicted themselves.",
  "There isn't an interest in those play acting cases and that's why the affirmative defense allows those to take place. But again, the question is as you indicated substantial overbreadth and these questions we're talking about, about Traffic and the film version of Lolita really are a tiny fraction of the cases covered by the statute.",
  "Well, let me first try to say two reasons why I don't think Miller is directly relevant and if those aren't responsive to your questions, maybe --",
  "Well, one reason that Miller is a difficult case and doesn't -- isn't terribly satisfying is it requires a case by case adjudication of that three-prong test which I would say with deference is not self-defining. And what Congress decided to do in this context is follow the lead of Ferber where it said that Miller wasn't the test of child pornography and defined a much clearer class of material that whether or not it applies in Miller, whether or not the work as a whole is implicated, this is a definable class of material that is outside the protection of the First Amendment. If you have concerns about the Miller test then you really should seize upon this statute and Ferber and the analysis in Osborne as one way to deal with that problem because here's a test that doesn't rely on community standards or other difficult considerations to apply in practice. It has a test that says when we're talking about visual depictions only, we're not talking about novels here, and we're talking about material that depicts children engaged in sexually explicit conduct then we don't have to look to the value of the work as a whole. You can put all the Shakespeare around these visual depictions you'd like and they're still visual depictions of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct.",
  "Well, I think there are two principal reasons why you shouldn't be worried about that particular slippery slope. One is this Court already put one foot down that slope in Osborne when it relied on the seduction rationale in conjunction with the concern for the children who were depicted. And in the same way this statute responds both to harm, potential harm, to other children in the seduction rationale and to children actually depicted because as a matter of practical reality it's become very difficult for the government to prosecute cases involving actual, traditional child pornography.",
  "Because I think, as I indicated before, there are real verifiability problems that don't arise in the context of age that do arise in computer. The second reason, though, I think that you have to be less worried about the slippery slope in this context is the government has consistently gone to the courts and told them to interpret appears to be to cover images that are virtually indistinguishable from traditional child pornography. It doesn't seem to put this Court on a slippery slope to say that material that is virtually indistinguishable from material that's already been held to be outside the protection of the First Amendment also will be outside the protection of the First Amendment.",
  "Well, the virtually indistinguishable phrase already appears in the text of the statute, it just doesn't appear in the operative provision. So what we're asking you to do is to read that term, appears to be, in light of the legislative finding, where it's not just the legislative finding where it's virtually indistinguishable.",
  "That's absolutely right and that's the position we've taken in all the lower courts.",
  "Well, I actually think that the conveys the impression language could be given that meaning but I think the conveys the impression language is much less problematic from a constitutional standpoint if you understand subsection D of the statute to be addressed to pandering and in that context the concerns about vagueness are much reduced because you're not going to be focused on just the image, you're going to be focused on the way it's marketed, and I think in that context it won't be difficult to see whether or not it conveys the image. I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel for Respondent notes the 97 percent conviction figure. Well, that reflects a couple of things. One, it reflects that the 1996 Act has allowed us to prosecute cases even where there is a reasonable doubt about whether it is a virtual image or not. The other thing that the 97 percent conviction rate reflects is that we are not out there prosecuting people who pick up Traffic at the Blockbuster. It's no accident that the one court that considered this case in a facial challenge struck the statute down, but the four courts of appeals that considered it in an as applied challenge upheld the statute. Those cases give you an illustration of what the statute is really applied to. The Mento case involved over 100 images of prepubescent children. The Acheson -- case in the 11th Circuit",
  "There is precedent and the best one I can think of is Ferber for waiting until as applied challenges to deal with the fringe cases, the tiny fraction cases. And I think, as in Ferber, if you wait for those cases to be brought you'll find that they are not brought in these cases. Another point I think worth emphasizing is that I don't think given that this statute only covers explicit sexual conduct that there'll be much medical research involved.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When this Court confronts a general grant of jurisdiction, like 1367(a), it routinely infers that the statute does not apply to nonconsenting States. Such a construction avoids difficult -- upsetting the balance between Federal and State powers. For similar reasons, this Court should construe section 1367(d)'s tolling provision not to apply to nonconsenting States. That reading avoids the difficult sovereign immunity questions posed by the application of a Federal statute to extend the State statute of limitations against a nonconsenting State in State court.",
  "The nub of the point --",
  "-- is this Court should apply a clear statement rule to this statute, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, and since there's no indication in the text or legislative history that Congress had any contemplation that this would apply to nonconsenting States, this Court should construe the provision as not applying to nonconsenting States.",
  "There is -- there is enough ambiguity in the statute, if the Court wanted to, to reach the second argument that we offer in our brief, but I would suggest that the first argument we offer in the brief, which you could call the clear statement argument, is a more narrowly tailored and focused answer to the constitutional issues that are raised by applying the statute to nonconsenting States.",
  "Well, if I could, I would focus on the clear statement argument because I think it does very narrowly avoid the constitutional issue that's raised.",
  "I don't think so. I think this Court only needs to decide that it would raise grave constitutional doubts before it would need to apply the -- the clear statement rule because, although in some contexts, in the abrogation context, for example, a clear statement rule assumes that -- that the Congress can't constitutionally do something, in other contexts as Gregory v. Ashcroft, Will against the Michigan Department of -- of State -- in those cases, this Court has applied clear statement principles even though they don't assume the answer to the constitutional question. And that, of course, is consistent with the way this Court approaches matter as a general matter and its preference to avoid constitutional questions. The -- the Court, for example, just last term in -- in Vermont against United States ex rel. Stevens, applied similar principles of statutory construction to avoid directly addressing the Eleventh Amendment --",
  "Well, I think, for example, in the Stevens case, this Court interpreted the term person not to include the State. What effectively we're asking the Court to do here is interpret the term, any claim, in section 1367(d) to say any claim except one against a nonconsenting State.",
  "No. That's exactly right. And in Will against Michigan where the Court had already held that 1983 did not implicate Eleventh Amendment issues, this Court nonetheless held that in State courts, the term person in 1983 does not apply to -- to States or to State officers acting in their official capacities. And I think all of those cases and the -- the Court's decision in Gregory against Ashcroft and in Will all stand for the proposition that this Court can apply a clear statement type principle to avoid a constitutional --",
  "Well, I -- I think that -- that in order to maintain consistency with our position in this case, we would have to ask this Court to apply a clear statement rule in that case, and the current version of the statute would probably not apply to States under that -- under that theory.",
  "We haven't seen that the -- that the issue of sovereign immunity arising in those contexts, and it very well -- well --",
  "It very well may be, as counsel for the University of Minnesota suggested, that States will have the good sense in those instances to waive their sovereign immunity defense. I mean, the same principles that are going to motivate the Federal Government to pass the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act are going to motivate State governments to waive their sovereign immunity defenses in those claims. Now, it seems to me that -- two points I'd like to make. First of all, it's worth focusing on the fact that even before 1367(d), the informal Federal court practices for dealing with potentially untimely State claims did not apply to nonconsenting States. Justice Scalia, you raised the -- the problem of conditioning a dismissal on a withdraw -- of statute of limitations defenses. But, of course, under Pennhurst II, a State has an absolute right to insist that the pendent claims against it be dismissed. So, in that context, the Federal court would not be able to condition the dismissal on a waiver of a statute of limitations defense, nor would it be able to retain jurisdiction over the claim. So, it stands to reason that 1367(d) should no more apply to cases against nonconsenting States than the Federal court practices it replaced. Lastly, I would emphasize that this interpretation of section 1367(d) does not place plaintiffs in an untenable position or in an unconstitutional bind. Plaintiffs, in cases where the State objects to Federal court jurisdiction as a blanket matter, have the same rights that they would have under Pennhurst II. They can file both claims in State court, the Federal and the State, which seems a complete answer to any due process objections, or they can file parallel proceedings. Even if the State makes a decision whether to consent on a case by cases, as Minnesota appears to do, the State -- the plaintiff can still attempt to get consent in the first instance, and if it's not, it can make a protective filing along the lines that Justice Ginsburg suggested. In the end, it seems that plaintiffs lack any case law to support their due process arguments. I think that respondent, in fairness, lacks any case law to support its -- its Article I legislative power argument. There's really no need for this Court to make any significant case law in order to decide this case if it simply applies the clear statement test we suggest in our brief. If there's no other questions, I'll submit.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: States enjoy no sovereign immunity from Federal executive branch action, even when it takes the form of adjudication. It is well-established that States have no immunity from a suit brought by the Federal Government. That's true not because of some preexisting notion of sovereign immunity, but because that consent to suits by the United States Federal Government is implicit in the plan of the convention. Now, proceedings before the Federal Maritime Commission are a necessary predicate for the United States Government to bring a Federal suit to enforce the Shipping Act. Given that the States enjoy no immunity from such a suit, they should not be allowed to reach back into the administrative process and assert an immunity from the preliminary proceedings before the agency.",
  "No --",
  "But we have a private party that's not initiating a lawsuit, but is initiating executive action. Private parties are free to complain to the Federal Government and say a State government is violating Federal law. In fact, the Petition Clause rightly protects the individual petitioner's right to petition the Federal Government and complain about that violation. Now, I don't think it violates the Constitution for the United States Federal Government to say, we take citizen complaints seriously, and we're going to investigate each and every one of them, and I wouldn't think that it would violate the Eleventh Amendment for the Attorney General to give the party who's the subject of the complaint, even if it's the State, an opportunity to come before --",
  "-- the executive branch and explain why there wasn't a violation.",
  "Well, they do resemble adjudication, and that's part of the process to formalize and regularize this process of getting complaints from citizens and response from others, but I don't think the formalization and regularization of that process turns it into a judicial act. It remains an act --",
  "Well, first I want to clarify something. If there's a case where the State doesn't appear, and the private party is asserting a view of the Shipping Act that's contrary to the view of the Federal Maritime Commission, then there will be no order.",
  "It is -- it would be enforceable through a judicial procedure under the Shipping Act.",
  "But I don't think it's a critical difference, because the reason that that becomes enforceable, subject to whatever defenses there are, the reason that becomes enforceable is not because it's the midway point in some litigation. It's enforceable because it reflects the executive branch's definitive interpretation of the Shipping Act. The cease-and-desist order --",
  "Well, there are some challenges that can be brought to that, and I guess the problem with this --",
  "No, they can't, under the current system.",
  "I don't think it currently is, but if that's --",
  "Well, it -- but the point, I think -- first of all, if the problem is the level of review that's given at the end of the process, then that's what should be adjusted, not throwing out the entire proceeding ab initio as the Fourth Circuit did. But more to the point, I think the reason there's deference is because it reflects the executive branch's view, and it's the same in that order whether it's the product of a privately initiated complaint and adjudication, or whether it's an agency-initiated complaint. In both cases there's going to be practical pressure for the State-regulated entity to participate in the proceeding, but neither should they get an immunity. The practical pressure is not the same as the compulsive process that the judiciary has. Nobody's summoned before the commission because a summons is necessarily enforced through the contempt power of the court. This is --",
  "What there is a tradition of is the executive branch having the flexibility to determine how it is going to enforce Federal law. There aren't many of these cases precisely because there just aren't that many State-run entities that are regulated, but the executive branch has the flexibility to regulate them through rule-making, through agency-initiated adjudications, or through private adjudications. In each one of those, there are practical pressures to participate. In each one of those, the rule- making can be initiated by a private complaint. There's a specific provision in the commission's regulation to allow rule-makings to be kicked off by a private complaint, but that doesn't turn it into something other than the executive branch's determination of what the law is and how it should be enforced, and this Court has generally deferred to the executive branch's need to determine how best to take care that the laws are faithfully executed.",
  "What's that?",
  "Well, --",
  "I don't know the specific application, but --",
  "Well --",
  "I mean, but one thing that's certainly clear about the labor board is that that's a perfect example of an administrative agency that decides to proceed by adjudication.",
  "Well, another example is the Railway Labor Act, because the Railway Labor Act is -- defines its jurisdiction coextensively with the Interstate Commerce Commission. There are State-run railroads under the Railway Labor Act. Typically those kind of employment disputes are initiated by a private party. This court in California v. Taylor said that the Railway Labor Act can apply to a State-run railroad. Interestingly, in footnote 16 of that opinion, the Court reserved the question of whether the Eleventh Amendment provided protection for the suit in court, but it didn't say anything about Eleventh Amendment protection before the board itself, and I think the relevant history here is almost exactly the opposite of the case in Alden. In Alden, this case had a long history of State sovereign immunity, and very few and only recent efforts by the Federal Government to abrogate that immunity. Here, by contrast, there's a 115-year tradition of State entities being subject to regulatory commissions, and very few and only recent efforts to invoke any kind of Eleventh Amendment immunity before them. I also think that the text of the Eleventh Amendment has a special relevance here that it lacked in Alden. In Alden, the determination that State courts not exercise the, quote, judicial power of the United States, only began the analysis of whether or not the States enjoyed their sovereign immunity free from congressional disturbance. Here, the recognition that the commission exercise -- does not exercise the judicial power of the United States necessarily means it exercises the executive power of the United States, and this Court has traditionally held that the executive branch may initiate process against the States without an Eleventh Amendment bar. The fact that this proceeding --",
  "But in this particular context, I think the text is relevant, because this is not a free- floating, pre-existing notion of sovereign immunity. What we're saying is that the Eleventh Amendment waiver in the plan of the Constitution that allows the United States Government to sue a State also allows it to take the preliminary steps in the administrative process.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A school district that reasonably concludes that it faces a drug problem may adopt random drug tests for students engaged in competitive extracurricular activities without violating the Constitution.",
  "I think in a case like that, it still might be appropriate for the school district to test the students involved in extracurricular activities, and I think that is because, as this Court has emphasized on a number of occasions, by making the -- the testing program applicable only to an avoidable activity, the -- the school district would be ensuring the reasonableness of the program under the Fourth Amendment.",
  "Well --",
  "A couple of points in response to that, Justice O'Connor. First, there's contrary evidence as well, and the petitioners in their reply brief point to some evidentiary studies that showed that really drug use is distributed evenly across all groups in the student -- in the student population. The second thing I would add is that as -- as I was noting in answer to Justice Kennedy's question, there is a sense, and which the majority and Justice Ginsburg in -- in Vernonia emphasized, that by making the program only applicable to activities that are avoidable, you -- you limit Fourth Amendment difficulties. You make the program more reasonable. And as Justice Stevens pointed out, you also avoid any difficult questions that might be occasioned by the consequences of a drug testing program that applies to school-wide.",
  "Well, I don't think it's that odd, Justice O'Connor. First of all, in terms of the certifications, I would direct you to footnote 23 of the district court opinion. And the district court found in that footnote that what those reports really emphasized are the relative natures of the problem. Alcohol was the major problem they faced, but in each one of those -- those reports, they note that they do have a drug problem.",
  "I would be surprised to find a school district that didn't. The national figures on -- on the -- the amount of drug use are really staggering. As we note in our brief, over half of all 12th graders have tried illegal drugs by the time they graduate from high school. So, I really think that, you know, if anything, the burden ought to shift in these cases to the other side to show that this one school district is the one school district --",
  "That's correct, Justice Scalia. And I would also point out I'm not sure you want to put school districts in the business of trying -- when they -- when they find some incidental evidence of drug use, to try to pin it down to the exact extracurricular groups involved. If a student comes in --",
  "-- for some sort of anonymous drug counseling, I'm not sure they want to ask him what groups are you in.",
  "Justice Stevens, we think such a program would be constitutional, but we think the program at issue here --",
  "We -- we do have that difference, but we think a program like this is constitutional for three reasons. One, extracurricular students agree to additional intrusions on their privacy and have additional safety risks. Second, as --",
  "Two points, Justice Souter. First, we're not suggesting this is -- this is constitutional because it's consensual. I think Justice Kennedy, in -- in his separate opinion in the Ferguson case, pointed out that in these special needs contexts, there's an element of voluntariness which is important to the constitutional analysis, even if it's not voluntary in the full sense of the word. This -- a second and related point about that, though, is that these are avoidable programs, and I think that makes the important difference. And again, as I noted earlier, because they're -- they're avoidable in that sense, it avoids any difficult questions with the consequences that a positive test might generate.",
  "Well, I mean, I -- I think one fact is that I think it is increasingly becoming true that -- that these sorts of policies are in society as a whole. And one of the petitioners in this case who -- who didn't wanted to be drug tested at school had to go get drug tested for the job at the Kmart, at the McDonald's. And I do think that probably does have some influence on the reasonable expectations of privacy in this area. But I also think that it really doesn't make a lot of sense to draw a line on -- on sports, and even within sports, of course, there are differences. The Vernonia policy applied to golfers, as well as football players. Now, I'm not aware that golfers, as a general matter, are tested for substance abuse even on the PGA Tour. I could be wrong about that, but the point is there are differences in the risks even among the athletes, and I think this Court in Vernonia didn't make anything turn on those differences. The dissent in Vernonia pointed out that there wasn't any evidence of drug use at the grade school in the 7th and 8th grade, and that the evidence really wasn't an evidence of a disciplinary problem that was specific to student athletes. And the majority in Vernonia did not -- was not -- was not moved by those two points. The majority said that the evidence was good enough in these contexts. And I think this is an area where deference to the local school boards in their determinations about the nature of the problem, the nature of the solution, and particularly the particular students that are going to be tested is quite appropriate. It's important to recognize --",
  "I would, Justice Souter. I do -- as I said, I think it's a more difficult question. And I think the most difficult problem with a school-wide test is what Justice Stevens pointed out, and that would be what are the consequences of a positive test. But if you imagine a school district that -- that faced -- reasonably concluded it faced a serious problem and instituted a drug test where the only ramification of a positive drug test was a confidential notification of the parents, I don't see why that test would violate Fourth Amendment reasonableness.",
  "I would like to say two things in response to that. First, in Vernonia itself, this Court didn't identify the special need as being the drug problem. This Court identified the special need as being the school setting, and that's consistent with this Court's decision in T.L.O.",
  "I -- I do think it would properly recognize that the school context is different, and that school boards have a freer hand in testing their students than the Government has testing either employees or its citizens at large.",
  "I think the danger is this. I mean, it -- and I think Von Raab actually is -- is an excellent counterpoint. This Court in Von Raab said that you could test the customs official because they are on the front line of the drug problems on the supply side. I think by parity of reasoning, children today are on the front lines of the drug problem, but on the demand side. The evidence shows that if you can stop children from using drugs before their 18th birthday, they're not likely to start using drugs after that --",
  "I agree with that, Justice Scalia, and I would -- I would add that this is not the only context where -- where the Federal Government has recognized that difference. The penalties for dealing drugs in a school area or selling drugs to a minor are much more substantial than those selling drugs to adults.",
  "Absolutely, and I think it's perfectly --",
  "No, and -- and I don't think it's rocket science also to say that that -- that concern is particularly acute with respect to the youngest and most vulnerable members of society. And as I say, if you look at 21 U.S.C. 859, 860, 861, all of those provisions put added penalties on someone who deals drugs involving children. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Congress has directed the FCC to use auctions to allocate scarce wireless spectrum in a manner that furthers the public interest. Those auctions allocate spectrum to the party who will -- who values the spectrum most highly and, by assumption, will use it most effectively to serve the public. In addition, Congress has directed the FCC to consider a number of specific factors in assessing the public interest, including promoting opportunities for small business and ensuring the rapid deployment of wireless services. Nothing in that public interest regulatory regime runs afoul of section 525 of the Bankruptcy Code. To be sure, in administering its auctions the FCC does place consequences on the regulatory signals provided by the failure to meet regulatory payment deadlines. In particular, the FCC views the failure to make a timely regulatory payment as a proxy for a determination that continued possession of the license is not in the public interest.",
  "That's right. It's been replaced in large part but not exclusively, and I think both aspects that are important --",
  "Well, I think there's a difference, though, when a regulator regulates solely for timely payment for its own sake, and in that case it implicates only the policies that are addressed by the Bankruptcy Code, and I think it's a different situation when the regulator looks at the failure to make timely payment as a proxy for something else.",
  "Well, it's automatic in the sense --",
  "With respect, Justice, Chief Justice Rehnquist, when it says automatic, what it means is that it cancels without any, the need for any further action from the commission, but in any given case, the cancellation of a license is a result both of the automatic cancellation rule and the fact that a payment deadline has come forward, and where the commission has discretion is in relaxing the payment deadline, and you can see that in this very case. NextWave's license is canceled, according to the FCC, because NextWave failed to make the very first installment payment due under those licenses. Now, according to the licenses in the first instance, that payment was due on April 30, 1997, but the licenses didn't cancel on April 30, 1997 because the commission in its discretion, as part of a multifactor public interest determination, extended the payment deadline a full 18 months.",
  "Well, to be sure, the FCC participated in the bankruptcy proceedings and protected its interests as a creditor, but at the same time it has independent interests as a regulator, and the FCC, as we point out on page 19 of the reply brief, made clear at various points well before NextWave went into bankruptcy that it did not view bankruptcy as an exception from the regulatory provisions of the Communications Act, and I think if you look at the specific event that NextWave points to as the automatic cancellation, it's the failure to make a payment that was due on October 29, 1998, and it was due on the 29th of October, 1998, rather than April 30, 1997, precisely because of a public interest determination by the commission.",
  "With respect, Justice Souter, I don't think that's correct. When -- I mean, it is true that the FCC tried to go in and protect its interests as a creditor, but at the point that NextWave was trying to keep its regulatory licenses that it promised to pay $4.7 billion for, and trying to keep those licenses for just over a billion, the result of that process would have been that the rest of that amount, the $3 billion plus, would have been an unsecured claim of the FCC, that would have been really worth virtually nothing, so I think the better way to understand this case is that the FCC does have interests as a creditor, and it has tried to protect those interests in the bankruptcy proceedings and has participated in those proceedings, but at the same time, it has interests with the -- as a regulator, and in its capacity as a regulator it hasn't acted in a way that would result in a sole-cause cancellation.",
  "No, I don't, but let me give you --",
  "No. The only regulatory purpose there, at least as I understand your hypothetical, is in providing for timely payment, but suppose a State --",
  "Well --",
  "But again, but if a State had a regulatory purpose in ensuring that its drivers were financially responsible, and presumptively said that a license would fail to cancel for the failure to pay $500 in traffic tickets, but provided a mechanism for the driver to go in before the regulatory commission and say, look, I know I haven't paid $500 worth of traffic tickets, but I'm actually financially responsible. I have a ton of money in the bank, and so you ought to give me a relaxation of the rules or a waiver --",
  "Right, but --",
  "Well, but again, if you look, and what the regulator is doing is extending the -- extending the payment not as a creditor, but as a regulator, I think you're in a very different situation.",
  "I really don't think that's true, with respect. I think the kind of waiver proceeding or opportunity to relax the rules would be out of place in a regulatory regime that was only concerned with timely payment. It's precisely because the FCC uses the timely payment, or the failure to make timely payment, as a proxy for a public interest determination that it has this waiver proceeding, and it gives the regulating entity --",
  "Well, I mean, there is some tension there, and the FCC has been at pains to try to make sure that it doesn't bend over one way too far or the other. In its restructuring order that I think is critical in this case. It froze the payments -- it suspended the payments ultimately for 18 months, and then it also provided some restructuring options that required further modifications of its rules.",
  "When it did that --",
  "When it did that, not only did some people complain that they didn't give enough regulatory relief, but other disappointed bidders ran to the D.C. Circuit and said, look, you've acted arbitrarily and capriciously because you haven't stuck with your pre-auction rules.",
  "Well, again I think the key is, the payments do cancel automatically after all the efforts to get the payments extended have failed, and that's just not like a hypothetical consideration in this case, because in this very case --",
  "No, no, not after attempts to --",
  "The automatic trigger is when somebody fails to make a payment --",
  "And -- no, it's really not enough, if you look at the broader perspective of the regulation, because there's an alternative way to get out of the automatic cancellation. It's not -- if you're a regulated entity and you don't want your license to cancel, you don't go to the commission and say, don't apply the automatic cancellation. What you do is, you go to the commission and you say, I've a regulatory payment. It's going to be due April 30. I'm not in a good position to make that payment, so what I'd like you to do is relax the payment deadline, and --",
  "Not only does the commission have the authority to do that --",
  "-- it did it in this very case.",
  "Well, the reason we don't settle the case today, although obviously there were efforts to try to settle this, which would require congressional legislation, which we were unable to get in a timely fashion, but the reason that they are not in a position to cure their defaults, if you will, is because our view is that they have -- the opportunity to cure has passed. The licenses have actually already --",
  "I think it would be within the agency's discretion to settle the litigation at this point. Now, of course, if we did that, I'm sure, as in the last time the commission tried to relax its rules, I'm sure we'd draw a D.C. Circuit challenge to that exercise of discretion to relax the rules. But the very fact that there is that reservoir of discretion to relax the rules demonstrates that the ultimate cancellation is not a sole-cause cancellation.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Well --",
  "But I don't think -- whether or not the FCC has the authority to exercise that discretion in a particular case might be an issue, but it's undisputed that they have that right as a general matter and, in fact, NextWave wouldn't be here today if the FCC didn't have the authority to offer discretionary relaxation of its rules. When NextWave's --",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I don't really think it's in dispute, because in this very case the payment deadline --",
  "Well, I --",
  "No. We think the right-to-cure argument is best addressed on remand. I do think there are two reasons why the right to cure is not any longer available to NextWave. One is that the licenses automatically canceled on their own terms. The second reason is that the license restriction, the licenses themselves had a restriction on transfer or alienation, and there's law under 11 U.S.C. 365 that deals with executory obligations that says that the debtor in possession cannot take possession of a license, assume the obligations of a license if there are restrictions on its alienation or transfer.",
  "Well, there have been situations like that, not necessarily in the C-Block license situation, but there was a situation with respect to a different program where a license canceled by its own terms by a failure to renew, and the commission renewed that license largely on the basis of the fact that that licensee was already providing service, and so the result of revoking the license would be to deny people service that was currently being provided. Now, in the reconsideration order that's the subject --",
  "Well, I think that particular instance is particularly relevant, because NextWave relied on that in its reconsideration proceedings before the commission. And the commission, in rejecting that, I think demonstrated why this isn't a case of sole-cause cancellation. If you look at the commission's reasoning on page 82a of the petition appendix, the commission says, quote, \"NextWave is providing no service. The spectrum licensed to NextWave has gone unused since early 1997, and represents licenses in 90 markets across the United States.\"",
  "Absolutely, it does, and what the commission decided in this order, which is under review in this case, is that it was not going to relax or provide an exception to the automatic cancellation rule, but the reason it decided that is because NextWave wasn't providing service, and that others stood ready to provide service under that spectrum, and what I would respectfully suggest is that under those circumstances the cancellation is not a sole-cause cancellation. It also reflects the fact that NextWave wasn't providing service, that others stood ready to do it, and that's enough to take it out of 525, which is, after all, a very narrowly written provision. It only protects against sole cancellation. It allows the failure to pay a dischargeable debt to be a contributing factor in a regulatory decision, indeed, the primary factor in the regulatory decision, just not the sole cause.",
  "I think the position is they might have an opportunity to go after that as an unsecured debt in bankruptcy.",
  "That's true. I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.",
  "That's an open question before the commission that they haven't addressed. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me first address Justice O'Connor's very proper concern that licensees are going to be able to enjoy their licenses for much less than they agreed to pay the commission. That is not a dead letter and, in fact, one of the cases that is being held for this case involves Kansas PCS, where the bankruptcy court approved the plan that gave the FCC 5 cents on the dollar for the value of its licenses. Now, it's true that one mechanism to get the licenses for less than they paid for, the fraudulent conveyance theory, is something that the FCC can address. That was the GWI bankruptcy, where the FCC only got 16 cents on the dollar. But there's a second way to do it, which is to only give the FCC the value for its security interest, the value of the licenses at that point, and the bankruptcy court did that in Kansas PCS, and only gave the commission 5 cents on the dollar. Second, let me address Justice Kennedy's concern with, where's the authority for the FCC to take into account bankruptcy policy concerns? The authority comes from a D.C. Circuit decision called LaRose, which is cited on page 79a of the decision, the reconsideration decision that's under review. The LaRose decision is a D.C. Circuit decision that tells the FCC that it must take bankruptcy policy considerations into account. Now --",
  "Well, it is binding on the FCC, though, and the FCC tried to do its best to take bankruptcy considerations into account. Now, if it failed to do it properly --",
  "No, they did. They did, and again I think they -- one of the reasons they took bankruptcy considerations into account is by extending payments for all the C-Block licensees for 18 months. But if you think the problem here is that the FCC didn't do the right balancing of bankruptcy policy and telecommunications policy, then the D.C. Circuit or this case could reverse for an arbitrary capriciousness, but that's not the role of 525. 525 is an exceedingly narrow provision that simply prevents a regulator under any circumstances from canceling a license solely because, and here it's just not true that the failure to make a payment was the sole trigger, because you have to look at it in context, and what triggered default is the failure to make a payment of a payment that was due for a particular reason. Now, anybody in -- any FCC licensee could have gone to the commission and tried to get a further extension of that payment deadline. They'd already gotten extended 18 months. They could have gotten extended even further, and it's hard for me to understand how there's a sole trigger when the very payment deadline that is supposed to be -- trigger the automatic cancellation is itself the reflection of a multifactor public interest determination by the commission. They extended it 18 months but no further, based on a consideration of the public interest. Now, on Justice Breyer's concern about what's going on here, I think your concern is exactly right, and what sense does it make from a bankruptcy policy to disable the Government to make installment payments?",
  "Well, I think -- no, I think -- I think --",
  "I think -- there's two reasons we didn't argue it. One, we did -- there is that flavor in the brief, but the other reason is, you at one point said, doesn't the commission just want the money? That's actually not true. What we want is, we want the licenses back --",
  "Don't worry -- thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The 1995 amendment to section 409 is, contrary to the determination of the Washington State Supreme Court, constitutional. The provision protects data that is compiled and collected for purposes of applying for Federal highway funds from being used in State and Federal court litigation. The documents at issue are inherently Federal in character, and so Congress has the power to prohibit the use of those documents in both Federal and State court litigation.",
  "I think those documents --",
  "I think those documents, Justice O'Connor, would be discoverable and admissible if the documents were sought from the party that collected them for a purpose different than the Federal highway funding purposes, but what the statute, I think, does prohibit is somebody going to the State Highway Traffic Department and essentially engaging in a one-stop shopping enterprise where they can get all sorts of documents that have been collected --",
  "That's exactly right, Justice O'Connor, and so as a result of our interpretation of the statute, the typical police accident report can be obtained from the Police Department and, I think with respect to Justice Breyer's hypothetical, the report about the tree can be obtained from the State Tree Department or the State Environmental Department.",
  "I think that's a difficult question, Justice Kennedy. I think that as you know, as a general matter evidentiary privileges are waivable, and so -- and that's the proposition this Court has established in cases like Menzonato and Hill, but there is a sense in which this privilege exists, in our view, primarily for the benefit of the Federal Government, so that we can obtain accurate, complete, and candid assessments of highway traffic safety requirements, and so, there's a suggestion, for example, in the Hill decision at footnote 3 that, when a third party's interests are at stake, that the court may not find waiver under those circumstances as readily as it would otherwise, so our view I think would be that although the Court need not definitively resolve it in this case, there's a strong argument that the privilege would not be waivable.",
  "I think the admissibility of those materials --",
  "I think there's a sense in which it would violate the Federal statute, but I'm not suggesting that the Department of Transportation is going to be able to leap to the defense of the statute in that hypothetical and assert the interests of the statute. I think, however, if a State wanted to take a systematic policy of disregarding section 409, I think that would implicate the Federal interests, and I'm not sure that a State would be able to do it.",
  "I don't think so, Chief Justice. I think it is something that could be procedurally defaulted, but I do think if in a case like that the State went to the trial judge and said, look, there is this provision of Federal law, section 409, that says this material can't come in, but we're happy to just disregard that provision, I think the trial court might well be within its rights to say that no, we're not going to disregard that provision of Federal law, we're going to keep the material out, but I do think it could be --",
  "Well, I'm suggesting that the language of the statute is mandatory. It says that it shall not be admitted, so I think if the language is brought to the attention of the trial court judge, he or she would be in a position where they ought to exclude the evidence.",
  "I think under the circumstances that you're envisioning, Justice Ginsburg, the Federal Government would not provide funds under 152 or 130 or 144 to that particular locality.",
  "It certainly depends on the States or the localities abiding by that privilege as a general matter. I don't think a State or a locality can take a cavalier position of saying, we're just not going to be bound by the provisions of this Federal statute, but yet we'd still like to take the money under those three statutes. I don't think that's permissible, and the reason is, is that section 409, although it may benefit the State in a particular litigation, does serve an important Federal interest, and that is the interest in getting complete and candid information to assess and to award Federal highway funds. By analogy, I would suggest this Court look to its decision in the Buckman Company v. Plaintiff's Committee case, because in that case this Court recognized that the FDA approval process, and the process for applying for FDA approval, is inherently Federal in character, and so this Court preempted State tort law that might distort the effect of applying for FDA approval. In the same way, the process of applying for Federal highway funds and the documents that are used for that purpose have an inherently Federal character, and so the Federal Government has an interest in making sure that the information provided to the Federal Government is accurate and complete, and it has an ability, Congress has the power to take those essentially Federal documents and protect them both in State and Federal court litigation. Now, I would suggest that the answer to the waiver question, unlike the answer to the statutory construction question, is not a necessary component of this Court's decision. We think the better view is that it could be -- is that it could not be waived, at least in gross. Of course, if it could be waived, I think that is an additional answer to any accountability questions that may arise, but again, we think the better view is that it can't be waived.",
  "I think the better view is that he doesn't have standing to raise that argument, and I'll also suggest that if they wanted to make a Tenth Amendment argument, and wanted this Court to decide the difficult question of whether or not an individual had standing to raise a Tenth Amendment argument, that they probably should have raised the Tenth Amendment argument before the conclusion section of their brief, and I think this Court would be well-advised not to definitively decide whether or not an individual had standing to raise a Tenth Amendment issue. I --",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I don't think all Tenth Amendment challenges are created equal, and I think therein lies the difference. If all the Tenth Amendment challenge is, is a mirrored reflection of Congress not having the enumerated power to enact a statute --",
  "Absolutely. In those kind of cases, the individual does have standing, but this Court on various occasions has suggested that there's an additional component to the Tenth Amendment, that it's not just a reflection of the enumerated powers of Congress, but, rather, there are certain special areas of State prerogatives that the Federal Government can't intrude through congressional acts.",
  "I think that's right, but Justice Kennedy, I think there's something that certainly seems different. If the gravamen of the complaint is that there's some element of State sovereignty that Congress cannot intrude upon, and the State doesn't object to that intrusion, it seems odd that the individual would have third party standing to raise that objection.",
  "Again, I think you could, and I think that's why with respect to a more typical Tenth Amendment challenge that's based on an enumerated power, or the lack of an enumerated power, there would be standing. I think what this Court suggested --",
  "Well --",
  "No, I understand that, and that was also true in Chadha. I think if there is a difference, and this Court suggested there might be a difference in the TVA case, if there is a difference it's because there are certain Tenth Amendment challenges that have the nature of just an intrusion on State sovereignty that's particularized. The hypothetical that the cases have often talked about is moving a State capital, and if the State doesn't object to moving the State capital, it's hard to see why an individual ought to be able to raise that question. I think the more important point, though, for this case is that there was a suggestion to this effect in this Court's TVA decision. If this Court wants to revisit that decision, it probably doesn't want to do it in a case where the Tenth Amendment challenge is not properly raised and isn't even raised at all in the briefing before this Court until the conclusionary section of the brief. With respect to the enumerated powers questions, which I think are the gravamen of respondent's case and the Washington Supreme Court's decision, there's no question the individual has standing. That was true in this case, in this Court's decision in United States v. Lopez and would be equally true here. And I think this Court can take comfort in knowing that this is, at bottom, an enumerated powers case, not a Tenth Amendment case in any specialized sense, because the Washington State Supreme Court found it unobjectionable that section 409 would apply in its pre- 1995 amendment version, and what that indicates is that there's nothing sacrosanct about State courts' procedures, or State evidentiary rules.",
  "I agree with you entirely, Justice Kennedy, that this Court should define the scope of the statute before deciding whether or not it's constitutional, and we would urge the United States' construction of the statute. I would say that the waiver question is somewhat different. I don't think the constitutionality of the statute turns on the waiver question. If the Court disagrees, we would urge the Court first to find that this privilege is not waivable at least in gross and, second, that even if it is waivable, the statute remains constitutional.",
  "I think you do have a final State decision, and I think that's most clear with respect to the PDA action -- that's the State Public Disclosure Act that was brought -- because in that case the Washington Supreme Court held that the four documents were disclosable and said that attorney's fees would be appropriate. In this --",
  "Well, but there was no cross- appeal on that document either, Justice Scalia, so I think that document is no longer part of the case. When the Washington Court of Appeals held that four of the five documents needed to be disclosed, Pierce County took an appeal to the Washington State Supreme Court, but I don't think that the Guillens filed a cross-appeal suggesting that the fifth document ought to be disclosed, and so I really think the fifth document is no longer in the case, and since the Washington Supreme Court found that attorney's fees were appropriate, that means that there was a final judgment. That's true both at the --",
  "That's not how I read the decision, Justice Ginsburg. I thought -- I read the decision as the four documents were clearly going to be disclosed as part of the PDA action.",
  "That's not, with respect, how I read the opinion. I read the opinion that those four documents are disclosable under the PDA. The only objection to disclosure under the PDA that was raised by the county was section 409, and with that issue resolved against the county, I took the import of the decision that those documents would be disclosed. At that point, I think it's clearly a final decision, because this Court has held in the Beckton Dickinson case in the context of section 1291 that the fact that attorney's fees need to be resolved on remand doesn't deprive a decision of finality, and in that decision this Court relied on 1257 decisions, and so I would think that the same rule would apply in both contexts, so I think that the PDA action clearly is final. I think the tort action is a more difficult question as to whether that's final. I think this Court might have to change its -- to modify its precedents a bit, but I think it might be a wise course in light of what Congress has done here. I think this case is quite analogous to a case that this case found final called National Mercantile Bank v. Langdow, and in that case there was a State venue provision that a Federal statute trumped, and the State supreme court found that the -- this Court found that the State's decision saying that State law trumped the Federal statute was final, and I think the cases are quite parallel. They both involved congressional efforts to modify State procedure in order to serve a Federal interest, and in both cases when the State court disregarded the Federal interest and either through constitutional means or statutory means found the Federal statute inapplicable, this Court found that there was a final judgment in the Langdow case, and I think by extension of that decision, they could find a final judgment here. I think the main difference between this case and Langdow is that in Langdow this Court took the position that upon remand there would be no further litigation available in the State court where the lawsuit was filed. Here, there might be some litigation that would go on in the tort action, for example, but I think the important thing is that the Federal interest has been extinguished, and I think if there's any play in the joints in this Court's finality decisions, I think that this would be a particularly important case to find a final decision, because an act of Congress has been held unconstitutional.",
  "I don't think so, Your Honor. I think that these actions are severable. They were consolidated for purposes of appeal before the Washington Supreme Court, and I think that --",
  "I think that would be fair, or this Court could just sort of ignore the tort case and say that it's going to take jurisdiction over the PDA action and decide this Federal statutory issue in the context of the State PDA action, and --",
  "Well, I --",
  "I mean, I think that this Court could say that to the extent that the tort action is before it, that that action is not final, and that -- or they're not going to -- the Court's not going to definitively resolve that, and that the PDA action is final. I would -- this Court in a different context actually managed to bifurcate a single case and say that one part of the case was final and the accounting action that was subject to remand was not final. That's the",
  "No, no, but I think if you can do that in a single case, I think you can certainly do it in a case like this, where they started as separate actions, were consolidated only for purposes of appeal, and really have separate life. If, for example, this Court hadn't exercised jurisdiction, what would have happened is that the two cases would have gone back down. The PDA action would have been essentially over, because as the county suggested, there's nothing left in the PDA action on remand. The tort action would go on, and once the PDA action went back to the trial court, then it would have been appropriate to appeal that on a separate track from the tort action, and there would have been really no point to making the county go through that exercise, and so I think the PDA action is final. If there are no further questions, I think the important submission from the Government is that the 1995 amendments can be given force in a way that renders them still quite well within the Congress' power under the Commerce, Spending, and Necessary and Proper Clauses.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Amendment privilege against self- incrimination safeguards the integrity of the criminal trial process and ensures that an individual is not convicted on the basis of a coerced confession. But the privilege against self-incrimination is not a direct limit on the primary conduct of the law enforcement officers. This is not to say that there are no substantive constitutional limits on what law officers may do to obtain information or to secure a confession. But those limits are to be found in the Fourth Amendment and in the law of substantive due process, not in the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination privilege --",
  "That's right, Justice Kennedy. It's not a Fifth Amendment violation. It very well might be --",
  "It very well -- Justice O'Connor, it very well could be a Fourteenth --",
  "Well, I think generally, at least as I understand this Court's decision in -- in Sacramento against Lewis, in these kind of executive action contexts where things are ongoing, I think there is some kind of intent element. I think that --",
  "Well, I'm not sure how intent would need to be proven in any particular case, but I would say the critical difference between the Fifth Amendment inquiry and the Fourteenth Amendment inquiry, when it's -- when it's done in the context of the admissibility of a coerced confession, is in that context, what the courts are taking into account is the effect on the integrity of the trial process of using a coerced confession. It's a different calculus, though, when you're trying to regulate primary law enforcement conduct because it strikes me that not everything that a law enforcement officer could do to coerce a confession -- there -- there may be some acts that may be sufficiently problematic that you'd certainly want to keep the confession out of the trial.",
  "No. I don't think there's a Fifth Amendment -- I don't think there's a complete Fifth Amendment violation. The courts intervene there to protect the privilege.",
  "You mention the Fifth Amendment, but I think the important thing is the Fifth Amendment in this context works a -- a bit like the takings clause. And Justice Souter, for the opinion for the Court in Balsys, noted that the self-incrimination privilege is unusual because it's not purely and simply binding on the government. It doesn't say that in all contexts, the government cannot coerce confessions. What it says --",
  "Well, typically those cases have been dealt with on -- on habeas. And what I would say is --",
  "If there's a 1983 suit in that context, I actually don't think a 1983 suit would lie in that context.",
  "I think that's a very good point, Justice Souter, and the Court has also treated in the penalty context --",
  "I don't think so, but I think it would --",
  "-- at least be a better case. But as I was trying to say --",
  "There is a -- there is a -- there -- what there is is there is an ongoing interference with the Fifth Amendment right that the courts will vindicate, but there isn't a complete constitutional violation. And I think the critical distinction is that, as -- as Justice Souter said for the Court in Balsys, the privilege against self-incrimination is not purely and simply binding on the government. The government can compel testimony in exchange for a valid grant of immunity. What it can't do is compel testimony and attempt to use it in a criminal case. And --",
  "No. I don't think that's true. I think that, for one thing, if the person is imprisoned on some basis, that may raise an independent Fourth Amendment violation. There may be other --",
  "And -- and I think that this Court has already clarified in Balsys that what you need for a self-incrimination violation is both the coercion of the testimony and the use of it in a criminal case.",
  "I would say there's no -- there's no damages action. Of course, he could get --",
  "Well, he could get a habeas action to get out because the court would be granting relief --",
  "-- to protect the Fifth Amendment --",
  "Well, in any event, let me just say that the privilege works quite differently in the custodial context. The reason that hypo even comes up is that in the context of a civil trial, the individual has to raise the -- the Self-incrimination Clause themselves. And we have a different rule that operates in the context of police custodial interrogation. In that context, the privilege is self-executing. The individual doesn't have to raise it. And -- as -- the other thing that's different about the custodial context is that in the custodial context, this Court has not insisted on a pre-testimony grant of immunity. They've always held that the exclusionary rules prevent a constitutional violation from occurring. And if I could resort to the analogy to the takings clause. In that context, it's not enough for the government to take property. It's only a constitutional violation if the -- if the government simultaneously takes property and refuses to grant just compensation. In the same way, there's no self --",
  "Yes, and it's the substantive due process protection.",
  "And I think to get back to that point, what's important is in the context of trying to protect the integrity of the criminal trial process, I would think the courts would want to be quite careful about what they let into evidence. But in the context of law enforcement officers, they're dealing with other objectives than simply trying to get a confession to secure a guilty verdict.",
  "It --",
  "I think it should, Justice O'Connor, and I would respectfully suggest that that's best done on remand --",
  "-- because, although there is a due process argument in this case, it's nobody's fault that in light of the -- the governing precedent in the Ninth Circuit, the Cooper decision, that nobody thought that they had to prove shocks-the-conscience, or any of the factors relevant to a substantive due process inquiry. Again, that's not the way respondents briefed the case, but one can hardly blame them for briefing the case they did, given that the Ninth Circuit had held under Cooper that as long as the conduct was sufficiently egregious to have the evidence be inadmissible, therefore you have a full substantive due process violation. And I think it's --",
  "Well, I -- I don't really disagree with him. I think this Court could reach the qualified immunity issue if it wanted to, but I think perhaps the path of least resistance would be to just note that there is a substantive due process limit, and that's something that's best to be resolved on -- on remand. I think the important -- oh, sorry.",
  "No.",
  "Thank you very much.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has repeatedly reaffirmed the Government's authority to protect the public from fraud, even though virtually every representation involves speech. Indeed, while striking down broad prophylactic laws, every time this Court has addressed the issue of charitable solicitation, it has reaffirmed the constitutional viability of individual fraud actions. Now, part of the reason that this Court has distinguished between individual fraud actions and broad prophylactic rules is that an individual fraud action can bring into bear the entire context of a misrepresentation. The difficulty with a statute like that before the Court in Riley was that it necessarily focused on a single factor, fundraising costs, and didn't take into account what was told to individual donors or anything else, and then categorically --",
  "I think that the fundraising costs are part of the analysis of the fraud action, but I wouldn't have read Riley as making that factor wholly immaterial, and I think the important thing is that in the calls in this case, they weren't just saying, we're here to raise money for Vietnam vets. The record suggests that there was an emphasis on particular charitable services. We're raising money for food baskets. We're raising money to help veterans here in DuPage County.",
  "Well, two responses, Your Honor. First of all, since there are these specific misrepresentations in this case, that alone is a reason to reverse the decision, because the Illinois Supreme Court seemed to be laboring under the misimpression that those cases were wholly off-limits because the fundraising percentage --",
  "Absolutely.",
  "So let me bring you to the second part of the question, which is, I think there are problems when you have a situation where the only thing that is said is, we're here to raise money for charity, but I think in reality, you have to give -- you have to trust juries in common law fraud actions a little bit to take into account the broad nature of the representations that are made. The -- the virtue of a fraud action as opposed to a broad prophylactic rule is that a fraud action can take into account the entire mosaic of the representations that are made, and there's no need to focus on one particular tile and see whether it's literally true or literally false.",
  "I -- I think so.",
  "If every --",
  "Because there are other elements of a common law fraud action. You also have to show materiality, and reasonable reliance. If every single person raised --",
  "Because if every single person raising money has had these astronomical fundraising costs, which of course is not true, but if that were true, then a -- an individual donor who recognized that might well not have any reasonable reliance on the representations that money is going to charity, because no -- no charity, apparently, can get any money to the actual services that money is being raised, but that's not true. A very important element of common law fraud that I think can provide sufficient protection to legitimate charities is the intent to deceive, and the intent to deceive I think is going to make a big difference, because if you have a legitimate charity that's asked by a donor what percentage of the money goes to the specific service that you're raising money for, let's say, food baskets, and that charity responds and provides forthcoming information, then I don't see how the prosecution or plaintiff can ever show an intent to deceive. On the other hand --",
  "I -- I think that's right, but I -- I would say --",
  "-- that part of the evidence I'd like to put before the jury on intent to deceive --",
  "-- is when a donor asks that question --",
  "I'm reliably informed that this particular proceeding would go as a bench trial, which I think would provide even further protection for free speech.",
  "I think that -- my answer is in terms of the jury because I do think that the -- the decision that this Court announces is going to affect jury trials as well, but what I'm saying is, I'd like to get before the jury the fact that when these particular fundraisers were asked the question, well, where does the money go, at least the record suggests that they flatly misrepresented where the money --",
  "Well, I would say first that we wouldn't have any objection if you wanted to retreat from what you said in Riley.",
  "But -- but --",
  "No, that is not what you have to do, and I think the important thing is the type of hypo of just all they do is call up and say, I'm here to raise money for charity, what that hypothetical tends to do is force the analysis into the single variable analysis that's reflected in broad prophylactic rules, and the answer in these cases, and I think what the opinion should suggest, is that the context does matter terribly, so to take some of the questions --",
  "-- that concern Justice Breyer, if I could, when he's worried about the start-up charity, well, if a start-up charity says, hi, we're a start-up charity, but we are trying to raise money for a new cause, and here's what we hope to do with the money, that's very different than if a start-up charity picks up the phone and says, we're a start-up charity, and we're going -- if you give us money, we're going to help this particular child in this foreign country. I mean, if a start-up charity avoids fraudulent statements, then that's going to have a reasonable effect on the mind of the donor, and the donor's going to recognize that, okay, a) start-up charities may have higher cost, but more importantly, the representation that I received was not that you were going to provide food baskets in DuPage County, but that you hoped to provide special services that weren't being provided currently by any extant charity, and I think that context can make all the difference. And there are many elements of common law fraud actions. You have to show knowledge of falsity, intent to deceive, materiality, and reasonable reliance. In Illinois, as is typical, you have to show those factors by clear and convincing evidence. All of that is going to provide substantial breathing room for First Amendment values. Indeed, much of this Court's jurisprudence in the libel and defamation area has been a process of taking the requirements of the common law for fraud, which were much more onerous, and superimposing them on the law of libel and defamation, where things like falsity was presumed, and damages could be presumed, upon a showing of defamation, and I think if you put it in that context, that all of the safeguards that this Court has carefully constructed over the years in the libel and defamation context are in place to protect the -- the First Amendment rights and provide breathing room, then I think that the idea that the sky is falling is really mistaken in these cases. And I think to the contrary, if this Court were to suggest in a case where the reality is that not just 85 percent is going to the professional fundraiser, but fully 97 percent is going to something other than program services, because VietNow only spends 20 percent of the money they receive on program services, if this were -- Court were to suggest in this case that there's not a fraud action, then it really will be open season for charitable solicitation fraud. And I think this Court has been particularly concerned about broad prophylactic rules in the First Amendment area. This is reflected in -- in, most critically in its prior restraint doctrine, and that -- that instinct is reflected in Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley, but at the same time, there's a corollary principle, which specific instances of fraud can be prosecuted by the Government, and that instinct is also reflected in Munson, Schaumburg, and Riley, and there's simply nothing in the First Amendment that suggests that charitable solicitation fraud need go unpunished, and with respect, I think what the Illinois Supreme Court did here in creating a broad prophylactic immunity for charitable solicitation from the law of fraud is just as unjustified as the broad prophylactic rules limiting charitable solicitation that this Court struck down in Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley. If there are no further questions --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court's campaign finance cases consistently emphasize the fundamental distinction between contributions and expenditures. Direct transfers of cash to a candidate pose unique risks of the appearance of corruption or the threat of actual corruption while, at the same time, imposing less significant interference with First Amendment values. And so this Court's jurisprudence consistently recognizes that there is less rigorous scrutiny on limitations on contributions relative to limitations on expenditures. The court below lost sight of that fundamental dichotomy. It held that corporations of the type that this Court exempted from the general limitations on corporate expenditures in Massachusetts Citizens for Life were equally exempt from the broad prohibitions on corporate contributions to candidates. That reasoning ignores this Court's decision in Massachusetts Citizens for Life itself, which specifically distinguished between the expenditures and contributions of nonprofit corporations. More fundamentally, the decision below ignores this Court's decision in National Right to Work Committee. There this Court held that the broad limitations on corporate contributions and the specific limitations on solicitation embedded in that broad prohibition were constitutional against a First Amendment challenge.",
  "That's right, Justice Scalia. The court below addressed both an expenditure issue and a prohibition issue with respect to contributions, and the Government only took up the prohibition on contributions. So that is the only issue before the Court. I think it's important, though, to understand that that is a distinction that the court below placed insufficient emphasis on because that is a distinction between contributions and expenditures that underlies the last quarter century of this Court's campaign finance jurisprudence. And in National Right to Work Committee itself, this Court recognized that the broad prohibitions on contributions applied to all corporations, including those like National Right to Work Committee itself that were without great financial resources. Nonetheless, in the particular context of corporate contributions to candidates, this Court held that it would not second guess Congress' decision that a broad, prophylactic approach was necessary when corruption was the evil feared.",
  "Well, I think it would, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and I think that where I would point to first is your dissent in that case because in that case in your dissent, you made the argument that National Right to Work Committee was essentially the same as Massachusetts Citizens for Life. And the majority, in responding to that argument, didn't draw any particular distinction between National Right to Work Committee and Massachusetts Citizens for Life, but rather drew a firm distinction between the level of scrutiny that applies to limitations on contributions and the level of scrutiny that applies to limitations on expenditures. So I would read that decision as saying that the critical distinction is not the differences among the types of corporations with respect to contribution bans, but is the fact that contribution bans are much more readily approved under First Amendment analysis than expenditure bans. And National Right to Work Committee obviously wasn't the last word on that subject. This Court reaffirmed the validity of a broad, prophylactic approach to corporate contributions both in National Conservative Political Action Committee and in Massachusetts Citizens for Life itself. Particularly, in light of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, a ban on corporate contributions by nonprofits does not impose significant burdens on First Amendment interests. In the particular context of this type of corporation, the corporation is free to engage in unlimited spending on elections through the corporate form, and the individual respondents are free to give unlimited contributions to North Carolina Right to Life. In addition and equally important, the individual members of North Carolina Right to Life are free to give contributions to the candidates of their choice up to the constitutionally valid contribution limits. Accordingly, this case doesn't involve the right to associate together or the right to associate with candidates of someone's individual choosing, but only the right to assemble together collectively to give money to candidates of an organization's collective choosing. And even that rather attenuated First Amendment interest is only affected to the extent that a corporation must direct its contributions through a separate segregated fund with enhanced disclosure and reporting and bookkeeping requirements.",
  "Well, certainly in -- in the first point, parties are subject to a different type of regulation under the campaign finance laws. But secondly --",
  "And -- and I don't want to suggest that there's no First Amendment interest on the other side of -- of the argument in this case, but what I did mean to suggest is that interest is less significant than the interest in individuals banding together to make expenditures that they might otherwise not be able to make. And I think even in the party context, this Court recognized that distinction in the Colorado Republican cases where it held that limitations on what the -- the party can spend to support a candidate are not subject to limitation, but what -- but there -- but there are valid limitations on what the party can contribute to a candidate of its choosing. Now, in contrast to the rather minimal First Amendment interests that are interfered with by section 441b, it plays an important role in safeguarding the integrity of the election process. This Court in -- in National Right to Work Committee already has recognized that corporate contributions pose a risk of the reality and appearance of corruption and that a broad, prophylactic limitation on all corporations, including those without great financial resources, is an appropriate response to that threat. All corporations, regardless of their size, also pose risks of circumvention and of undermining the workability of candidate disclosure requirements. As this Court recognized in Cedric Kushner Promotions against King, the whole point of a corporation, its basic purpose and fundamental reason for -- for existing is to create legal separateness between the individuals that form and run the corporation and the artificial corporate entity itself. Giving such an artificial entity the right to contribute in its own name, independent of the individuals that underlie the corporation, obviously poses a distinct risk to a campaign finance system that is based largely on individual contribution limits. Section 441b addresses that risk by requiring that those contributions be made through a segregated fund subject to enhanced bookkeeping and disclosure requirements. Those bookkeeping and disclosure requirements, in turn, make the campaign disclosure forms that individual candidates have to file work in a meaningful fashion. If those candidate disclosure forms simply revealed that the candidate received money from an artificial entity with either an ambiguous name or what this Court in Citizens Against Rent Control v. Berkeley termed a seductive name that tends to conceal the true identity and true source of the funds, then those campaign finance forms -- or disclosure forms will not provide meaningful information. If, on the other hand, 441b makes the underlying corporations use a segregated fund that discloses the individual sources of the contributions, then the disclosure forms can work in a meaningful fashion. I think it bears emphasis, as this Court recognized in Massachusetts Citizens for Life, that the distinction between contributions and expenditures applies with full force in the context of nonprofit organizations. A limitation on expenditures can prevent an organization's members, who might otherwise not have the resources to reach a certain audience, to pool their resources together to reach that audience. There is no comparable function or benefit from the pooling of individual candidate contributions. The individual candidates themselves can perform that pooling function by assembling together candidate contributions of whatever size in order to reach an audience or to engage in political speech. The intermediate pooling function that the nonprofit corporation serves can only benefit by either circumventing the individual contribution requirements or assembling an aggregate contribution of a sufficient size to potentially capture the attention of a candidate for purposes of a quid pro quo. To be sure, the same provisions of the campaign finance laws allow corporations to assemble funds in -- in aggregate amounts through a segregated fund, but only with the additional safeguards that are imposed, including enhanced disclosure requirements. Congress, in adopting section 441b, drew an important distinction between corporations and their ability to contribute and individuals. In the expenditure context, the limitations on corporate expenditures stand in stark contrast to the general right of individuals to engage in unlimited independent expenditures. But no one has a right to engage in unlimited corporate -- in unlimited contributions to candidates. Congress addresses the threat of individual contributions through dollar amounts. It addresses the distinct risks of corporate contributions through the requirement of a segregated fund, higher limits, and enhanced disclosure requirements. Respondents effectively ask this Court to disregard and second guess Congress' decision to treat corporations differently from individuals for purposes of candidate contributions. With respect, I think essentially respondents ask this Court to treat North Carolina Right --",
  "Certainly, Chief Justice Rehnquist. The -- the main difference is that in the context of a segregated fund, all -- both all incoming contributions to the segregated fund and all disbursements must be disclosed.",
  "PACs. I mean, the PACs generally -- there are segregated funds in the particular context of corporations and labor unions.",
  "The donor is listed. There are specific provisions for very small donations where the name only goes to the FEC and is not publicly disclosed. But there's a -- but really, everything that comes in and comes out of the segregated fund is traceable either by the FEC or through the public in disclosure requirements. In the context of the corporation generally, only -- only donations that are given over $200 and for the express purpose of -- of political activity have to be disclosed. And that does create a significant loophole. In the --",
  "Justice O'Connor, it really isn't, at least as this case comes to this Court. The prohibitions on corporate contributions have been in the law since 1907 and have been left completely unaffected by the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act. It is true that certain limitations on electioneering activity, which is a new term introduced into the law by the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act, do apply to corporations. So in considering challenges to the McCain-Feingold legislation, this Court may have to consider the restrictions on corporations engaged in expenditures and these new electioneering activities, but not --",
  "The issue of corporate contributions is miraculously unaffected by the many reforms that are put in place by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.",
  "In the end --",
  "A -- a political action committee or any segregated fund can give $5,000.",
  "There is indeed, Justice Breyer. It's $5,000.",
  "And two points of emphasis just on that question. One is that respondents here don't just have the right to set up a segregated fund, but they've actually already done that. They've already set up a segregated fund. And I know that this Court in Massachusetts Citizens for Life emphasized that there are unique restrictions and burdens on setting up a segregated fund, and I think that's true in the context of expenditures. But I do think it's easy to exaggerate the burdens that are imposed in setting up a segregated fund. Although a segregated fund is like a PAC, there's no requirement that they have separate offices or separate officers. They have to have a distinct leadership and -- and -- but it can be the same leadership as the corporation itself.",
  "I don't know of any particular limit on -- on the members. But the point is all that's really required is segregation of funds and keeping it separate. It's not an onerous requirement. And I think it's no accident that in the four cases that this Court has had that involved a nonprofit corporation, National Right to Work Committee, Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Austin against Michigan Chamber of Commerce, and this case, all four of those nonprofits had already set up segregated funds before the case got to this Court. So I don't think, at least in the contribution context, that those are onerous requirements.",
  "There was. This Court in footnote 8 suggested that that wasn't dispositive of its reasoning because other -- other entities could set -- be in a position that were similar to Massachusetts Citizens for Life, might not be able to afford those burdens. But Massachusetts Citizens --",
  "I don't want to suggest that the -- that it may not be true that the risks are slightly less in the context of a nonprofit advocacy corporation than in the context of something like General Motors. But I think in the particular context of candidate contributions by corporations, this Court has repeatedly decided that it's willing to accept a broad, prophylactic approach and to limit all corporate contributions, including contributions by corporations without great financial resources. The Court said as much in National Right to Work Committee. It repeated that again in National Conservative Political Action Committee, but I think most tellingly, it said that in Massachusetts Citizens for Life itself. And in particular, if you look at footnote 13 of the Massachusetts Citizens for Life decision, the Court there specifically said that it understood that Massachusetts Citizens for Life would continue to be subjected to the National Right to Work Committee regime for purposes of its contributions, and it was talking about the fact that it didn't have -- that Massachusetts Citizens for Life, for example, didn't have shareholders. But it was quick to -- to reinforce that that didn't mean that it didn't have members for purposes of National Right to Work Committee that it could solicit, subject of course to the overall limit that it could not give direct contributions to candidates.",
  "Well, I don't think it's necessarily the holding of the case because, obviously, that case involved expenditures. But I do think that when this Court distinguishes a prior precedent of the Court, that that's not a part of the opinion that a lower court is free to ignore. I think that part of the opinion is critical to the reasoning of the Court and should be given stare decisis effect. And I don't think there's any reason that's been brought to bear here to revisit this Court's distinction in Massachusetts Citizens for Life between contributions and expenditures, which after all, is the fundamental building block of this Court's campaign finance jurisprudence.",
  "I would think that in many respects that's the most important part of the opinion. It's not to say that the Court can't subsequently revisit that part of the opinion. I mean, that's certainly what this Court can do, but I think for purposes of a lower court, anyway, if -- if this Court distinguishes two cases on the ground that the prior case involved a corporation that had less than $10,000 and a subsequent case comes along where there's $9,999 involved, I would think the lower court would be well served to heed the distinction that this Court drew. And I think in this particular context, obviously, this Court is free to reconsider its prior precedents, but I don't think there's any reason to do so. The distinction between contributions and expenditures has proved workable particularly in the context of nonprofit corporations. As I say, this isn't some abstract application of the contribution/expenditure dichotomy that this Court has never considered. Massachusetts Citizens for Life involved a nonprofit corporation and this Court was at pains, pretty much at every step in the Court's reasoning, to distinguish between contributions and expenditures. In the end, I think respondents ask this Court effectively to disregard Congress' decision to treat corporate contributions distinctly from individual contributions. They effectively ask this Court to treat North Carolina Right to Life Incorporated as if it were not incorporated, but there's no reason to disregard either respondents' decision to incorporate or Congress' decision to subject all corporations to the same regime, segregated funds, distinct disclosure requirements, and higher limits, in fact, on their contributions. If there are no further questions, I'll reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me begin with the distinction that respondents rely on between limits on contributions and prohibitions on contributions. Even if there is something to that distinction -- and I rather doubt there is for some of the reasons unearthed by Justice Stevens' colloquy with -- with counsel for respondent. Even if that were a valid distinction, this case does not involve an absolute prohibition. This Court, both in Massachusetts Citizens for Life and Austin, and in fact, much earlier in Pipefitters, made clear that the limitations on corporate and labor union contributions in section 441b are not a, quote, absolute prohibition, but rather just a limitation on contributions. The availability of the segregated funds to make the contributions is another way of making this a limitation, a particular limitation designed for the unique risks of artificial entities like corporations and labor unions. And I think any effort to distinguish the discussion in Massachusetts Citizens for Life and its distinguished -- distinctions between contributions and expenditures on the grounds that a prohibition might be different just doesn't work because both Massachusetts Citizens for Life and National Right to Work Committee involved this very provision, section 441b. So whatever there might be in the case of an absolute prohibition on somebody's right to make contributions, 441b either isn't that or isn't that in -- in a constitutionally relevant way after this Court's decisions in Massachusetts Citizens for Life and National Right to Work Committee. Some discussion was had about fine distinctions that potentially could be drawn between the American Association of Retired Persons, National Right to Work Committee, Massachusetts Citizens for Life, and North Carolina Citizens Right to Life. The point of section 441b in the contribution context is that Congress has not found a need to draw those kind of fine distinctions. MCFL itself, of course, drew some of those distinctions in the contribution context -- in the expenditure context, rather, but drew a distinction between contributions in light of the inherently greater risk of corruption from contributions. Another suggestion was made that perhaps there is a seemingly less restrictive alternative. As with independent expenditures made by nonprofit associations, perhaps contributions that are made to the association with the purpose of them being used for contributions to candidates could be disclosed.",
  "No, and to the contrary. This Court has not held that. It did not apply a least restrictive alternative analysis in National Right to Work Committee. In the California Medical Association case, a plurality of the Court, in fact, affirmatively held that the least restrictive alternative was not required in the context of contributions. So I don't think there is that requirement. But I want to address the -- the supposed less restrictive alternative precisely because I believe that less restrictive alternative is illusory because the suggestion is that -- that individuals could say -- could disclose when they give a contribution to a nonprofit organization for the purpose of a contribution. Well, if that's going to have the effect of avoiding the circumvention rationale, I wonder whether people are really going to volunteer the information that the contribution to the nonprofit is for that purpose. And additionally, even if that is a permissible way and would be enforceable in the real political world, that really doesn't give you much of a different result than what Congress has specifically provided for with the segregated fund. And indeed, the segregated fund actually is responsive to the kind of First Amendment associational interests that underlie this Court's concerns in Buckley and even going back to NAACP against Button. The concern is that disclosure requirements imposed on organizations could be a backhanded way to get at membership lists. The segregated fund prevents that by keeping the membership lists and the organization itself separate from the political activity of the organization. Indeed, if Congress hadn't provided for segregated funds as a requirement for all corporations, but simply made that available, I would think that many nonprofit corporations would avail themselves of that option precisely to avoid the interference with associational interests as in cases like NAACP against Button. The last point I'd like to talk about is simply this idea that again underlies much of respondents' arguments that because there is no threat from expenditures to these types of corporations, there is therefore no threat to these type of corporations engaging in corporate contributions. If that analysis were applied across the board, it would undermine the entirety of this Court's campaign finance jurisprudence which is based on the fundamental recognition that contributions involve greater risks than expenditures, and -- and expenditures, therefore, are largely unregulated because they are -- presumably do not pose as great a risk as contributions. If there are no further questions, I'd like the court below reversed.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: In enacting Title II of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, Congress addressed a problem that's been with us for 100 years, the corrosive and distorting effects of aggregate corporate wealth on candidate elections. In addressing that problem, Congress did not adopt a revolutionary approach, rather, Title II and its requirement that corporations fund electioneering communications through a separate segregated fund simply represents a contemporary chapter in the century-long history of regulation of corporate political giving.",
  "No. There is no question that corporations are very good at aggregating wealth in the corporate --",
  "-- and in commerce, and the concern --",
  "Well, as you say, Congress has long been able to address express advocacy, and what the evidence, the overwhelming evidence before the district court showed is that in a modern political campaign, the express advocacy test no longer works. It no longer is -- it is a woefully inexact proxy for the kind of speech that affects candidate elections that this Court has said corporations must make through segregated, separate segregated fund. This Court has --",
  "First of all, I don't --",
  "Justice Scalia, I don't think it's artificial distinction. In any event, it's not a distinction I'm drawing. It's a distinction that this Court drew in Austin when it distinguished the situation it had before it in Belotti, where it said that a corporation facing an absolute ban, not a separate segregated fund requirement but an absolute ban in participating in a referendum, this Court held that unconstitutional. In Austin, this Court said that limits on express advocacy in the context of a candidate campaign triggered different interests, and in that context, Congress has a legitimate ability to deal with the corrosive and distorting effects of aggregate corporate wealth and the problems with diverting shareholder and member money to political causes with which they disagree.",
  "Well, there are certainly ways to do that, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think what Austin represents incorrectly is the idea that when corporate money is being aggregate for different reasons, that there is an interest on the part of the shareholders not to have that money diverted to political causes with which they disagree. Now, outside of the corporate context, the principle that you are advocating certainly applies. Individuals are able to advocate unpopular causes with their money and that is not a concern of Title II, but in the corporate context this Court has drawn a distinction, and that's not a distinction this Court just drew in the Austin decision. It's one that goes through this Court's decisions. It goes, and it starts really from the Tillman Act in 1907 which recognized that corporations are different. Corporations posed unique risks of corruption, so in 1907, corporations and corporations alone were barred from making contributions to candidates. Then in 1947, that ban was extended to expenditures, and in Austin, this Court quite correctly held up that as constitutional because of the unique risks of the corporate context and what the evidence before the district court showed is all of those same interests that applied in Austin to express advocacy equally apply to these kind of electioneering communications.",
  "That's exactly right. That is safe, Justice Souter, and that's why all of the evidence before the district court that looks at retrospective ads running previous cycles has to be read in the light that one of the virtues of the clarity with which Title II defines electioneering communications is that a corporation can avoid the trigger and that similar to current law, under current law as we pointed out in our brief, the NRA put together two ads in the 2000 election cycle. They were virtually identical, except one of them finished with the tag line, vote for Bush. Now, the",
  "Well, let's, Justice O'Connor, let's take the McCain-Feingold provision, for example. Now, first of all, one option, of course, is to refer to it the way I have, as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. It's important to remember, however, that the restrictions in this bill don't restrict any corporation from talking about the McCain-Feingold bill in 48 states or in fact all 50, as long as Senators McCain and Senator Feingold are not up for election. Now, at the point that somebody wants to make a reference to the McCain-Feingold, to one of those Senators' voters in the immediate days running up to the election then they may not be referring to it in a way that has nothing to do with the election. They may be referring to it as that no good McCain-Feingold legislation, and it may clearly have an electioneering purpose.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, we start from the same proposition, which that distinction no longer holds up as a practical matter of political reality. Now, I fear you may take the conclusion from that that we should just end this whole enterprise, but we take from that the conclusion that Congress is not disabled from addressing the serious problems that this Court found that it could address in Austin.",
  "I don't think so, Justice --",
  "No, it's not, Justice Kennedy. Just because the campaign finance laws need to be adjusted from time to time doesn't mean there are no limits and if you are looking for a limit in keeping the distinction between this Court's decision and Belotti and this Court's decision in Austin, one clear limit is a reference to a candidate, because that is one thing that clearly identifies an ad as being tied to the interests of the candidate election cycle.",
  "Certainly not, Justice Kennedy. What we want to have this Court do is write an opinion that upholds a limitation on corporate and union spending from direct treasury funds that reflects the current reality. I can't tell you whether the decision that you would, that such a decision upholding this legislation would still work 25 years from now, but I can tell you that it will work in the near term. And this Court has said, for example, in footnote 11 in Massachusetts Citizens for Life, that particularly in the First Amendment area, Congress doesn't have to anticipate every problem. It can respond to the observed realities and the observed problems before it and try to address those and that's what Congress did with this provision. As you say, the express advocacy test no longer works. The candidates themselves, who have absolutely no regulatory incentive to avoid express advocacy, still themselves don't make reference, don't make their pleas in those express terms.",
  "With all respect, Justice Scalia, that's a formula for surrender in response to what is clearly a problem that Congress has been wrestling with for the most part successfully for a hundred years, which is the corrosive and distorting effects of corporate wealth on candidate elections.",
  "Justice Breyer, the simple answer is you were right all along. The separate --",
  "The separate segregated fund requirement is not an undue burden on corporate political activity. This is, after all, not the first case that this Court has dealt with the separate segregated fund requirement. And of course the requirement was made in Austin as well that, oh, my, if we have to use the separate segregated fund, that will be impossible. The Court rejected that argument there and Justice Brennan in his concurrence addressed it and made two very good points. First, in footnote 7, he said that that just doesn't reflect the observed reality, that the Michigan Chamber of Commerce there was very successful in raising funds for its PAC. At that time, success was measured $140,000. It seems quaint because what this record says is that the NRA in the Political Victory Fund was able to raise $17 million just for its PAC.",
  "No, that was a concurrence that reflected the views of the majority.",
  "No, they didn't, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think that it is certainly -- I'm not suggesting that it binds this Court in any way. I'm just suggesting that Justice Brennan's logic in addressing that problem has persuasive force. It is true also that the majority opinion of Justice Marshall in that case, also noted, described the Michigan Chamber of Commerce in that case as being quite successful in its PAC. And also specifically said in the majority opinion that they were success as -- to the tune of $140,000. That Justice Brennan amplified that point in his concurrence.",
  "The Court could certainly say that, Justice Breyer, and I think should say that. The remarkable thing about the challenge to the separate segregated fund requirement here, if I understand it, is that the gravamen of the concern seems to be that the solicitation restrictions on the separate segregated fund make it difficult to raise enough money. Now, the reason I find that so surprising is there was a direct challenge to those solicitation requirements before this Court in the National Right to Work Committee case. And this Court unanimously rejected that challenge. So the solicitation requirements and the separate segregated fund, which by the way were not changed by BCRA and therefore really probably aren't even jurisdictionally before this Court, those -- if somebody has a problem with the solicitation requirements either on their face or as applied, that's open to them in an as-applied challenge.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, the consequence is entirely speculative on this record. As I say, some groups even under the current system have been able to assemble massive amounts of money in their political action committees. And that is remarkable if for no other reason that as Justice Kennedy pointed out, it's sort of no reason to do it under the current system, because one of the main reasons to put money in your political action fund was so that you could engage in express advocacy rather than issue advocacy.",
  "Justice Scalia, with respect, this issue is no different than the parallel issue in the context of Austin. That was speech, too. That was a burden of speech. And as some of the Justices pointed out, there is not one word in Buckley or in Austin that suggests that express advocacy is somehow second class speech. Indeed, there is no higher protected speech than vote for Bush or vote for Gore, yet nonetheless, the restrictions there were upheld by the Court and there were not --",
  "Very well, Justice Scalia, but I'll take the five to four. And many of the arguments that are being raised in opposition to this statute are the arguments of the dissenters in Austin, not the arguments of the majority opinion in Austin. And I think that's an important point. This Court has approved the same basic mechanism in the context of express advocacy. It has worked well perhaps not with the definition of express advocacy, but has worked well in terms of the separate segregated fund requirement. The other point I think that has to be made about the separate segregated fund requirement is that the idea that, okay, let's say that we now have meaningful limits so there are going to be some real incentives to put some money in your political action committee or your separate segregated fund. One of two things can happen. With some organizations, it may very well turn out that some of the people who were members of the overall organization, turns out they really weren't 100 percent interested in supporting the political causes of that organization. They sort of like some of the other benefits of membership. And in that case, the amount of money that would be raised will be reduced. In some other organizations, it may be that every member of the organization supports the political cause and they give the money to the separate segregated fund. In either event, the purposes of the separate segregated fund are fully vindicated because the resulting corporate political activity at that point will reflect the views of the underlying membership and the underlying union members, which is precisely what this Court said was a compelling interest in Austin.",
  "There is certainly a large body of state law about corporate waste that is, if I remember it from law school, fairly impenetrable and doesn't provide a lot of specific guidance in particular consequences, in particular cases. But I would say that that same issue again was raised in Austin, and this Court said that it was not sufficient simply to leave everything to the state law of waste, where you have the business judgment rule, and everything's set up to make sure that no corporation is ever held liable. This Court said that in this particular context, it was much more appropriate to use the separate segregated fund requirement which has been part of the law and functionally since 1947 --",
  "Well, I think again, Justice Scalia, the resort I would take is to the Austin decision, which rejected that argument as well. And it did so on the basis that candidate elections are different than other situations. It may be a bit of an affront for a shareholder to have their money spent on an issue that they don't particularly care for, or to have the corporation go into some new line of business that the shareholder thinks, boy, that's really not very smart, you should stick with what you know best. That's an affront. But it's a much greater affront to have that individual's money spent on candidate elections where that individual does not agree with the position that the corporation has taken. And let me just add --",
  "I thought that's the position you were taking earlier, because I think there is a sense in which any time -- if you're talking about ads within 60 days from election that are targeted to a candidate's home district then I think -- and mention that candidate, I think it's a safe assumption to be made that they at least have a mixed motive. And one of the motives is to influence the candidate election. And I think if the corporate consciously decides to link its issue up to a candidate election, then it's a perfectly appropriate response to make that corporation funded through a separate segregated fund.",
  "That's right. And this Court took a different step over the Chief Justice, among others' dissents and said no, we're going to invalidate that traditional approach. But then in Austin, this Court drew an important distinction between the candidate election context and the issue context. I was talking a minute ago about the mixed motives and I did want to be responsive to a question that Justice Souter had asked earlier, which is this question about in the specific studies that Congress and the district court discussed, was mixed motive an option for the people that were scoring the ads. And as a matter of fact, it was not. The students were asked whether or not the issue in the particular ad had a tendency to support or go against a candidate, or if it addressed an issue. There was no mixed motive box, and I think the net effect of that is that whatever overbreadth is estimated by the studies, it actually overstates the overbreadth because it didn't account for the mixed motive case. And as I say, I think the mixed motive case does reflect the reality in a number of situations. But I do think that the point that a corporation makes that conscious decision to link some controversial issue to a candidate election, at that point, the interest that this Court found sufficient in Austin are fully implicated.",
  "Again, and the safe harbors that we talked about earlier are still available in that situation. And they are, as Justice Breyer pointed out, twofold. One, if all the corporation is really concerned about is a pending legislative issue, it doesn't need to make a reference to the candidate and it can run the issue through treasury funds. On the other hand, if they want to make a specific reference to the candidate, tie that legislative issue to the broader context of the campaign, then they're free to do so as long as they do so through their separate segregated fund.",
  "Well, first of all, Justice Scalia, as I understand the media exemption, it applies to the media corporation but not necessarily to the entire corporation, so I don't think --",
  "I don't know about that. What I do know is that media corporations are exempted for the same reason they've always been exempted from the law, which is that they do pose a different situation, a difference of kind. And this Court --",
  "I mean, I think the traditional role of media companies has been quite different than the traditional role of other companies.",
  "Well, I don't know. I've been focused on this area for the last couple of weeks, Justice Kennedy, and the case that comes to mind is Austin, where the Michigan statute before this Court --",
  "I love Austin. It's binding precedent. I don't, I mean, as much as the plaintiffs don't seem to like the case, I don't really hear them asking this Court to overrule it.",
  "I know it is, Justice --",
  "Yes. I don't think that particular provision --",
  "Right. But it was brought into full focus in the Austin case, and the argument was made there, as it's made here, that the statute is somehow underinclusive because it doesn't include media corporations, and I -- it is a difficult issue, I will admit, but I think this is an area where sometimes it is just as much a problem to treat different entities the same as it is to treat similar entities differently.",
  "I think the difference is that because of the traditional role of what a media corporation does, there is, there's an inherent involvement in the political process. This Court recognized that, I think at least implicitly in Mills against Alabama, when you had a situation where there was an effort to apply a statute to a newspaper, and I think because of the role of the media, there is a recognition that a different rule should apply to the media, and again, this is -- this is no revolution in the, in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. This is just carrying through --",
  "Well, there certainly is the similarity in the sense that they're both addressing the same issue, but I do think that again this Court has drawn that distinction in the Austin case and Congress has drawn that distinction throughout its campaign finance reform. This is not some new provision.",
  "I think the under --",
  "Oh, absolutely they can, and I think if what you're talking about is running an issue about the slanted press, I can't imagine how that has to refer to a candidate, so I think you come within both safe harbors that are available to corporations. They could do it through a separate segregated fund, but again, if what a corporation wants to do is correct some nasty publication that's been running some media corporation, they are perfectly free to do that with treasury funds and it's, it's harder for me to imagine how that would be translated into the context of a candidate election.",
  "I don't. I know there are cases that address --",
  "Right.",
  "Well, this Court has talked in various cases, Mills against Alabama is one, about the freedom of the press, and suggesting maybe that adds something, but I don't think there is a case that draws that definitive distinction, but again, this is a little bit different. This is not saying that the Freedom of the Press Clause, although that has been raised in this litigation obliquely, that the Freedom of Press Clause is what makes the difference. What makes the difference here is a legitimate decision by Congress to treat these different corporations differently, and again, I know you don't want to hear me say it, but the Austin Court heard the argument, it said that that argument is invalid. And I don't think --",
  "No, I think that's exactly right. It reflects that historical tradition. It also reflects the reality that applying this kind of limitation to the press would make it very difficult for them to report anything.",
  "No. That can't be done, and in --",
  "I'm sure that law would be challenged. There might be a defense that you could try to make on the law, but the point I'd like to make is that I think that this effort is just another effort to say that Congress is powerless in this field, because all the problems you are raising about electioneering communication and how you treat the press differently apply a fortiori I to express advocacy.",
  "I think --",
  "I think what you are saying is that contrary to this Court's decisions in Austin, in MCFL, in all the corporate, in all the cases dealing with contributions, that the First Amendment holds the Congress powerless to deal with this problem. And that is what this Court's cases say.",
  "No. What would be an astounding proposition is in light of the 100-year tradition of Congress' ability to regulate the influence of corporate political activity and corporate influence on political elections if all they can do is limit express advocacy or as I understand some members of this Court, they can't even do that. That is a very difficult position to swallow because Congress has been active in this field since 1907. The abuses that they are addressing today are not different in kind from the abuses they have addressed for the past 100 years, and I simply don't think that they are powerless to deal with this situation.",
  "No. That's a very good point, and there are differences with respect to broadcast media, and I think if I can digress for a minute to talk about some of the other provisions like Section 305, 311, and 504 --",
  "Well, I think with respect to some of the other provisions, 504, 307, I'm sorry, 305 and 311, I do think that this Court's cases suggesting that broadcast media are subjected to a different regulatory regime remain good law, and I think that there is certainly enough in this case without trying to revisit Red Lion or some of these other cases. I think one of the things that can happen in this case and one of the unfortunate by products of the en masse nature of the way this case is litigated is that you look at some of the provisions that are dealing with a very different type of speech, and then you get to Section 504 and you take a look at the broad terms that Congress has used and it's easy to reach the conclusion that that's an impermissible approach and those words are too broad, but that ignores the reality of the way the broadcast industry has been regulated. That's, after all, an industry that continues to be regulated on a public interest standard. In CBS against FCC, this Court upheld a statute that required individual stations to give reasonable time to candidates and it's within that background that a provision, the kind of provisions that Congress added to Section 504 are not --",
  "I don't think in the CBS case that the court specifically addressed the scarcity rationale. It may well have been building on prior precedents, though, that were based on that. One other point I'd --",
  "But that's the way that the media has long been regulated, which is to say that with respect to requests for candidate advertisement, with requests to address a, quote, controversial issue of public importance, which is the pre-existing law, nothing added by BCRA, there has been a requirement that if you make a request for air time, that the station do some record-keeping in conjunction with that and that's exactly what 504 carries over.",
  "I think one of the reasons, Justice O'Connor, is so that they could enforce the public interest standard, which has, which has manifested itself not only in the fairness doctrine, but also with the idea that stations have to give appropriate amounts of time to things like discussion of legislative issues. And so if you have the requests before you, you can then make a judgment as to whether or not one station is denying all the requests.",
  "Well, it depends on which provision that you are asking about, Justice --",
  "In 504, what triggers the disclosure, the disclosure requirements is, is a request and again --",
  "I'm not positive about this. I don't think that Section 504 has that kind of advance notice principle to it. The advance notice objections that have been raised have been raised to Sections 201 and 214, and I think with respect to those provisions, it's important and worthwhile to note that the FC -- the FEC has cured the advance notice issue by regulation, and what people seem to have focused on is the idea that the statute requires the disclosure of a contract to disburse, and that language is not designed to get at advanced disclosure in the sense of advanced disclosure before the ad airs. It's simply to get away with, to avoid the clear circumvention that would happen if somebody could buy ads on credit and then only disclose them after the fact, after the election when they had actually made the disbursement at that point. I think --",
  "I mean, I think that's right, but again, that is the way that the FEC has interpreted the provisions, which is to say there is no advance disclosure requirement under 201 and 214 as interpreted by the FEC, because they trigger to the definition of, for example, in 201 the electioneering communication and you don't even know for sure that it's an electioneering communication until it's in fact it is run in the relevant district that's been targeted and all the like, so in that sense I do think that the FEC has cured any problem with advance notice. I'm not sure it was that much of a problem in any event because what you are talking about is forcing people to disclose the fact that they made binding contracts. I think it's also --",
  "Again --",
  "No, again, what contracts to makes disbursement, or I don't know what language you have in front of you, but contracts to make disbursement.",
  "Again, as I was explaining to Justice O'Connor, that provision is necessary to avoid the phenomenon where somebody contracts to make a disbursement, i.e., buys an ad on credit and doesn't make the disbursement until after the ad is run or in fact after the election, so that's why that's in there. It's also worth noting that the statute --",
  "No, it doesn't fall within the con -- the disclosure provision. I suppose if you buy $10,000 worth of ads on credit that does become an expenditure the second you make that credit purchase, but I don't think that renders a statute unconstitutional. I think again it bears noting that this advance sort of contract to purchase language has been in the statute all along. It was in FECA with respect to expenditures. In fact, I believe that Justice Souter made note of that in footnote one.",
  "It depends on the nature of the challenge with respect, Justice Scalia. If the nature of the challenge that a provision is vague and in fact a very similar provision has been in the statute for 20 years and the regulated parties working with the FEC in the context of 504 have figured out how to live with it in a way that doesn't have any chilling effects, then I think the fact that there was a statutory prerequisite for it is quite important and is valid and a valid basis for interpreting the statute. If I may say in closing as I said before, I think the counsel of the other side in this case is that, to borrow Justice Scalia's phrase, this problem is insoluble. They fully admit that the express advocacy test doesn't work. I think it is not a proxy for speech designed to influence candidate elections. I think one thing we can trust candidates to do is to make speeches that are designed to influence their own elections, yet almost 90 percent of candidates' own advertisements don't use words of express advocacy. The remarkable thing about plaintiffs here is that in the first, in the first, this morning we heard a little bit from Mr. Starr about less restrictive alternatives. You hear not one word about that this afternoon because they offer nothing as an alternative. They say it's express advocacy or nothing, and they are all too willing to abandon even express advocacy and I simply do not think that the Constitution leaves Congress powerless to deal with this problem. Strict scrutiny is not a formula for corruption. When Congress is dealing with this kind of corporate spending, a problem they have been wrestling with since 1907, they can take reasonable steps like Title II to address the problem. If there are no further questions.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A policy -- a mutual policy of refusing to rehire individuals previously terminated for serious misconduct does not constitute disparate treatment for purposes of the Americans with Disabilities Act even as applied to an individual previously discharged for drug- related misconduct. The policy does not single out people who are addicted or those who test positive for drugs for disfavorable treatment. The policy treats all serious misconduct, whether drug-related or not, the same. As a result, an individual who is refused re- employment pursuant to that policy is simply not subject to disparate treatment because of their disability.",
  "Justice O'Connor, in our brief we suggested that it would be possible to grant summary judgment for the employer here on this record. I have to confess, though, that that issue is of considerable less importance to the Government than the broader validity of this rule. One thing I -- I'll address why we think summary judgment might be appropriate, but I want to emphasize, though, that even if the Court thinks that summary judgment is not appropriate here, the proper disposition would be to vacate and remand. But it's very important to vacate the opinion because the theory of the Ninth Circuit, if you can divine one here, is that, all right, there's a pretextual case for discrimination and the employer comes in and says, we didn't discriminate on the basis of disability. We applied a neutral, across-the-board rule. And as I read the Ninth Circuit opinion, what they say is that neutral rule is not a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for your employment action. And they -- they do that as a matter of law, and that is a profoundly wrong decision as a matter of law, especially in a disparate treatment case because Justice Stevens suggested that maybe you could have a reasonable accommodation theory but that's not in this case. It is possible that the language of 42 U.S.C. 12112(b)(6), which embodies the Americans with Disabilities Act disparate impact principles, could be used to challenge the neutral policy. But whatever else is true, when an employer applies a neutral policy, it has not engaged in disparate treatment on the basis of disability. Now, if I can get back to the summary judgment question. I think there's two reasons why we thought summary judgment was -- would be appropriate for the employer. One is as suggested by Mr. Phillips. In footnote 17, after the court of appeals finishes with its pretext analysis, it seems to suggest that there's really no dispute that both sides agree that this policy was invoked. And I think in -- in looking through the lower court record, it doesn't seem like the gravamen of the respondent's case was that the policy doesn't exist. It was more a -- a suggestion that whether or not you have a policy, as to me in particular that's not the reason for the discharge, and the best evidence of that, of course, is the letter that George Medina sent to the EEOC.",
  "Yes, the best evidence that the plaintiff has is that letter to the EEOC from Mr. Medina. And, of course, that letter suggests that it was more complicated than simply application of a neutral policy, and it's for that reason that the EEOC issued a -- a cause to sue letter. Unfortunately, though, Mr. -- Mr. Medina was not the ultimate decision maker in this case. That was Joanne Bockmiller. And the record is clear -- and this is at joint appendix 51a and then 64a. It's clear that Ms. Bockmiller did not participate in the preparation of that Medina letter.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that's not the way I read this Court's decision in Anderson against Liberty Lobby, which seems to suggest that simply the possibility that the jury will not disbelieve testimony even if there's no other evidence that draws that testimony into question --",
  "-- it's not enough.",
  "And I think that if the Medina -- certainly if Medina were the decision maker or even one of the decision makers in this case --",
  "They certainly did, but the -- the facts of this case are that Bockmiller was the ultimate decision maker. And in Hazen Paper, this Court suggested that in these kind of disparate treatment cases, what you're looking for is if --",
  "I think that's correct, Justice Ginsburg, but at the end of the day, he just wasn't the decision maker. I think, though, I -- I've made our position clear, which is when you have a case where there's an ultimate decision maker who suggests a neutral policy was involved, our position would be a -- a straight statement by somebody who was not involved in -- directly in the decision making process shouldn't preclude summary judgment. I do want to be clear, though, that that really is the less important issue for the -- from the Government's perspective because the Ninth Circuit's decision in this case does embody the position that this kind of neutral policy, assuming it exists for a moment, is somehow per se unlawful as applied to drug addicts. And I think, again as Justice Stevens suggested, there may be ways that a plaintiff could try to go after such a neutral policy. They could suggest that it -- that under a reasonable accommodation theory, a reasonable accommodation must be given. But if that were brought forward, I think an employer would have an opportunity to say, no, that reasonable accommodation imposes an undue hardship. In similar fashion -- and I would say this. I think if you look at the statute as a whole, the provision of the statute that most specifically speaks to a neutral qualification criteria that is alleged to have a disparate impact on individuals with a disability is -- is 42 U.S.C. 12112(b)(6).",
  "No, that was not raised.",
  "They --",
  "No, that was never addressed in the lower courts.",
  "You don't have to get in, and we would suggest that you not definitively resolve the reasonable accommodation issue or the disparate impact theory. But that doesn't mean that it's sort of harmless error if the Ninth Circuit opinion stays on the book because the Ninth Circuit assumes that the answer to the question on reasonable accommodation is that you could never justify such a policy. You'd always have to grant a reasonable accommodation. The Ninth Circuit opinion assumes that there would be a disparate impact even when there's not or even if the employer could justify the policy as job-related and consistent with business necessity. I wanted to be responsive to Justice Stevens' question, though, even though I think this Court should ultimately not reach it. With respect to reasonable accommodation, there's no question that reasonable accommodation applies in the application process. And so if you have -- for example, if you're going -- an employer wants to give a application test for the job, and puts it in a facility that's not wheelchair accessible, that reasonable accommodation would have to be given, and that would be a reasonable accommodation in the hiring process. I do think, though, that subsection (b)(6) addresses very directly a neutral qualification standard that's alleged to screen out an individual with a disability or to tend to screen out an individual with a disability. And with respect to that claim, that would trigger the employer's burden to come forward and show that the requirement was job-related and consistent with business necessity. One of the real sort of ironies, if you will, of the Ninth Circuit's opinion is on the same page of the opinion and in consecutive footnotes, after they -- they clearly hold that the disparate impact theory is not in this case, they also fault the employer for not justifying the neutral rule as consistent with business necessity. But the business necessity defense, as its status as a defense, suggests is not some sort of free-floating obligation on the employer, especially in a disparate treatment case where the employer has already pointed to a neutral and legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for their actions. The business necessity defense comes into a case when a plaintiff has properly preserved a claim under subsection (b)(6) and triggers the obligation of the employer to come through. I would like to also point out, though, that we largely agree with Mr. Phillips that there is -- there is much in 42 U.S.C. 12114(c)(4) that suggests that there may be a basis for an employer to maintain this kind of neutral policy, and I think an employer may be able to use that section as a defense. I would agree with Justice Stevens that it doesn't speak directly to this situation because all it does is allow -- with respect to current drug users who aren't entitled to any protection under the act, it clarifies that an employer can apply a neutral qualification standard, and it doesn't matter whether the underlying misconduct has its roots in -- in drug use or drug addiction. And I think it doesn't directly say it, but implicit in that provision is the idea that an employer can use uniform and neutral sanctions for violations of those uniform conduct rules. The difficult question becomes whether or not there's something special about a bar on re-employment, when you say that if you violate our conduct rules not only are you terminated, but you need never darken our door again. And I think with respect to that kind of policy, there are two -- the act, in a sense, points in two different directions. On the one hand, the act draws a clear distinction between current drug users who are -- who are not protected by the act and draws a distinction between recovered addicts who are protected by the act. In --in any event, the Court can reconcile those competing policies in a subsequent case.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Absent an affirmative defense, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of age against members of the protected class and is not limited to claims brought by the older members of the class.",
  "There's no affirmative defense in the statute, Justice Stevens, and let me address those hypotheticals, because I think these seemingly benevolent instances of using age may be beguiling, but I think in reality even those benevolent uses of age implicate the interests and concerns of the Age Act. Take, for example, an employer who's willing to exempt employees over 50 from a physical fitness test. Well, the first question I would ask is, if you're willing to exempt workers over 50 from the physical fitness test, is the physical fitness test really a legitimate occupational qualification? And should that be used to exclude workers between 40 and 50 from the workplace?",
  "Justice Ginsburg, it seems to me that stereotypes that older workers are going to be more strained and can't work as hard and need time off are precisely the stereotypes the Act is designed to prohibit. Now, it's different if a worker -",
  "Justice Ginsburg, 1625.2(b) is limited to benefits, and Charles Shaner, who's the general counsel of the EEOC at the time that the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act was passed, explained that the statutory affirmative defense that would be implicated here on remand, 623(f)(2)(B)(i), is a simplification of that regulatory defense. And I think what the Act as a general matter does is it recognizes that benefits are more difficult because it's tied up with issues of retirement age and the like, and so a more flexible approach is necessary with respect to benefits. But with respect to core employment, hiring, firing, promotion, and compensation, the Act reflects a judgement, as stated in the purpose, that they want to promote the employment of older people on the basis -",
  "I - I think that's right. Unless this Court were, I mean, if this Court has a - has a very flexible view of age in the prohibition, I suppose it could allow the agency to adopt a flexible affirmative defense along the lines of Weber. Let me also -",
  "Let me also say that the statute specifically gives the EEOC, in 29 U.S.C. 628, the regulatory authority to make exemptions, and I think if there are specific concerns with particular practices that seem benevolent and are benevolent, then the EEOC can make a regulatory exemption. But with respect to these seemingly benevolent -",
  "29 U.S.C. 628. It's in the statutory appendix, I believe at page 4a, and that - and that is - that is a sweeping authority. It gives the EEOC both the authority to make interpretive regulations and substantive exemptions from the statute.",
  "Well, I think, as I said, if - I think that - that the Act is perfectly consistent with the idea that these stereotypes should play no role. The purpose clause of the statute says it wants to promote the employment of older workers, but how does it say it wants to promote the employment of older workers? By having them judged on their ability rather than age. And I think it reflects a judgement that an employer that has age in mind and not ability when trying to favor an older worker is not going to be able to reverse the process when they're working to the detriment of a worker.",
  "I - I think that's right, Justice Breyer, but what's -",
  "Two responses, Justice Breyer. First -",
  "First, I think that the natural human instinct to favor an older worker would be to cut a break to a worker who's been with the company many years, and if that's what an employer wants to do, it's perfectly free under the Age Act to say, if you've been with us 30 years or 20 years, we're going to cut you a break. To the extent that's not the motivation, but it's purely age- based, then there is an indication in the statutory history, and that indication is the colloquy between Senators -",
  "Well, the colloquy is not at all ambiguous.",
  "Justice Scalia, all I can tell you is that -",
  "Justice Scalia, I can tell you this. The same number of people heard that colloquy as heard the colloquy that this Court relied on between the same two Senators in interpreting the Age Act in Betts and in United Airlines against McMann. On two occasions this Court has recognized that those two Senators have important views on the Age Act because they were the principal sponsors and the floor managers of the bill, and as the icing on the cake, the Court relied on Senator Javits again in the Criswell case. But -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I don't know the exact number of times, but I know there is a pending exemption right now that's been - that's been promulgated -",
  "There - there are, Mr. Chief Justice, and the one that they're working on now is to give employers greater flexibility to coordinate their retirement benefits with Medicare benefits in response to a Third Circuit decision in the Erie County case -",
  "- so that's not just statutory authority that's never been used.",
  "Justice Stevens, there's one time where they did enforce it and that was a full committee proceeding. The decision was circulated to the full commission, so that is a binding decision on the commission.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, but there are only a handful of examples that go the other way and with - I think it's important to understand that with respect to the entire universe of EEOC decisions, as opposed to Department of Labor decisions, there's this one decision that comes up in a non-benefits context where they apply the regulation. There are three other decisions that come up in a benefits context -",
  "That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. That's exactly what the Senate colloquy said that - and that colloquy was picked up in the regulation, which is a binding regulation with notice and comment rule-making.",
  "Right. There would be -",
  "Right.",
  "No. It said there would be discrimination whichever way the decision went, and I don't think that's all that unusual. I mean, anytime in the Title VII context that you have an employee who's fired for sex or race -",
  "- somebody will sue.",
  "I - I think, Justice Stevens, you could have a presumption or a stereotype that older workers are going to be better. I suppose it's also true that you could have a situation where, for some other benefits reason, an older worker wasn't going to have as many benefits or would get paid less -",
  "Justice Scalia, the statute, when it was originally enacted, had the protected class only between 40 and 65, so I don't think the fact it's - now only has a lower bound tells you anything in particular about the prohibition.",
  "And I thought you said it well for the Court in the Consolidated Coin case that this is not a statute about protecting individuals against the burden of being over 40 or to protect against over-40ism. It protects people in the protected class, which is crystal- clearly defined to be individuals over 40, from discrimination because of age. The Act doesn't care if the worker in the protected class who loses out is the younger of the two. The Act is triggered whenever an individual in the protected class loses out because of his or her age. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Unlike Title I of the ADA, which regulates states as employers and treats public and private employers alike, Title II of the ADA focuses on states and state governments as governments in their distinct role as providers of public services. As a result, Congress focused specifically on the conduct of state and local officials rather than simply extrapolating from the experience of private employers. Equally important, Congress in the statutory findings and legislative reports, the same reports this Court found lacking in the Garrett case because they did not include specific findings of public sector discrimination in employment, those same findings and reports found persistent discrimination in such critical areas as access to public services and voting. Moreover, as this Court -",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I think that brings us to the second important distinction between Title I and Title II, which is because -",
  "Well, and - and -",
  "And again, Justice Scalia, I think the problem in Garrett, when this Court saw findings of discrimination in an area like employment discrimination, that's governed by rational basis review, then there's very little reason to think that the small \"d\", if you will, discrimination Congress found resulted in unconstitutional discrimination. But because Title II focuses on government services, many of which implicate fundamental rights, there's every reason to believe that when government - when - when the Congress found - take voting for example - discrimination in voting, that they were actually finding unconstitutional discrimination in voting, because voting and access to polling places triggers fundamental rights and heightened scrutiny. And as this Court recognized in -",
  "- in the Hibbs case, when -",
  "Title I and Title II?",
  "They - they passed at the same time.",
  "I think whatever way they were using discrimination, I think that that finding of discrimination is going to be much more likely to be correlated with actual constitutional violations in an area that implicates fundamental rights. And I think when there's a specific finding in the text of the legislation itself of discrimination in voting, I think it's very likely, given the heightened scrutiny that applies to voting -",
  "In - in some cases, Mr. Chief -",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, let me say the - the relevant congressional committee heard testimony of individuals that were turned away from the voting place on - on election day, so there is that kind of evidence. Now, I can't articulate for you how many instances of that there were.",
  "Turned away because there was no elevator, turned away because -",
  "If - if the voting official tells the individual, we - you can't vote here, because this -",
  "- this is not accessible -",
  "Right. If he tells them -",
  "With respect, I think maybe you'd need to know more, but if the individual in the polling place is turning people away because of their disability and they're not offering, don't worry, we have a school down the road that is accessible, that's not the facts. They're saying, you can't vote, I'm sorry, we don't have the facilities. I think that would state a constitutional violation.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there was testimony of individuals, I don't have the exact number, and -",
  "I - I think it was anecdotal evidence, and I would say - I mean, to give you a feel for the - the - the sort of order of magnitude, in the state task force reports that Congress authorized, there were 35 instances of inaccessible voting places. Now, I can't tell you the breakdown of how many of those involved people refused at the door and how many of those involved simply physical barriers. But I do think it shows that there was a significant problem in this area.",
  "And again, Justice Scalia, I think that when you couple an inaccessible voting place with local officials who are saying, you can't vote today, we don't have any facilities for you, that does violate the Constitution.",
  "I - I guess I fail to understand the difference in that in a practical way.",
  "And I think this Court has said on a number of occasions, in areas of fundamental rights, it is simply not true that only intentional discrimination of the kind you have in mind would violate the Constitution. In the access to court context, in particular, this Court's decision in M.L.B against S.L.J. suggests that in many instances in order to avoid unconstitutional discrimination, the courts have to waive filing fees of indigent defendants or indigent individuals trying to provide their constitutional right. If that's true in areas of fundamental rights, it's not clear why - why state officials don't have some obligations under the Constitution itself to make accommodations for individuals with disabilities.",
  "Justice Stevens, I think one example might be enough, especially when coupled by other evidence in the record that is reinforcing and suggestive of the problem, especially when coupled with judicial decisions that we provide in appendix A of our brief. If you put all that evidence together, it's clear that Congress was reacting to a real problem in this context.",
  "That's true, Justice Scalia. And let me say two things in response. First of all, I think Congress was entitled, once it found a problem in areas of fundamental rights, to say that it's permissible prophylaxis to - to provide a remedy for a broader array of government services.",
  "Well, if I could respond to that, I don't think it's that there's no conceivable constitutional rights involved. Even in areas that don't implicate fundamental rights, this Court itself has found a constitutional violation in the disability context in a case like Cleburne. And I think if Congress finds that states are engaging in unconstitutional discrimination in areas implicating fundamental rights, that may lead to an inference that they're simply not turning off the switch when they get into other areas.",
  "I - I don't think standing alone, Mr. Chief Justice, it would, and I think I would defend that in part as part of the permissible prophylaxis of the statute. If I could say -",
  "Well, I guess -",
  "In fairness, Justice O'Connor, it's both. I mean, I'm here defending the constitutionality of the statute as a whole, but I also think it would be fair for this Court to follow the practice that I think was suggested in a case it decided called United States against Raines, and focus in on the aspect of the statute that is constitutional, that is valid, and that would be fundamental rights.",
  "You have not, Justice O'Connor.",
  "And we pointed that out, and I think there is some tension between the proportionality and congruence test in this as-applied mode of analysis. But I do think the Raines case points out -",
  "I think that's fair, Mr. Chief Justice. I simply point to Raines because Raines shows that there's nothing inherently inconsistent between analyzing a section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment or section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment piece of legislation, an as-applied analysis. And I think there's an important relationship between this Court and Raines, because in Raines, this Court in a sense identified a fault line in a statute that was broadly applicable. It applied both to state actors and private individuals. And in a case in which it applied to state actors, they said, we may have some concerns about whether it can validly apply to private actors, but we're going to uphold the statute as applied to state actors. And in the same way, I think if this Court thinks that the statute is constitutional as applied to fundamental rights, but has concerns in its applications to non-fundamental rights, that it could, in effect, decide the case along the same lines. And, of course, the narrowest ground this Court could decide the case on would be to simply focus on access to the courts.",
  "I'm not sure that it does, Justice Kennedy. I think that if you isolate the example of the non-fundamental right and ask the question of whether or not that standing alone violates the Constitution -",
  "I think they have - they might have some access under the Constitution and some right. I'm not sure though that I'd be able to make an argument that that constitutional right is protected by something more than that rational basis review. I think that -",
  "That's exactly right, Justice Souter. And one other thing I think that's worth bearing in mind is that -",
  "In - in - in the hockey ring context?",
  "Well, I think it would depend on the facility in particular. I think in the access to the - in - in trying to get access to a court, it would be access to the courts. In trying to get access to a polling place, it would be the right to vote. I think one thing I'd like to emphasize though is that the - that Title II -",
  "I - I'm not sure that - that this Court has said that yet. If it's interested in -",
  "It's certainly not one that this Court has ever articulated, and - and - what I would say though is that -",
  "I have - it's not - it's not a matter I've really given any thought, Justice Kennedy. I apologize for that. I think the one thing I would like to emphasize is that Title II does not just give an access to buildings, it doesn't give an access to hockey rinks. It gives an access to programs, services, and activities, and in many cases, it's going to be the same municipal building that has the courthouse in it as well as other non-fundamental rights, and that's exactly a good illustration of why Title II is appropriate prophylaxis, because by making the municipal building accessible, even for something like a kiddie concert that might not implicate fundamental rights, you're also making the courtroom in the same building accessible to individuals who have a constitutional right to access to that building. One other point I'd like to make is with respect to the damages remedy, which is precisely what seems to be the gravamen of the concern of the state here. As Justice O'Connor pointed out, this is not a situation like other cases, where, if the Court strikes this down as inappropriate section 5 legislation, there's going to be lots of other remedies. The state provides none and people are raising constitutional challenges to the Commerce Clause legislation. The damages remedy that's particularly provided in Title II of the ADA is provided by double cross- reference. Title II incorporates the remedies available under the Rehabilitation Act, which in turn incorporates the remedies available under Title VI. Those remedies are entirely judge-made, and as the Thornburgh amicus briefs points out, to the extent that those remedies are the gravamen of the constitutional concern, their judge-made origins gives this Court unique flexibility to interpret the compensatory damages remedy in a way that renders the statute as a whole constitutional. Broadly speaking, Congress, in passing this statute, found a real problem with the individuals and the entities that are responsible for protecting the civil rights of everyone, denying the rights of individuals with disabilities. One element of its solution was the element of compensatory damages. Those compensatory damages are an appropriate response, but it would be very sad if that one element of the statute was used to bring down the entirety of Title II, given that it remains vitally necessary to make the promise of the Fourteenth Amendment a reality for individuals with disabilities.",
  "I think there is, Justice Ginsburg. I think that one thing, I think, is that Congress - the difference in remedies between Title II and Title III reflects two things. One, it reflects a judgment that - that unconstitutional action by a state is worse than unconstitutional action by a private entity.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit found that the arrest at issue here was one unauthorized, false, and in violation of international law because it occurred in Mexico. Nonetheless, the court found inapplicable the exception in the Federal Tort Claims Act for claims arising in a foreign country. At the same time, the court read the bare jurisdictional terms of section 1350 in title 28 to provide courts with the authority to infer causes of action from sources of customary international law, including treaties that the political branches have expressly refused to ratify. The resulting decision, which reads express grants of executive authority narrowly and implied grants of judicial authority broadly, turns the established separation of powers regime for dealing with international issues on its head. The Ninth Circuit first construed executive authority narrowly by holding that the DEA agents lacked the authority to effect an arrest in Mexico or abroad. That decision -- that holding has several problems, not the least of which is that by its terms it would preclude Federal agents from making an arrest abroad even in circumstances where the foreign country consents or there is no foreign government that is functioning to provide consent.",
  "Well, regrettably -­",
  "Well, regrettably, Justice Scalia, this is the rare case where I think they really are of quite significance because what the Ninth Circuit has held is, on the one hand, Federal agents, including the FBI, would lack the authority to make arrests abroad. They've also ruled in a way that I think really reads the foreign country exemption out of the Federal Tort Claims Act and then, of course, on the 1350 issue, that is an issue of tremendous importance to the Government and also to the broader community. So I guess if -­",
  "I actually intend to cover them both in -- in my initial period. Now, Mr. Phillips is going to be covering just 1350 because that's the only issue that affects his client. But the United States is both the petitioner in the case that raises the Federal Tort Claims Act issue, but also a respondent in support of petitioner with respect to 1350. So it's an ambitious goal in -- in 25 minutes, but I hope to address them both.",
  "Well, I think you are wrong about that, Justice Kennedy, because as I read the ruling of the Ninth Circuit, they say that the President, the executive, the Attorney General lack the authority to make an extraterritorial arrest, and they specifically -­",

  "That actually wasn't the -- the reasoning of the majority opinion. There's a concurrence by, I think, five of the six justices in the majority that said at a minimum you'd need a high-ranking official, but the majority opinion that's the law of the Ninth Circuit is that regardless of who approves the operation, the President categorically lacks that authority. And that's, of course, the -­",
  "I -- I think that's correct, Justice Stevens. Now, I would say that it -- the other issues in the case are logically in some respects anterior to that question, especially because the -- for example, the section 1350 really is a question about the -- the very jurisdiction of the courts.",
  "That's exactly right, Justice O'Connor. There's no way I can tell you that you have to address those other issues.",
  "I think, though, there's nothing that would stop the Court from addressing those issues, and those -­",
  "Well, we think it was raised and argued below, Justice O'Connor, and I think the 1350 issue is of tremendous continuing importance. I mean, if I could -- if I could address the point that you raised about the change in position. It is true that the United States in the Filartiga case took a different position. Now, subsequent that -- to that, the administration has -- different administrations have taken the position that 1350 is just jurisdictional. And if I could draw an analogy to the experience that this Court has had, in 1947 this Court upheld the constitutionality of State statutes that provided reciprocity in inheritance laws with foreign countries and said that was okay. 21 years later, with the -- sort of benefit of hindsight and the experience with State court judges causing foreign policy problems, this Court in the Journing case revisited that decision. And in a similar way, I think the 20-years-plus experience that we've had with the Filartiga regime has made it quite clear that these lawsuits provide tremendous problems for the foreign policy interests of the United States. And at the same time, in the intervening -­ intervening period, if anything, this Court has made it quite clear what the proper mode of finding a cause of action is and the proper way to read a jurisdictional provision.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, regrettably, I don't have the numbers on those. But I think one thing that's important to emphasize is that the case doesn't have to go to judgment to create potential foreign policy problems for the United States. And to give you just one example, there's litigation that's ongoing -- hasn't gone to judgment. It's quite preliminary -- in New York right now, where people are seeking compensation for abuses that occurred during the apartheid regime in South Africa. Now, the Government of South Africa itself, of course, has a very different mechanism for dealing with those issues, the truth and reconciliation process. And the Government of South Africa has formally protested at the highest levels that these issues that are very difficult issues for that government and that government is dealing with are the subject of litigation in the United States courts. And I think what you see is time and time again you have private litigants that may be very well intentioned but are focused on only a single issue and they are bringing that issue into the courts, creating foreign policy problems for the executive branch which the executive branch then has to try to remedy and ameliorate. At the same time, in the process of those lawsuits, you have courts making pronouncements on principles of international law and customary international law that may well be at variance with the views of the executive branch or -­",

  "I don't know that any bills are pending, but I do think that Congress is certainly fully able to deal with this situation.",

  "Well, I think that -- that -- I don't know that Judge Randolph in his separate opinion in the Al-Odah case expressly -- if you can tell exactly where he would come down on that. I -- I actually read his opinion as consistent with the position we're urging, but I of course may have an interest in doing so. I would say this, though, that I think that if you read this Court's precedents for dealing with a cause of action -- in finding a cause of action, there's no question that the 1350 is applied pursuant to those modern principles -­",
  "Well, with respect, Justice Stevens, let me take that in a couple of steps. First of all, I mean, certainly Judge Bork thought that maybe those original causes of action would be actionable in Federal court at the time. Now, first of all, to make clear, what the first Congress did is rather than pass any kind of tort action, it dealt with those three very offenses against the law of nations and dealt with them criminally. Now, it may be that what Judge Bork had in mind is that at the time of the framing, as a matter of general common law in the pre­ Erie sense, it might have been possible to get into Federal court and raise those three violations against the law of nations as a tort action. I don't think, however, that authority would survive Erie in any event, and I think it raises some questions of its own. Now, I think you're absolutely right, though, Justice Stevens, to say that the one objection you would have to applying straightforwardly the principles that this Court has adopted in cases like Cort against Ash and Sandoval is that this statute was passed at a much earlier time and where the -- the enacting Congress may have had different assumptions in mind. But this Court has made clear that it's not going to sort of tether its analysis to what assumptions the enacting Congress might have had in mind. It did so, of course, in the Sandoval decision. But you did so yourself, Justice Stevens, in your separate opinion in California against Sierra Club where you said that it may very well have been that the Congress in 1890 that passed the Rivers and Harbor Act probably assumed there would be a cause of action in court, but you said it was more important to apply the principles of Cort against Ash in that case than to try to divine the intent of an enacting Congress from 100 years earlier.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, if I could just make sure that there's one fact that's on the table, which is you said that they -- that Congress effectively had the provisions side by side, and I think it is worth noting that although the Torture Victim Protection Act is now codified as a note to 1350, that was not a decision Congress made. That was just a codification decision. So Congress itself didn't say insert in the code after",
  "There certainly was and I think that -- that basically the enactment of Congress is -­ sort of says nothing about 1350 one way or another. What I would point to the Torture Victim Protection Act, though, is a model of why it makes sense to ask Congress to get involved in creating a cause of action because when it does, it provides clear direction to the court and also acts in a way that minimizes tensions with allies because you're absolutely right to suggest that torture is one of the most well-established norms of international law. Yet, notwithstanding that, when Congress addressed the issue in the TVPA, it provided specific definitions of the prohibited conduct. Then it also provided clear guidance to the lower courts by providing for a specific statute of limitations of 10 years. And then, as I also indicated, it -- it put in a specific statutory exhaustion provision which suggested that litigants shouldn't rush to United States courts if the courts in the area where the events actually took place are open for the claims. I think that last provision is particularly telling because it shows that when you take the normal course and insist that Congress get involved in the process of creating causes of action, Congress as a political branch with foreign affairs responsibilities of its own -­",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, there certainly are international jurists that will argue that exhaustion principles are a principle of international law. But I think that's exactly what ends up happening if you leave these issues to the courts and don't insist on a cause of action is you leave the courts as a matter of Federal common law, I guess, trying to interpret international law sources to come up with things like exhaustion. A statute of limitations I would think would be even more difficult. Principles of damages. And they're supposed to do all of that as a matter of Federal common lawmaking with the only guide they have in the text is the 33 words in 28 U.S.C. 1350 which, by their terms, really only address jurisdiction. So I think that would put the courts in a very difficult position, and I think in contrast, the Torture Victim Protection Act shows the virtues of waiting for Congress to take some action before somebody would get involved in this kind of situation.",
  "Yes, Justice Kennedy, and thank you. Let me start with the -- the arrest authority question because, as I said at the outset, the view of the Ninth Circuit is that there is categorically no arrest authority abroad, even if a foreign nation consents. And that really cannot be correct. And I think respondent recognizes that implicitly by not defending that aspect of the Ninth Circuit ruling, but rather insisting on a rule that would give arrest authority only with consent. And with respect, though, I think that is not a workable rule for the Federal courts, and if I could use, by way of example, the arrest of the individual who's the convicted killer in the CIA shootings, Mir Aimal Kasi. This is an individual who was arrested by FBI agents in Pakistan in 1997. Under the Ninth Circuit's approach, obviously, this individual could not be arrested by FBI agents as a categorical matter. But under the approach of respondent, the Federal courts would have to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the arrest and to inquire specifically into whether the Government of Pakistan consented to the arrest by FBI agents in Pakistan in 1997. Now, I think the prospects for interfering with sensitive diplomatic relations, not to mention the difficulty of divining any principles for discerning the requisite degree of consent, are manifest in both those cases, and I would suggest that the far better approach is to read section 878 of title 21, consistent with its plain terms, to give the DEA the arrest authority for any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States without reading in either a territorial limitation or a limitation based on consent.",
  "With respect, Justice Ginsburg, I actually think the Mansfield Amendment supports the view of the United States here, and indeed, under the view of the Ninth Circuit, it's entirely unclear what the Mansfield Amendment was supposed to accomplish. It was under their view limiting an authority that did not exist because what the Mansfield Amendment does is put specific limitations on the authority of Federal agents. It applies only to direct arrests, only to foreign police actions, and only in the context of narcotics control efforts. And then even there it provides specific exceptions for exigencies and the like. And so I think what that reflects is that there may be circumstances where an extraterritorial arrest authority raises concerns and Congress may react to those, as it did in the Mansfield Amendment, but the very fact that there is this specific and tailored limitation on DEA authority suggests that there must be some broader grant of authority that includes extraterritorial arrests.",
  "That's certainly -- that is one way you could read it, Justice Souter. And I think there's two implications from that. One is, of course, if that's the way you read it, the Mansfield Amendment certainly doesn't bar the action here.",
  "Right. But here's why I think it still implies something about the scope of section 878 because section 878 of title 21 is not just the authority for the DEA to make arrests, it's basically the source of all their statutory authority for law enforcement efforts. And I think that even participation in the midst of a foreign police action, as you were envisioning the reference in the Mansfield Amendment, is at least a law enforcement involvement of the DEA. And so I think that unless 878 authorizes extraterritorial actions by DEA agents, be it arrests, be it simply carrying a firearm, or be it engaging in other investigatory activities, then so too I think the language of the Mansfield Amendment, even if it limits the very specific kind of law enforcement activity by the DEA, still suggests that 878 by its terms is not strictly limited to the territory of the United States.",
  "That's a fair point, but I think even if that's a bit of a broad conception, I certainly think assisting in the context of a foreign police action should qualify as law enforcement. If I could say just a -- a few things about the foreign country exemption before I sit down. I think that there is a very clear error in the analysis of the Ninth Circuit because this is really a -- a rare case where you have an arrest that is false and tortious only because it occurred in Mexico. You have the lower courts recognizing that the plaintiff is entitled to damages only for the period he was in Mexico, and every element of the tort took place in Mexico. Yet, nonetheless, somehow the court applies this headquarters doctrine to say that the foreign country exception applies. And I think what that illustrates is that although the headquarters exception may have been a helpful gloss on the language of the statute when it was first developed, as it's been interpreted by the Ninth Circuit, it becomes a free-floating exception to the -- to the foreign country exception that allows a plaintiff to skirt the language of the statute simply by alleging any degree of U.S. involvement or direction. If I could reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. If I could first address the argument that is advanced by respondent that we can solve the extraterritorial arrest problem by simply insisting on there being consent. I think this Court in its first Alvarez-Machain opinion at footnote 16 made the point that there are some issues that are best dealt with in diplomatic relations between countries and not in the courts of a single party. And I think consent for an extraterritorial arrest is a prototypical example of that. In diplomatic relations between countries, a certain amount of ambiguity can make the diplomatic relation function and so there may be varying degrees of consent. In the context of a United States judicial proceeding, though, the tendency is to bore down and find out whether there was some modicum of consent, some legal standard of consent. And I would point again to the example of Mir Aimal Kasi as how having courts bear down and figure out the exact extent of consent between Pakistan and FBI agents in 1997 would not have been a productive exercise for the courts. A very brief note on the Ker opinion, Ker against Illinois that was just mentioned at the closing of respondents' argument. It's true the Court said that there might be an action for kidnapping in that case, but this Court did not opine in any way what would be the relevant law in that kidnapping that occurred in Peru. I would suggest if it had looked at that issue, it would have suggested that the law that applied would be the law of Peru in the same way that if there is any law that applies to the false arrest here, it is the law of Mexico and that only underscores that this arrest, even if it were actionable somehow, would fall within the foreign country exemption to the Federal Tort Claims Act. If I could say two things about section 1350. The -- first of all, in terms of trying to divine exactly what was in Congress' mind when it enacted this provision in 1789, I would say that that is exceedingly difficult and that strongly suggests that what the Court should do is simply apply its rules for when there is a cause of action. But if there is any agreement at all as to what at least one of the events that led to the passage of the statute was, it was the events involving ambassadors in the United States and violations and assaults on those ambassadors. And I think the reaction to those assaults is telling. First, there were no civil actions ever brought in the courts that anybody is aware of to remedy those actions. What were brought are common law criminal actions. That's what the Longchamps case in Pennsylvania was. It was a common law criminal action. Now, I don't think anybody would suggest that a common law criminal action in law of nations somehow survives this Court -- this Court's decision in Hudson, saying there's no longer any common law criminal jurisdiction. In the same way, to the extent that the Court -- the Congress may have had in mind some general common law action that was available, there's no particular reason why that decision should withstand the Erie decision. But again, I think it is noteworthy that there was no civil action in response to those incidents. What there was is the 1781 Continental Congress action, and it just didn't ask the court -- the State courts to do something about this. It told the courts to authorize actions. The one court -- the one State that took up the challenge was Connecticut, and if you look at what Connecticut did, it is very telling because first they put in a jurisdictional provision. Then as a separate provision, they used language that is rights-conferring language. It seems obvious that Congress with section 1350 did the former but not the latter. There is jurisdiction, but there is not any rights-creating language. Now, it may be a bit anomalous to apply this Court's current conception to an old statute like the Judiciary Act of 1789, but this Court has done it before. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Unlike the Hamdi case, which raised not only the question of the President's and the military's authority to detain, but also questions the process and access to counsel. This case raises only two relatively discrete questions, first, whether the habeas petition in this case, challenging Padilla's present physical confinement in South Carolina, was properly filed in Manhattan, rather than against the immediate custodian in South Carolina, and second, whether the President has the authority to detain a citizen who travels abroad, affiliates and associates with the enemy abroad, receives training in enemy camps in wiring and explosives and then returns to the United States at the direction of the enemy to commit hostile and warlike acts. Now, there are many aspects of this case that raise issues that are really extraordinary, but the habeas petition that was filed in this case was a standard, indeed ordinary, use of the writ to challenge the prisoner's present physical confinement and the habeas rules are settled that when the writ is used to challenge the present physical confinement, the proper custodian, the proper respondent, is the immediate custodian and the suit should be filed in the district where that custodian is present. In other words, in a case to your present physical confinement, the case should be filed in the district of confinement.",
  "There would be jurisdiction in that case, Justice Stevens, under the Endo decision. Now, I think in that case, there would still be a question, especially if there was the, the habeas petition was filed and he was immediately removed, there would still be the question of venue at that point and there is a Seventh Circuit case that's not in the briefs but Ross against Mebane that you may want to look at that says that in a case like that presumptively --",
  "Oh, my answer is jurisdiction yes, under this Court's decision in Endo.",
  "But then there would still be a subsidiary question that's not raised here about venue.",
  "Exactly, and we would raise in the case where there was in fact jurisdiction.",
  "But in this case our position is there is no jurisdiction whatsoever, and I think that --",
  "No, I don't think so, Justice O'Connor. I don't know which case have you in mind, but I'm aware of no case of this Court that takes the unprecedented step that the court below took, which is basically to allow a habeas petition to go forward in a case where neither the prisoner nor the custodian is in the jurisdiction where the habeas petition is filed.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, as I was suggesting to Justice Stevens, that case involves a kind of unique situation where a habeas petition is filed, challenging a certain kind of confinement, and then after the petition is filed, and after jurisdiction attaches, the prisoner is moved. In that case, it was an individual moved from California to --",
  "Well, I don't know for sure, Mr. Chief Justice, but I would say a couple of things. One is on the immediate custodian rule, I think that is a rule that perhaps the government could waive in a case, and so if you have a situation - - - In a way Hamdi is that case where when the habeas petition in Hamdi was filed, he was being detained in Norfolk, which was in the Eastern District of Virginia. It did not matter in that case whether the immediate custodian was Paulette, who is the brig, the commander of the brig, or Rumsfeld because in the government's view, they are both territorially present in the Eastern District of Virginia. So the immediate custodian rule I think is something that government can waive. I don't think that the territorial jurisdiction limit on the courts, though, is something that the government is in a position to waive. I think that is a restriction on the power of the court to issue the writ of habeas, and again, as I was indicating --",
  "Yes, Justice O'Connor. There is a circuit split on that issue, and I think in some ways that issue is sort of tied up with this case, though even there as I understand most of those cases, there is a case from the Ninth Circuit called Armentero, which in the government's view goes the wrong way. There is favorable precedent in the Sixth Circuit, the First Circuit, and the Seventh Circuit, but even the Ninth Circuit, I think, envisions a case where they view the attorney general as the proper custodian, but they, you know, it's not clear where they think that individual can be served. Now, I suppose that the Ninth Circuit applying that rule might also take the unprecedented step here. It's also true if you want a sort of sense of the potential for abuse in these cases, I think you could point to the Ninth Circuit case where the Ninth Circuit held that the Central District of California had habeas jurisdiction over a claim filed by a petitioner in Guantanamo. I mean, obviously there is the issue that this Court has, but there is a question of if there were jurisdiction, I wouldn't have thought that it lay in the Central District of California. And I think that happens when you relax these traditional rules. And I think particularly in a case like --",
  "Well, if, let me answer the question this way, which is if you had a citizen in Guantanamo.",
  "And under this Court's cases like Toth against Quarles and Burns against Wilson, that citizen is unable to file a habeas petition. Our view is that the proper place to file that would be either in the Eastern District of Virginia, if you were naming the Secretary of Defense or if were you naming some official present in the district, you would sue in the District of Columbia. But the important thing is even in that case, the court where you filed the petition would have jurisdiction, territorial jurisdiction over the Respondent and what is so anomalous here is in a sense, it doesn't, I mean it matters to us in the sense that we think the proper Respondent is Commander Marr, but even if you assume the proper Respondent here is secretary Rumsfeld, the case still shouldn't be brought in the Southern District of New York. It should be brought in the Eastern District of Virginia.",
  "Well, I think there are a number of --",
  "I think that's right, Justice Stevens. I think it only makes sense to have the defense mounted in the place where the detention is taking place. And I think that's particularly true in this case, because this isn't a petition that only challenges the fact of confinement. If you look at the, the petition in this case, the amended petition, joint appendix page 56, the relief that's sought here also goes to the conditions of confinement in Commander Marr's brig. Now, in a case like that, it seems --",
  "Well, I think you can file a mixed petition and seek that kind of relief, but in any event, I think that what they are looking for is not just release from detention, but the stopping of the interrogations.",
  "I mean, unless the word essentially is going to bear a tremendous amount of weight, I disagree because I think that what you have here is not general venue principles. You have a situation where the relevant statute that gives courts habeas jurisdiction restricts their ability to issue the writ to their territorial jurisdiction. And this Court has been clear in cases like Carbo and this is even consistent in Justice Rutledge's dissent in the Ahrens case, that for that provision to have any meaning at an irreducible minimum, it has to mean that a writ that goes to the proper custodian has to be filed within the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court.",
  "That's right, Justice Ginsburg. And this Court decided that in Endo long before Ahrens when it reaffirmed an even stricter rule and there is nothing in the post-Ahrens cases that suggests that this Court has ever deviated from this understanding. And indeed I would point the Court to the decision in Schlanger against Seamans, because I think in some ways, it shows how, that that case really decided this issue, because what the court there had was an individual who was trying to get ROTC scholarship in Arizona, but he was assigned to a unit in Alabama, and he filed his habeas petition in Arizona, and he named as Respondents an individual in Arizona who had no custody over him whatsoever, so that individual was out. He also named the Secretary of the Air Force. The court did not rely on that, and the court said that his true custodian is his commanding officer in Georgia, and what this Court said is there was no jurisdiction in Arizona over that custodian in Georgia, and just to be clear about it, the Court noted and rejected an argument based on 28 U.S.C. 1391(e), which among other things provides nationwide service of process against Federal officials. Now, if that statute had applied, then it would have been perfectly appropriate to bring the case in Arizona against a Georgia Respondent who was a Federal officer. But the Court said no. 1391(e) does not trump the habeas statute. Now, if that is true of a Federal statute that provides for nationwide service of process, it seems like it would be true a fortiori for Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4. But that's the theory under which the courts below exercised jurisdiction in this case.",
  "Absolutely, Your Honor. And I think the best evidence of that, there is two things I'd like to point to. But maybe the simplest way is that both Strait and Braden cite Schlanger favorably and, indeed, if you look at the very end of the Braden opinion, when the court says that the proper Respondent there is within the court's service of process, it sites Schlanger for that proposition, which makes sense because in that case the petition was properly filed, challenging a Kentucky detainer in Kentucky, so the proper Respondent was within the territorial jurisdiction of the court in that case. The second reason I would say that Schlanger is very much good law as we pointed out in our reply brief, is that the court in Schlanger went out of its way, because at that point, Ahrens was sort of already teetering on the verge of obsolescence, to state that the rule would be exactly the same even under Justice Rutledge's view in Ahrens, so I think for those two reasons, Schlanger continues to be good law, and clearly would trump any service of process that would be provided by Rule 4. And I think, and this is consistent with what the unanimous three-judge court in the Fourth Circuit said in the Hamdi case, that particularly in cases that raise such sensitive issues as the cases that are involved on the merits in this case, it is particularly important that the court try to avoid unnecessarily reaching Constitutional issues by first ascertaining that it has jurisdiction. Now, if I --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, its statutory jurisdiction, but I agree. It is at some level it is a which District Court question, not whether District Courts are open to these claims at all.",
  "With respect, Justice Breyer, I would disagree. I think that this Court, it is true, in situations where it has relaxed the notion of custody, and has allowed habeas petitions to be brought in circumstances where they previously weren't available, Strait against Laird is an example. This Court's decision in Braden, basically is an example because it was accommodating the overruling of McNally against Hill and Payton against Rowe. So in those contexts, where there is more than one custody or some kind of metaphysical custody, this Court has relaxed the rules in a way to accommodate those, but it has never deviated. Never, from the rule that you have to file the habeas petition where the custodian is, and equally important, it has never, there is no need to expand the notion of custody, because you have a classic habeas case where you are challenging your present physical confinement. The courts never relax the rules.",
  "That would be fine.",
  "Justice Breyer, I will answer the question. I would preface it by saying that I certainly wouldn't read the authorization of force's use of the term necessary and appropriate as an invitation for sort of judicial management of the executive's war-making power. I would have viewed it as a delegation to the executive to use its traditional authority to make discretionary judgments in finding what is the necessary appropriate force. And the Prize cases, I think, stand for that proposition. Now, if I can address the specifics, though, why it might be necessary and appropriate and, indeed, why is the Government asserting this authority? It is precisely because, in this war on terrorism, the Government can confront an individual who is not only guilty of past war crimes, but also --",
  "Even if, contrary to our position, it was a venue question, we would still say no. And I think that you have to understand -- I mean, the fact that he was in New York in the first place is a bit of a happenstance. He tries to fly to Chicago. He is seized in Chicago --",
  "Well, with respect, Justice Stevens, I don't think anybody would think that if you filed a habeas petition to challenge Padilla's detention as a material witness while he was being detained in New York, that that should be filed in Chicago. And I think by the same logic, it doesn't make any sense from what the gravamen of the -- the gravamen of the challenge is to the conditions and legality of the detention in South Carolina, why that ought to be filed in New York just because he was there under a different authority.",
  "He did have a lawyer appointed there. But again, I don't think -- I mean, I think Mr. Dunham or his equivalent in South Carolina would be available to provide whatever role is necessary and appropriate under the circumstances. I don't think there are only lawyers in New York.",
  "In none of these cases have we seen a problem with the detainees finding legal representation.",
  "Well, I hate to disappoint you. I'm not sure that I had anything in particular left other than to say that we would still -- I mean, I think all I would say, and maybe I can reference that there are Court of Appeals cases, the Seventh Circuit has decided this Ross against Mebane case that basically say that even if you're in a venue situation, even if you're within the rule of Ex parte Endo, there is still a strong, strong presumption that a habeas petition belongs in the district court where the individual is being detained. Now, maybe if you had a situation where the habeas petition was up and running and close to a final judgment or whatever. And then the individual is detained, it makes sense to keep the proceeding in the first venue. But in a case like -- if you had a case where the day after the first petition is filed, he's moved for independent and good reasons, I think you would also say that the case belongs in the place of detention.",
  "I think for purposes of the question before this Court, the authority question, he is just the same. It may be that in an appropriate juncture when the Court has before it the question of what procedure should be applied, that you would want to apply different procedures in a case like this.",
  "Could we punish him? Certainly we could punish him if we decided to change the nature of our processing of him. As this Court made clear in Quirin --",
  "No, I don't think we could for good and sufficient reasons --",
  "Not after we captured them and brought them to safety. And I think in every case, there are rules of engagement, there are rules for the appropriate force that should be used. And I don't know that there are any --",
  "Yes, even if they're an unlawful belligerent. Once they're -- I mean, we couldn't take somebody like Hamdi, for example, now that he's been removed from the battlefield and is completely -- poses no threat unless he's released and use that kind of force on him.",
  "Well, first of all, there are treaty obligations. But the primary check is that just as in every other war, if a U.S. military person commits a war crime by creating some atrocity on a harmless, you know, detained enemy combatant or a prisoner of war, that violates our own conception of what's a war crime. And we'll put that U.S. military officer on trial in a court marshal. So I think there are plenty of internal reasons --",
  "Well, our executive doesn't and I think -- I mean --",
  "This is a situation where there is jurisdiction in the habeas courts. So if necessary, they remain open. But I think it's very important -- I mean, the court in Ludecke against Watkins made clear that the fact that executive discretion in a war situation can be abused is not a good and sufficient reason for judicial micromanagement and overseeing of that authority. You have to recognize that in situations where there is a war -- where the Government is on a war footing, that you have to trust the executive to make the kind of quintessential military judgments that are involved in things like that.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, let me give you a practical reason answer and the legal reason. You may prefer the former. But I think that the practical reason is if you capture somebody who is not just somebody who is guilty of a war crime or a violation of some provision of Title 18, but also has a wealth of information that could be used to prevent future terrorist attacks, then it seems to me that the military ought to have the option of proceeding with him in a way that allows him to get actionable intelligence to prevent future terrorist attacks, and should not be forced into a choice where the only way they can proceed is to proceed retrospectively to try to punish him for past acts. In doing so, whether it's a military commission or an Article III, requires you to give him a counsel who likely is going to say that you shouldn't talk to the Government about any of these things.",
  "I think he might well, Justice Souter, and you in fact suggested that yourself, which is if there was actionable information --",
  "Well, I think he would certainly today, which is to say September 12th or April 28th.",
  "That would be my answer. I would say the President had that authority on September 10th, but I guess I would --",
  "No, but Justice Scalia, presumably the authorization of force is read against prior history and this Court's precedents. And those precedents include the Quirin case where it is absolutely clear that in fighting a war, you have the authority to detain individuals, even if they're not formal military officers who are affiliated with the enemy and come into the United States intent on committing hostile and warlike acts.",
  "Well, two things, Justice Souter. First of all, I mean, you asked me a hypothetical but we do have the authorization of force here. Second of all, I don't think Quirin can stand for the kind of clear statement rule that others want to attribute to it for two reasons. One, to the extent it applied any clear statement rule, it runs in the opposite direction. The Court said they would not strike down the detention and try the individuals there absent a clear conviction that it violated an act of Congress.",
  "Well, it actually -- it purported to be. It said absent a clear conviction, it wouldn't strike down the authority. But what I would -- just to be clear, I think as we point out in our reply brief, if you applied a clear statement rule to Quirin, it would have to come out the other way because Article II of the articles of war that were in force at the time were restricted to members of the United States military. Article 15, which the Court relied on, didn't expressly authorize military commissions expressly. It did so by negative implication. So it's simply not the case that you need an express statutory authorization. If I could reserve my time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I would like to make just three points. First, on jurisdiction, it is true that the immediate custodian rule is not a hard and fast rule and it has been -- exceptions have been made. But the territorial jurisdiction rule, as statutorily prescribed, limits the Court's jurisdiction and is a hard and fast rule. And the best evidence of the relationship between the two is in those cases where you had to relax one or the other, when you had a citizen detained abroad where the immediate custodian was abroad outside the territorial jurisdiction of any district court, rather than relax the rule of territorial jurisdiction, the Court said you could sue the Secretary of Defense in a district where there is territorial jurisdiction over the individual. It is true there are situations like Strait against Laird that don't involve normal physical confinement, where the Court has had to come up with some rule to deal with the fact that you only have a metaphysical custodian. But in the case of a physical detention of an individual, the Court has never relaxed the rule that you file it in the district where the immediate custodian is located. And if you look at this Court's decision in Carbo and Justice Rutledge's dissent in Ahrens, you'll see that if you don't respect the rule in a situation like this, there is nothing left to the statutory language and nothing left of the intent of the Congress that passed it. The second point I would like to make is that in looking at this case and the authority that's asserted and the role of 4001(a), it's important to recognize that there is a significant difference between civilian authority and the military authority over enemy combatants. This Court, when it decided Endo and addressed the situation of the detention of the Japanese, specifically carved out the situation of the military detention of enemy combatants and said that that is not involved here. It stands to reason that if Congress, in passing 4001(a) to effectively prevent another Japanese internment camp of concededly loyal citizens also probably wanted to put to one side the issue of military detention of enemy combatants. In any event, the Court need not ultimately decide whether 4001(a) has any application because the authorization of force clearly provides the necessary act of Congress. It authorizes not Article III courts for these individuals. It authorizes military force. And the relevant line here is provided by this Court's case in Quirin, when somebody goes abroad, associates with the enemy, takes weapons training or explosives training with the enemy, and then returns to the United States with the intent to commit hostile and warlike acts at the direction of the enemy, that classically falls within the Quirin side of the line. It's much different than a Landon Milligan who never left the State of Indiana. And the military has authority over that individual. Lastly, let me just address the argument that somehow you can constrain the authorization of force and read it only to apply in a battlefield setting. With respect, I think that ignores the context in which it was passed. It was passed seven days after September 11th. The resolution itself recognizes that we face continuing threats at home and abroad. It was not passed as a matter of retribution for those attacks, but to prevent future attacks. To read it to deny the Government the authority to detain a latter day citizen version of Mohammed Atta is to simply ignore the will of Congress. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Petitioners contend that the Government categorically lacks the authority to hold Hamdi as an enemy combatant. But it has been well established and long established that the Government has the authority to hold both unlawful enemy combatants and lawful prisoners of war captured on the battlefield in order to prevent them from returning to the battle. Over 10,000 United States troops remain on the field of battle in Afghanistan. No principle of law or logic requires the United States to release an individual from detention so that he can rejoin the battle against the United States.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I think that reflects a sound exercise of prosecutorial and executive discretion. There are some individuals who may be captured in a situation where they do not have any particular intelligence value, they have been handled in a way where there are no difficult evidentiary questions that would be raised in a criminal prosecution and those individuals can be dealt with in the Article III system. But there are plenty of individuals who either have a paramount intelligence value that putting them into the Article III system immediately and providing them with counsel whose first advice would certainly be to not talk to the Government is a counterproductive way to proceed in these cases.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, I'm not sure I can give you the outer bounds, but what I can say is that the case here before you today in Hamdi, and the case in Padilla, suggests that the amount of time that is necessary to allow for interrogation without access to counsel in order to get intelligence is not an indefinite period of time. Both these individuals now have access to counsel because the military intelligence experts who make these judgments have made the judgment that access to counsel at this point does not interfere with the intelligence gathering process.",
  "I suppose you could. One thing I would point you to, Justice Kennedy, is the declaration of Vice Admiral Jacoby, who is the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. That's at page 75 of the Joint Appendix in the Padilla case. And I think that -- there obviously are various ways the courts could approach this. A court in one proceeding could take evidence of the question generally. I suppose if there were a situation in which there was a habeas petition filed and there was an initial period where there was no access to counsel, if a judge for some reason thought that that had taken too long, I suppose that judge could make an inquiry of the Government, and in an ex parte proceeding, they could make some kind of filing explaining to the judge why it is that further interrogation without counsel is necessary. I think the important thing is twofold. One, to recognize that there is a unique interest, especially in the course of this conflict, where intelligence is at unprecedented value, to have some ability with some detainees to deal with them in a way that allows us to get intelligence to prevent future terrorist attacks, and not be limited just to going after them retrospectively for past terrorist attacks.",
  "That's right, Justice Souter, but I would be quick to add that we -- I mean, all 4001(a) says is that an individual must be detained pursuant to an act of Congress.",
  "Well, Justice Souter, I would say a couple of things. One is there may be some difficult questions down the road, but if there is emphasis that 10,000 United States troops remain on the battlefield in Afghanistan --",
  "I realize that, Justice Souter. Let me say one other thing. And then if I have time, I'd come back to the 10,000 troops still on the ground. What I would say is Congress has been open with whatever appropriate recesses every day since September 18th, 2001 when they passed the joint resolution. If they were to pass some specific statute that either provided for more finely reticulated procedures for dealing with enemy combatants or tried to preclude the detention of certain individuals, then I think one of two things would happen, either the executive branch would follow those more reticulated provisions, or I suppose if there was a judgment by Congress that this authority was denied all together and the President thought that that authority was absolutely necessary to the fighting of the battle in Afghanistan, then you might have a situation where we came to this Court in a situation that Justice Jackson would say the executive's power is at its lowest ebb. But here we come to the Court with that authorization that the President relied on.",
  "Well, again, Justice Souter, I can't imagine that the rule is that the executive somehow suffers if Congress doesn't fill the breach. Because the last word from Congress is that -- that all necessary and appropriate force is authorized.",
  "But Justice Souter, they have authorized the use of force. They recognize, if you took --",
  "Well, absolutely.",
  "It would, Justice Scalia --",
  "And that's why I find it so remarkable that we have to confront this question when our troops are still on the ground in Afghanistan.",
  "Justice Breyer, let me say several things. One is that the regulations that are being bandied about are the regulations that the Army uses to comply with their obligations under Article V of the Geneva Convention. Now, Article V of the Geneva Convention does not apply here, and let me address why in a minute, but let me say very clearly that these individuals have gotten military process. It might not have been the exact process --",
  "Well, Justice Breyer --",
  "I understand that. But the practical answer that you are looking for assumes a process that's never been provided. There has never been a process that's removed from the battlefield. What Article V provides and what the military regulations provide is immediately adjunct to the battlefield, you have three military officers who do a very quick hearing, the purpose of which primarily is to figure out not whether somebody is completely innocent, but to figure out whether they are properly classified as a prisoner of war, as opposed to an unlawful enemy combatant.",
  "They do, Justice O'Connor --",
  "This Petitioner, Justice O'Connor, did not get that precise type of review, and the reason is because, based on a Presidential determination, the military officers understood that Article V of the Geneva Convention has no application here. Again, that provision, and I think it's worth --",
  "We do agree that he is entitled to bring a --",
  "-- habeas action.",
  "Well, I don't think it's required, especially in a situation like this, where although Hamdi did not receive an Article V hearing because it was inapplicable, he did receive military process. When he was originally turned over to the United States forces by the Northern Alliance, our military allies, there was a screening process on the ground in Afghanistan. Now, that process screened out 10,000 individuals out of U.S. custody. So he received that process. Now, to be sure, it's a military process, but it is the kind of process that prisoners of war and enemy combatants have always gotten. Now, because of the nature of this war, Hamdi got additional process. And it's important to point out that this Article V process that other prisoners of war traditionally get is a one-shot deal. It's done off the battlefield and that's it. You are under detention for the remainder of the battle. And there's no reason for Congress to have to go in with a new resolution. You are there for the remainder of the war. Now, in this context, because we recognize that there are some unusual aspects of this war, and also because the United States military has no interest in detaining any individual who is not an enemy combatant or who does not present a continuing threat, when Hamdi got to Guantanamo, he was given additional screening processes. That screened him in as well. Did not screen him out. Then it may not seem what you think of as traditional due process in an Article III sense, but the interrogation process itself provides an opportunity for an individual to explain that this has all been a mistake. And as the affidavit that's in the record here shows --",
  "Absolutely, Justice O'Connor. And the affidavit that's filed here represents, by Mr. Mobbs, that the interrogation process, in that process, his story confirmed that he was on the battlefield and surrendered with the Taliban military unit while armed.",
  "Justice Kennedy, I'm not positive what the ultimate minimum that the habeas statutes would require in this context, but we do think that an appropriate balance of individual rights, the traditional role of habeas, that the overwhelming military imperatives of this situation are that the habeas corpus writ is available, first to make legal challenges to the detention along the lines of 4001(a) categorically precludes this, and those challenges have been open. We also think it appropriate for the United States to come in with a declaration that explains the basis for the military's decision. And particularly, I think what it does is it provides an explanation that if believed, provides a basis for a court to police the line that separates Quirin on the one hand from Milligan on the other. And obviously, a situation like this with a battlefield detainee who surrendered while armed on the battlefield is a classic case of an enemy combatant.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I mean, there actually is, I mean, it would be something like double hearsay, but there is a statement in the Mobbs declaration itself where Mobbs is summarizing that Hamdi himself --",
  "It certainly is, but this is --",
  "With respect, Justice Ginsburg, he has an opportunity to explain it in his own words. Now, it may not --",
  "During interrogation.",
  "During interrogation. During the initial screening. During the screening in Guantanamo.",
  "No, Justice O'Connor. And let me say two things. One is when the initial screening criteria are applied in the field, for all intents and purposes, that is a neutral decision maker. I mean, as I said before, the Army is not interested in holding people as enemy combatants that don't qualify for that and don't pose a threat. The second thing I would say, though, is that as I understand it, the plan on a going-forward basis reflecting the unique situation of this battle is to provide individuals like Hamdi, like Padilla, with the equivalent of the annual review process that's laid out in the briefs --",
  "Well, Justice O'Connor, those regulations are still in draft form.",
  "We don't know for sure. I think what's envisioned is an opportunity to go before a neutral tribunal, some opportunity to present --",
  "Justice Stevens, what we're assuming is that he has no right to counsel that is automatic and as of right --",
  "Not at the preliminary stages if the Government has made a determination that access to counsel would interfere with the intelligence gathering process.",
  "Let me answer both parts of your question, Justice Stevens. Certainly it has occurred to us and we have considered the possibility that in some circumstances with some individuals, the best way to get them to cooperate and provide information is to give them a lawyer who will tell them, boy, you know, it's in your best interest to plead to this relatively minor material support charge or whatever and provide the Government with everything that you have. And that is part of the answer to Justice Ginsburg's earlier question, is why is it that there is this pattern that you look at and some people are used in the Article III system and other people are prosecuted or dealt with in preventative detention in the military system. And it reflects a judgment by people whose job it is to make these judgments that certain people, the best way to get them to cooperate, or maybe with certain individuals after you've gotten a certain amount of information from them, but you feel there is one other area you're not going to get unless the dynamic fundamentally changes, those people may be best dealt with in the way that you envisioned. Whereas other individuals, the only way that the judgment of the intelligence experts had to deal with them is to provide them without counsel and to use an interrogation. I think to get to your second part of the question, I don't know that there are any authorities that I'm aware of that address exactly what you're talking about, but I think there are two types of authority that we would point to as being very important. First of all, it's long been recognized that one of the major justifications for the detention of enemy combatants or prisoners of war is to gather intelligence. And we cite some sources to that effect in the brief. The second thing, and I think this is important, is that it has never been the case that prisoners of war are entitled to counsel to challenge their capture or their detention. What has happened historically, and what the Geneva Convention provides, is that if one of those enemy combatants is charged with a specific war crime, then at that point they're entitled to counsel. But if they are just being held in a preventative detention, then in that circumstance, they are not entitled to counsel.",
  "A couple of responses, Justice O'Connor. First of all, in the midst of any war, the detention may seem like it's indefinite because if you talk about a detainee in 1942, they're not going to know how long World War II is going to last. And their detention may seem indefinite but those detentions have always been approved under the law of war. Second, with respect to Al Qaeda and individuals who are hard core Al Qaeda operatives, the end of the war is a very difficult thing to perceive. But with respect to somebody who is captured on the battlefield with the Taliban, this war may eventually -- the executive may make the judgment or Congress may help us make the judgment that the war in Afghanistan is effectively over. And individuals who only really posed a danger of rejoining the battle in Afghanistan would be released. Now, there may be a few individuals who, as I say, are hard core Al Qaeda operatives and they're going to join the battle against the United States wherever it's waged. They're just in Afghanistan because that's where the action is.",
  "Well, I think there is, Justice Stevens. I mean --",
  "Well, just to give one example, I think that the United States is signatory to conventions that prohibit torture and that sort of thing. And the United States is going to honor its treaty obligations. The other thing that's worth mentioning of course --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I actually have the sense that the torture victims -- you have the Torture Victim Protection Act, of course, which I think doesn't actually apply to the United States. So I'm not sure that there would be any other basis for bringing a private cause of action against the United States. But as this Court noted in footnote 14 of the Eisentrager opinion, the idea that a treaty is going to be enforced through means other than a private cause of action doesn't mean that it's not a binding treaty, doesn't mean that it's not going to constrain the actions of the executive branch. Just to finish up my answer to Justice Stevens' question, I wouldn't want there to be any misunderstanding about this. It's also the judgment of those involved in this process that the last thing you want to do is torture somebody or try to do something along those lines. I mean, if there were an artificial -- if you did that, you might get information more quickly, but you would really wonder about the reliability of the information you were getting. So the judgment of the people who do this as their responsibility is that the way you would get the best information from individuals is that you interrogate them, you try to develop a relationship of trust.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, there may be a point where, depending on the nature of the war -- I mean, I'm not quite sure what you have in mind that they would intervene on.",
  "Well, as I indicated earlier, Justice Breyer, the courts remain open. We recognize the viability of the writ of habeas corpus. There certainly is a challenge that can be brought to the length of the detention at some point. And the courts would be open to hear claims --",
  "Justice Souter, a couple of points. One is, I don't think there is any contradiction with that and my answer to Justice Breyer's question. I mean, you can imagine a situation where the evidence in the Government's own affidavit shows that somebody is only detained with regard to war in Afghanistan. And then you can imagine that that has been signed, sealed and delivered, it's over, the President says so, Congress says so and there is an effort to continue to detain that individual.",
  "With respect, Justice Souter, I continue to think that there may be a role for the courts in dealing with the timing question at some point. I think that would be --",
  "Well, I wouldn't take that away, Justice Kennedy. What I'm saying is there is a continuing but modest role for the courts. The habeas courts will remain open. I mean, the import of one of Justice Souter's questions is that it's already too long and if somebody raised that claim, if there is another petition filed, a direct petition now that Hamdi has counsel that's filed in this claim, and that claim is raised, we would be in court vehemently saying there is no role for the habeas court there. There are troops still on the ground in Afghanistan. It makes no sense whatsoever to release an individual detained as an enemy combatant in Afghanistan while the troops are still on the ground in Afghanistan.",
  "Well, again --",
  "No, but the alternative is to provide a means of allowing for a military process to go forward. It's not just the interrogator. It's the original screening team on the ground in Afghanistan that, as I said before, released 10,000 individuals out of U.S. custody. It's the screening team in Guantanamo and then it is this annual review process that will go forward. Now that is a tremendous amount of process that the executive branch is providing.",
  "That's quite correct, Justice Ginsburg, but I would say that for the time being, everything provided to date is more than sufficient.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case, and these cases, concern the constitutionality of the twelve hundred criminal sentencings that take place in Federal court each week. If this Court re-affirms its traditional understanding of the relationship between the Guidelines, and the statutory maximum penalties set forth in the United States Code, an understanding reflected in a series of this Court's decisions dealing with the Guidelines, than the constitutionality of those criminal sentencings remains secure. On the other hand, if this Court takes a different view, and treats the outer bounds of the Guideline ranges as if they were statutory maximums, then the majority of those criminal sentencings become constitutionally dubious, and this Court must confront difficult remedial issues. This is, of course, not the first time that this Court has confronted a challenge to the constitutionality of the Guidelines or to the Commission. To be sure, in those previous cases, this Court has never considered the precise Sixth Amendment issue before the Court today. But, nonetheless, those previous cases are instructive, because all of those cases, Dunnigan, Witte, Watts, and Edwards, all reflect a particular understanding of the relationship between the Guidelines and the statutory maximum sentences for each specific crime defined in the United States Code. And all of those decisions suggest that the statutory maximum in the Code is the relevant focal point for constitutional analysis. So, in the Witte case, for example, the finding of relevant conduct in the Witte case increased his sentence under the Guidelines by two hundred months. Nonetheless, this Court rejected the double jeopardy challenge before the Court by emphasizing that that consideration of relevant conduct did not increase his penalty beyond the statutory maximum. Likewise in the Edwards case, this Court considered the propriety of a judicial finding of crack cocaine that increased the Guideline sentence, when the jury was instructed in the alternative, to find cocaine or crack. Now, even though the judicial finding had the effect of raising the punishment under the Guidelines, this Court found no serious Sixth Amendment issue raised precisely because the effect of the judge's finding did not take the sentence beyond the maximum for a cocaine-only conspiracy.",
  "In the Edwards case, a Sixth Amendment issue and, I think, fairly including the jury trial, was raised in that case. Now, I've tried to go back and look briefs in that case and I have to admit, they're a little difficult to get through in terms of the precise issue that was being raised.",
  "Well, it was argued, I think, fairly clearly in the Watts case, I mean, there was a section -- Watts, of course, was a summary reversal, so you have to go and look at the brief in opposition in the Watts case. And if you do, there's a separate paragraph in the argument section denominated the jury trial right. And I think in some respects, the Watts case is a particularly clear indicator that this Court has rejected the view of the Guidelines that Respondents embrace. Because Justice Stevens was quite prophetic in his dissent in that case. He embraced the precise understanding of the significance of the outer bound of the Guidelines range in his Watts dissent, and no member of this Court joined that dissent, and no member found the disposition with respect to Watts",
  "It may very well prove that, Justice Stevens, because you were very clear about the point, just to remind you, in the Watts case there were two cases before the Court, there was the Putra case, and there was the Watts case, they were consolidated. And with respect to Putra, you can envision that case, or characterize that case as being sort of a collateral estoppel, double jeopardy case, but as you correctly recognized, very clearly, in your Watts dissent, with respect to Mr. Watts, the finding, the criminal finding of acquittal was based on 924(c), which requires use of a gun. The sentencing enhancement was done based on an enhancing factor that only requires possession of a gun. So there wasn't any collateral estoppel effect in that case. But, nonetheless, in your dissent you pointed out, in footnotes 2 and 4 that it still had the effect of raising his sentence above the outer bound of the Guidelines range, and that, because that was done on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence, rather than a beyond a reasonable doubt standard, that that raised a constitutional problem, and you would have reversed. The rest of the Court was happy to summarily reverse in that case.",
  "With respect, Justice Scalia, I'd like to make two observations. One, I don't think the jury trial right is just a juxtaposition of the role of the jury versus the role of the judge, because if that were the only factor at issue in this Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, it would be very difficult to explain why it is that judicial fact-finding can have the effects that it can under a purely discretionary system, yet this Court has upheld that time and time again. The second point I'd like to make, is I do think that this Court's Apprendi to Blakely line of cases ­",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think there -- there certainly is a difference between sentencing under the Guidelines, versus a system of discretionary sentencing, or even a system of discretionary sentencing where the Guidelines have an advisory character, I'd certainly concede that. My point was, though, in making a distinction between the role of the jury and the judge, it's not just as simple as saying that the jury trial right exists precisely to protect the jury from the judge, because if that were the case, the kind of fact-finding that Judge Lynch engaged in, or the kind of fact finding that was commonplace under discretionary sentencing also takes roles away from the jury, and gives them to the judge.",
  "With respect, Justice Scalia, I think you've built in some assumptions into that question, because under our system, generally speaking if somebody wants to know what the maximum exposure for a particular criminal offense is, they would be well-advised to look at the U.S. Code provision that specifies what the maximum sentence is for that offense, because that is their exposure, that's what they're told about in their Rule 11 colloquy if they plead to the crime, and if the judge makes certain findings, to be sure, upward departure, whatever it takes in a particular case, that is the maximum exposure that the individual",
  "Unless the judge departs for some other reason, or the like. I mean, but certainly that's true -",
  "I suppose that's true, too.",
  "So there are different ways that you could get that sentence under the Guidelines system. But if there's no mistake, and no departure on some other grounds, we both understand, I think, how the Guidelines work and you're describing it correctly. But still, that is a finding that is only necessary because of the determination of the Commission and the Guidelines, and that brings us back to the question -",
  "I would not concede that, Justice Ginsburg, but let me first make clear that in the case before us today, the Guidelines that we have are promulgated by the Commission, and were not the direct or indirect result of a Congressional act the way that the, say, the Protect Act added particular amendments to the Guidelines, so that question is not directly posed in this case. The reason I would say that even in that case there is a difference is because it is still different when Congress goes in and amends a particular Guideline in a sense in a sea of Guidelines provided by the Commission. And I think that's true, one, because amending a single Guideline doesn't change the overall character of the Guidelines. But also because, when Congress decides to take action not as a statute, but as an amendment to a Guideline, it doesn't change the fundamental character of the Guideline as a Guideline. And so after -- the Protect Act for example, specifies a period in which -- after which the Commission can then amend that Guideline. Which is obviously not a case that you can have with a statute consistent with the Presentment Clause. And to just give you another example, the Sentencing Reform Act that has brought us here today, one of the things it did was make specific amendments to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. I think when Congress does that, it doesn't make Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 a statute, it continues to be a Federal Rule, the Federal Rules Advisory Committee could still modify it after the fact, and so I think even in that case, there's a difference in effect.",
  "I think it should make -­ well, I guess what I would respond to that, Justice Souter, is this. I think that one thing that emerges from this Court's recent Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, is that the impact on the defendant himself or herself is not the only test that this Court looks to. Because from the perspective of an individual defendant, they don't care if they've gotten five extra years because a judge made a finding under a discretionary regime, or they got five extra years because the judge made a finding that the legislature told the judge to make, the practical effect is the same.",
  "Well, I think again, as Justice Stevens suggested earlier, I mean, that may be true if you focus in on that single fact under the Guideline system, but under the myriad of various ways that your Guidelines sentence can go up or down, it may be inappropriate under the Federal Guideline system to focus in on the point of analysis on that particular interval, of just the one -",
  "Because, again, as a defendant, you may have a case where there are five or six potential enhancements, and there are five or six potential departures, and your sentence is going to be a product of the judicial fact finding that goes in, in making those various conclusions -",
  "I don't disagree with that characterization of the Guidelines, but I still think that is a difference from a pure statutory scheme, it's different from a scheme like this Court had before it in Blakely against Washington, where the statute focuses you in on just a couple of factors and you really can re­ conceptualize that regime as providing for a base offense level and one or two aggravated grades of the offense. As Judge Lynch observed in language that we quoted on page four of our reply brief, you really can't re-conceptualize the Guideline system that way.",
  "I agree, Justice Souter, and the point isn't that it's more complicated. If I just continue with Judge Lynch's observation, which, as I say, is quoted on page four of our reply brief, it's not just that it's complicated, it's that the mission of the Guidelines system is, once, assuming that somebody's been convicted of some Federal crime with certain elements defined by Congress, then, what the Guidelines ask the judge to do is evaluate the incident of criminal activity and assess an appropriate punishment without regard to whether it has met the certain elements of a particular Federal crime. And so, the really, the focus is quite different, and in that sense, I think there is, there is more than a difference of form between a set of guidelines produced by a legislature and a set of guidelines produced by the sentencing commission.",
  "Well, I think there are differences between the two. I think if you look at the Washington system that you had before you in the Blakely case, it was a product of the legislature, and so, not surprisingly, there was a focus on the crimes as defined by the legislature, there was a presumptive range for each crime, and then there were a handful of things that got you into - added three years, like a firearm, and then there was basically the upward departure authority or the downward departure authority, and that was it. And that makes sense; a legislature is going to be predominantly focused on the statutorily defined crimes. In the context of the Guidelines, on the other hand, it is a much more widely variant focused, and what it's focusing on is the criminal activity as a whole. There are many factors that can increase it, there's many factors that can decrease it, and",
  "I don't think so. I think in that, in that context we would be limited to an argument to asking this Court to overrule Blakely. But that is not to say that, that, what I want to make the point, though, is ultimately if pushed ­ and your hypothetical pushes us - if pushed, the argument is one of form, that the fact that these emanate from the sentencing commission makes a constitutional difference. But I don't want to lose the fact in making that concession that there is still a real difference between the way the Federal Guidelines work and the way the Washington Guidelines work, and the Federal Guidelines work exactly as you would expect: sentencing guidelines promulgated by an entity located in the Article III branch, and consisting of Article III members; and the Washington Guidelines system works",
  "That's true, Justice Ginsburg, but there",
  "Still in the judicial branch, Justice Scalia, and there are the same number of judicial members on the Commission now as there were when this Court considered the Mistretta decision. And I think Mistretta itself recognized that you could have bodies located in the judicial branch that were auxiliary to the judicial branch, even if they consisted, quote, \"solely of non-judges.\" So I don't think that's what's dispositive. I think what's dispositive ultimately is what this Court recognized in the Mistretta decision. In the Mistretta decision, this Court made clear that the Commission was constitutionally located in the Article III branch precisely because it did not take on the quintessentially legislative tasks of setting maximum punishments and defining the elements of Federal crimes.",
  "I think that's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice. And I can talk more about that in terms of the severability issue, which is question two. But I think especially if you get to the point where prospectively the proposal is to treat sentencing enhancement factors under the Guidelines exactly as if they're elements of Federal crimes, they would have to be included in indictments and have to be charged to the jury on beyond a reasonable doubt. Then I don't see how Mistretta survives anymore or at least how Mistretta allows that particular judicial remedy to go forward. Because at that point, you've really had the Commission become transformed into precisely what this Court said it wasn't, as a matter of constitutional law, in the Mistretta case.",
  "Justice Kennedy, I think that the thrust of respondents' position -- they can obviously speak for themselves to this point, but I think the thrust of their position is in for a penny, in for a pound, that if you extend Blakely to the guidelines, then that's it, the guidelines go out. I think the consequence of accepting the Government's position here, that the guidelines are different, would not foreclose the possibility for a more fine-tuned analysis that focused on the particular effects of particular guidelines ranges, or the particularly enhancing factors and the like. And I think one thing that ought to give the Court caution before it extends Blakely all the way to the guidelines is, if you look at the guidelines, there are certainly some enhancing factors or some factors that increase punishment under the guidelines, that look nothing like any traditional element of any crime.",
  "Well, I mean, two things, Justice Kennedy. I don't want to get too far afield in the sense that we think that for purposes of this case, the Court could distinguish the guidelines and could still maintain the very bright line of Blakely as applies to legislative enactments. But if this Court were going to either, with respect to legislative enactments or in the particular field of the guidelines, try to develop another test to differentiate elements from - I'm sorry, elements from sentencing factors, I think this Court could get guidance in the same kind of analysis that it's done in the context of affirmative defenses. As Apprendi itself recognized, in the Patterson case, this Court decided that in that context, it would not adopt one bright line or another and just give up the enterprise of drawing lines in between. And I think a similar enterprise could be done under the guise of dealing with the guidelines. But I think the thrust of the Government's position here today is that you shouldn't accept the Respondent's particular challenge to the guidelines because that does have the effect of \"in for a penny, in for a pound,\" and wiping the guidelines out.",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, let me try to answer it as best as I can. I want to make the observation, though, that the only estimate I can give you is based on retrospective data, obviously, and it could be ­",
  "I'm not sure that's right, Justice Stevens. Let me answer it this way, because I can only answer it based on the data I have.",
  "I understand, and let me answer it this way, which is looking retrospectively at the data from 2002. If you consider all the cases that either went to trial or pled and that, they're not differentiated, the two aren't differentiated, then about 65 percent of the cases raise a potential Blakely or Apprendi type issue, so that would be the starting point for the analysis. Now, as you pointed -",
  "Yes, that's 65 -",
  "The numbers that we have is 65 percent. Basically, you have 44 percent of the cases involve some chapter II or chapter III enhancement or adjustment to the base level. And then we've kind of looked, in addition to the 44 percent, we've looked at the drug cases, which by the nature of the drug sentencing table, virtually all of the drug cases, if they don't implicate a mandatory minimum, involve a potential Blakely upward adjustment. And so what we've done is, in looking at these numbers, is to basically take all the drug cases and then subtract that",
  "Well, again, Justice Stevens, I don't know, because that comes to a second question, which is, if I understand your question, which is, we know that 65 percent of the cases raise a potentially, a potential Blakely issue. Then the question is, well, if 97 percent of the cases settle, is there a way to sort of waive Blakely rights and the like, and make this workable going forward? And it's hard to know what the, what, what system will emerge.",
  "Well, again, I can only give you the numbers -",
  "Again, Justice Stevens, I want to answer as best I can. The figures I have suggest that 65 percent of the cases do involve an upward adjustment of some kind. And so there is a Blakely problem. So the only real question is, all right, 65 percent of cases in the world where nobody thought Blakely was a problem for the guidelines involve those kind of upward adjustments. There may be ways through plea agreements and the like to have people waive their Blakely rights in certain ways that may make the system work a little bit better or deal with a slightly reduced number of cases. But I think any way you slice this, this is going to have a tremendous impact on the reality of criminal sentencing in the Federal system.",
  "Well, I, well let me try to address the remedial question then going forward. If this Court were to find that Blakely is fully applicable to the guidelines, then that's going to raise some very serious and complex remedial questions. One question, though, I think ought to be clear, is that one option that shouldn't be on the table is the idea that on a prospective basis, the guidelines are severable in a way that makes all enhancements or all upward adjustments completely unavailable, and all downward departures fully available. Because that system is obviously nothing that Congress intended. Now Respondents, for their part, don't propose that rule, although they want to benefit from effectively that rule for their own cases. What they suggest is that on a going-forward basis, you could include the sentencing enhancing factors as, in the indictment and then send them to the jury as effectively de facto elements of the crime to be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Now with respect, I think that so-called Blakely-ization of the guidelines creates an enormous amount of judicial lawmaking and raises very serious separation of powers problems.",
  "Well, with respect, Justice Souter, I think it is fairly ambitious judicial lawmaking. You do have to take out a fair amount of text to get the sentencing judge effectively out of the business of fact-finding.",
  "You have to take out the reference in 3553(b), that talks about what the court finds, and then it makes a definite reference to the court needing to find things in order to have upward and downward departures.",
  "And I think then ­",
  "And as we point out in our brief, there are plenty of statutes that refer to the court in distinction from the jury. I think then if you look at 3742(e), which is the appeal right, if you look at 3742(e), makes it quite clear that on appeal, courts of appeals are supposed to defer to the, to the fact, the facts found by the district court. Now I think in the context of the overall provision for judicial review, that is clearly a reference to the judge, not to the jury.",
  "Well, with respect, I don't think there's any way to avoid a potentially unconstitutional system going forward, because if you treat these guideline factors that were clearly created by the Commission and in some cases created by Congress, on the assumption that they would be used for judge fact-finding, and then send them to the jury, then what you've done prospectively -- it's one thing -- let me put it this way. It's one thing to recognize that the guideline factors that are enhancements have the effect of increasing sentences and operate like elements of crimes for retrospective constitutional analysis, for finding a Sixth Amendment problem, but it is quite another thing to prospectively treat those factors exactly as if they're elements of crimes, force them to be included in the indictment, send them to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.",
  "Well, I actually don't think that follows, Justice Stevens, because I think taking guidelines that were clearly designed for judge fact finding and sending them to the jury --",
  "No. What my submission is, is that taking guidelines that were designed for judge fact finding and sending them and using them for jury fact finding is going to have a very disproportionate impact on some cases. Let me give you an example if I could, to make the point. If you think of two fraud cases that under the guidelines",
  "I think it would, Justice Stevens. And if I could -- I'll keep it a very simple fraud example.",
  "Well, it might not make as much a difference in the drug case --",
  "Well, here's how it could make a difference, if I could use the fraud example.",
  "And then you may be able to see how it could or could not relate to the marijuana example or a drug example. In the context of a fraud case, two fraud cases that are sentenced the exact same way and treated as uniform and proportional under the current system",
  "In the number of victims. And what you'll have is -- if you think of one fraud that involved one victim and a slightly higher amount of money, and another fraud that involved many victims and a slightly lower amount of money, the current guideline system basically tries to treat them the same. Now with a single fraud victim, the idea of Blakely-izing the guidelines may be relatively straightforward. You include the loss amount in the indictment. You put a special verdict form with the amount of loss on it. And you call in that one witness, and you can prove up your case beyond a reasonable doubt. But if you have a case of telemarketing --",
  "I don't think it would, Justice Stevens.",
  "But that's what, what I want to contrast it is with",
  "Sure. Imagine that you have a telemarketing fraud where a thousand peoples -­ a thousand individuals have been milked out of a couple of dollars each. Now under the current system, proving up the fraud amount for the judge is not that difficult because you can get the probation officer to testify, or some other way to get the total amount of the fraud in front of the judge. Under the system that Respondents propose, you're going to have to call in every one of 2,000 individuals who was defrauded. Otherwise, I think it's going to be very difficult to prove that fraud amount in front of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. And that just is one example of the disproportionate and disuniform effects",
  "I think it would be very",
  "Well, I suppose ­",
  "Well, again, I think whatever else is true, what you would be doing with such a system is you'd be taking factors that I think everyone concedes were designed by a Commission that was upheld as constitutional precisely because it did not have the effect of creating new Federal crimes and statutory limits.",
  "No, I understand that, Justice Scalia. I'm trying to talk about the remedial question, though.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think we don't have enough experience to know. I think I can tell you one thing: that with a lot of enhancements, putting something in the indictment is not necessarily the difficult step. There are some things like relevant conduct that can be very challenging to try to formulate in an indictment. But for a lot of the factors that enhance a sentence, it's relatively easy to put it in the indictment itself. I think the trickier difficulties come up in terms of trying to instruct the jury, especially in cases where there are multiple enhancements.",
  "That's completely right, Mr. Chief Justice. And those cases are just out.",
  "And that's never been the under -- I mean, that's true, there may be some cases that you could bring a separate perjury prosecution, but this court",
  "Well, there may be situations where there's an obstruction of justice that wouldn't necessarily make out all the elements of a perjury prosecution.",
  "Well, Justice Souter, with respect, I mean, this Court, both before the guidelines and after the guidelines, rejected the argument that the only way to enhance a sentence for obstruction of justice was to bring a separate perjury prosecution.",
  "But that's",
  "That's what this Court had before it in Dunnigan. And this Court said that that was not problematic. It was obstruction during the trial. And this Court upheld it on reliance on Grayson, a pre-guidelines case, and this Court said that the additional rigor and predictability instilled by the guidelines did not make a constitutional difference.",
  "I think that's a fair summary, Justice Breyer. I think on sort of how complicated it gets to take something that was designed for a judge and then send it before the jury in jury instructions, I would ask the Court to look at the Medas case, which we cite on page 15 of our reply brief.",
  "Assuming I understand the approach you propose, there would be nothing wrong with taking that approach.",
  "I would -- I would take the approach that you should make the advisory -- the advisory guidelines -- the guidelines as advisory. Now, with respect to whether or not you've escaped from the burden of serving on the sentencing commission, I don't think that the reading of 3742, the appeal provision, that you've envisioned is necessarily foreordained. I think ­ -",
  "A couple of observations, Justice Scalia. First of all, you're exactly right, since 1812 we've abandoned a system where judges can define the elements of crimes. And that's why, if I leave you with one thought on the remedy, I would think that it's inappropriate to allow an entity within the judicial branch to have that effect on a prospective basis. I think that would be a very serious separation of powers problem. I think it would dwarf the separation of powers problem that at least you found quite significant in the Mistretta case. Now, if I can address Justice Kennedy's question about the appeals system simply replicating the Apprendi or the Blakely problem. First of all, we would suggest that the appeal process that you've envisioned would not violate Apprendi and Blakely. And that's one of the reasons that we think the Commission wouldn't violate Blakely. Because what we see is a distinction in this court's cases. They have said this Court has said that judicial discretionary sentencing doesn't implicate the Sixth Amendment. This Court has said that legislative-directed sentencing does implicate the Sixth Amendment. What the guidelines present is a situation of judicial sentencing that's directive. We would suggest -- we would suggest --",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I can point you to the DiFrancesco case, where this Court approved an earlier Federal statute that allowed for appeals in sentencing.",
  "Well, I think our position would be that that kind of system would be constitutional. As I was suggesting to Justice Kennedy, we think, because that system would be constitutional, we think the guidelines are also constitutional. I think Justice Kennedy is right, though, that somebody that says that that system is unconstitutional and the guidelines is unconstitutional is not going to be particularly impressed by that reading of 3742 that gets you to that result. And that's why I want to leave you with an important thought, which is, that reading of 3742 is not foreordained. This court could say that the guidelines should be applied in an advisory fashion, and that all that would be left of the Government -­",
  "But, Justice O'Connor, that's why, to be clear, we've only argued in favor of an advisory view of the guidelines if we get to the remedial question, because I think you're absolutely right, if you look at what Congress actually intended, it's crystal clear they did not intend the guidelines to be advisory. But it's equally crystal clear they didn't intend the guidelines to be the basis for jury fact- finding.",
  "I think that actually would be the proper remedy. That's effectively what we ask for, Mr. Chief Justice. And -­",
  "No, I think that's fair, Justice Ginsburg. I mean, in responding to Justice Breyer's hypothetical, I didn't mean that was the only way to get to the result we've propose. And the particular way, in our briefs, that we suggest that you would get to an advisory use of the guidelines on a prospective basis is precisely as you suggest. You don't read 3553(b) to change \"may\" to \"shall\"; instead, you read it, unfortunately, I guess, if we've reached the remedial question, to be unconstitutional. And then, at that point, you focus in on 3553(a) -­",
  "Absolutely. Absolutely.",
  "Exactly. And then if I could just -­",
  "Well, I think -­",
  "Well, I don't see how it works in 3742(e), because if you read that section in context it's talking about determinations made by the court, it's talking about determinations made by the court after the presentence report comes in -­",
  "-- and so I think that 3742(e) has to go. I think the fairer -­",
  "Well, I think the fairer reading of 3553(b) is that it has to go, too. I know that you don't agree with -­",
  "I think you disagree with me on that. I think 994 -- 99 -- 994(a), in Title 28, which talks about the guidelines being for the use of the sentencing court, I would suggest that has to go, but I assume you would say sentencing court can mean sentencing judge. Then at that point, there's a provision of rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that must go, because it talks about the role of the district court in a way that I don't think you can, sort of, find to mean the jury. And then I think, obviously, the sentencing guidelines provision that makes clear that it is the judge that's to make the findings by a preponderance of the evidence, has to go, as well. So I think that is -- that is -- that is the sum total of the carnage of deciding -­",
  "-- that the guidelines are fully applicable with Blakely.",
  "I think very, very many of them. I mean, I can't give you a better answer than that, in terms of the number. But the Medas case, on page 15 of a reply brief that I suggested the Court look at, provides one example. There, you had a case where it had already gone to the, to the jury on a general verdict, and it had the typical kind of general verdict form you see. It's had a six-count indictment. There were 12 boxes, guilty/non-guilty for each of the six crimes in the indictment. Then when there was a concern that Blakely might require jury findings on all the various enhancements, the Government tried to put in a 20-page supplemental special verdict that tried to walk through the various factors that the jury would try to find. I think that just, in miniature, shows you the kind of transformation you're talking about. You go from a 12-line general verdict form, which is the classic kind of verdict form used in the criminal system, to 20 pages of a supplemental special verdict form.",
  "With respect, Justice Scalia, I think if you look at that supplemental verdict form, and you look at the guidelines, there's no other way to do it. And I think, as the judge in that case said, one of the things that comes up in virtually every guidelines case is the issue of relevant conduct. Now, that is a very, very difficult thing to try to instruct the jury on. The application notes that the Commission itself have come up in span eight and a half pages of very small, single spaced text. To try to give that as jury instructions, I think, would leave the jury completely bewildered. Then, you'd also, though, even if you could get past the instruction problems, the effect of considering relevant conduct is going to have a transformative effect on what goes before the jury, because relevant conduct asks the jury not to focus on the elements of the specific crime; the relevant conduct focuses on the other acts of that individual defendant and, if there's joint criminal, if there's a joint criminal undertaking, the reasonably foreseeable events of acts of others taken in furtherance of the joint undertaking. Now, the effect of using that guideline, designed for judges, and sending it to the jury, is effectively to transform many, many cases from individual defendant cases to scheme cases or conspiracy cases. So in tallying up the carnage and the wreckage of applying these guidelines designed clearly for judge fact-finding and willy - nilly sending them to the jury, I think you have to include the confusion and the difficulty of that.",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, I think with respect to the Sentencing Reform Act itself, the statute, the provision that we think needs to be severed is 3553(b). Then, with respect to the Guidelines, I think our view on the guidelines -­",
  "Well, the specific reference to \"shall\" -- this is basically the \"shall/may\" issue -- I think that needs to be severed. I'm not quite sure what of 3553(b) is left after you do that, but that's -- that's the important thing.",
  "Well, I think, as Justice Ginsburg suggests, 3553(a) still stands alone as telling the court that it should consider that. And I think, in fact, if you look at the legislative history, I actually think the language in 3553(b) was, was a floor amendment that was added later. So it certainly doesn't pull the whole statute down to take that one provision out of the statute. If I could reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. This Court in Mistretta expressed its understanding that the commission was constitutional because it would pursue traditional judicial tasks related to sentencing, and it would not get involved in quintessentially legislative acts of setting maximum penalties, or defining the elements of the crime. Now, we of course, think that's quite relevant for the Sixth Amendment issue that's raised in question one; but even if you disagree with us on that, even if you think the non-legislative origins of the guidelines don't matter for purposes of question one, surely they do matter for purposes of the severability analysis under question two. Because if one takes those elements, those enhancement factors in the guidelines, and treats them like true elements of crimes that must go to the jury, then you are giving this non-legislative body's work product the effect of Federal criminal statutes, and that's something that not only Mistretta suggests is problematic, but United States v. Hudson in 1812 suggests is problematic. And the effect is really breathtaking; it is an understatement to say that the effect of that judicial remedial decision would be to create thousands of new Federal crimes. Now, let me talk just for a second about the language of severability. There's been some questions about whether what we're really talking about is severability. First of all you're going to have some cases where there's going to be no enhancing factor at all. And in those cases you don't need to talk about severability. If there's no Sixth Amendment issue raised in a case, there's no reason to strike anything down and that would be a simple matter of traditional principles of third party standing and facial challenges. The fact that you might have a constitutional problem in this case, doesn't mean that you invalidate the guidelines in those other cases, where they apply without problem. The real question becomes, what do you do in a case where there is a Sixth Amendment problem, assuming Blakely applies to the guidelines? At that point, I think severability is the right way to talk about it. One way of dealing with the case at the point you recognize there's a Sixth Amendment problem in this case is to say, \"Well, there's nothing we can do about it, we can't sentence this individual to any more than the upper bound of the sentencing range.\" The second thing you can do is you can say, \"Well, okay, there's a constitutional problem, but the result is that we sever 3553(b), we don't make the guidelines mandatory, and we allow the judge to impose a discretionary sentence within the range of the statute.\" That is what we think is the appropriate solution. As a couple of you have mentioned, what we may be talking about here is an interim solution Anyway. Congress may well get involved. That's why in considering what regime of remediability or severability best serves the interests of Congress in uniformity and proportionality, it pays to pay particular attention to the cases that are in the pipeline now. And on those cases, there's no question which proposal better serves the interest of uniformity and proportionality. Respondents have to admit that they are seeking a huge sentencing windfall here. One other point that bears mention is this idea of, the suggestion that because the guidelines will not be binding in every case, the Government somehow controls the decision as to whether or not it's a guidelines case or not. That is not the case. That decision under the system will rest with the judge. If there is an enhancement sought, but it's not found in the basis of the judge, then there's no Sixth Amendment problem in that case, and the case can go forward. The irony, of course, is that the consequence of applying Blakely to the guidelines is to create more power with the prosecutor, because as Justice Breyer pointed out, under the current system of the guidelines, the prosecutor cannot control through the indictment exactly what sentencing factors the judge will consider. The Burns case, for example, that this Court had involved a situation where the judge sua sponte took notice of sentencing factors that neither the prosecutor nor the defendant very much wanted in front of the court. That will no longer be possible under a system where everything has to be in the indictment, so the result is to strengthen the hand of the Government. The last thing is this idea of bifurcation is not a panacea. I know Justice Scalia, you've thrown that out in a number of instances, but the traditional rule in cases with real elements of real Federal crimes is that you don't get to bifurcate out one element that the defendant doesn't want to put before the jury. That's the, that's the binding law in cases like Collamore out of the First Circuit and Barker out of the Ninth Circuit. So, I think it's wrong to simply suggest that, that bifurcation is going to solve all these problems. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case presents the Court with an opportunity to reaffirm that all government policies based on race are subject to strict scrutiny. The deference generally owed to the sound judgment of prison officials does not require this Court to modify its repeated statements that all government action based on race should be subject to strict scrutiny.",
  "Well, I think that this Court has recognized in a variety of contexts, including when they have -- when justices have made reference to prison policies, that all government actions based on race are subject to strict scrutiny.",
  "The First Amendment obviously has been subjected, at least when you're talking about things other than outgoing prisoner mail, to be subjected to the Turner analysis, but note -- this Court has never suggested that the Turner analysis applies to race.",
  "Absolutely, Justice Stevens. I think if the Turner analysis is correctly applied in this case, this policy does not even survive Turner analysis. I would suggest it's very analogous to the marriage policy that the Court struck down in Turner applying the Turner analysis because there the State identified a concern with inmate marriages and particularly with inmate-to-inmate marriages, and yet they adopted a policy that prohibited all inmate marriages. Here there's a concern that's expressed with newly arriving inmates, about whom California says it knows very little. Yet, it applies its policies to transferring inmates, as well as to returning parolees.",
  "Well, I think either one of those would be a constitutional --",
  "-- holding of this Court, and I think either under Turner or under strict scrutiny, it's still equally a constitutional holding. And I think it would send an improper message to suggest that there's some element of government decision-making that is somehow exempt from strict scrutiny. I think in a variety of contexts, this Court, where it generally reviews a government action deferentially -- take, for example, jury selection, peremptory challenges. Take, for example, military policy. Take, for example, congressional districting. Those are all government policies this Court generally refuse -- reviews under a highly deferential standard. Yet, nonetheless, when it comes to government policies based on race, this Court applies strict scrutiny. And in that sense, I think the racial districting cases provide a very good example because there, generally, as the Vieth case from last term illustrates, this Court is very reluctant to do any review of the districting lines that are drawn. Yet, when race is identified as being the cause for the lines being drawn, as in Miller against Johnson, this Court emphasizes that strict scrutiny applies.",
  "Well, I think that's part of it, Justice Souter. I think one thing is that particularly because of the history of this country and the use of -­ of race by governments, including in prisons, there is a concern that all government uses of race must be subjected to very heightened scrutiny.",
  "Well, again, I think, though, that there is almost a uniquely pernicious history involving race in this country, and I think, again, it is completely wrong to suggest that somehow prisons were exempt from that history. To the contrary. Throughout the Nation before Brown against Board of Education, it was common for prisons to be segregated on the basis of race.",
  "It lasts 60 days, is the best evidence.",

Nonetheless, this Court said that seven to 15 days of racial segregation was too much.",
  "Well, that's true, Justice Souter. I mean, I think if you look at Brown against Board of Education itself and you look at the various per curiam opinions that this Court issued in the wake of Brown v. Board, I don't think any of those decisions have a hallmark of being elaborate about the standard of review that the Court has applied. Nonetheless -­",
  "With respect, Justice Scalia, I disagree. The entire time these prisoners are kept at the reception center, which is a separate part of the facility where the incoming inmates go, that entire time they are segregated on the basis of race. Now, the Bureau of Prisons, for example, has a similar entry section in its various prisons. It's called the admissions and orientations process, and there, using the presentence reports that are provided for by California law, the Federal officials evaluate prisoners and their risk levels and have no need to segregate those prisoners on the basis of race.",
  "With respect, Your Honors, that misdescribes the -- the population of the Federal prisons. Part of where I think they get off on the wrong step is they do their analysis only on the offense of conviction. But a lot of the individuals in the Federal prisons are, say, for example, convicted felons who are convicted for felony in possession. And the underlying felony that led them to be, say, a 924(c) defendant was a violent felony. And so we -- there are also agreements by which the Bureau of Prisoners, on request from States, will house the State's most violent criminals. So I think that's an unfair description of what the Bureau of Prisons policy -­ or population looks like. And I think the fact that the Bureau of Prisons and virtually every other State that's looked at this issue has found a mechanism to deal with the problem of incoming inmates without resorting to race is a powerful indication that this kind of use of race is unnecessary. And the problem with applying Turner, rather than strict scrutiny, I think is well illustrated by this case and this policy. This is a policy that is expressly acknowledged to take race into account, and it is nowhere written down. If you pull the Department of Correction manual for the California prison system, there's a 94­ page chapter on the classification of inmates. Yet, this policy doesn't appear there. It's an unwritten policy. Justice Ginsburg, you asked, well, was this policy introduced in response to specific incidents of violence in a cell. The answer to that is unknowable because nobody even knows how long this policy has been in place. The official responsible for administering it acknowledged it's been in place for 25 years.",
  "What I'm suggesting, Justice O'Connor, is what the -- the application of Turner to this policy allowed. It's to allow an unwritten policy where -- of uncertain origins -­",
  "Well, it wouldn't survive a proper analysis under Turner. That is correct. But the -- the court of appeals here, applying its version of Turner, upheld this policy. And I think one way of looking at the choice between Turner and strict scrutiny is whether there is a greater threat that frequent judicial approvals of prisons' use of race will have the effect of diluting the strict scrutiny rigor or whether frequent disapprovals of prisons' use of race will have the effect of undermining the Turner deference. And the concern of the Federal Government is exactly that, that by having race policies evaluated under Turner, there will be a necessary temptation to bump up the Turner analysis in a way that strikes down racial policies.",
  "Well, I think -- I think California -- it's -- it's best described as California is one of at most a couple of States that have a comparable cell-based policy of segregation. And so I think it really is kind of the outlier in terms of that analysis. Now, there may be situations -- and we think strict scrutiny can account for them -- where States want to take race into account in particularized circumstances. And I think testing those under strict scrutiny is the proper mode of analysis.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Through the Controlled Substances Act, Congress has comprehensively regulated the national market in drugs with the potential for abuse. And with respect to Schedule I substances, like marijuana, that have both a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use in treatment, Congress categorically prohibits interstate trafficking outside the narrow and carefully controlled confines of federally approved research programs.",
  "Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, I don't think either Lopez or Morrison casts any doubt on the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act, and I think, in particular, that's because the decisions in Lopez and Morrison cited, with approval, cases like Darby and Wickard, and preserved those cases. And, of course, the concurring opinion of Justice Kennedy did so, as well.",
  "Well, Justice O'Connor, let me first say that I think it might be a bit optimistic to think that none of the marijuana that's produced consistent with California law would be diverted into the national market for marijuana. And, of course, the Controlled Substances Act is concerned, at almost every step of the Act, with a concern about diversion, both of lawful substances from medical to non-medical uses and from controlled substances under Schedule I into the national market.",
  "Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, on this record, I don't think that there's any reason to assume that California is going to have some sort of almost unnatural ability to keep one part of a fungible national drug market separate. And I think Congress, here, made important findings that you've alluded to, not just that there's a national market, not just that the intrastate and the interstate markets are linked, but that drugs are fungible, and that because drugs are fungible, it's simply not feasible, in Congress' words, to regulate and separately focus on only drugs that have traveled on interstate commerce.",

  "Well, because I think it is a reality, in responding to Justice O'Connor's question -- I think that in -- obviously, in all of these commerce - -",
  "Well, in your hypothetical -- and if I could turn to that -- I still think the analysis would not turn on whether or not the truth of the supposition that diversion could be prevented, because this Court, in a series of cases, including Darby, Wickard, Wirtz, and Perez, has made clear that the relevant focal point for analysis is not the individual plaintiff's activities and whether they have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, but whether the class of activities that Congress has decided to regulate has such a substantial effect. And, in this case, there's no question that the overall production, distribution, and possession of marijuana and other Schedule I substances has a profound effect on interstate commerce.",
  "Well, no, it doesn't, Justice Scalia, but let me respond in two ways. First of all, I think it's been clear, at least since the lottery case, that Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce includes the authority to prohibit items traveling in interstate commerce and to declare something contraband in interstate commerce.",
  "And I would suggest that it is a perfectly rational exercise of Congress' judgement to treat marijuana and other Schedule I substances not just as contraband in interstate commerce, but as contraband simpliciter, as contraband for all purposes.",
  "Well, I think there's some truth to that, Justice Scalia, but let me say this. I think what I'm saying is, I'm taking the rational that this Court accepted in Wickard, and I'm applying it to a different regulatory regime. Here, Congress - -",
  "Well, with respect, Justice Stevens, if you took a look at the Controlled Substances Act, itself, and read it literally, you'd assume that there was absolutely no market, period, in Schedule I substances. But the reality is, there's a $10.5 billion market -- illegal market, albeit -- but market in marijuana in the United States, on an annual basis. So - -",
  "Well, first of all, Justice Stevens, that's only true if there will be no diversion, to get back to - -",
  "Well, in the same way that the Federal Government has had trouble stamping out the marijuana market entirely, I think California is going to have parallel problems in absolutely preventing diversion.",
  "Oh, absolutely, Justice Kennedy. And, in that context, what this Court said is, even though it was focused on what was going to be an -- both in that case and generally, an interstate activity, Congress did not have to just look at the particular plaintiff's effect on interstate commerce, but, rather, the effect of the entire class of activities. And if I could - -",
  "Well, with respect, Justice Ginsburg, I think the whole point of the Wickard case was to extend rationales that it applied previously to commerce to activity that the Court described as economic, but not commercial. And I think the production and distribution and possession of marijuana is economic in the same way that the production of wheat was in the Wickard case.",
  "That's exactly right, Justice Souter, and that is the logic, not just of me, but of this Court's cases, in cases like Darby and Wickard and Wirtz and Perez. And I point to the Wickard case, in particular, only because it, too, involves a non - commercial enterprise or a non-commercial production of - -",
  "Well, Justice O'Connor, it could be -- I mean, any case can be distinguished on the facts, of course, but I think what's important is, this Court, in Wickard, itself, recognized that the case was -- it was only interesting because a portion of the regulated wheat involved wheat that was going to be consumed on the farm. And - -",
  "Well, that's true, Justice O'Connor, but this Court, basically, in its opinion, Justice Jackson, for the Court, put aside -- to one side all of the grain that was going to go in interstate commerce, since that's easy under our existing precedents. This case is only interesting, he said, because it involves wheat that's going to be consumed on the farm. And he specifically talked about both the wheat that would be fed to the animals, but also the wheat that would be consumed by the family. And what he said is, the intended disposition of the particular wheat wasn't clear from the record of the case. And, by that, I take him to mean that it wasn't relevant to the Court's analysis in upholding the Agricultural Adjustment Act to the wheat at issue there. And it's important to recognize that the way the Agricultural Adjustment Act worked is, it applied to all the wheat that was grown in excess of the quota, and so it applied to the wheat that was used by the family for consumption of their own bread. And, nonetheless, this Court upheld that as a valid Commerce Clause regulation. And so I think, by parity of reasoning, all of the marijuana that's at issue and covered by the Controlled Substances Act, whether it's lawful under state law, whether it's involved in a market transaction or not, is fairly within the Congress' Commerce Clause - -",
  "-- authority.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy - -",
  "I think it does, Justice Kennedy, because, as I said earlier, in responding to a question from Justice Scalia, I think if you're talking about a context where Congress has the undoubted power to prohibit something in interstate commerce entirely, and has exercised that power, so it treats something as effectively contraband in interstate commerce, and then takes the complementary step, especially in light of the fungibility of the product, and says, \"We're just going to treat this as contraband simpliciter.\" I think that judgement by Congress has a very definite link to interstate commerce and its unquestioned authority to regulate interstate commerce. And I do think there's a sense in which when Congress is regulating the price of something, there's certainly a temptation to excise out relatively small producers and for Congress to say, \"Well, we can still have effective regulation if we regulate the vast majority of production.\" But with respect to something that's unlawful to have and is -- and has very significant risks precisely because it's unlawful, any little island of lawful possession of non-contraband marijuana, for example, poses a real challenge to the statutory regime. It would also, I think, frustrate Congress' goal in promoting health. And I think the clearest example of that is the fact that, to the extent there is anything beneficial, health-wise, in marijuana, it's THC, which has been isolated and provided in a pill form, and has been available as a Schedule III substance, called - -",
  "-- Marinol.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think we would take the position, based on our reading of the Oakland Cannabis case -- and, obviously, different justices on this Court read the opinion differently and had different views on the extent to which the medical- necessity defense was foreclosed by that opinion -- I would imagine the Federal Government, in that case, if it took the unlikely step of bringing the prosecution in the first place, would be arguing that, on the authority of Oakland Cannabis, the medical-necessity defense was not available. But I think, in any event, what is important, at this point, is that we don't have a prosecution; we have an affirmative effort to strike down the Controlled Substances Act in an injunctive action. And I think, in that context, certainly Justice Souter is right, that this Court's precedents make clear that one doesn't consider only the individual's conduct, but the entire class of activities that's at issue. I think, in this regard, it's also worth emphasizing that a deeper flaw in the Respondent's argument, that California law is somehow relevant here or the fact that their conduct is lawful under California law, is that there's a mismatch between what California law makes lawful and what might be considered relevant for arguing that there's an attenuated effect on interstate commerce. Because the California law makes the possession of marijuana for medical use lawful under state law, without regard to whether that marijuana has been involved in a cash transaction or has crossed state lines. And so, if Respondents are right on their Commerce Clause theory, I don't see how they can be right because their conduct is lawful under state law or because their -- that marijuana use is medical. If they're right, then I think their analysis would extend to recreational use of marijuana, as well as medical use of marijuana, and would extend to every state in the nation, not just - -",
  "-- those states that made it lawful.",
  "Well, I don't think that is permissible, Justice Stevens. I think that's what this Court's cases in Wirtz, in Darby, in Wickard - -",
  "Under the Commerce Clause, I - - that's exactly right, that would be our position. It is constitutional on its face, and it -- and because of that line of authority, an as-applied challenge can be brought, but the legal test that's applied in the as-applied challenge is one that considers the constitutionality of the statute as a whole - -",
  "Oh, absolutely, Justice O'Connor, but - -",
  "Well, with respect, I don't think so. And I'd say two things about it. One, this Court, in Morrison and Lopez, was very important to emphasize - - thought it very important to emphasize two things: one, that the activity there was non-economic in a way that differentiated it, even from Wickard; and, second, the Court also made it clear that the regulation that there -- there was not essential to the effectiveness of an overall regulatory scheme. And I think, on both points, this case is on the constitutional side of the line that separates the Lopez and the Morrison case.",
  "I understand that -- I understand that's their argument, Justice O'Connor, but I don't understand how this Court, in Lopez, could have said that Wickard involved non-economic activity if this activity is not also covered. You're talking about - -",
  "I'm sorry if I misspoke. Economic activity. Because what you're talking about here is the possession, the manufacture, the distribution of a valuable commodity for which there is a ready - - unfortunately, a ready market, albeit an illicit market.",
  "I would be speculating, Justice Kennedy, but I think the price would go down. And I think that what -- and that, in a sense, is consistent with the government's position, which is to say, when the government thinks that something is dangerous, it tries to prohibit it. Part of the effort of prohibiting it is going to lead to a black market, where the prohibition actually would force the price up. And there is a sense in which this regulation, although not primarily designed as a price regulation -- the Controlled Substance Act, I think, does have the effect of increasing the price for marijuana in a way that stamps down demand and limits the -- and in a way that reduces demand. And I think that's all consistent with Congress' judgement here. And if I could return for a second to the point about Marinol, what's important there is that the process of manufacturing of Marinol, and isolating the one helpful component, does two things. One, the manufacturing process allows there to be a safe use for one of the components in marijuana. But it also provides an unambiguous hook for Congress to exercise its Commerce Clause authority. And yet the overall regime of trying to get people to use more healthful substances, and not use things like crude marijuana that have harmful effects, is undermined if Congress can't also address that which is more harmful, but is distinct only because it is capable of being locally produced. And that's exactly what crude marijuana is.",
  "Well, I think, in responding to that, Justice Stevens, I would say, obviously, for purposes of federal law, the idea of medical marijuana is something of an oxymoron, because the Federal Government treats it as a Schedule I substance. Now, notwithstanding that, some doctors may make a different judgement about a particular patient; but that's something that this Court, I think, has previously understood, that the federal regulatory regime does not allow individual patients or doctors to exempt themselves out of that regime.",
  "I think that's the import of the Rutherford decision with Laetrile.",
  "Well, it depends on the exact hypothetical you have in mind. I think the -- the judicial finding that I think would be appropriate, and this Court would not have to ignore in any way, is a finding by the D.C. Circuit that, in a particular case where there's a rescheduling effort before the FDA, that the underlying judgement of the FDA refusing to reschedule is invalid, arbitrary, capricious. That's the way to go after the finding that marijuana is a Schedule I substance without a valid medical use in treatment. This is not a situation in -- and your hypothetical might respond to a different statute that raised a harder question, where Congress made such a medical finding, and then just left it there without any mechanism to adjust the finding for changing realities. But, here, Congress made it clear that a process remains open to reschedule marijuana in a way that gets it onto Schedule II or Schedule III. And I think it's wrong to assume that there's any inherent hostility to the substances at issue here. I mean, the FDA, for example, rescheduled Marinol from Schedule II to Schedule III in a way that had the effect of making it easier to prescribe and more available. But I think what's going on with the FDA is an effort to try to counterbalance the risk for abuse, the risk for diversion, with these other considerations of getting safe medicine - -",

There was also a series of, kind of, a four- or five- iteration effort to change the rescheduling that culminated in a D.C. Circuit opinion in the early '90s. So there's definitely been these efforts. But on the current state of the -- of the record, there just is not a justification for changing the schedule. And I think both of the briefs talked a little bit about the Institute of Medicine's study about the medical efficacy of marijuana. And I think one thing that's important to keep in mind that that study comes to a conclusion about is, whatever benefits there may be for the individual components in marijuana, that smoked - - smoked marijuana itself really doesn't have any future as medicine, because -- and that's true, I think, for two reasons. One, there's something like 400 different chemical components in crude marijuana that one would smoke, and it's -- it just, sort of, belies any logic that all 400 of those would be helpful. And a big part of the process of medicine, generally, is to take raw, crude material that somebody could grow in their garden, and actually have people who do this for a living get involved in a process of synthesizing and isolating the beneficial components, and then manufacturing and making that available. The second reason that smoked marijuana doesn't have much of a future as medicine is, as I think people understand, smoking is harmful; and that's true of tobacco, but it's also true of marijuana. And so the idea that smoked marijuana would be an effective delivery device for medicine, I think, is also something that really doesn't have any future as medicine. What does have a future for medicine, of course, is an effort to synthesize and isolate the beneficial component. That's been done with Marinol. It is true that some people have difficulty tolerating the pill form that Marinol is available in. And there's ongoing research to try to figure out different ways to deliver that substance. But there is, in a sense, a little bit of a -- and the Institute of Medicine's study has about five pages discussing Marinol, and it makes the point that there's something of a tradeoff. Because one of the downsides of Marinol, as opposed to marijuana, is that it takes longer to get into the bloodstream. But that's also one of the reasons why the FDA has made a judgement that Marinol is less subject to abuse, because it takes longer to get into the drug-stream, and so it doesn't have the characteristic of street drugs that tend to be abused, which is a very quick delivery time between the taking of the substance and the time that it has an effect on the system.",
  "With respect, Justice Souter, I don't think that it would be a good idea for this Court to get on a path of starting to second-guess Congress' judgement about defining a class of activities - -",
  "Well, Justice Souter, I have no doubt that this Court could draw a line. I think it would find it very difficult to police that line over the broad variety of cases. I think it would find it every bit as frustrating as policing the line in Hammer against Dagenhart that this Court abandoned in Darby. With that, I'd like to reserve my time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: As I understand Respondents' position, it's effectively that their clients, and clients like them, in their use of medical marijuana, is somehow so hermetically sealed from the rest of the market on marijuana that it has no effect on that market on marijuana and no effect on the government's overall regulatory regime. And I understand that to be true largely because of state law. And one of the many problems with that mode of analysis is that the state law is not designed only to carve out those transactions that have no effect on interstate commerce or no effect on the federal regulatory regime. Proposition 215 was not passed as an exercise in cooperative federalism; it was passed as an effort to make medical marijuana lawful to possess, whether you bought it in interstate commerce, whether you bought it with the marijuana having traveled in interstate commerce, whether you bought it, whether you grew it yourself. There's a fundamental mismatch with their theory that really, I think, undermines their theory. Now, there's the question now about what kind of impact this would have on the federal enforcement scheme. Now, we, in our reply brief, try to use the numbers from one of Respondents' own amici, and we suggest that there's a hundred-thousand people that might be lawful medical users, if their position prevails. Now, obviously, this is all an effort in, sort of, counter-factual speculation, so the numbers may be a bit off. But they suggest that our own government numbers are somehow better, and they cite them on page 18 of the red brief. But the only numbers on the red brief for California suggest that, in the four counties for which there are data, there was - - .5 percent of the people use marijuana. Now, if you extend that out statewide to the 34 million people in California, that gives you 170,000 people. So their numbers -- using the government numbers actually give you more potentially affected people. I think in trying to figure out how many people would be affected, it's worth considering what medical conditions are covered. And this responds to Justice Kennedy's last question, Is this just limited to AIDS or people with terminal cancer? And it's not. And if you want to look at what is covered as a serious medical condition under the statute, you can turn to page 7(a) of the red brief, in the appendix to the red brief, and it suggests that a serious medical condition -- there's a catchall at the end that includes subsection 12 -- \"Any other chronic or persistent medical system that, if not alleviated, may cause serious harm to the patient's safety or physical or mental health.\" Now, I think that is an exceedingly broad definition of a serious medical condition for which somebody could be -- get a recommendation for marijuana for medical uses. Another point worth considering, in considering the impact on the federal regulatory regime or the effectiveness of California in preventing any diversion, is to take a look at two cases we cite in our reply brief. One is the People against Wright. There's somebody who's arrested with 19 ounces, over a pound, of marijuana. They're packaged such that he has one small bag in his pocket, six other small bags wrapped with a scale in his backpack, two other larger bags in that backpack, and then a pound wrapped in a shirt in the back of his truck. And yet the Appellate Court in California said that he was entitled to go to the jury with the theory that that was for medical use. The fact that he had a scale, and the fact that it was packaged the way it was, could be explained to the jury because he had just boughten it, and that he used the scale to make sure he wasn't ripped-off. I think that shows that it's going to be very hard to enforce the regulatory regime. The other case in the reply brief worth mentioning is the Santa Cruz case, because that's a case where a Federal District Court, after Raich came out, said that it could not enforce the DA and the Controlled Substances Act against a 250-person cooperative. And that just shows that this is not something that will be limited to one or two users at a time, but will have a substantial impact on the government's ability to enforce the Controlled Substances Act. Thank you.",
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case, like the Totten case almost 130 years ago, is at bottom an effort by alleged spies to obtain additional compensation for services rendered.",
  "That's correct. That's correct, Justice O'Connor, with respect to the kind of espionage arrangements and contracts we're talking about.",
  "Well, Justice O'Connor, I think that actually points up the important differences between the way that the CIA deals with its employees and the way that it deals with its espionage agents like respondents are alleged to be.",
  "With respect to espionage agents -­",
  "I believe that's true, Justice O'Connor, because the espionage agents do not sign prepublication review agreements. They do not receive formal security clearances the way that an employee does. And unlike an employee, they do not have access to a broad swath of classified information that raises attendant counterintelligence concerns. And so if you think about the course of dealing that the agency has with its employees, the employees are able to sue the agency in court under, for example, title VII, and the agency can turn around and sue their employees to enforce things like the prepublication review agreement that was issue -- at issue in this Court's Snepp decision. So in the employment context, I think it's very difficult to say that there's an implied term of the employment contract that either side will not have judicial recourse.",
  "If I understand your hypothetical, Justice Stevens, I think that individual would be treated as an espionage agent if it's just somebody for sort of a one-off assignment. And I think that -- that is illustrated by this Court's decision in Totten. I mean, William Lloyd, for example, was a U.S. citizen. He agreed with President Lincoln to engage in espionage activities in the south. And this Court held that when the estate of -- of Mr. Lloyd came to seek compensation from a court, that there was no judicial remedy to enforce that alleged agreement, and the remedy, if any, lay with the President's contingent fund.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, it's a difficult question to answer because I think there are a lot of different strains underlying the Totten decision, and I think there is -­",
  "Well, Justice O'Connor, I think it's better understood as simply a rule of dismissal, that it's not really a pure jurisdictional defect. It's been referred alternatively as a jurisdictional bar or as a rule of dismissal, and of course, as this Court reminded us recently in the Kontrick decision, people tend to use terms like jurisdiction loosely in these contexts.",
  "Well -­",
  "Well -­",
  "Justice Kennedy, I think the general practice of the Government is to file under both. I believe that's what happened here. I think the fact that we file under both suggests that there is a little bit of confusion about it. I would tend to agree with you it's better understood as a rule of dismissal under 12(b)(6) because if you think about the Totten decision, there's really two strains to the decision. One is a recognition that the claim to relief necessarily depends on a fact that the law has always regarded as secret, and in a sense that case simply can't proceed. And that's very analogous to this Court's holding in Weinberger against Catholic Action. There's a second strain to the case, though, and that is that the very idea of walking into court and filing the action is inconsistent with an implied term of the contract or, indeed, the whole nature of the espionage relationship. And I think particularly if you emphasize that second strain of the Totten decision, I think it's better understood as a 12(b)(6) dismissal because what you're really saying is somebody is walking into court and they are effectively pleading themselves out of court because as -- if you look at this complaint here, it starts out with a recitation of the fact that these individuals allegedly engaged in espionage activities and that they were denied certain promises that were made to them after they carried out, quote, their end of the bargain.",
  "I -- I mean, I -- you know, one -­ one way of thinking about it, but I think it's a very rough analogy, is it's almost like an unlawful contract. It's a contract that the law just doesn't recognize. And I think that -- that reflects the underlying reality of these cases, which is there is something inherent in an espionage relationship that when you enter an espionage relationship, you understand that you have no protected status under the law. I think that has, with respect, been clear in the -- not just in the Totten decision but from the very beginning of the republic. I mean, ever since Nathan Hale agreed to cross British lines as a spy, it was understood that he had no legal recourse, that he had a status that was not recognized at the law. And I think that is -- it has always been thus, and I think there is no reason to revisit the -­",
  "I -- I don't believe that's true, Justice Stevens, and what I would distinguish is between a constitutional claim that an -- an agent -- an alleged agent might have that doesn't depend on the espionage relationship. As I would understand your question, I mean, it would -- there would be a -- a substantive due process claim that anybody could bring if the Government tortured them. They wouldn't have to allege that I had a secret espionage relationship with the Government and then they tortured me. That would be irrelevant to their claim.",
  "Well, Justice -­",
  "No, that's not the position, and -- and I -- and I apologize if I gave that impression in answering Justice Stevens' hypothetical. I understood to be the hypothetical that you had a Government employee who engaged in a separate spy endeavor, if you will, and then tried to sue to collect on the damages owed under that -­ for that particular endeavor.",
  "Exactly. And as I indicated to you earlier, Justice Stevens -- that in a sense that's not a hypothetical. That's the Totten decision itself. William Lloyd was -- or at least alleged that he was employed by President Lincoln to engage in those services. And in answer to Justice Scalia's question, if William Lloyd happened to be an employee of the -- of the Comptroller of Currency or something, he could still sue to get whatever remedies he had -­",
  "That's exactly right. No bonus dollars for being a spy under those circumstances.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg, but the point is that the reason that -- that I think that the Government would have had almost no ability to invoke a Totten-type defense in Webster or in a title VII case is because of its course of dealing with its employees. And I suppose that if the agency completely changed its course of dealing with respect to its employees or entered a very different course of dealing with certain select employees, then a Totten defense might become available in those circumstances. But as I indicated earlier, I think if you look at the overall nature of the agency's relationship and rights vis-a-vis its employees, even its covert ones, that's a very different relationship than the agency has with respect to espionage agents. And again, that's because they enter contracts with them. Each side has certain litigation rights, and I think it would be a bit of a stretch for the Government to come in and say that there's an implied term of that employment agreement that forecloses a judicial remedy.",
  "That's exactly right, Justice Scalia.",
  "Certainly not -- I'm not aware of such a suit, and I've been told by the agency that it's impossible. And I think it just reflects the nature of these agreements, and it does -- it -­",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in fact we have abandoned it. We abandoned that position at the cert stage. We made that clear to the Court in our certiorari papers, and we don't renew any type of jurisdictional objection at this stage.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I think the answer to that is that it probably is jurisdictional in the pure sense and so if this Court disagreed with our view that there wasn't a Tucker Act problem, this Court could reach that issue and send the case back on the Tucker Act grounds. So maybe I could explain to you why it is that we think that there's not a Tucker Act problem, at least at this stage of the litigation. The Ninth Circuit's reasoning on this was a little bit oblique, but as I understand it, there were two parts to it. First of all, that there might be some kind of substantive due process claim here that did not depend on the contract but rather somehow stemmed from the fact that there was some endangerment of these individuals and that gave rise to some substantive due process right. And even if that claim, as the Ninth Circuit recognized, is not one that is formed on the contract or an implied contract, it seems to me that that's a claim that's clearly within the coverage of the Totten doctrine because it is inherent in the espionage relationship that the individual will be engaged in a -- in a situation where they will be endangered. And I think that was certainly true of William Lloyd in the Totten case. When he crossed southern lines, he was very much endangered, and that's something that wasn't lost on President Lincoln. In footnote 3 of our opening brief, we have a quotation from President Lincoln about the inherent dangers of spies crossing lines and the need for secrecy to protect that. So that's why I think that claim is properly understood as not being covered by the Tucker Act and not being required to be brought in the Court of Claims, but nonetheless a claim that is barred by the Totten doctrine. The other point they made was with respect to the specific regulations that the agency has internally, and they suggest that there might be a claim here that was based on the regulations independent of the contract. But in order for that claim to go forward, the Court would have to examine the unredacted version of the regulations. And even if the Court is right that there's a need for further proceedings on that question, it makes no sense to interpret the doctrine in a way that requires the Government to wait to assert a Totten defense until there is a jurisdictional question cleared up that actually requires discovery because I think what Totten recognized is -- is there is a need to dismiss the claim at the outset before any discovery because of the nature of the suit. So for those two reasons, we thought that the -­ that the better view was that the Tucker Act problem was either not presented because of the substantive due process claim or not ripe and that we would pursue the Totten act.",
  "Well, I think whatever the status the contract question has, whether it's 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6), I think it's a -- it's a threshold issue and I think this Court under the Rohrgas authority can reach that issue at the outset. And I think it would be particularly perplexing to have a doctrine that said that when we have a suit that we know on the face of the complaint cannot be brought in any court, that we are going to not reach that issue in favor of trying to determine first which court it properly belongs in, when that inquiry in fact will get us into the exact classified information that we know at the outset the suit should not involve in the first place. And I think there is enough flexibility in this Court's Rohrgas decision to allow the Court to reach that threshold question first.",
  "I -- I think that follows, Justice Kennedy. I think one of the difficulties with the constitutional theory that's advanced on the other side is it gives -- it seeks a right to enforce internal procedural handling mechanisms for claims that we know there's no legitimate expectation for their enforcement at all. And it seems odd that this would develop in a way where the procedural rights somehow trump the substantive rights, and we know from Totten that there is no substance here that can be brought forward in the courts. I think in this respect it is also important to recognize that, as a practical matter, an agent who's negotiating in the shadow of the Totten decision and the broader understanding that Totten reflects is likely to seek assurances not just about compensation but about how -- how their claims would be heard by the CIA and how they're going to get their compensation. And I think there's no particular reason to think procedural assurances should be judicially enforceable when the substantive assurances are not. Now, one other point to make about the nature of these agreements. Not only because of the nature of these agreements does the agency end up in a position where it cannot enforce these contracts itself through judicial actions, but it also ends up in a situation where it may have to give up-front payments that it otherwise wouldn't have to give and the like. So there are consequences to both sides of dealing in this way with these espionage relationships as effectively outside the law. But again, it has always been thus, and I think there is no principle in -- in any recent development that requires this Court to revisit the rule of Totten which, as I said, suggests an -- it reflects an understanding that date backs -­ dates back much further. If I can make one other point, which is I think even though the Totten decision reflects something more than the state secrets privilege, because there's a more fundamental defect with a suit that's premised on an espionage agreement than just the fact that it tends to compromise secret information, it is true that applying the Totten rule of dismissal does provide a clear mechanism that protects confidential information. And I would analogize it to this Court's decision in Snepp where the Court adopted a constructive trust arrangement. The Court adopted that arrangement where -- where an employee who violated a -- a prepublication review agreement had to turn over all the proceeds to the Government. And -- and the Court adopted that remedy in favor of a damages remedy, and the Court did so to send a clear signal to the employees that there is no incentive whatsoever to violate the terms of these agreements. In the same way, having a clear rule of dismissal sends a clear message to espionage agents that there's no point in even bothering to file the suit in the first place. It will simply be dismissed.",
  "Justice Stevens, there is such a statute. There's a statutory provision that gives the authority. It had been with the -- with the Director of Central Intelligence. The recent Intelligence Reform Act has transferred it to the Director of National Intelligence. But it gives a requirement that the -- that -- that the director protect sources and methods. I think that that -- that statutory provision is consistent with the general notion behind the Totten doctrine, but I don't think it's -­",
  "I don't think it -- it certainly doesn't impose any kind of monetary penalty. There are, under certain circumstances, criminal penalties for the disclosure of classified information, but I think that the -­",
  "I think it is. It's protected both by the sources and method provision, and I think revelation of a source could implicate the -- the criminal prohibitions in the statute as well. And I think that this statute -- I think you can see the extent to which this -- this case implicates the core of the secrets that the agency has. This Court in the Sims case described the sources and methods protected by the statute as the heart of the intelligence community.",
  "And this case involves both.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, there's a couple of points to be made about that. One, as this Court recognized in Reynolds -- in the Reynolds state secrets context itself, even the provisions of going forward, no matter what innovations have been made, the -- the provisions of going forward and handling classified information necessarily involve risks that the information will be disclosed. In the first place, both Totten and the state secrets privilege itself are premised on the notion that the information, if it is in fact privileged, is withheld from the case. It's an absolute privilege. So the idea is not that you have some sort of limited disclosure to the court personnel and to the ultimate fact-finder in the case and that's somehow all consistent with the state secrets privilege. To the contrary. Once a determination is made that a matter is state secrets, there's no further disclosure of the information. You -- the whole premise of state secrets is not that you try to prevent ultimate disclosure to the general public. It's that once something is privileged, you -- you treat the matter as privileged and you take it out of the case.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I think there can be certain arrangements in certain civil litigation where the Government can agree with a party to proceed -­ as part of their overall agreement, to proceed on the basis of classified information, but that would involve a very different way of -- of proceeding than the normal default rules. And I think absent some kind of agreement for the Government to proceed in that way, the default rule in civil litigation has always been that the privilege is just that. It's -- the matter is -- the matter is privileged and it's taken out of the case.",
  "Absolutely not, Justice Scalia, not in civil litigation. And that's why the state secrets privilege is, I mean, quite a remarkable doctrine in the civil side of the case.",
  "Only civil.",
  "That's exactly right, Justice Scalia.",
  "Right, and a different bargain has been reached in the criminal context, and in that context to ameliorate the consequence of the sometimes difficult choice of revealing classified information or proceeding, the Congress has come through with the Classified Information Procedures Act. That only applies in the criminal side, though.",
  "Justice Breyer, I have two responses to that. The first is I think the -- that the Totten doctrine extends more broadly than just the narrow confines of the contract.",
  "I would -- I mean, I would need a specific hypothetical. I can't imagine a tort that by its nature -­",
  "-- depends on the relationship.",
  "I can't imagine a tort that depends on its very nature on the relationship. But we're talking about regulations that, as I understand the other side's allegations, are regulations for handling secret contracts. So unless one can allege that they were a party to a secret contract or at least a secret relationship, there's no point in that individual even being in a position -- they wouldn't even have standing to challenge the regulation.",
  "I still think the answer would be that there would be no relief under that circumstance because their -- their -- still their claim to having any entitlement under those rules at all would -- I mean, you know, total strangers don't have rights under those regulations. Alleged spies would have rights under those regulations, and the very idea of walking into court and asserting your rights as an alleged spy is inconsistent with the entire relationship and the contract that gave rise to it. I would also point you to the Weinberger decision, Weinberger against Catholic Action, because there this Court applied Totten to not force the Navy to produce an environmental impact statement even though there were regulations on the book -- and the concurring Justices focused on those regulations -- where the Department of Defense said we do produce an environmental impact statement even if it's classified. So I think on the authority of Weinberger as well, the very fact that there are internal regulations on a subject, the entire subject matter of which is secret, doesn't give rise to judicially enforceable rights. If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the time for rebuttal.",
  "Justice Stevens, just a few points. And may it please the Court, just a few points in rebuttal. First of all, as I think Justice Kennedy's question indicated, there was no waiver of any due process argument. If you look at those footnotes, the only thing that's waived is the Tucker Act concern that we talked about earlier. Second of all, I think in thinking about this PL-110 claim, it's important to acknowledge, as I think Justice Scalia was suggesting, that it is the PL-110 claim to the CIA. And as I understand their argument, it depends on their being a significant difference between coming into court and saying I'm an unacknowledged spy and I'd like to sue the CIA and coming into court and saying I am an unacknowledged PL-110 resettlee with a claim against the CIA, please hear my claim. I would say there's no material difference in terms of all of the policies that undergird the Totten doctrine between those two. And I would note that even the Ninth Circuit recognized at 35a and 37a of the petition appendix that the respondents would have to establish a relationship with the agency. The final two points I would make is, first of all, they would like to make some benefit of the fact that they are suing as Does as opposed to the Totten case. I would make two points about that. First of all, presumably the reason that William Lloyd could use his name in the Totten case is because it was a suit by his estate and he was deceased, so he didn't have a concern about retaliation.",
  "I would also say that the difference between suing under Doe and suing under your name just makes clear that both sides to this litigation start with the premise that the fundamental fact of this litigation turns on a secret. They don't want their name revealed any more than we want the name revealed, and that just underscores how this is all about a secret, just as in Totten. The last point I would make is they asked you to take their pleadings as a given at this stage in the litigation, and I would ask you to look at those pleadings. The complaint is replete with references to the espionage relationship, and the complaint itself cites Totten or the Totten doctrine no less than seven times. I would suggest that if this claim is not Totten-barred, then no claim is. With that, I'd ask the court below be reversed.",
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The Ten Commandments have undeniable religious significance, but they also have secular significance as a code of law and as a well-recognized historical symbol of the law. When a State decides to display a Ten Commandments display along with more than a dozen other monuments on its Capitol grounds in order to honor the donor, it is not endorsing the religious text of the Ten Commandments. And in the same way, when a state has that monument as part of such a collection, the force them to send a message of hostility to religion by singling out that one monument for removal solely because of its religious content.",
  "Justice Stevens, I don't think so. I mean, we didn't purport to do an well-represented group of displays throughout the country including, I think, in States that probably have relatively high Catholic populations. But I think we would steer this Court away from attributing too much significance to the fact that if a State is going to display the Ten Commandments at all, it will necessarily have to display a version that reflects one or another sect's preferences. I mean, in the Marsh case, for example, this Court upheld legislative prayer. It understood that they would necessarily have to choose a chaplain and that chaplain would necessarily be of one denomination or another. And this Court didn't doom the whole practice of legislative prayer because of the necessity of picking a chaplain of one denomination or another. In fact, in the Marsh case itself, this court upheld Nebraska's practice, even though they had chosen the same Presbyterian minister for 16 straight years. And so I don't think this Court in other Establishment Clause contexts has steered away from putting the States and municipalities in a catch-22. even in Stone against Graham that the Ten Commandments can be displayed, can be used in certain settings, it can't be that once the State in practice picks a particular version, it's all of a sudden guilty of a sectarian preference.",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, I think there are quite a few of both types of displays and I think the very fact that the Fraternal Order of Eagles put a lot of these displays out suggests that a bunch of them are textual displays. I'm not sure, though, that a display that actually has Moses receiving the Ten Commandments from God is any less religious. I would suggest that's actually more religious than one that just displays the monument standing alone. If the monuments are standing alone, you being displayed for their secular significance as well as their religious significance. When Moses is there, it's hard to avoid the implication that they are the revealed law of God, as opposed to also a secular code. So in that sense, I'm not sure that the variations in the display -­",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, I would say -- my point is not that there are not other ways to display it. I mean, certainly I think, as we point out in our brief, blank tablets or tablets with Roman numerals are less objectionable -- certainly, I don't think they're beyond objection -- than a textual display. My point was that I'm not quite sure how one would balance sort of four Commandments and Moses versus all Ten Commandments in text. I think it's a close call.",
  "Well, I guess I'm not sure that's true. I mean, some of the displays that are out there in courthouses have Moses receiving the Commandments and have text. And I guess, my point, though, would be, again -­",
  "To be sure, to be sure. But I would hope the constitutional line wouldn't be that you can't have text. I mean, the Ten Commandments have a role in our society and had an influence on the development of the law as text. I mean, you know, they weren't influential with ten Roman numbers. They were influential as text.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I certainly think location and context matters. I think in almost every Establishment Clause context, school case, for example, as you suggest, I mean, unless this Court is going to revisit Stone against Graham, it's certainly true that the school context at least raises much more difficult questions. In terms of where it can be displayed in a courthouse, I think there are certainly permissible displays in the courthouse, but it may be something all together different to have a display in a way that it actually looks like a religious sanctuary within the walls of the courthouse.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I think putting it in the rotunda of the court as a stand-alone monument, giving it sort of pride of place, if you will, raises a much more difficult question, to be sure, and may well cross the constitutional line. As I was alluding to, the one case I'm familiar with, which is the case of the Alabama Supreme Court, there it was displayed in a way that the district court literally found it was like a",
  "I think the display that I have in mind in the Alabama Supreme Court probably does cross the constitutional line even under our view. I think that a display of the Ten Commandments in some appropriate way in the courthouse certainly wouldn't cross the line that this Court -- that we would have this Court draw. I mean, we think, for example, it cannot be that the very fact that moving it closer to the courthouse itself is a constitutional problem because as you yourself have pointed out, Justice Kennedy, the legislative prayers that were approved in Marsh v. Chambers were at the absolute epicenter of the government. And still those were a permissible acknowledgment of religion. So I think while context matters, I don't think solely the fact that it's moved closer to the seat of government does have a dispositive impact. And again, I would say in response to Justice Stevens' question, I do think it is important choice among the various documents if they are going to be displayed at all. And I don't think that the Constitution puts the municipalities and the States in the bind of being able to display the Ten Commandments in theory, but in fact, not being able to pick any one version -­",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, two points to make about that. One is certainly a disclaimer would make this an easier case. And I would point out that there is a disclaimer of sorts on the monument already because it clearly states that it was a gift from the Fraternal Order of Eagles.",
  "It is, Justice Stevens, and I'm troubled frankly by the suggestion that they would have to go as far as you suggested they would go under the City of Lacrosse case. The idea that in order to have the Ten Commandments monument on the Capitol grounds, the State of Texas has to cordon that monument off, unlike any other of the 17 monuments, suggests a hostility to religion. fence away from the Ten Commandments to make clear that the State has nothing to do with the Ten Commandments is bending over too far in the other direction. The State can have, as this Court has acknowledged many times, permissible acknowledgments of religion. And I don't think in this case that the State of Texas has gone too far. One other point I think that is important to put on the table, and it is consistent with the analysis of both the district court and the Fifth Circuit, is that whatever the original purpose is for Texas accepting the monument and displaying it in the first instance, they now have an additional secular purpose in retaining the monument. And I would point this Court to Judge Becker's analysis in the Chester County case for the Third Circuit. In that case, he had a display that was admittedly smaller, but it was actually a much more overtly sectarian version of the Ten Commandments. It had the Ten Commandments plus the summary of the Ten Commandments from the New Testament. And nonetheless, Judge Becker said that in that case, the monument had been there since 1920 and maintaining that document and maintaining the plaque on the courthouse. And I think he correctly understood that in these cases of displays that have stood for 40 years or longer, that the State is in something of a dilemma. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court. The display of historical documents here, like the display in the Lynch against Donnelly case of the creche, may include a religious item without running afoul of the establishment clause. As in the -­",
  "Justice O'Connor, we would urge you not to consider the history of the display. You in your concurring opinion in the Pinette case made the point that in the context of accommodations, the inquiry into religious purpose doesn't make a lot of sense and you urged the Court to drop it in that context. I think so too in the acknowledgment context. Certainly if you have a situation where you don't have -- I think in the acknowledgment context as well, a focus on purpose may not be that productive. But I would like to talk about the purpose -­",
  "I think this Court has said that you can accommodate religions. They've also said that you can acknowledge the role that religion has played in our society and I think in both contexts, a focus on purpose is probably not a prudent exercise of judicial resources. But I would like to talk about the purpose here because I think what you have here is a display of a document alone in the first instance that certainly was at least defensible and probably constitutional, yet the courts below got off on the wrong foot by saying that the first display was open defiance of this Court's decision in Stone against Graham and I think this Court's cases themselves suggest that the contextual differences between the school and the courtroom are enough to at least make the display not in open defiance. Now there was the second display and we are not here to defend the second display but that was the display that was in reaction to the lawsuit filed against the first display. Now, I don't know if that second display was the product of bad legal advice or simply frustration at the first lawsuit being filed but I don't think it should make a constitutional difference. In the Lynch against Donnelly case, Mayor Lynch, after the ACLU filed a lawsuit against him, had a rally at the site of the creche, a press conference, where he publicly vowed to fight to keep Christ in Christmas and then he led city workers in carols and said they should sing another one that apparently bothers people. Yet despite that adverse reaction to the litigation being filed against the city of Pawtucket, this Court upheld the display and although the dissent did focus on the mayor's crusade to keep Christ in Christmas, the majority and the concurring opinions did not. And I think that is the proper mode of analysis. Now, the second point I think is should these counties be faulted for trying to bring their practices in compliance with the Constitution? And I think the answer there is clearly not. And I was going to point this Court to the Marsh case that's been talked about quite a bit. One of the things that as Professor Chemerinsky said about the Marsh case that this Court emphasized in that case itself and in subsequent cases is the fact that the prayers there were non-sectarian in the sense that they did not directly invoke, say, Christ. But that actually is something of a change that took place after the litigation began. Prior to the litigation, there were explicit references to Christ as Justice Stevens pointed out in footnote 2 of his dissent in that case. But the state of Nebraska, after they had a lawsuit, decided let's make this an easier case for the Court, not a harder case, and they modified their conduct.",
  "Justice Souter, I have two points in response. First of all, what I think would be a crazy way of having a jurisprudence is for the Court to say that this display is a foundation to the law document, it's perfectly constitutional in every other county courthouse in Kentucky except for McCreary County and Pulaski County because of their prior conduct. The second point that I think is important in this context is that I think this Court's establishment clause jurisprudence is already difficult enough to apply without creating the First Amendment equivalent of covered jurisdictions under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.",
  "That would be my point, Justice Souter, but I also think independent of that point, it is also not a particular productive jurisprudence to really treat different municipalities differently because the mayor in one case may have started with the creche and decided to add the wishing well or in the other case started the wishing well and added the creche. I don't think it makes any sense that if they end up in the same place, the constitutional rules could be the same.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I'm not sure that I could the jurisprudence that said this Court could not open its sessions with a prayer but the Capitol can. Now, if there was any difference drawn at all, I would assume it would be a difference based on history.",
  "And as I said, Justice Ginsburg, I think if there were a difference in principle, it would have to be a difference based on history. But I don't think there is -- in this context, I think it is fair to say -­",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I suppose if the federal courts decided to do that, we would probably try to defend them on establishment clause grounds. I don't think, though, that -- I think that would obviously be a much tougher case than the posting of the Ten Commandments in the outer hallway along with a variety of other documents which I take it to be the first case here. And then the final display that the Court has before it is actually the Ten Commandments in the context of the other secular historical documents. And I think that kind of display clearly is constitutional for the reasons that the display was constitutional in the Lynch case.",
  "Well, Justice O'Connor, this Court on a variety of occasions has chosen to simply put Lemon to one side as opposed to overtly amending it.",
  "No, I don't, Justice O'Connor.",
  "No, I don't. I think it would be prudent, as I suggested at the outset, to make not necessarily a full amendment and eliminate the first purpose prong of Lemon but at least in the acknowledgment context as in the accommodation context we're not going to focus on that. But independent of that, I think many of these Court's cases that were decided even under Lemon acknowledge the principles that municipalities should be rewarded, not punished, nor trying to change their conduct to try to get things right. In Abbington against Schempp, which I think in many respects is a precursor to Lemon because it talked at least about the purpose and effects test and I gather that's about all that's left of Lemon. In that case, this Court held out the promise that it might be permissible for the government to have some use of the Bible in school. Now, when it did that, it didn't except out Abbington township and said, but not for you, Abbington township, because you violated the purpose prong. The Sixth Circuit here has adopted a rule that once mistaken, always condemned and we don't think that has any proper place in this Court's establishment of jurisprudence.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When the government acts to remove government- imposed burdens on religious exercise, it does not violate the Establishment Clause. Rather, as this Court put the point in Zorach against Clauson, when the government eases those kind of burdens, it follows the best of our traditions. The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA, eases government burdens on restrictions by having institutions and prison officials examine burdens on religious exercise and remove unjustified, substantial burdens.",
  "That's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think that -- that that doesn't make any substantial difference, in part, I think because if you think about certainly this application of RLUIPA, it's Spending Clause legislation. And spending legislation often takes the form of giving the States an incentive to take action on their own. And in this sense, I think you can understand this legislation as giving the States an opportunity to remove their own burdens on religious exercise. And that's precisely how it works in practice. The relevant action that a State takes is State action in removing its own burdens, not Federal action imposed on the States. And I think that's consistent with the analysis of this Court in the Dole case where the Federal Government, on the assumption of this Court, didn't have the direct power under the 21st Amendment to raise the drinking age, but it could give the option to the States to exercise their power to do it. So I do think in the end, the burdens that are removed here are attributable to the State of Ohio, not to the Federal Government. It is also true that the standard that's imposed by RLUIPA is a more exacting standard than that imposed by the Federal Constitution itself. But I don't think providing for greater accommodation of religious exercise than the Federal Constitution creates an Establishment Clause problem.",
  "Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice, but I don't think this case poses the same problems as City of Boerne. First of all, this really isn't an effort to rewrite a rule of decision for all cases the way that RFRA was. Congress in this legislation targeted two areas where there were particular problems with respect to religious exercise, and in those contexts, it addressed a different standard. Now, as I say, that standard is higher, but so are the standards of over half of the States which also apply a heightened scrutiny test either as a matter of State constitutional law or State law.",
  "That is also true. I mean, there -- there is -- to be sure there is -­",
  "Well, I take your point, Justice Scalia. I would -- I would clarify that there is the potential for applications to the statute under the Commerce Clause. We don't think that's really appropriately presented here. We also think that with respect to State prisons in all their applications, they will be Spending Clause applications.",
  "That's right, Justice Ginsburg, and I think the fact that there may be more than one hook for this legislation in certain applications shouldn't make any constitutional difference. And I think here it is Spending Clause legislation as it applies to the State of Ohio. I think that's conceded. They -- they take issue with whether it's valid.",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, I don't think the fact that there's money involved makes it harder or easier from a Spending Clause perspective. I think from the perspective of why this case is different from Boerne, the fact that it's Spending Clause and Commerce Clause and not section 5 legislation makes a big difference. But I certainly don't want to leave you with the impression that there's anything constitutionally problematic because there's Federal money involved because, of course, this Court has upheld Federal Spending Clause legislation in religion areas in cases like Zobrest, Mergens, Agostini, Mitchell against Helms.",
  "No, I don't, Justice Stevens. Or another way of answering that is I would say that even though you thought there was an Establishment Clause problem in the City of Boerne case, I don't think you need to find one here. And part of that is because this is more targeted legislation, and it particularly deals, as -- as it comes to this Court in this application, with the exercise of religion in prisons. And I think that's an area like the military where the Government is necessarily going to be involved with religion in a way that it otherwise wouldn't be.",
  "Justice O'Connor -­",
  "Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't think upon analysis it is, and I think there's a couple of reasons why that's so. First of all, this is not an absolute entitlement to get your religious beer at 5:00 p.m. every day. It is a balancing test, and I think things like getting beer every day, getting marijuana inside prison walls would not satisfy the test.",
  "Well, it does, Justice O'Connor, but just to take a step back, I mean, applying that same standard in the Smith case, you yourself thought that a general law banning marijuana use outside or -- or peyote use outside -­",
  "-- peyote outside of prison would be justified even under that standard. I would think, a fortiori, it would be justified within prison walls. I want to make another point about the incentives, though, which I think is important. Every State in the Union provides some degree of accommodation for religion, and in many States it's majoritarian religions that are accommodated. Now, if there's going to be some incentive to engage in religiosity in prison in order to take advantage of things offered for religion that aren't available for something else, at least RLUIPA has the virtue of making sure that all religions are accommodated neutrally. So if there's any incentive, it's an incentive for religion over irreligion as opposed to between sects -- sects of religions, and I think that's the way you would have without RLUIPA involved. The other point I want to make is although there may be some extravagant claims of certain religions that would seem quite enticing, much religious exercise in many of the reported cases involve things that I don't think people are necessarily lining up to do. I mean, there are a number of lower court cases dealing with the availability of kosher food, and in prison what that means as a practical matter, is generally you are going to get cold food rather than hot food. And I don't think -­",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think -­ and we cite a few cases in footnote 2 of our reply brief that suggest that in dealing with legitimate concerns about using prison -- religious symbols or other religious items as a gang signifier or a gang identifier, that the -- that there have been cases where the courts, even applying the heightened standard or RLUIPA or RFRA, have deferred to the government officials. I also think, though, it's worth noting how the Federal Government and the Bureau of Prisons has dealt with the concern that religious medallions, as opposed to beards, would be used for gang identification or gang signification. Ohio, I take it, takes the position that if you have a medallion that could be used for those purposes, you can't have it within prison walls at all. The Bureau of Prisons, by contrast, takes the position that you can have the medallion, but you have to wear it inside your shirt. So it can't be used for prison signification purposes or gang identification purposes. And I think that shows the kind of reasonable accommodation that RLUIPA or RFRA, as it applies to the Federal Bureau of Prisons -­",
  "I think in a case like that -- I mean, obviously, this Court's recent decision in Johnson would suggest that -- that the prison officials are in a difficult position there and I think they could not accede to that request. And I think complying with the Equal Protection Clause in that context would itself be a compelling interest under the statute. And I think this Court in Widmar against Vincent, for example, suggested that avoiding Establishment Clause problems is a sufficient compelling interest. I would think equally avoiding the Equal Protection Clause violation in that context would also be a compelling interest, and I don't think there would be a least restrictive alternative. And so I think that the statute -- there would be no statutory violation in refusing that particular accommodation. I think there -- these show that there are ways to administer this statute in a way that's respectful of the decisions of local prison officials but also does make sure that they have a degree of sensitivity to these claims for religious exercise.",
  "Well, Justice O'Connor, no more so than under the Free -- the Free Exercise Clause itself. I mean -- and as this case, of course, comes to this Court, the substantiality of the religious beliefs and that they are actually held by these individuals has been stipulated to.",
  "That's right, Justice O'Connor, but that's true under the Free Exercise Clause as well. So even the Sixth Circuit, that obviously had some problems with the statute, understood that on that score there's no more entanglement with religion under RLUIPA than there is under the Free Exercise Clause itself.",
  "That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, but this Court has been clear in the context of legislative accommodations of religion in particular to make clear that that preference of religion over irreligion doesn't mean that the government cannot provide legislative accommodations of religion without providing benefits for secular organizations as well. That was the clear holding of this Court in Amos. And I think that although this Court has expressed concerns about religious accommodations when there's no guarantee that the religious accommodation will be provided to other sects -- take, for example, the Kiryas Joel case. This Court has been quite clear that there is not a constitutional problem in favoring religion over irreligion in providing legislative accommodations for religion. And as I said, in -- in Zorach against Clauson, this Court noted that that's not just the absence of a constitutional problem, but there's really a constitutional virtue in the legislature acting to accommodate religion. The Court made basically the same point in Smith in saying that even though the Free Exercise Clause did not require the special accommodation or exemption for peyote, the legislatures could do so and in doing so, they would be furthering constitutional values. If I could say a few words about the Spending Clause claim that is brought by Ohio in this case. They suggest that there's a difficulty with this legislation under the Spending Clause. Now, the court below -­",
  "Well, I think it is not in the questions presented themselves, I don't think, but I think it would be fairly open to this Court to reach it because it would be an alternative ground to support the judgment below. That said, this Court doesn't have to reach it and its practice in recent cases has been when there's one constitutional claim that is -- that the Court has ruled on below, it doesn't necessarily reach the other -- the other constitutional claims. The Court did that in cases like Oakland Cannabis and the Pierce County case. And we would urge the same course here because, although the courts have divided on this Establishment Clause issue, the courts have not divided on the Spending Clause issue. All the courts that have reached it have upheld it as valid Spending Clause legislation. And I think that reflects the fact that there is a clear nexus here between the Federal funds and the Federal conditions that are being imposed. If the Federal Government is going to provide money, over $1 million to Ohio, to have prisoner meals, then certainly the Federal Government can insist that kosher meals are among the available options. And so too if the -- if the Federal Government is going to provide monies for Ohio to build prisons, they can ensure that those prisons are safe and are operated consistent with Federal policy such that there's not discrimination on the basis of race or religion. The last issue in the case, of course, is the Commerce Clause issue, and on that issue, no court below reached the issue. And we think this Court's recent admonition in the Sabri case that facial challenges are best when infrequent, applies with particular force here because --",
  "No, of course not, Justice Scalia, and I must have misspoke. My point is they raise three arguments that are all alternative arguments to support the judgment below. My burden is to defeat all three of them to show -- if the Court reaches them. So I have to show that there's no Establishment Clause violation, which we -- we've certainly made that argument in the brief and here today, and that there's no Spending Clause violation, and that there's no Commerce Clause violation. The -- in this case the Commerce Clause claim has a completely abstract quality, and indeed, the only temptation to reach the issue at all would be that the -­ since RLUIPA has a jurisdictional element, the resolution of the Commerce Clause is so clear that it might be tempting to reach it. But I think the better course would be for this Court to allow that issue to be sorted out in the --in the lower courts. If there are no further questions, I would reserve time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points in rebuttal. First of all, I'd like to note the anomaly that much of the argument of General Cole would be an argument for why the State constitutional provision that gives higher protection for freedom of conscience in Ohio is itself unconstitutional.",
  "I'd be happy to do that, Justice O'Connor. I think that there's been an exaggeration of how far it goes beyond. Now, I want to be clear about one thing, which is this Court, even before Smith and O'Lone, said that there was going to be deference to prison officials and a Turner standard would apply. So to the extent that there's a little less deference here than under the O'Lone standard, that is a modification. The centrality requirement, though, is not something that can be charged to RLUIPA or to RFRA because even before the Smith case, this Court in Ling and Hernandez was moving away from centrality and -­",
  "Well, Justice Scalia -­",
  "Justice Scalia, I don't think this Court has ever in its accommodations cases held that the government can only accommodate those things that are central. I don't know for sure, but I rather doubt that employing co-religionists in a gymnasium is central to the practice of any faith. Yet, in Amos, this Court upheld that as a valid accommodation. And I do think the centrality requirement --",
  "What's that?",
  "I may, Mr. Chief Justice. But again -- but -- but to the extent I do, I think those are questions that are best to be kept out of the courts, which is why even before Smith this Court moved away from centrality. It's why even Justice O'Connor, who otherwise was in disagreement in Smith, also agreed that we should get rid of the centrality requirement. And if you look at some of the cases that are actually decided under RLUIPA, the cases involve things like Muslim prayer oil and they -- the cases -- the Seventh Circuit, for example, allows it. Now, we don't want the courts getting into --",
  "Well, I -- I think that's right, and I think there is not that centrality requirement for accommodations. I do want to make the point, though, that -­ that Ohio already, under its State constitution, has this heightened review with a lot of these, you know, least restrictive alternative tests and the like. Nobody thinks Ohio's constitution violates the Federal Constitution. That's true even though Ohio applies it in the prison context, at least when it's a claim by a guard rather than an inmate. That -- those are the facts of Humphrey against Lane. It's also true that many of Ohio's arguments would suggest their own accommodations of some religions would give too much of an incentive for religious exercise and the like. And I think that's a defect as well. I don't think -- and I agree with Justice Souter in this regard -- that narrower accommodations actually raise more constitutional problems than broader accommodations. I think that this Court, for example, in Caldor dealt with an accommodation that was at a fairly high level of generality, but yet this Court said and Justice O'Connor emphasized in her concurrence, well, that's a preference for Sabbatarian religions. And I think you avoid that with this kind of across-the-board test. Justice Kennedy, you made a point about whether this is extreme in the degree that it accommodates religion, but it's certainly no more extreme than the -­ than the laws and constitutions of 26 States, which across the board apply this heightened scrutiny to all manner of State actions. So in that sense, the fact that it accommodates religion kind of wholesale with a broader standard, as opposed to retail, I don't think is a constitutional defect. The last point I wanted to make is on the racist literature hypothetical, and I think it is in large measure just a hypothetical. As footnote 2 in our brief points out, prisons have been generally successful in keeping racist literature out even when it's supported as a claim for religious-based racist literature. The only cases that I've come across where that hasn't prevailed is when the -- the prison's own policy had exceptions in it that made very little sense. And in this case, for example, if you look at joint appendix page 118, there's an allegation that with -- with one piece of literature that was described as racist, that some prisoners were allowed to have it while others were not allowed to have that same kind of literature. Now, I don't know whether those claims are in fact true, but that's the kind of claim that should be able to go forward in a case like this. With all respect, I think the Sixth Circuit here made a mistake, ignored this Court's precedents, and should be reversed.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The decision below allows companies, like Respondents, to build a business model out of copyright infringement without fear of secondary liability. As long as they avoid obtaining actual knowledge that a particular customer is about to infringe a particular copyright, they are free to operate a system that involves massive copyright infringement with full knowledge that the draw of the entire system for customers and advertisers alike is the unlawful copying. No matter much how much of that system - -",
  "That's right, Justice O'Connor. And then I think the Court explained and elaborated that the test is whether or not there are commercially significant noninfringing uses. And I would say what the Ninth Circuit did in this case is basically adopt the test of mere theoretical capability for noninfringing use, plus maybe some anecdotal evidence.",
  "Well, I think the way we would try to articulate it is that if the way that the business model of the particular Defendant is set up is that they are not involved in a business substantially unrelated from copyright infringement, that there should be liability in that situation. And I think in an extreme case like this, where over 90 percent of the business - - and I think Mr. Verrilli correctly describes that it's not a minimum of 90 percent; it's over 90 percent -- because the only evidence on the other side is anecdotal evidence that there are such things as public-domain works.",
  "It came from a study by Petitioners' experts of the actual operation of the system. And what they did is, they identified about 75 percent of the works as clearly infringing works, another 15 percent of the works were identified as very likely infringing works, then there were 10 percent they just couldn't tell anything about.",
  "Well, I think the -- it's not - - the system is not limited to music.",
  "I'm not sure about that, but - -",
  "Well - -",
  "Actual inducement?",
  "Well, based on our review of the record -- and we haven't been able to see the entire record -- I agree with you, the Petitioners ought to be able to win this case on an active-inducement ground, and that's a narrow way to decide the case. I do think, though, this Court might have to say something about the Sony issue before it reached that issue. And if it did feel compelled to do that, I think it would be a mistake to sanction the Ninth Circuit's reading of Sony, because, you're right, there's a theoretical possibility that public-domain works can be exchanged on this system, but it's also true that this system doesn't have much of a comparative advantage for trading in public-domain works.",
  "Justice O'Connor, it stands for - - the test is whether or not there are commercially significant noninfringing uses. The Ninth Circuit got it wrong because it thought that test was satisfied by a combination of two things: being able to point out that there were such things as public-domain works or authorized sharing of the Wilco album, for example, and anecdotal evidence that you could actually do that. Now, if that were the right reading of Sony, with respect, I would suggest that footnote 23 of this Court's Sony decision would have been the sum total of the Court's analysis, because in that footnote the Court observed that there were broadcasts of public-domain works.",
  "If it's 50 percent infringement in the short run? We think, absolutely, yes.",
  "He can - -",
  "-- use the program. I mean, as we suggest, if you're at a 50-50 -- I mean, if you're anywhere below 50 percent, we think that there should be no liability under the Sony standard. If you're above that level and there's sufficient evidence that you're really targeting infringing uses, then I think maybe there would be liability. But in the hypothetical you suggest, there would clearly not be liability in that situation. What we would like to suggest, though, is there ought to be enough room for -- under the Sony test, before you reach actual inducement, to capture somebody where they've clearly set out, as a business model, to deal with the infringing uses. And the only thing they point to are the theoretical possibility, anecdotal evidence, that it could be used for public-domain works.",
  "I think that's a fair point, Justice Ginsburg. We're operating in something of a disadvantage, because we haven't seen the entirety of the record. Based on the record that I've seen, I think there's a close case, unless perhaps once this Court clarifies the legal standard, Respondents put on additional evidence. I think this is a close case, where you actually could grant summary judgment in favor of the Petitioners. But certainly we have no objection to having a trial on the Sony issue in this case. What we object to is the Ninth Circuit rule, which, in every case, is going to obviate the need for a trial, based on a showing that there are such things as public-domain works.",
  "I think that's potentially right --",
  "-- Justice Scalia - -",
  "-- and that's why I think it's important to preserve a role for the Sony test. And, again, this Court, in Sony, could have adopted a simple theoretical-capability test, but this Court, instead, adopted a test that required there to be shown some commercially significant use for the -- noninfringing use. And even in the patent context, where I think the test is, and should be, more demanding, even in that context, cases like Fromberg, which we cite at page 19 of our brief, show that there is an analysis to make sure that the suggested theoretical noninfringing use is, in fact, a practical use of the item.",
  "Well, I don't think - -",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, we have concerns about that, as well. I don't know that we would give them ten years of, sort of, free space to do as - - facilitate as much copyright infringement as possible. I think what we would say is that when you're -- when a suit targets a nascent technology at the very beginning, there ought to be a lot of leeway, not just for observed noninfringing uses, but for the capacity of noninfringing uses. I don't think, in fairness, that's what you have before you in this case, because this is a case where the peer-to-peer technology was out there, it was employed in a particular way, with a centralized server, in a way that was actually -- had a lot of users involved in it, and they were users of the old Napster system, that had a distinct character. They were using that system for infringing copyrighted musical works. And then these individuals come along and seek to capitalize on that market. That is their business plan from day one. And it's not some newfangled idea. The only newfangled idea here is that if you give something of value away for free by ignoring the copyright laws, you're likely to draw consumers to your site, and you're likely to attract advertisers. But that cannot be the kind of innovation that we want to further through a development of secondary liability into the copyright laws.",

  "Well, I was just trying to articulate it, which is to say that this Court has talked about the capacity for noninfringing uses. I think, with a mature product like this, it's fair to point to how it's actually used in the marketplace.",

  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Before Oregon became the first State to authorize assisted suicide, the prescription of federally controlled substances to facilitate suicide generally violated State law and also violated Federal law. Respondents contend that Oregon's decision to remove the State-law consequences from that conduct also operated to remove the Federal-law consequences.",

  "Well, the statute itself says that the Federal Government shall use the method in the State in which the sentencing court sits, the Federal sentencing court.",
  "And again, Justice Souter, I think the best reading is, that is now foreclosed -- that interpretation would be foreclosed by Congress's action in 1994. There are also some technical differences -­",
  "I think we would have to do a little construction, in fairness, but I do think -- I mean, and there also are some differences, because, for example, as I understand the practice in most States, doctors actually aren't exactly involved in the specific process of administering the lethal injection. There's also a technical difference, which is, with respect to lethal injection, it's not the federally controlled substance which is the lethal agent. It's just that there's a federally controlled substance that's used to administer -- to relieve pain in conjunction with a different injection that's not -- that does not involve a federally controlled substance. And that's actually the lethal agent. Here, of course, it's -­",
  "Justice Breyer, I haven't thoroughly considered the issue, precisely because I do think the '94 statute stands as an obstacle. It may be that some of the differences in the way that the death penalty is administered, the fact that doctors aren't directly involved -­",
  "-- would allow for -­",
  "I think that's right. As I say, I think some of the technical ways in which the penalty is administered could make a difference.",
  "Well, several points, Justice Breyer. I think that, first of all, I would say that Congress did focus on suicide, if not physician-assisted suicide, and I think that's an important distinction that I'd like to come back to. But I actually think the comparison to the tobacco case is quite instructive, because there what you had is a statute in which something seemed like it might come within the plain terms of the FDCA, and yet if you took that literally, it would run smack into another statutory scheme. And here, there is no other statutory scheme. To the contrary, the most natural reading of the Controlled Substances Act, I would say -- and I'll address it in a minute -- is that this falls within the authority of the Attorney General. And if you look to any alternative congressional indication of intent on this topic, the only thing you would find is the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997, which continues a Federal policy against assisted suicide.",
  "So, in that sense, I think it's very different than the Brown and Williamson case. Now, taking, though -­",
  "-- as to what Congress -­",
  "With respect, Justice Ginsburg, I don't think so. I -- we stand by the brief in Glucksberg. Now, obviously in the Glucksberg case, the Federal law that everybody was focused on -- and, in fairness, the United States was focused on -- was the Federal Constitution. And so, that's one important difference. Another important difference -- and I think this is an important point -- is that the Federal regulation here, the interpretation of the Attorney General, does not purport to foreclose the issue of assisted suicide -­",
  "-- which is -­",
  "Well, Justice Souter, we don't have a factual record on that question. I think it's not clear that that's the case, because, I mean, proponents of physician-assisted suicide have identified alternative methods. Perhaps the most notorious proponent of physician-assisted suicide, Dr. Kevorkian, operated without a federal controlled-substance license for the last six years before his conviction -­",
  "-- at the time -­",
  "He did not. He did not, which is why he could do that. So, it just goes to prove that physician-assisted suicide and the use of federally controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide are not coextensive.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, we operate without a factual record on that point. In doing some outside reading, it seems that some of the other methods are actually disapproved, not because they're less -- more painful, but because it's more obvious that it's a suicide, in certain cases, and the administration of scheduled drugs sort of blurs that line.",
  "But I guess my point would be, even if we take it as true that controlled substances are the most efficient way to do this, I take it as a given that if Oregon doctors decided that a schedule 1 substance was the most effective way to administer a lethal overdose --",
  "-- after this Court's -­",
  "-- decision in Raich -­",
  "I agree there is that difference between schedule 1 and schedule 2 substances. Now, I think that brings us to the Attorney General's regulation, which is a longstanding regulation.",

  "-- OLC opinion are patently -­",
  "-- clear on that.",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, the reason I would say that it wouldn't is, I think you have to read this regulation against a backdrop that for 90 years the Federal Government has been involved in the regulation of controlled substance. Now, there have been a lot of statements and a lot of court opinions during that 90 years -­",
  "The -- I'm not sure if you're referring to the statute or the regulation. I would say it this way, which is to say -­",
  "I think that's fair, Justice Stevens. I don't take issue with that. And I think you're right to say that the statutory grant of authority to the Attorney General is quite broad. He's supposed to make judgments in the public interest about public health and safety. The point I was trying to make is, I would read all of that against the backdrop that for 90 years the Federal Government has been involved in the regulation of controlled substance. And we all know that that is going to have an incidental effect on State regulation -­",
  "-- of medicine.",
  "Well, I don't think that would be an odd regime. I think if, for example, Oregon made a radically different judgment and said that in Oregon it was going to be permissible to have treatment or detoxification programs that involve the administration of radically larger quantities of controlled substances than had been recognized in any other State, I think, under the authority of cases like Moore, the Attorney General can make a judgment -- now, that's not a legitimate medical purpose, that's -­",
  "-- an abuse.",
  "I think there could be, Justice Kennedy. I don't want to overstate it, in the sense that -- one of the reasons you don't see that much of a conflict between Federal and State law in the regulation of controlled substances is because, in the main, the States have adopted uniform controlled- substances acts that mirror the Federal Act, and, in most of the instances there, works in the way of cooperative federalism in dealing with this problem. This Court tends to see the cases -- Raich, in this case -- where there's a conflict between the State regime and the Federal regime. And I guess my point is the -- in a such a comprehensive Federal regime, if this Court makes clear that State law can overtake the Federal regime, I think it at least creates the potential for there to be a lot of holes in the regime and the possibility, if States take the -- take you up on that invitation -­",
  "-- to really undermine the regime.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, it is perfectly true that there are places in the statute where medical or scientific decisions are expressly given to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and not the Attorney General, but it is equally true that there are places in the Controlled Substances Act where medical determinations or public-health determinations are given expressly to the Attorney General and not the Secretary of Health and Human Services. And one of the places, of course, that's true is Sections 823 and 824 of Title 1 -­ Title 21 -- which, of course, are the provisions about the registration and revocation of registrants. And Congress --",
  "It absolutely is, Justice O'Connor, but -­",
  "Justice O'Connor, there's nothing that says we want to take over the regulation of medicine, but it's crystal clear -­",
  "Well, yes, but I think this Court is always hesitant to draw inferences from -­",
  "-- failed legislative efforts. And if -­",
  "-- the Attorney General had not adopted this interpretation, it may be that this Congress would have passed those initiatives -­",
  "And the prior administer of the DEA before that had our position. So, this is an area where I think, you know, there are different approaches to this. What I wanted to make clear, though, is, you're absolutely right that the regulation of medicine is -­ this Court has observed -- is traditionally left to the States.

And I think if you go back to the history of the Harrison Act, it's been clear since the very first prosecutions under the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914 that the Federal Government's ability to regulate medicine was going to have an incidental effect on the State's ability to regulate medicine. I mean, States had much more of a laissez attitude towards -- laissez-faire attitude towards the opium trade, but that was really displaced by the -­",

  "Well, I think I would -- I mean, I -- I guess I would do two answers to that, Mr. Chief Justice. One, I would point to the fact that, at the genesis of the Harrison Act, it really was displacing State medical judgments about the opium trade. I would point to two other examples, one under this statute and one other the -- under the FDCA. The idea under the FDCA -- the example that comes to mind is the FDA's treatment of Laetrile, that this Court addressed in the Rutherford decision.

  "-- who recognized -­",
  "Well, Justice Souter, I think you have to look at the regulation of drug abuse and ask, To what end was Congress regulating these substances?",
  "Well, Justice Souter, what I would say is, what Congress had in mind in enacting these substances is, they were concerned about drug abuse, not for its own sake, but for the debilitating effect it has on people's lives, for its tendency to destroy lives. And I will grant you that Congress, in 1970, did not have before it in its contemplation a State that would make physician-assisted suicide lawful. But that's because it would have been unthinkable at that time. And what Congress did have clearly in its contemplation is the fact that a clear manifestation of a drug's potential for abuse was the fact that it could lead to suicide and overdoses. And that's page 35 of the House report, for those that look at legislative history. And I actually think that's --",
  "Well, Congress didn't specify, one way or another. And what I would -- I would point you to the House report, because I think it actually is indicative, because when Congress is framing the issue, they first look at the extent of the problem. And one of the ways they identify the problem as serious is, they point to overdoses that are taking place among teenagers. And then, in the next section of the report, they look at the question of the consequences of drug abuse. And what do they point to as -­",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, I mean, I -- first of all, I would say, as it compared to Raich, I would almost think this is an a fortiori case, as it affects commerce, because, unlike Raich, which, of course, were untraditional noncommercial transactions, the transactions at issue here are standard commercial transactions that are -­",
  "-- well within -­",
  "I think they do. And I sure hope they do, because this is a situation where Congress and the Federal Government pervasively regulates the drug transactions at issue here in a way that even respondents don't object to. The details of the form that you fill out for the prescription, the fact that it has to be in writing, the regulations specify whether it has to be in pen or pencil -- I mean, there's such a pervasive involvement of the Federal Government in the regulation of these controlled substances that I don't think there's any additional commerce clause extension by regulating the purpose for which the prescription is being made. That's what the DEA did in the context of Marinol, when it was first moved from schedule 1 to schedule 2, that -- we discuss that in detail on page 30 of our brief. And I think that kind of regulation, although it's not a common feature of the DEA in its administration of the Controlled Substances Act, is an important one, is a legitimate one. And I guess what I would say, with respect to Congress's intent, is, it seems to me odd to think that a Congress that was concerned about overdoses, concerned about suicides, would be indifferent or agnostic on the question of using federally controlled substances for the express purpose of inducing a lethal overdose.",
  "I think they were concerned with it part and parcel of -- because, I mean, I think of the things that Congress does when it regulates is, it regulates to protect life, to protect health and safety -­",
  "I mean, sure -­",
  "-- there are. Sure they are.",
  "And they're worried about the impact -­",
  "Well, I think it is, but, again, I think -­",
  "But not solely.",
  "No, not solely.",
  "Not solely. And, again, I mean, I think, you know, addiction qua addiction was not the concern so much as addiction because of its tendency to debilitate lives -­",
  "-- to destroy lives -­",
  "Well, no, I don't think that's right, Justice Breyer.",
  "I think there are a number of instances where the abuse that is being -- that Congress is concerned with is not solely the addictive abuse. I mean, to take one example, Congress has recently, as part of the controlled substances regime, regulated GHB, one of these so-called \"date-rape drugs.\" And the concern for abuse there is not its addictive quality, but the fact that it can be used in a way that's not medical, that can be very pernicious, and the like. And so, I think that's just another example of this concept of abuse being much broader than a narrow focus on diversion or a narrow focus on addiction.",
  "Well, Justice Souter, I would simply say that the Controlled Substances Act, if you look at it, is a very paternalistic piece of legislation. It's not designed to let people make their own judgments about the health risk. And if I could reserve the remainder of my time?",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think Respondents have embraced the logical consequences of their position. And what it results in is turning the Controlled Substances Act, the federal Controlled Substances Act, into an odd patchwork. It also is profoundly a-historical, because, at the time of the Harrison Act of 1914 -- which the Controlled Substances Act was intended to strengthen, not weaken, as this Court pointed out in Moore -- at that time, the States had a variety of different approaches to opium and heroin and other -- and cocaine and other substances -- opium and cocaine now of which land on schedule 2. Some of them tightly regulated them, some of them allowed them in over- the-counter tonics in large quantities. And the point of the Harrison Act was to clean that up and impose a uniform Federal regime. And they knew it would have an impact on State regulation of medicine. And even the Court, in the Linder days, recognize that that was not, per se, a constitutional problem.",
  "Well, it's an odd statutory -­ I mean, I'm not familiar with the -- with the principle that the Federal authority only extends to prevent that which would gut the statute, and no further. That seems like an odd principle. And I think that, here, it is a perfectly legitimate interpretation of this statute to say that a Congress that was profoundly concerned with overdoses, with suicide, with drug abuse, precisely because of its debilitating effect on people's lives, would not have been agnostic at the prospect of -­",
  "-- controlled substances.",
  "It was, Mr. Chief Justice. They were all over the map, but there was clearly a recognition that doctors were part and parcel of the problem, that there were needs in States to more closely regulate both the doctors and the pharmacies. That was, kind of, the two problems that gave rise to this. And there's no question that the impact of the Federal program was profound on the State's practice of medicine. Nonetheless, that program was upheld, and that has been the tradition in this area.",
  "They were. And opium's now on schedule 2. The Harrison Act did not have the schedules we're familiar with from the Controlled Substance. But most of what was at issue -- I mean, opium, in its various forms, morphine, all of that of that is now on schedule 2, and that's really what prompted the Harrison Act in the first instance.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Stevens. It's the same reason as my answer earlier, which is, I think you have to look at this regime, and read it in light of the 90 years of Federal involvement in the regulation of controlled substances and the lack of a traditional Federal role in regulating medicine qua medicine. And I think this is on the -- on the side of the line of regulating controlled substances. With respect to the commerce-clause issue, I would -- thought that one thing that came clear out of the Raich decision is that the relevant factor to consider is not the class of activities that a State decides to decriminalize, but, rather, the class of activities that Congress decides to regulate. And with respect to schedule 2 substances, I would think this case is a fortiori. We're not talking about substances that are homegrown and are never part of a commercial transaction. And even those who were in the dissent in Raich, I think, would think that this was an appropriate commerce-clause application. This case is to Raich as the regulation of commercial farming would be to Wickard against Filburn. It is a much different situation. Congress's commerce-clause power is more robust here. I wanted to remark and focus for a minute on what an odd statute Oregon has passed. The practitioner respondents point out it is a prescribing law only. And Oregon itself points out that what's allowed here is the prescription, but not the administration, of these substances. Even what Oregon does, does not purport to be medicine, as one traditionally understands it. I can think of no other medical substance where a doctor can prescribe it, but not administer it. And I think if you look at that aspect of the statute, what becomes clear is that Oregon is not regulating medicine, it's purporting to basically take a Federal regulatory regime that allows doctors the ability to get at schedule 2 substances. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act validly abrogates the States' sovereign immunities as applied to the class of cases involving the unconstitutional treatment of disabled inmates. That result follows from this Court's decisions in Nevada against Hibbs, and Tennessee against Lane. In Lane, this Court held that it was clear, beyond peradventure, that Congress had an adequate basis to enact prophylactic legislation to ensure that individuals with disabilities had access to public services. In reaching that conclusion, this Court surveyed a broad array of evidence, not just limited to the court-access context, and, indeed, surveyed evidence involving prisons, in particular. As a result, the sole remaining question, and the only question in Lane on which this Court applied an as- applied analysis, is the question of whether or not Title II's remedies are congruent and proportional as applied to the particular context; here, the context of the discriminatory, inhumane, or otherwise unconstitutional treatment of inmates with disabilities. Now, if one applies the congruence and proportionality analysis of Lane, in particular, in the prison context, it easily passes constitutional muster. For all of the factors that this Court emphasized as making Title II appropriate in the court-access context -- the absence of absolute mandates, the inherent flexibility of the reasonable modification standard, the fact that benefits are limited to otherwise eligible individuals, the defenses for fundamental alterations or undue burdens -- all of those factors apply with full force in this context.",
  "Absolutely, Justice O'Connor. And one of the reasons that I think that Title II is particularly congruent and proportional in the prison context is, the reasonable-modification standard, which, after all, uses the term \"reasonableness,\" is very well amenable to the kind of Turner deference standard this Court applied. And, of course, just last term, this Court, in Johnson against California and Wilkins -- and in the Wilkinson case, Cutter against Wilkinson, applied deference to prison officials even in the context of strict scrutiny. And so --",
  "-- I think it --",
  "-- applies, a fortiori. I'm sorry, Mr. --",
  "-- Chief Justice.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I don't -- I don't -- I'm not up here today saying there's no prophylaxis at all with respect to Title II, but I think it is proportional and congruent, and I think the prophylactic gap between what the Constitution protects and what Title II protects is relatively narrow in the prison context, both because if you think about one set of claims, the Turner claims, much of that deference can be brought in under the reasonable-modification standard; and then, if you think of the other class of cases, those involving deliberate indifference, I think in those class of cases, this is -- the prison context is one of the rare contexts in which the State is under an affirmative obligation to provide accommodations to the medical needs of inmates, including disabled inmates. And I think the fact that here's a case where the Constitution requires affirmative accommodation also helps narrow the prophylactic gap.",
  "I think it certainly could. I think -- if you look at the cases that we collect at footnote 17 of our reply brief, which are cases where the lower courts have applied Turner-style deference to claims under the Rehabilitation Act or under Title II, I think some of those Courts of Appeals have clearly taken into account those kind of budgetary concerns.",
  "Well, I think damages are an important aspect of the remedial scheme, Justice Kennedy. I would also point out that, because a number of States have challenged the application of Title II, in the prison context, in particular, as not being valid Commerce Clause legislation, it's not a foregone conclusion that there would be injunctive relief available. But I do think if we want to focus on the damage --",
  "Well, I'm not sure about the treble damages, but certainly compensatory damages would be available. This Court, of course, in Barnes against Gorman, has already said that punitive damages are not available under Title II. And I think if you look at compensatory damages --",
  "Well, I think punitive damages would be a harder case, in terms of proportional incongruence. But this Court has, even in the absence of congressional action, found damages to be an appropriate remedy for unconstitutional or unlawful State conduct. Take the Bivens cases, for example, or the Franklin case, in Title IX, and, I think, if damages are appropriate where Congress hasn't acted, I think where Congress has provided for damages, damages are clearly an appropriate remedy. But, with respect to damages, in particular, I think it's important to note that the prophylactic gap here is not large, because, in the Title IX context, in the Gebser case, this Court has already said that, in order for there to be compensatory damages, there needs to be a showing of deliberate indifference. And now, there may be some difference between what \"deliberate indifference\" means under Gebser and what \"deliberate indifference\" means under Farmer against Brennan, but, whatever that small gap is, that certainly seems manageable.",
  "No, Justice Ginsburg, we don't think so. But one thing I think it's important to emphasize is that, although at the current time period all 50 States take Federal funds for their prisons, so that all 50 States are subject to the Rehabilitation Act, that wasn't true at the time that the ADA was passed. And I think what that illustrates is both that Title II plays an important gap-filling role and also that, for whatever reason, I think, this is an area -- prisons taking Federal funds -- where the degree to which they take Federal funds may wax and wane over time. And so, I don't think this is a situation where Title II is purely duplicative of the Rehabilitation Act, but the difference is really in terms of the scope of the coverage, not in terms of the substantive obligations under the --",
  "-- two provisions.",
  "I'm --",
  "Yes, they are, as to the States.",
  "No, I don't think that is right, Justice Scalia. I think that we would -- we would say that the PLRA fully applies to claims under Title II and there is an exhaustion remedy. There is also, of course, an exhaustion remedy inherent in Title II, because, in order to get a reasonable modification, you have to ask for the modification in the first place. We also think that the PLRA applies, in all its provisions, to Title II claims. And one important provision to keep in mind is 1997e(e) -- 42 U.S.C. 1997 e(e) -- which is a limitations on the damages that are available. And, under that provision, in order to get damages for emotional or mental injury, you have to also show some sort of physical injury. And the lower courts have interpreted that to require at least the kind of more than de minimis injury you need under the Eighth Amendment. And I think the PLRA, together with Title II, in the particular area of damages, which is what Justice Kennedy has pointed out is the particular area of concern under the Eleventh Amendment, is even a further narrowing of the relief that's available and a further narrowing of the prophylaxis under the Title II. So, I do think the PLRA is actually something that actually helps make sure that the remedy here is congruent and proportional. May I ask you to comment on this? This problem of -- just troubles me a little bit. If we hold this provision unconstitutional because it is not congruent and proportional and so forth, does it not follow that the Title II is entirely unconstitutional, it cannot even be enforced by injunctive relief?",
  "Because of the lack of the Commerce Clause nexus? Is that the --",
  "-- concern, Justice Stevens?",
  "Well, it was -- when it was originally enacted, Justice Stevens, it was supported by both the Commerce Clause and, of course the --",
  "That is -- that's true, the statute generally -- and it's true of Title II. We would make -- we would certainly defend the Act as valid Commerce Clause legislation. But I do think that is a much more difficult argument as to Title II, generally, and particularly difficult argument with respect to prisons. I think, in that respect, it's --",
  "-- telling that, if you go back to the Government's brief in Yeskey, when we were dealing with constitutional challenges to the application of Title II to prisons, the Government focused all its energy on defending it as valid Section 5 legislation --",
  "-- and dealt with the Commerce Clause in a footnote. So, I think we certainly, at that point, were of the view that the Section 5 authority was the much stronger basis to defend the statute, especially in the prison context.",
  "We agree with that, Justice Stevens. And I would say, with respect to -- I mean, again, I don't want to mislead you, in the sense that we would be here defending it as Commerce Clause legislation, but I think that's a tricky argument. If it's possible, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Before I say anything else, I want to just clarify that the scope of the Rehab Act and Title II is really coextensive. Mr. Schaerr made a reference to the fact that you need intentional conduct under the Rehab Act. I think that was true for a while in the lower courts with respect to damages claims. I think after this Court's decision in Gebser, in the context of damages claims, the lower courts have generally required deliberate indifference both in the Rehabilitation Act context and in the Title II Act context, to the extent they've reached the issue. But with respect to the substantive obligations, they really are identical. And I do think that's important, in a couple of ways. In particular, I think it's worth remembering here that the damages remedy in Title II -- and this is different than Title I, where there was a specific provision for back-pay -- but in Title II, the damages remedy is just an incorporation of the damages remedy available under the Rehab Act, which, in turn, incorporates Title VI and Title IX remedies. And those, of course, are entirely judge-made. And so, one of the things this Court recognized in Gebser, in deciding there had to be deliberate indifference for a compensatory-damages claim, is, this Court said, the judge-made nature of those remedies gives the court a particularly free hand in making those remedies make sense, in terms of the statute, and, I would think, a fortiori, in terms of the Constitution. So, if --",
  "Well, let me address the specter of all these claims for TV access, because I do think that that's something that can be taken care of in any number of respects. One is, a sensible application of Turner-type principles to the reasonable-modification standard can certainly be done in a way to weed out those claims. I also think -- especially given Justice Kennedy's principal concern with damages, I think here's an area where the PLRA is particularly helpful, because I don't know what kind of physical injury you're going to be able to show to being denied access to the TV room. And since that's what you need to show under the PLRA in order to recover any damages for mental and emotional suffering that I suppose you could try to bring a claim for emotional suffering for not seeing TV -- I'm not sure which way that would cut -- but, in any event --",
  "-- I think, in those contexts, the PLRA is the gateway you need to some physical injury, so I think that's going to help weed these out as a matter of damages claims. And so, I think that's going to have a helpfulness, too. Also, I think, in some -- in some sense, you can't lose sight of the fact that perhaps the reason that somebody's being denied access to the TV room is because they're in a wheelchair on the second floor, and the TV room and the law library and the religious services and everything else they need in the prison is on the first floor. And, in those contexts, it may be an appropriate degree of prophylaxis. But I guess what I would say is, I would think that this Court would want to interpret the PL- ­ - I'm sorry, would want to interpret Title II in a way that avoids constitutional problems, rather than in a way that engenders it. And so, to the extent the access to the TV room is critical to the constitutionality of the statute, I think the reasonable-modification standard provides plenty of tools to apply Turner-type principles and ameliorate the constitutional problems. I mean, if you compared this case with Cutter against Wilkinson from last term, there you had a statutory strict-scrutiny standard that was specifically directed at the prisons in one other context. And, nonetheless, this Court said, \"That can be applied with Turner deference-type principles.\" Here, you have a statute that applies broadly, and I would think it would be a very easy act of interpretation and constitutional avoidance to say that, \"In the prison context, we're going to interpret in a way that avoids constitutional difficulties.\" If I could try to address just one or two specific questions -- Justice Souter, you asked about the practical experience of the Federal Government. And, as we point out in our opening brief, at page 45, it's been less than 1 percent of our litigation, and less than 2 percent of our compliance cost. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Respondents elected to bring a facial challenge to New Hampshire's statute and succeeded in their goal in enjoining the statute in all its applications. Despite the facial nature of their challenge, however, they do not contend that the statute is invalid in all or even a large fraction of its applications.",
  "No, I don't think it was, with respect, Justice Souter. This Court found as to the spousal notification critically, that there was a large fraction of the applications of the statute that would give rise to the constitutional problem.",
  "Well, two things, Justice Souter. I think, first of all, this case has come up postured as being about a choice between Salerno and the large fraction test. And I think in some points, based on the way respondents have approached the case, that's become largely beside the point. At footnote 13 of their brief, they could not be more clear, that they are not here contending that the statute is invalid in a large fraction of their applications. They instead are embracing a per se rule that if the statute does not have a health exception or an emergency exception clear on its face, it is void in its entirety.",

  "Well, I can think of two reasons, Justice Souter. First of all, because this Court applied the no set of circumstances test in Akron II to a parental notification statute, this Court in Casey may not have wanted to overrule Akron II to that extent. Second of all, I think this Court, in that very passage about the large fraction test, specifically distinguished spousal notification provisions from parental notification provisions.",
  "You should clearly rule in the State's favor. And the respondents have really given you no choice because they aren't even arguing that a large fraction of the applications of the statute are invalid. What you have before you is really a case where it's literally a one in a thousand possibility that there is going to be an emergency where the statute will operate. And the real question for you is faced with that kind of case. Do you invalidate 1,000 applications of this statute noting that 999 of them are constitutional?",
  "Absolutely. And they also could have -- what I think I would envision them filling is an even narrower provision that seeks a pre-enforcement declaration, kind of like Steffel against Thompson would be the model, that say that this statute can apply in an emergency situation.",
  "And Justice Breyer, I would say the court has some discretion in how it formulates that order. It would basically say that this statute is not constitutional as applied to those emergency situations.",
  "No, I don't Justice Scalia.",
  "I think the court could issue any order a legislature could issue. And I think the fact that the court would have some discretion is an answer to the argument that, oh, well, if you leave this to the courts, you're cutting the legislature out of this. I think that --",
  "I don't think that's right, Justice Souter and I think it's because you have to be careful. I think it's easy to use loose language about a health exception. And I think if you looked at the First Circuit opinion, they seem to suggest there needs to be a health exception. And I think in the context of a parental notification statute, a health exception as opposed to a narrow exception for emergencies is a non --",
  "With respect, Justice Souter, I think they were -­",
  "They did and it's extreme severability.",
  "I think that's right Justice Souter -- Justice Scalia -­",
  "Two answers, Justice Souter. First of all, I think that if you look at what the New Hampshire legislators were concerned about, they were concerned about a broad health exception that would undermine the statute, not an emergency exception. As to the severability point, I think in some respects, severability is the wrong way of looking at it. In the context of as-applied challenges, this Court has not rigorously said that you look at the applications and see whether they're severable. The idea is that a statute is not constitutional in certain applications. But the New Hampshire legislature I think was -- even had the belt and suspenders to worry about that if you had a different view of that, it's the view that actually Justice Thomas embraced in his Booker opinion, that actually you do look at severance when you do applications. The New Hampshire legislature couldn't have been clearer, because they said not only do you sever the provisions, but sever the applications. We want to save as much of this statue as we can.",
  "You're right, Justice Ginsburg, but I don't think you look only at the end of the statute. It clearly says, if any provision of this subdivision or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the provision or applications of this subdivision which can be given effect without invalide - sorry -- provisions or applications. It seems like they had this case in mind, that there were circumstances in which perhaps some court would say it was unconstitutional to apply it and that's not a basis to strike down the whole statute.",
  "With respect, Justice Ginsburg, I don't think that accurately describes the way the courts have approached as-applied cases. They often hold statutes unconstitutional as applied. Think of Wisconsin against Yoder. This Court said that a general compulsory education statute didn't apply to the Amish. It's just unconstitutional as applied. They didn't think, boy, you know, the Wisconsin legislature didn't expressly put in an exception -­",
  "Well, I think that's true, Justice Ginsburg, but it just shows that that's the way that this Court approaches as-applied cases. It's not a matter of reading something in. its saying the statute doesn't apply. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Solomon Amendment conditions the Federal funding of educational institutions on receiving something that any donor would expect, the opportunity to recruit students educated at the funded institutions. That opportunity allows the military a fair shot at recruiting the best and the brightest for the military's critical and vital mission. The Federal Government does not insist on any predetermined level of access; rather, it simply asks what other employers receive. Likewise, the recipient schools remain free to criticize the military and its policies, and, of course, they remain free to decline Federal funds altogether. As a result of these circumstances, the Solomon Amendment comports with both the Constitution and with common sense.",
  "Well, I think, Justice Scalia, that you have to look at the -- I think, the statute in two steps. One is, I think it's quite clear that it gives the military a right to gain access to campus as a condition, that it has -- that they have to gain access to campus in order to perform their military recruitment.",
  "Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, I think there's several points to be made in response to that. First of all, I think the Solomon Amendment itself is a recognition that the military is not like any other employer for purposes of its policy and its treatments of homosexuals. And I think that, unlike any other employer, the military's policy is a result of a congressional mandate. And --",
  "And what --",
  "-- what I would say --",
  "Well, and Justice Kennedy, I think the point I would say is, in terms of gaining access to campus, we want to gain access at a level, and under circumstances, that perhaps some other employer would be excluded. Well, once access is gained, then the question arose under the prior version of the statute, all right, if access is gained, what level of access suffices? And on that second-order question of what level of access suffices, then you look to what is provided to any other employer. And so, that's why, when I say that we don't ask for any predetermined level, we don't ask for seven meetings a year, we don't ask for entrance into the public-address system or the e-mail system. We simply say, \"Once you let us on campus, just give us, and extend to us, an opportunity to recruit on the same terms as others.\" And that obviously reflects the commonsense judgment that the military is competing for the same pool of students that the other employers are competing for.",
  "That's exactly right, Justice Breyer.",
  "And, of course, we take the --",
  "-- position that --",
  "I think there's -- I mean, there's -- the Constitution is -- has no difficulty with such a statute. It is this statute. As I say, there's -- if you want to think about it being preferential entry into campus, and then, at that point, equal access on terms of the -- the terms that are extended -- however you want to think about it, though, there's no difficult constitutional question here.",
  "I think that's right, Justice Scalia. I'm -- and I'm sorry if I got us off on the wrong foot.",
  "I think there is this debate --",
  "Well, a couple of points, Justice Breyer. I don't think there is a difficult constitutional question to be avoided here, and I'll get back to that whenever I can. As to the statutory-interpretation question itself, I think that in -- the proper frame of reference here is probably not the original 1969 version of this, which conditioned only NASA's fund. The original starting point is probably about 1996, when the first version of the modern Solomon Amendment was introduced. And there have been a couple of iterations of it, but I think one important reference point is the version that was in force at the start of this litigation, and that's actually reproduced at page 88(a) of the petition appendix in the District Court opinion. And if you look at that against 88(a) of the petition appendix, there would be no question that what is at stake here is access to the campus, and the amicus argument that's being raised is not even available; because the statute at that point is, I think, in fairness, materially identical, except for that last clause, which says \"in a manner equal in scope to -- in character to that of any other institution.\" So, it's clear that when this litigation starts, there's no argument available to the amicus that the statute effectively accomplishes nothing. Now, what happens under this version of the statute is, a second-order question arises. Okay, the -- in order to comply with the Solomon Amendment, universities have to give access, they have to allow the military to gain entry and gain access to the students in the terms of the then-extant statute. The --",
  "Sure.",
  "As a regulatory matter, the military took the position that if they simply barred access to --",
  "-- anybody --",
  "I think you could read the statute either way on that question, Justice Stevens. They interpreted it to say that there was no equal -- there is no obligation to give entry if no employer was on campus at that time. The other thing they interpreted in the statute as a regulatory matter, though, was this second-order question of, \"All right, if they get some access, is unequal access enough?\" And as a regulatory matter, they said, \"No. We need access that is equal in character and scope to that provided to any other employer.\" And then what Congress did in the iteration of the statute that's at issue here, which is reproduced starting at page 185(a) of the petition appendix is they effectively codified and ratified that regulatory interpretation by adding the phrase \"in a manner that is at least as equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses and to other students that is to -- provided to any other employer.\"",
  "But I think --",
  "No, that's true, Justice Ginsburg. That's why I said, in response to Justice Breyer, that I think that the proper point to start to focus on is the -- these -- is the 1994 Solomon Amendment. And, at that point, there is a question about this policy. At that point, the American Association of Law Schools does have its recruiting policies beginning in place, and I think the provision has been amended a number of times in the years since 1994. There have been changes in the scope of the funding that's covered. First, student-aid funds were put in, then they were taken out. And then, this is the most recent iteration of the provision. There's no question that what's at issue here is more than just the Vietnam-era concerns about ROTC presence on statute, because that's addressed in a different subsection of the statute. That's addressed in 10 U.S.C. 983(a). So this provision, 10 90- -- 10 U.S.C. 983(b) is specifically addressed at the problem of access to campuses for recruiting. And, I think, especially when you read the statute in light of the relevant history of the prior administrative interpretation, and that being codified and ratified by Congress, it's very clear that this phrase \"in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access provided to any other employer,\" is just that, it's a regulation of the manner of access, once access is granted. And it addresses this difficult question of, If you allow some entry and access onto campus, what level of access is sufficient? And so, I think that --",
  "It deals with the military.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I think the statute is clearly supported under both provisions, under the spending authority and the Article I authority to raise and support armies. I think, in answering your question, we tended to focus on the fact that it was a spending condition, because we thought, under this Court's precedence, that made it an even more straightforward case. We certainly think it would be constitutional, even if it were a direct imposition, and we certainly think the fact that this is an exercise of Congress's undoubted authority to raise and support an army, is relevant to the constitutional analysis. And if I could move over to the constitutional question and address that for a minute, I think one of the arguments that's raised on the other side is that there's an interference with associational interests in this case, and I think there are other statutes that, frankly, have much more of an interference with a university's associational interest. I mean, Title VII, for example, regulates who can be members of the university. And I raise that also because another provision in Title -- in terms of this same area of the military, requires that there not be discrimination against veterans in hiring and employment. And you could easily see that a university could take their position to its logical conclusion and say, \"In order to show just how much we don't like the military's policy, we're not only going to not let military recruiters on campus, but we are going to not hire former military people, veterans, and we're not going to admit them to our classes.\" Now, who's in the classroom, and who's a member of the university --",
  "-- seems --",
  "Well, with respect, Justice Ginsburg, I'm not sure I understand why not. It's the same idea. In order to teach equality, that there should be no discrimination against homosexuals, we're going to exclude, (a), military recruiters, and, while we're at it, the former military, as well, because they voluntarily joined the forces knowing that they had a discriminatory practice. It's no stretch of the imagination to think that the principle that's being articulated by Respondents, would stretch well beyond simply a direct antidiscrimination motive. For example, NYU -- this is in the joint appendix, at page 153 -- NYU, for 3 years, had a policy of excluding recruiters from the State of Colorado, simply because Colorado had passed Amendment II, which this Court dealt with in the Romer case. And so, it's not a matter of saying that, \"Well, you know, the only think that's at issue here is excluding employers that are, themselves, discriminatory.\" The free-speech interests that are articulated on the other side, would extend to any basis for criticizing the military, whether it was not liking the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, or the discriminatory hiring policies. I also think, with respect to the issue of discrimination, it's worth pointing out here that there's more than one way to understand whether or not the military's policy is discriminatory. Certainly respondents are entitled to view it as being discriminatory. But the Congress that mandates this same policy towards homosexuals, I think, is equally entitled to look at it and say, \"No, there's no discrimination going on here, because you have to take into account the special role of the military.\"",
  "I think that's exactly right Justice Souter, and I think those arguments would be the same even if what was going on here was a concern about the military's other policies. You would still have a concern that the military is being forced onto campus to make its own speech, and you would still have the concern that that interferes with the message --",
  "-- the university --",
  "I agree. I mean, I think, ultimately, that cuts in our favor, because it shows that the other side's position is not limited to this narrow context, but is a much broader first-amendment claim. Now, turning to that first-amendment claim, I think what's wrong with that claim is several things. I think, with respect to what the military itself wants, it simply does not want a -- primarily a speech activity to take place, it wants access for recruiting, which is a traditional commercial enterprise, it is an activity that is something that is regulated by Title VII in other Federal statutes. Sure, there may be some incidental speech involved in that, but primarily it is an instrumental activity designed to get --",
  "It does, indeed, Justice Scalia, and I think, though -- I mean, there is this sense in which we certainly concede that there maybe some incidental speech involved; certainly, military recruiters are engaged in speech. I'm -- we're not sure that's really the relevant speech. But even the university itself --",
  "Well, Justice Souter, I guess -- I'm inferring that you're drawing that conclusion from some of the statements of some of the floor sponsors about their purposes enacting the Solomon Amendment. I mean, if you look at the text of the Act alone --",
  "-- I don't think --",
  "Well, I think the reason for the Solomon Amendment is to ensure that military recruiters, in fact, have an equal opportunity to recruit the same pool of individuals that all the other employers are trying --",
  "-- to recruit.",
  "Well, if by -- \"the expressive objective\" you're talking about is the military's own recruiting, I guess --",
  "-- I agree with you.",
  "No, I would disagree, Justice Souter. If the -- if the law schools were denying access to military recruiters, for any reason, be it a first-amendment reason that they'd say it's a first-amendment reason, or just because they couldn't be bothered, the Solomon Amendment would be written exactly the same way, which would say, \"Look, the military has an opportunity to get onto campus, and, once it gets there, it ought to get the same basic opportunities as other employers.\"",
  "Absolutely not, Justice Scalia. And I would go further and say it's also not a problem, if, in the real world, the conduct that Congress sought to regulate was, in fact, in practice, generated by first-amendment concerns. I think that describes O'Brien.",
  "Yes, they can, Justice O'Connor. I think they would be, in fairness -- I want to be clear -- I think there might be a line where there would be -- the recruitment office could conduct itself in a way that would effectively deny access. But I think, with that caveat, there is --",
  "-- nothing in the Act that prevents the universities --",
  "-- from disclaiming --",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, I would say, to the -- I think, the main thrust of your question, no, which is to say that if what you have in mind is really forcing them to go to the undergraduate campus, I think the military would take the position that that's not equal in scope. Now, if there's a way, though --",
  "It's the latter, Justice Stevens, and only the latter --",
  "I mean, my own --",
  "Well, I mean --",
  "-- I guess I'm -- I'm resisting a little bit just because I'm not -- I think it would depend on the --",
  "-- hypothetical.",
  "It could --",
  "It could apply to some symbolic speech, I believe. It's just -- I'm having trouble, because, in a practical matter, if you look at the record here, I think it's telling. If you look, at joint appendix, at pages 215 and 219, describes the real situation at Boston College. And they want to say that, \"Well, it's not really much of an imposition on the military, because all you have to do is get the recruiting list from the reserve desk at the law library, and then go to\" --",
  "-- the main campus, which is a mile and a half away.",
  "Well, and I think -- I mean, I'm -- I think that some resistance by some parts of the university might be fine. I think if the recruiting office -- this is the caveat I tried to give Justice O'Connor -- if the recruiting office engages in conduct that effectively negates the access that they're providing, then I think you would have a different situation.",
  "I mean, concretely, they could put signs on the bulletin board next to the door, they could engage in speech, they could help organize student protests. I would draw the line, though, at saying that they have to go to the undergraduate campus, because I think, as a practical matter --",
  "The school could --",
  "-- organize --",
  "I think that would be equal access. I think you have to draw a practical line --",
  "-- here between --",
  "-- between access and allowing the speech, but I think it -- you have to be ­ -",
  "I don't think the military and the Army recruiters -- and I -- and I won't be one of them -- but I think the Army recruiters are not worried about being confronted with speech, they're worried about actually not being allowed onto the same law schools --",
  "I don't know if it would fulfill every purpose, but I think the amendment has to accommodate the first-amendment --",
  "-- interests at --",
  "-- a university.",
  "Well, I think that would --",
  "Well, but, Justice Kennedy, I think you have to distinguish what the Constitution would allow the Government to do and what this statute does, which is to say -- I mean, what you have in mind is a --",
  "-- race example --",
  "Right, but in -- the practical meaning has to turn on the statute at issue. And Title VI, for example, in the race context, forbids all discrimination because of race. And so, some of the conduct that you have in mind may well violate that statute. And if Congress wants to write a different statute that provides more rights to the military, we would be here defending it as valid first- amendment legislation. But this statute gives, not a right to be free of any discrimination, but a right to equal access. And we think that the right way to frame that inquiry is say, \"Access, yes, but be respectful of speech.\" And the last thing I would say, if I could reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal, is simply that it's worth remembering that the recruiting office is not the heart of first-amendment activity on campus. And if the recruiting office acts in a way that ensures access, and the rest of the university engages in speech, that's a common sense way to accommodate the interest of the military recruiters and the first amendment. If I may reserve.",
  "Yes, Your Honor. I understand the hypothetical, at least -- especially as to the first half, which links to Justice Breyer's earlier question. There is an enormous difference, under this Court's jurisprudence, between antidiscrimination laws and the sort of law we have here, the Solomon Amendment. And the difference is, the Government -- it is both on the need side and on the infringement side. On the need side, the Government has a compelling interest that is different from just regulating the conduct. The compelling interest that the Government has is a completely separate interest in seeing to it that not a penny of Federal money ever goes to support an institution that taxpayers would not be in a position to go to. That's Bob Jones and Norwood. And, on the infringement side, this Court has said, that the act of discriminating against individuals is entitled to no first-amendment protection, regardless of whether there's a first- amendment right at stake. And I should add, also, that the vast majority of schools that are subject to Title VI or to Title IX have no such expression that is at stake. They are not articulating a message, \"We really need to discriminate on the basis of race or on the basis of gender.\"",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to make just a few points in rebuttal. First of all, in starting with the compelled- speech problem, there are only two kinds of speech that are at issue here. First, there is the compelled speech of the military recruiters. And no one thinks that that speech is being misattributed to the schools. Even in the secondary-school context, in Mergens, this Court understood that secondary students could distinguish between the school's message and that of school groups. Now, the second piece of speech that's at issue is that of the university, when they incidentally send an e-mail around telling the students where the military recruiters are going to be on a certain day. And certainly in the context of recruiting, that kind of incidental speech does not implicate any compelled- speech doctrine. In the Title VII context, for example, if an employer says that there's a job opening, and says that to a white applicant, it has to say the same thing to an African-American applicant. Nobody would think that that other -- saying that to the African-American applicant, which is, of course, compelled speech by Title VII, violates the Constitution. I would also say, just as the last point on compelled speech, that it's something of a stranger in a strange land in the context of this case, since we are talking about a funding condition, not a compulsion. Second, let me move to the argument that the Respondents have about trying to distinguish this case from Justice Stevens' World War II hypothetical. And, as I understand it, it boils down to the argument that the way that the legislature was reacting here to this problem and observing what it observed on campus somehow implicates different constitutional issues, different first-amendment issues. And I think the O'Brien case stands as an obstacle to that argument. In that case, if you look at it, the argument was exactly the same. There already was a prohibition that required you to have your draft card with you. Congress then passed a second statute that prohibited burning your draft card. Now, what did the Representatives say about that? Well, Representative Bray, of Indiana, said that this was an effort to get at \"communist stooges and beatniks.\" Now, this Court did not strike the statute down on that basis. It looked at the text of the statute and upheld the statute as a reasonable statute. Let me also, then, move to what you could call the \"Bob Jones problem.\" And I think you have to have be cautious about interpreting this statute in applying a rule and having it come back in the context of other statutes that even the law schools like, like Title VI and Title IX. I don't think it's enough to simply say that race is going to be different. For one thing, Federal statutes also prohibit, as a condition on funding, universitywide discrimination on the basis of disability and on the basis of age. Now, those aren't things that trigger heightened scrutiny, and I think one has to be worried about converting this rule in this case to something that's going to threaten those statutes. This Court, in Hishon, for example, made the point that all discrimination can be recharacterized as somebody simply saying -- exercising their associational rights, \"I don't want to associate with you, because you're female,\" in Hishon. You have to be leery of that kind of recharacterization. The last point I would make is that there's simply no limit on Respondent's argument in this case. I don't think their matter of conscious limitation is going to be enforceable by the courts. And, beyond that, I think, even in this case, there is more at issue here than just the military's policy on homosexuals. If you look at the original statement of the American Association of Law Schools -- which is in the joint appendix at 246 and 249 -- they were concerned, first and foremost, about the military's policies on homosexuals, but also about the discrimination in sex, on what kind of combat roles that women could have, what they call career-advancing positions. So, even if Congress changed \"don't ask, don't tell\" tomorrow, the -- presumably, the law schools would still be here protesting the military's position on gender, or perhaps the war in Iraq, or perhaps the war in Afghanistan. And the last point in showing there is no limits on their position is, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, any conduct can be imbued with communicative force just by saying, \"We're opposed to this, and, therefore, we're going to engage in this conduct.\" That's simply not enough to generate a significant first-amendment interest. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In McConnell against FEC, this Court upheld title II's definition and regulation of electioneering communications by corporations and unions as defined in the act.",
  "No. In -- in fairness, Mr. Chief Justice, in the McConnell case at pages 105 and 106 of our brief, we said that as-applied challenges would arguably be available. But the principal argument we stressed in the brief and in oral argument was that, in a sense, overbreadth analysis here and even as-applied challenges, though we didn't put it in those terms, are a little bit beside the point because of the nature of the regulatory structure here.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I will answer it, and I -- and I think actually --",
  "Okay. Yes. Yes.",
  "Lane and Hibbs. I can't imagine after those two decisions which upheld in facial challenges the statutes at issue there and said that there was not too much prophylaxis for purposes of section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment --",
  "Lane and Hibbs. Tennessee against Lane and Nevada against Hibbs. I can't imagine after those decisions that somebody --",
  "I don't think this Court has --",
  "Well, I think the case really hasn't arisen because generally when this Court clearly identifies an area where Congress can regulate in prophylactic terms, somebody doesn't come back in and try to bring the exact same challenge. And if I could give you two examples. If somebody after Burson against Freeman, which you may remember is the case where this Court upheld a 100-foot buffer zone around a polling place -- if somebody came in after that decision and said, well, that can't apply to me in an as-applied challenge because I only want to stand 90 feet away, I think they would have gotten laughed out of Court because this Court already said that a 100-foot buffer zone was sufficient. I think in a similar way --",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy --",
  "And -- and, Justice Kennedy, please understand me. I don't mean to suggest that McConnell somehow magically jurisdictionally foreclosed as-applied challenges. And I suppose if somebody could come in after Burson and give a good reason why their situation is very different, that there's a super highway 90 feet away or that all they were talking about is a bumper sticker on a car, well, then maybe that --",
  "Exactly, Justice O'Connor. And again, it's not because it's foreclosed. It's because the reasoning of this Court in McConnell forecloses the decision.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, that would be a better as-applied challenge. I still think that with respect to the ads in the 30 days before the primary and the 60 days before the -- the general election, that corporation could look at this Court's decision in McConnell and say, oh, I understand. Our remedy is not an as as-applied challenge. Our remedy --",
  "No, no.",
  "No, no. The point would be in October either -- do exactly what this Court said at page 206 of the McConnell opinion: either make the ad in terms that doesn't expressly refer to the candidate which, if you're not interested in influencing the candidate election, shouldn't be a problem, or fund that one advertisement through a separate, segregated fund.",
  "I understand that, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think if you focus in on this particular ad, you will see that whatever the true intent of the advertisers here, this is the kind of ad that clearly would have an impact on the election. I mean, it talks about the -- the filibusters in colorful terms, associates them with gridlock and with a state of emergency, and then associates it with a candidate.",
  "No, Justice Scalia, it's not. But I think what this Court very clearly did in McConnell is it rejected an argument that said that the only thing that Congress could regulate is that which was unambiguously targeted at candidate elections.",
  "No, Justice Kennedy. What we're arguing for stems from the observation that this Court made in McConnell, which is that when you get up between 60 days before an election and you look at the ads that are run, most of the ads, in fact, are designed to influence candidate elections. It's very difficult to figure out exactly which ones, and there are very serious problems with adopting a very vague intent standard.",
  "No, they're not, Justice Kennedy. The Internet is not covered.",
  "No, Justice Kennedy. I think the fact that there are alternative methods available to communicate these ideas in these ads is a virtue, not a defect with this regulatory structure. And I would like to focus in on these ads because while it is true that --",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, I -- I'm not sure you really do think that -- that McCain- Feingold should be extended to that.",
  "And I do think that this is an area where this Court, in fairness, has recognized that -- that any effort to regulate in this area effectively has to avoid three pitfalls. And it's a very difficult task for Congress. It has to avoid being vague. It has to avoid being overbroad. And as your question suggests, it also has to avoid being so under-inclusive and easy to evade that it can simply be circumvented in a way that Congress can't achieve its purpose.",
  "Well, I -- I want to be responsive and I think the way to respond is that this Court's decision recognized that these ads were going to be difficult to classify and that you needed some kind of bright line rule and that the consequences of having a bright line rule in this consequence -- in this area weren't terrible because there were alternative ways for them to communicate either through a separate, segregated fund which served the interests of the statute or by avoiding the kind of references that would raise serious questions about tying the ad to a candidate election. And I think if you look at -- if -- if you want to keep the possibility open of some as-applied challenge and you focus on these ads, these are ads that clearly, I think, would implicate the concerns of Congress.",
  "I think all issue ads that come within the statutory prohibition are permissibly regulable. I think --",
  "Sure, you can run issue ads as long as you either fund them through a separate, segregated fund or you --",
  "-- omit the reference to the candidate.",
  "And -- and --",
  "I think that this -- I do think that is what the opinion says and stands for. And I think this Court recognized --",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, for one thing, I think it's important to recognize that the discussion about sham versus genuine issue ads was really a factor of the fact that necessarily in looking at the record there, what the Court had to do is look at ads that were run in previous election cycles where this regulatory structure wasn't in place and try to classify those ads. And as I understand it, sort of genuine versus sham was a way of capturing whether or not it was an ad that seemed primarily focused on an issue or primarily focused on a candidate election.",
  "I'm not sure which figure Mr. Bopp is referring to as the 7 percent figure. I don't -- I don't remember conceding that 7 percent of the ads were okay. And I think what we very clearly said -- and if you go back and look at our briefs, as I did, I think you'll see this. What we very clearly said -- and the Court picked up on it in that line on page 206 that Justice O'Connor read earlier -- is that whatever was true about a retrospective analysis of ads that were run in an election cycle that wasn't governed by the statute, that in the future corporations could avoid the -- the strictures of the statute by simply doing one of two things: either avoiding making an express reference to the candidate, which ought not to be too difficult if you're really just engaged in issue advocacy, not trying to influence a candidate election, or alternatively, you can fund it through the separate, segregated fund.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, they didn't even do that in this ad, as has already been pointed out. And if they would have said find out what you can do to stop judicial filibusters, visit befair.org, and avoided a reference to Senator Feingold, they could have run this through their general treasury funds. But they couldn't resist the temptation to mention Senator Feingold in this context --",
  "Yes, Justice O'Connor, they also could have done that. And I think that the very fact that they couldn't resist the temptation to link the filibuster issue to Senator Feingold is not that surprising --",
  "Well, and again, Mr. Chief Justice, though, I mean, fair enough, but I think you also have to keep in mind that this is a context where this filibuster issue isn't some idiosyncratic interest of the appellant here. This is an issue that was identified as a campaign issue by the -- by -- by the candidates opposing Senator Feingold, by the Wisconsin Republican Party, and by appellant's own PAC. And to the extent you're trying to figure out whether this was really designed to influence the pending legislative votes or the election, the timing of this ad strongly suggests it was designed to influence the election.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that gets back to Justice Stevens' question as to whether or not these categories are mutually exclusive. I'm not here to tell you that appellants weren't genuinely issued about -- genuinely interested about the filibuster issue. I think they were also, as their political action committee press release shows, genuinely interested in sending Senator Feingold packing. And they had an opportunity to run this ad and effectively get a twofer by naming Senator Feingold. Now, they could have resisted that and only gotten the influence on the -- the filibuster issue, if they had taken the --",
  "They -- they could have, Senator Kennedy.",
  "Obviously --",
  "Obviously, you're right, Justice Kennedy, but obviously, there are concerns that are implicated when somebody is running in cycle and the ad has targeted the electorate in the immediate run-up to the election that aren't present there with Senator Kohl and, therefore, the Congress has -- has struck a different balance in that case. But just to focus on the timing of these ads, they were run on day 4 of a 45-day August recess of the Senate. Now, that timing, if what you were trying to do, is to influence a pending legislative vote, is very, very odd timing. It could hardly be worse. If, on the other hand, you're trying to influence the upcoming election, the timing of that ad makes a great deal of sense.",
  "I'm not sure I would --",
  "With respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not sure I'd pick day 4 of the August recess to do that. Maybe 14 days before they're going back, something like that, would be an appropriate time to catch their attention in a -- in a period where they're going to remember it when they go and vote. But I think day 4 of a 45-day recess is probably not when I would pick to start running these ads. I don't suggest, though, the timing factor or any other one factor ought to be dispositive. I think what it goes to show is how difficult it would be to try to get into a fact-intensive as-applied analysis of these various issues. And all of that presumably would have to be done in the context of TRO hearings and preliminary injunction hearings on the eve of elections.",
  "Well, no, I think my answer to that would be that we'd still be here suggesting that that's controlled. I think my answer was also that that would be a far better as-applied challenge than the one that this Court has before it. And I think, you know, in -- in one sense we make this point in the brief. I mean, contrasting this case with a case like MCFL I think is quite instructive. There, you're not focused on the content or intent of specific ads. You look at the organization as a whole and come up with fairly bright lines. And once you've made a determination about the organization in an as-applied challenge, you're done with the issue. Here, the kind of --",
  "Well, I mean, that may speak about where the ACLU is going. I don't think it speaks about where this Court is going because this Court hasn't adopted that test. The test that this Court adopted in MCFL would -- did not get into that kind of inquiry. What it did is it focused on three relatively bright line factors about whether you accept corporate money, whether you have other sources of income from the corporation, and whether or not you were formed expressly for political views but without any sort of censorship or inquiry into what kind of political views. And that I think this Court has found administrable.",
  "The FEC administers that. That's --",
  "No, you're not wrong, Justice Breyer. And I would say that the --",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, let me answer both questions. As to the 527 issue, as I understand it, the commission has decided to proceed on case-by-case inquiries and has not tried to have a broad regulatory approach yet. Now, on to the issue of electioneering communications, you're absolutely right that there is a statutory authorization to create exceptions. But the regulatory authority of the commission is limited, and it's limited in the sense that they can't approve an exception that would allow for ads that engage -- that -- that fairly read, engage in promoting, attacking, supporting, or opposing a candidate. And what the FEC has found in practice is that it's very difficult to create that kind of regulatory exception because, as this Court recognized in Buckley and in McConnell, one does not want to naively underestimate the creativity of corporate spenders or political consultants. And if you create a bright line and say, all right, if you do this, that's grassroots lobbying, that's not electioneering communication, they're going to be able to drive a truck through that kind of exception --",
  "-- unless you're exceedingly careful.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, as I understand the record, the first effort to broadcast this ad was on, I think, July 26th, and that was sort of a few days before the -- the cutoff period would kick in. So there was an effort by a matter of weeks to broadcast this ad. But I think, you know, whether one views that as setting the stage for this litigation or being kind of an independent decision, I'll -- I'll leave to others. What I think is important, though, is that although they were engaged on this issue before then, up until that point, they had found it perfectly satisfactory to engage on the issue without engaging in broadcast advertisement.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I don't have as good an answer for that as I would like because the -- the Web site is now defunct. And so maybe Mr. Bopp can answer that in rebuttal. As I understand it, consistent with what Justice Breyer said, that there was sort of additional arguments about the Feingold record on -- on filibusters and Senator Kohl's record on filibusters, and then there was -- there was information about how to contact them. But I think, again, as -- as Mr. Bopp has said, if -- if you don't find the broadcast medium a particularly effective way to convey the phone numbers and you have to reference people to the Web site anyways, the very fact that you could reference them to the Web sites without naming the candidates' names and avoid the strictures entirely seems like the kind of thing that this Court had in mind when it said on page 206 that there were ways to deal with this problem prospectively and that you didn't need a as-applied challenge like this one. And again, I think you can't overestimate the difficulties here because --",
  "Justice Scalia --",
  "Well, I hope that's not the case, Justice Scalia. Let me give you two other First Amendment examples: the first admittedly involving intermediate scrutiny; the second, a strict scrutiny case. The first thing I have in mind is the contribution limits themselves. This Court has fully admitted that it doesn't have a scalpel to probe the difference between $2,000, $1,000, $4,000 as a contribution limit. And it's perfectly willing to admit in its opinions that not every high-value donor is going to be involved in an effort at corruption. Yet, this Court approved the approach of the contribution limits, which are hard to understand as anything other than prophylactic limits. Now, that's an example from intermediate scrutiny. Even in the strict scrutiny context, though, a case like Burson, I mean, this Court understood and said in the opinion, we can't tell whether 75 feet would be precisely okay or whether 90 feet or 100 feet. We don't have a scalpel to probe that either. But we're going to approve 100 feet because it's a basic way of dealing with this problem, identifying the area of potential concern, and people can do their electioneering 101 feet away. They can do it here on the 61st day. They can do it through the segregated fund. I think that is an approach that this Court has found acceptable, even in the First Amendment area, in dealing with these intractable problems. And I think Buckley --",
  "Well but, Justice Kennedy, precisely because you can't engage in just a formless content-based inquiry and precisely because there isn't any neat division between issue ads and candidate ads, that is why you need to have a different regulatory approach. I mean, this Court recognized --",
  "Absolutely, Justice Stevens. And of course, an even position one step intermediary from that or one step backtracking from that would be to say that all Congress can do in this area is regulate those ads that are unambiguously election oriented. And, of course, what's the class of those ads? Well, that would be express advocacy. And the one thing that I think is clear from this Court's decision in McConnell is this Court made clear that express advocacy is not a constitutional line. Congress is not disempowered to go after mixed ads that are -- yes, they have a component of issue ads, but you bet you they're intended to influence the election. Those ads are what are at issue here, and I think in order to be able to regulate those in a way that makes sense, the key is to regulate in a way that's not vague, that's not overbroad, but is not so under-inclusive that it can be easily evaded. And I think Buckley shows how hard that is. It's a tall order. In Buckley, this Court had a provision of FECA that prohibited independent expenditures related to a candidate election. The only way the Court could save that provision from the vagueness concern was to limit it to express advocacy. But having done that, the Court said, well, it's so limited, it's so easy to evade, we're going to find that it fails strict scrutiny. In McConnell, this Court said that in BCRA, after careful study, Congress had actually found out a way to avoid those three pitfalls. All of the proposed alternatives of -- of appellants run headlong into one or more of those obstacles. Look at the tests they've proposed. They've proposed looking at 16 factors, 4 details. They disclaim any interest intent, but any of those tests I think would be vague and unworkable. In contrast, they pluck a definition from the IRS regs that is designed to deal with 501(c)(3) corporations in a completely different context or a modification of a proposal by BCRA's sponsors, and they -- and they put those tests out there. And those would be very, very easy to evade in practice. In fact, I think if you use some of the tests that they propose or their amici proposed and you look at the body of ads that were before this Court in McConnell, you'd end up finding that a substantial percentage of them were grassroots lobbying. Well, if one thing has to be inconsistent with this Court's decision in McConnell, it's the conclusion that a substantial amount of the ads covered by this definition are unconstitutionally regulated because this Court clearly rejected a substantial overbreadth claim. The one thing I would say in -- in closing is to understand that Congress, having sort of avoided these very difficult pitfalls of vagueness, overbreadth, and easy evasion, came up with this definition in title II. But as this Court recognized in McConnell, title II of the statute does not stand alone. It is part and parcel of the broader regulatory regime here. And without title II, title I's limitations on soft money contributions to parties will succeed only in taking that soft money and directing it to corporations that are closely aligned with candidates or with the parties themselves. This statutory as-applied challenge that you have before it -- you strikes at the heart of the McConnell decision and at the heart of BCRA's title II. This Court should reject the invitation to revisit the McConnell decision and should give Congress' effort in this area a fair chance at success. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In United States against Riverside Bayview Homes, this Court unanimously upheld the Corps' jurisdiction over wetlands that were not themselves navigable, but were adjacent to waters otherwise within the Corps' jurisdiction. The principal difference between the Rapanos wetlands and the wetlands at issue in Riverside Bayview are that the Rapanos wetlands are adjacent to a non - navigable tributary, while the wetlands at issue in Riverside Bayview were adjacent to a navigable creek.",
  "Mr. Chief --",
  "Well, not in all these cases, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "No, not -- not -- that's actually not true. There are three specific wetlands that are at issue in the Rapanos case. One of those, the Pine River site, as its name suggests, is adjacent to the Pine River, which is a body of water that has water flowing through it all year-round. It's a river. I don't think anybody would look at that and say that's not a tributary of the downstream navigable rivers. And I think that's why, in fairness --",
  "The -- the other sites are -- are adjacent to man-made ditches that also drain in. If I just -- can I just say, though, I think the fact that the Pine River site is so obviously a tributary under -- under any definition is one of the reasons, along with the theory that you heard advanced by Petitioners, that this case --",
  "Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice. I just want to make the point that this case, because of the theory Petitioners have advanced, has not really unearthed or focused on the definition of a tributary, but let me get to it because the Corps has defined the definition of a tributary. And the definition of a tributary is basically any channelized body of water that takes water in a flow down to the traditional navigable water --",
  "Even --",
  "Justice Scalia, absolutely.",
  "The Corps has not drawn a distinction between man-made channels or ditches and natural channels or ditches. And, of course, it would be very absurd for the Corps to do that since the Erie Canal is a ditch.",
  "Well, let me say two things, Justice Scalia. First of all, this case has not been litigated under the theory that the key difference is whether it's man-made or natural, and that defines somehow the scope of a tributary. And I think there's a good reason for that, which is the second point, which is as the Corps experts -- from the experts of the Corps will tell you, the process of making the natural rivers navigable has all been about the process of channelizing them and creating man-made, artificial channels in them to the point where the difference between that which is a man-made channel and that which is a natural channel is both difficult to discern and utterly beside the point for purposes of this regulatory scheme.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, I think the precise answer to your question being none of the land mass -- none of the land itself would be regulated. But in terms of -- you want to talk about the --",
  "Well, the -- the Corps doesn't. They treat those as water bodies.",
  "And that's not the gravamen of the complaint here. But just to be responsive to your question, I think it's important to understand that the Corps and the EPA's view of wetlands would cover about 80 percent of the wetlands in the country. And that shows that the impact of this Court's decision in SWANCC was real and substantial because about 20 percent of the Nation's wetlands are isolated.",
  "I don't think that's right, Justice Scalia. The Corps has regulated this channelized tributary system. It has done it without regard to whether those channels are seasonally dry in some areas, and I think that's a rational judgment. It's not been the gravamen of this case, though. And what's important is while the Corps and the Federal Government regulate that channelized system of tributaries, non-point source pollution is still something that's in the primary providence of the States. And so it's not true that the Corps is asserting an authority to regulate land as such. But to also get it on the table, if the Federal Government wanted to -- if Congress changed its mind and said that, say, the banks of the navigable rivers or their tributaries are within the scope of this program, as it did in 1899 in section 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, we'd be here defending that as a valid exercise of Congress' authority not just under the Commerce Clause, but under the navigation power of the --",
  "No. With respect, Justice Scalia, in 1899 in section 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, the so-called Refuse Act, Congress regulated the navigable waters and their tributaries. Now, in fairness, the focus there was this idea that they only regulated the tributaries if they could show that it flowed into the navigable waters themselves, but they asserted right in the text of the statute in 1899 the authority to regulate the tributaries and the banks. And that shows what I think is a very important difference between this case and SWANCC.",
  "Justice Kennedy, that's not precisely accurate. The way it would describe it is this. As to the first question you have to ask, which is are the tributaries covered, we think an important component of describing the reach of the tributary system is whether there's a hydrological connection. On the second -- and that's subsection (5) of the regulatory definition that brings within the scope of waters of the United States tributaries. Then you get to the second question which actually implicates another subsection of the definition, subsection (7), which is the adjacent wetlands. And as to the adjacent wetlands, as the Carabell case illustrates, the definition does not turn on hydrological connection for purposes of asserting the Corps' jurisdiction.",
  "I think they -- they were included for the likelihood of an interaction both hydrologically and otherwise. I would say two important things, though.",
  "The two points I would make is, first of all, I think the Corps' regulations, which for 30 years have ignored the premise -- the -- the presence of a berm, are rational because in the vast, vast majority of cases, that berm is not going to prevent a hydrological connection, so to speak. And so a test that focuses, first and foremost, on physical proximity is a very rational jurisdictional test. The second thing I would say, though, is it's simply not true that even in the rare case where a berm or a dike prevents all hydrological connection, that an adjacent wetland will not perform an important function for the adjacent water body. And the most obvious one is the flood control possibility of the wetland.",
  "I -- I think, Mr. Chief Justice, my own view is the reason that that caveat is in subsection (7) is actually a vestige of the pre- SWANCC scope of the regulation. And specifically, if you look at subsection (3) of the definition which is the isolated waters provision that was at issue, I think, through the Migratory Bird Rule in SWANCC, that includes wetlands in the available isolated waters. And I think --",
  "Well, several thoughts on that, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the problem with that approach is that the reason why it makes sense to regulate that very first tributary that flows into the Mississippi is the reason that it makes sense to regulate the entire tributary system. All of that water is going to flow down into the navigable waters, and if there's going to be --",
  "Well, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, the way that I would read that and the way I understand the Corps reads that is that was really just trying to exclude a wetland adjacent to a wetland that was a water of the United States only because of the application of subsection (3).",
  "And I think that's -- that's supported by the --",
  "I agree with that, Justice Kennedy.",
  "Well, and I -- I guess there is two ways to look at this. You can start with the significant nexus test and see if it's met. I guess the way that the Corps would naturally proceed is to start with their definitions, and they would say section -- subsection (5) covers tributaries. And you can ask the question, is there a significant nexus between the tributaries and the navigable waters in which they flow into? And I think the answer to that is yes. And then there's the secondary question, as to subsection (7) of the regulatory definition. Is there a significant nexus between wetlands that are adjacent to waters otherwise within the Corps' jurisdiction, be they the traditional navigable waters or their tributaries? And I think Riverside Bayview answered that question and said, yes, there is a significant nexus between adjacent wetlands and any otherwise regulable water body to which they are adjacent. So that's the way we would ultimately satisfy what this Court required, which is a significant nexus. I wouldn't have understood this Court's decision to transplant the significant nexus test and say, that's what the Corps should administer, because whatever ambiguity there is in waters of the United States, I think significant nexus is precisely the kind of test you'd want the Corps --",
  "Well, I -- I think that -- as I said, I think what -- what the definition meant to get at was to exclude wetlands adjacent to isolated wetlands under subsection (3). I think if you ask the question more broadly, what about wetlands next to wetlands, I guess it depends on what you mean by that because the one thing we know from Riverside Bayview is that it's not a requirement that the parcel and its wetlands be immediately adjacent.",
  "And --",
  "They meant wetlands adjacent to waters that would otherwise not be in the statute which are isolated wetlands under subsection (3). It's the only application it has in -- in the regulatory structure, as they understand it.",
  "Under insignificant nexus? Well, I think it's the waters at issue in SWANCC, and I think it's --",
  "Well, no --",
  "I'm leaving out everything that this Court excluded in SWANCC, and I wouldn't have thought that the -- that the Court necessarily suggested there was going to be some subset that had a further insignificant nexus because it wasn't -- the argument of the Government in those cases was obviously -- we didn't just concede that those bodies of water were utterly isolated. We said they did have important ecological connections with the water. And I think the way I read SWANCC is that we can't make that --",
  "What I would say, Mr. Chief Justice, is that if the tributary flows in. I would start with the tributary, and I'd say, now, there's clearly a significant nexus between the tributary and the navigable waters to which it flows. I would then look at the wetland, and I would say for purposes of the regulation of adjacent wetlands --",
  "For purposes of the adjacent wetlands, it doesn't look to hydrological connection per se. The way I would resolve that is I would resolve it with reference to footnote 9 in this Court's opinion in Riverside Bayview, and I would say, all right, one drop? Fair enough. It's in the regulatory jurisdiction because it's adjacent and that's what the Corps looks to. And I think that's a rational judgment. But if there's one drop, grant the permit. That solves the --",
  "Adjacent to a tributary, absolutely.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I think if you had in mind a tributary, you'd probably have in mind the Pine River which is at issue in one of these sites. And I think that's why that's not the way Petitioners have presented this case.",
  "With respect, Justice Scalia, some things that you might classify as a storm drain are actually very deep channels that have a continuous flow of water that were --",
  "Well --",
  "But therein is the problem, which is some things that are part of the storm water drainage system of a city are actually things that were previous navigable natural waters. I mean, so --",
  "We would, Justice Scalia, but I guess if we can start with the proposition that tributaries are covered and then some things that the Corps thinks are tributaries you disagree with, that would be fine. But that would be a different case. That hasn't been the theory that this case has been presented. As I understand, these drains here are actually, you know, substantial channels that do have water in them. I have no doubt that the Pine River meets the test that it sounds like you would have for a tributary, and the difficulty I'm having is I'd be happy to defend what the Corps did if this Court, in the -- in the litigation of this case, had focused the court's and the Corps' attention on that issue.",
  "That's right. It's an undefined term. The Corps has interpreted it in the 2000 preamble. The best place to find the Corps' teaching on this is 65 Fed.Reg. 12,823-4. And they go through -- it was part of a comment and they deal with comments about their treatment of ditches and the like and many of these issues. And I guess what I would say is I think that for purposes of this case, I mean, you heard the Petitioners' argument. They have obviously, based on the legal position they've advanced, not focused this Court or any other court's attention on subdividing which tributaries count because their view is nothing counts. Even the first tributary doesn't count. And I think in this case what I would urge you to do, if -- if you have some concern with, you know, the extent of the definition of tributaries, is to not make that a basis for invalidating this -- the judgment of the Sixth Circuit here. And that's an issue that could be developed in other cases if -- if the parties want to really focus the attention on that. I think I would be comfortable defending the Corps' judgment, even in those more finely focused challenges, because I get back to the point, which is that the same logic that has you regulate that first tributary also suggests that you want to regulate anything that's a channel that brings large quantities of water into the navigable waterways.",
  "I absolutely agree with you, Justice Scalia, and that's why I'm not up here asking for Federal regulation over non-point source pollution, although that obviously contributes to the -- to the problem. What I'm up here asking for is a recognition that the tributary system is something that Congress can validly regulate and did regulate in its broader definition of waters of the United States in the Clean Water Act. And I think that's something -- the authority to regulate tributaries is something Congress regulated starting in 1899 and, importantly, this Court expressly upheld in 1941 in Oklahoma against Atkinson.",
  "Well, I think one important thing to focus on, Justice Scalia, is this case is not just about the Corps' 404 program because the 404 program by its terms does not permit anything. As -- as the permit word suggests, it's a -- it's a process of granting permission. The relevant provision here is section 301 of the statute which prohibits a discharge into the navigable waters without a permit. And so whatever this Court decides for purposes of the 404 jurisdiction, it's necessarily deciding for purposes of the 402 jurisdiction of the EPA. And so what you'd be suggesting is that if some tributaries aren't covered, then it's perfectly okay to dump toxins in those tributaries even though you know that because they are a channelized system that directly connects with the navigable water --",
  "That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, but there's only two ways to do that. One way of doing that and the one that I hear them advocating would be this impossible sort of process of trying to fingerprint or DNA test oil spills in a tributary to figure out, yes, that's the guy that got it to the navigable waters. And the one thing we know is that there were some efforts to try to regulate pollution that way before 1972 and they were a dismal failure. The only other way to do it, as suggested by one or two amici, is to treat the last -- treat the tributary as if it were a point source. But I'd sure hate to be the guy who owns the -- the land next to that tributary that's dumping into the Mississippi who's going to be responsible for the pollution of everybody upstream. And what Congress recognized in 1972 is that they had to regulate beyond traditional navigable waters.",
  "With respect, Justice Kennedy, the States still have plenary control over the non- point source pollution. They still have an important cooperative role in -- in the overall program, as you'll hear more about in the second case today. And I would actually ask you to focus on one particular provision that deals with the relationship between the Federal Government and the States under 404 in particular, and that's section 404, subsection (g) of the statute. And that was added to the statute in 1977. Unless Congress is going to be construed to have given the States a virtual empty set, that provision makes crystal clear that the waters of the United States, for purposes of the Clean Water Act, extend beyond traditional navigable waters and their adjacent wetlands.",
  "Absolutely, Justice Scalia. I concede that. But then you get to the question of defining real tributaries, and that's neither been teed up in this litigation, nor is it something that I think, at the end of the day, you'd want to differ from the Corps' judgment, which although you find it striking that some things that are ditches are actually included in the system, that is a product of the way that the tributary systems have worked, the way that certain cities have taken over a natural stream and channelized it and make it look like a ditch, but it's part of the system that carries water down from the headwaters. And again, maybe that's an issue that we can try to divine the limits to in a subsequent case. But I think what's important, as -- as your very comments suggest, is that trying to give meaning to that textual indication that Congress had clearly wanted to capture something beyond traditional navigable waterways and their adjacent wetlands.",
  "Well, I think even you would concede it's a clear statement that something else must be covered. Otherwise, other than is completely meaningless in the statute. And so -- and -- and I -- I grant you that it might not be a clear statement as to the nth tributary, and maybe that's a case on which we can litigate in the future. But I think what I would say is, for those of your colleagues that want to look at the legislative history, it provides some additional context for 404(g) and makes it very clear that Congress, as this Court found in both Riverside Bayview and in SWANCC, was specifically focused on the coverage of adjacent wetlands. And it's very clear that they understood that whatever scope of jurisdiction was given to the Corps, that it would bring along with it the adjacent wetlands. And so there was this long debate. As I say, the legislative history I think makes quite clear that they were meant to include the non-navigable tributaries and a substantial amount of the non-navigable tributaries. And so, I mean, I would invite others to look at that. I also think that, to get back to a point I made earlier, one thing that's exceedingly clear from that legislative history is nobody in 1977, including those that were advocating restricting the scope of the 404(g) program, wanted to restrict the EPA's jurisdiction under 402. And so in the legislation that they proposed that eventually found form in 404(g), they expressly decoupled the 404 permitting process and its jurisdiction from the 402 process. Petitioners' argument, by contrast, necessarily restricts the scope of both of those programs because they are joined in the hip through 301. And so if they're right that they can dredge and fill in these wetlands, then it is equally true that they can dump toxic materials into those wetlands. If I --",
  "Well --",
  "What I would say, Justice Breyer -- I -- I think I can answer the whole question -- is in the vast majority of cases, as I understand it, a berm will not have the effect of actually preventing all hydrological connection.",
  "I think a number of the amicus briefs have addressed that. I wish I could point to you a specific one.",
  "Oh, again, I didn't mean to suggest a percentage. I just think that -- that -- let me put it to you this way, and this is the argument we obviously make in the brief. The best reason to think that a man-made -- that a man-made berm or a natural berm is unlikely to prevent all hydrological flow is even those man-made structures that have as their express design to prevent water flow, like dikes and levees and dams, have seepage and leakage from them. So --",
  "What's wrong with what you just said is that wetlands have unique characteristics that are different just from low-lying areas. And I think this Court started to recognize that in the Riverside Bayview case. And the image I would leave you with is the image that wetlands actually act something like a sponge, and because of that characteristic, they play two important roles in helping to regulate the flow of the adjacent water body.",
  "And, again, I mean, I would direct you to the amicus briefs that discuss in length the benefits of wetlands, but I understand you won't find those --",
  "And -- and I sense that you found them lacking in that sense. I guess what I would say is there's certainly anecdotal evidence in those amicus briefs that I think is quite striking.",
  "Well, not surprisingly, I would suggest that you defer to the agency in its exercise of expertise.",
  "Well, you -- and you could cite to the proceedings in this very case in the joint appendix because although they didn't use the sponge word, there was a specific finding in this case that these wetlands played an important role in flood control and pollution control for the adjacent streams.",
  "With respect, I don't think that follows because if you read subsection (7), as I do, as only excluding those wetlands that are adjacent to other isolated wetlands, then regulating those wetlands --",
  "Well, and as I said, I think you have to read that in the context not just of the rest of the regulations but of this Court's decision in Riverside Bayview. The one thing we know from Riverside Bayview is that it's not enough to simply say that your parcel of wetlands is not adjacent to the navigable waterway because in that case, as the Court remarked, it -- the parcel ended before it got to the adjacent navigable body of water and there was another wetland. There was a continuation of the same wetland. Now, I don't know whether you'd call that two adjacent wetlands. I might as a common locution. There might be some different way of referring to that. But we know that the one wetland was covered because that was the holding of this Court in Riverside Bayview. So I don't think I would give undue weight to that reading of it especially when, if you read it as I do, it makes perfect sense because a wetland adjacent to an otherwise isolated wetland is not going to have the same role to play in flood control in terms of monitoring the stream volume as a wetland adjacent to an otherwise regulable water body as you have at issue here. And so I think that that regulatory decision that the Corps has made is one that's perfectly defensible and makes sense. And I think that -- again, I think one other point that I want to note that's kind of specific to this case is part of the reason why it makes sense to regulate a wetland adjacent to an otherwise regulable water body, even if there is a berm present, is illustrated by this case because, as was alluded to, the specific development plan at issue here -- and this is clear at joint appendix pages 95 and 160 -- would sever the berm and create the hydrological link between a smaller, deeper wetland and the adjacent navigable wetland -- waterway system. And so, I mean, it doesn't make a lot of sense, as Justice Stevens suggested, to have a regulatory regime where you have a regulable wetland after but not before a construction project that has the effect of vastly reducing the size of the wetland.",
  "No, that's not it, Justice Scalia. What I'm saying is what the Corps has always done for 30 years is said they are going to regulate a physically proximate, adjacent wetland without regard to whether or not there's a berm there. I'm just making the subsidiary point that that makes sense because the very construction project that might be at issue might have the effect of changing the degree of the hydrological connection. I want to be very clear, though. The hydrological connection has never been the sine qua non of the assertion of regulation authority over the adjacent wetlands.",
  "The short answer is flood control. If there is that berm that -- that allows the sponge to soak up water, either rainwater or waters from adjacent parcels, although I think in this case, it would largely be rainwater, that -- the fact that there's a berm actually helps in the flood control. When you sever it, it changes the dynamic quite a bit because then it's somewhat less helpful for flood control --",
  "-- but actually is earlier in term -- plays a better role --",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Well, I think the way I would do it is you start with the tributary. And if you'll concede for purposes of the illustration or the argument that that's a water of the United States, then what the Corps does as a jurisdictional regulation is treat the adjacent wetland as a water of the United States as well. That makes sense for two principal reasons. One, in the overwhelming majority of cases, there is going to be a hydrological connection. Actually tracing out exactly what it is and how it works is very difficult and not the kind of thing you'd want to get into at the jurisdictional stage, and that's why the Court said that was fine in footnote 9 of Riverside Bayview.",
  "And that's not an independent basis for jurisdiction. It's simply an illustration of why disregarding the berm makes sense.",
  "It is not an independent basis. It is part of the reason why, though, in the context of wetlands in particular, a focus on physical proximity and adjacency makes sense and a fixation on hydrological connection does not make sense. Part of the reason you can look at the record here and find differing information about the extent of the hydrological connection is that is not a term that is relevant for the regulatory scheme. And the same thing was equally true in Riverside Bayview itself. In fact, in Riverside Bayview, the district court made a finding that the wetland there was hydrologically isolated from the adjacent streams. Now, as the Solicitor General pointed out in the petition at footnote 7 in Riverside Bayview, we think the best understanding of what was meant there was that there was no overtopping and that there was some drainage. But that just illustrates the point that hydrological connection is not a statutory term. It's not a regulatory term. It's a very loose term and it's not a term the Corps has ever used in regulating adjacent wetlands. It's important to stress that the regulation for adjacent wetlands that is at issue here, subsection (7), is exactly the same regulation that was at issue in Riverside Bayview. As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the Court, when it framed the question presented, framed it in terms of whether or not the Corps could rationally regulate wetlands that were adjacent to navigable waters and their tributaries. And when they got to the holding, this Court approved the regulation and approved the fact that it asserted jurisdiction over wetlands adjacent to otherwise regulable waters. So if the tributaries are otherwise regulable because they are waters of the United States, it follows directly from Riverside Bayview that the adjacent wetlands are covered as well.",
  "Well, and -- and I'm -- I wish that weren't the case, Mr. Chief Justice. What I would say, though, is that this case has just not framed up the question of tributaries, and that's because -- I mean, to put it more favorably to my client, the other side has never taken issue with the fact that their wetlands are adjacent to tributaries. And I think that's -- that's obvious for a couple of reasons. I mean, first of all, if you look at the property in Carabell, it's just a mile from Lake St. Clair. It's right next to a substantial drainage ditch which connects to a navigable water, Auvase Creek, and then into Lake St. Clair. In fact, it's kind of ironic, but the property in Riverside Bayview was also a mile away from Lake St. Clair. So it's very similar. If you look at the three sites at issue in Rapanos, one is right next to the Pine River. One of the others -- the whole point of the dredge and fill operation was to drain the wetland through the adjacent tributary systems so the water would go away. And in the third one, there also isn't an issue about whether or not those are tributaries. In a different case, that might be an appropriate focus for inquiry. The last thing, I would say a couple of points before I sit down. I do think, first, that section 404(g) of the statute is very important because it is the clearest textual indication that Congress intended to regulate something beyond traditional navigable waterways and their adjacent wetlands. And as this Court itself remarked in SWANCC, the single most likely candidate are the non-navigable tributaries. The second point to emphasize is that the scope of the Corps' 404 jurisdiction is the same as the EPA's 402 jurisdiction. They are joined at the hip through the basic prohibition under section 301. So a conclusion that somehow certain tributaries are excised from the tributary system for purposes of 404 is likewise excising those tributaries and creating a situation where you can have a -- a free dump zone at some point above the -- above what somebody might put as the limits of the navigable waterway system or the tributary system. And I think that is something that even the proponents of narrowing the Corps' jurisdiction in 1977 could not countenance. The last point I would make is that there are going to be real-world consequences to contracting the jurisdiction of the Corps and the EPA to pre-1972 or, really, pre-1899 levels, especially for the downstream States. I think it's a bit much to ask a legislator in Wisconsin or in Minnesota to stop local development in order to protect the water quality and flood control propensities of the Mississippi River in Mississippi. That's why it was manifest in 1972 that there was a need for a Federal solution to this problem. That Federal solution includes as two of its most important components first getting at water pollution at its source, at the point source, and secondly, covering the tributary system without which the navigable waters will continue to be polluted. Thank you.",
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The executive branch has long exercised the authority to try enemy combatants by military commissions. That authority was part and parcel of George Washington's authority as Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary Forces, as dramatically illustrated by the case of Major Andre. And that authority was incorporated into the Constitution. Congress has repeatedly recognized and sanctioned that authority. Indeed, each time Congress has extended the jurisdiction of the court-martials, Congress was at pains to emphasize that that extension did not come in derogation of the jurisdiction of military commissions. And in its most recent action, Congress clearly did not operate as somebody who viewed the military commissions as ultra vires. They offered no immediate review, and no review at all for charges resulting in a conviction of less than 10 years. Of course, even more clearly, Congress's most recent action made it clear that the courts no longer have jurisdiction over pre-enforcement challenges. And it's to that I'd like to turn first.",
  "Well, what I would say, Justice Stevens, is, they basically enforce the laws of war. At times, there are obviously United States sources that are relevant to that. Obviously, if you have a field manual or something that says specifically that certain offenses are triable under the law of war, that would be very instructive in the tribunals. In certain situations that I don't think are principally relevant here, you might also have war courts that were set up to deal with municipal offenses. But that's not what we have. And then, they would look to U.S. law.",
  "That is right. And, of course, in this context, you have a controlling executive act in the form of the regulations themselves that make it clear that the executive views things like conspiracy to violate the laws of war to be actionable under the laws of war. Now --",
  "I think if you did that, Justice Stevens, it would present the very difficult question that this Court has never squarely addressed, which is, does the President have some authority to try, by military commission, beyond that which Congress has joined him in? Obviously, article 21 of the UCMJ gives Congress's sanction to any military commissions, to the extent they try crimes that are triable by the law of war. So, in that sense, I think, as long as this Court construes consistent with over 100 years of United States tradition and history, the conspiracy to commit a law -- a violation of the law of war is a war crime, then you don't have to reach that --",
  "-- difficult issue.",
  "I think he --",
  "I think we would take the position that he could, as a matter of pure constitutional power. I don't think, though -- he has not acted in this case on the theory that conspiracy is outside of the laws of war. He's acted inconsistent with 150 years of tradition.",
  "Yes. I mean, in the sense that I think that if there were -- there -- the other side is certainly able to argue, before the military commissions, that certain procedural provisions or the like are prohibited by the law of war or give them some greater entitlement. Now, as this Court has recognized in cases like Madsen, I don't think that the law of war is -- you know, extensively regulates procedure. And, indeed, as the Madsen Court recognized, Congress's approach to military commissions has been radically different than its approach to court-martials. In court-martials, they regulate every jot and tittle of the procedure. And if the UCMJ and its provisions for court-martials applies, then the defendants are going to get not just Miranda, but Miranda plus, and a whole panoply of rights. If, on the other hand, this Court follows the precedents in Madsen, it will recognize that only those nine provisions of the UCMJ that expressly reference military commissions will apply, and the rest is left to a much more common-law, war-court approach, where there's much greater flexibility.",
  "Well, Justice Souter, I don't think there's any frying pan effect or fire effect, precisely because what you have with respect to the claim that the Geneva Conventions applies -- okay, that claim could be brought to the military commissions, but they could adjudicate it and say that the Geneva Conventions don't apply here, for any number of reasons. And I think that this idea that there needs to be an article 5 proceeding --",
  "Well, I don't think so, Justice Souter. I mean, I think the disagreement is more fundamental than that. What I would say is, a claim could be brought in the tribunal that the Geneva Conventions apply. Now, just because the Geneva Convention does apply --",
  "Well, I don't think, consistent with the position of the executive, that the Geneva Convention applies in this particular conflict.",
  "We're not trying to have it both ways, Justice Souter. The fact that the Geneva Conventions are part of the law of war doesn't mean that Petitioner is entitled to any protection under those conventions. And --",
  "I think it is, Your Honor, but let me just say that that's a claim that he could have brought before the CSRTs, and that is a claim he can still bring before the military commissions.",
  "Lawful --",
  "Well, and we disagree with those claims. We think that most of those claims -- to the extent that he thinks some procedural requirement is provided either by the Geneva Convention, if applicable -- but we don't think it would be -- and that argument would be made; but, if by some other, sort of, principle of the law of war that a procedure is required --",
  "-- he could -- he could make that argument.",
  "Well, again, I think he could -- he could bring that claim. I don't think it would be well taken by the -- by the commission. I don't think it's a valid claim. I also don't think, if -- there's any reason why that claim has to be brought at this stage in the procedure. We think that abstention --",
  "-- principles --",
  "Well, of course that's true. And --",
  "-- also --",
  "That's exactly right, Justice Scalia. And this Court made clear that it doesn't intervene --",
  "-- even when a U.S. --",
  "Well, with respect, Justice Kennedy, this isn't a \"group of people.\" This is the President invoking an authority that he's exercised in virtually every war that we've had. It's something that was recognized in the Civil War, something in the World War II that this Court approved.",
  "Well, but -- habeas corpus generally doesn't give a right to a pre-enforcement challenge. And this Court, for example, in Schlesinger against Councilman --",
  "Well, that's exactly right, Justice Scalia. And Congress has spoken to this precise issue in the DTA. Whatever was the question about applying --",
  "-- judge made --",
  "Well, I mean, I don't really think there's any serious dispute about which it is. I mean, this is something that is --",
  "Well -- and if this Court --",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, I think that even if a court might have had jurisdiction to hear just that issue and --",
  "-- nothing else before the DTA, Congress has now spoken, and Congress has made it clear that, whatever else is true, these military commission proceedings can proceed, and exclusive review can be done after the fact, after conviction, in the D.C. Circuit.",
  "Well, I think I disagree, at least --",
  "Oh, I disagree, Justice Souter. E(3) specifically preserves the claim that the commissions were not, and the procedures were not, consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States --",
  "-- to the extent --",
  "-- they're pledgeable.",
  "Sure, if they want to come in and argue that there is a violation of article 21 of the UCMJ, or article 36 of the UCMJ, after their conviction, they are perfectly free to do that --",
  "-- under E(3), but --",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, let me answer both pieces of that. I certainly think that such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States. There is a reference to the first military order. I believe there's also a reference to any other subsequent orders implementing that. All of that, together, implements the November 13th order. So, I would think that there is -- it is very easy to read this language to allow any challenge that is being brought here, with the possible exception of the treaty challenge.",
  "And --",
  "-- I think the language is capacious enough if the treaty challenge is what you thought was very important, the D.C. Circuit, at the end of the day, could decide whether or not there is a requirement that the treaty challenge be brought.",
  "That is true, Justice Ginsburg. And Congress, in this act, was very careful to basically write without prejudice to the answer to that question. So, we would have that argument. The other side would have their argument. What this act provides that we don't have any argument on, that was something that wasn't before this Court, say, in the Rasul decision, was the fact that the procedures that the military has promulgated are going to be enforceable under this exclusive review provision. So, there at least will be some law to apply now under this exclusive review provision.",
  "So, that --",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I certainly think that Petitioner will be up there arguing that Eisentrager is no longer good law, not just as a statutory matter, as a constitutional matter, and those arguments will be made. Without respect to that, certainly the arguments about article 21 and Article 36, that are very much the centerpiece of their argument here today, would also be available to the D.C. Circuit. And if there's some constitutional requirement that that review be slightly broader or slightly narrower, that seems like something that can better be adjudicated in the context of a concrete case at the point that that review is sought.",
  "But one thing I --",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there would be 1254 review. Once the provision is in the court of appeals, then the case would be under -- under E(3), the review provision -- then the case would be in the court of appeals for purposes of this Court's 1254 jurisdiction.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, let me answer that question in two parts, which is to say that I think that this case, and most of the cases, don't raise a serious Suspension Clause problem, for the simple reason that I think deferring review or channeling it to the court of appeals does not amount to a suspension.",
  "Well, but --",
  "But, with respect, Justice Breyer, I think that cuts both ways, because I don't think there's any particular interpretation of these provisions on the table before this Court that's going to eliminate those potential Suspension Clause issues.",
  "Well, Justice Souter, first of all, I would think general principles of constitutional avoidance would say deferring the constitutional question is a good thing, not a bad thing. The one point I would --",
  "Right. But I don't see any argument on the other side that's really a constitutional avoidance argument. Their principal argument is --",
  "-- don't apply this --",
  "Well --",
  "And, Justice Breyer, what I would say is that our interpretation basically provides for pending claims exactly the way that Congress did. With respect to any future claims that might be brought, there may or may not be a constitutional question. And if I could turn to our interpretation of the DTA, it's the only one that really, I think, reads the various provisions in the statute in harmony. Now, this Court's decision in Bruner, and in a host of other cases, says that when Congress eliminates jurisdiction, pending cases fall, unless there's a savings clause. The closest thing to a savings clause in this statute, in E(1), is the provision that says \"except pursuant to Section 1005.\" And I think that's important, because if Congress wanted to put in a savings clause of the kind that this Court seems to refer to in Bruner, and that would certainly be consistent with Senator Levin's intent, it would have been very easy. Instead of saying \"except for Section 1005,\" they could have said \"except for pending cases.\" The choice is important, because what does Section 1005 provide? It provides the exclusive review in E(2) and E(3). And then, H(2), in very complementary fashion, says that, just in case there's any question about it, those provisions on E(2) and E(3) apply to pending claims governed by those sections. I think every word's important. It doesn't say \"pending cases,\" it says \"pending claims.\" Congress understood two important things. There were no cases currently pending under E(2) and E(3), because Congress was creating E(2) and E(3). It also knew that most of the cases before the D.C. Courts had some claims that were pure challenges to the final CSRT determination and other claims. So, what H(2) says is -- H(2) says that, to the extent those cases involve claims governed by E(2) and E(3), they are preserved under E(2) and E(3); otherwise, this -- there's no savings clause that covers those claims, and their jurisdiction is removed. The --",
  "-- retroactivity aspect -- I'm sorry.",
  "I think both, ultimately. I mean, I don't think --",
  "Well, I -- I don't see why I can't have alternative arguments here, as for anywhere else, Justice Stevens. We think that Congress, in this action, did not do anything that triggers the suspension of the writ. But if you think that --",
  "-- it did, I think that --",
  "Well, I think that the terms of the Suspension Clause would be satisfied here because of the exigencies of 9/11. If the question is, am I taking the position that Congress consciously thought that it was suspending the writ, then I would say no.",
  "And if you think, in order for there be to a -- to be a valid suspension, Congress has to do it consciously, then I think you could see why the arguments are mutually exclusive. My view would be that if Congress, sort of, stumbles upon a suspension of the writ, but the preconditions are satisfied, that would still be constitutionally valid. So, I think that may be the disagreement.",
  "I mean --",
  "Well, a couple of things, Justice Souter. I would agree with you if what we were talking about is suspending the right as to citizens within the Continental United States, but all Congress did here is restore the law to the understanding of the law that had prevailed for 200 years. Now, this Court obviously took a different view --",
  "-- in Rasul.",
  "I think at least if you're talking about the extension of the writ to enemy combatants --",
  "-- held outside --",
  "-- the territory of the United States --",
  "Okay.",
  "No, Justice Souter. There's no -- my point is not inadvertence. It's whether they have to say or incant any magic words that they are now invoking their power --",
  "-- to suspend the writ.",
  "That is my point. And there's nothing inadvertent here --",
  "Well, then any effort to suspend the writ would be invalid. But this is not a case where there's any question of --",
  "I don't think --",
  "-- I disagree with that.",
  "I guess my point would --",
  "I don't think I disagree with that. But there's two separate points here, is that -- one is, does Congress have to say, \"We are now suspending the writ under our Suspension Clause\"? And I don't think there's any call to say that they have to do that. Obviously, in cases like St. Cyr, this Court has been very clear to say, \"Congress obviously can't stumble upon the Habeas Clause.\"",
  "But that's not --",
  "-- at issue here.",
  "Yes. And there's no question that Congress, here, tried to amend the habeas statute. This is not like St. Cyr, where they didn't go after 2241 in terms. There's nothing subtle about this statute with respect to the clarity with which it speaks --",
  "-- to the habeas statute.",
  "With respect, Justice Souter, I don't think making a retroactivity analysis or holding here is going to spare you the trouble of dealing with the Suspension Clause argument. I mean, in St. Cyr, it's worth noting that this Court addressed the specificity with which the statute applied separately from the retroactivity question. Here, to take the first question first, there's no question, this wolf comes as a wolf. Congress was going after 2241. It clearly did that. All of E(1) --",
  "-- is a new subsection.",
  "With respect, Justice Souter, H(1) never spoke to the question. An earlier provision, D(1), had very different language, in an earlier provision of the statute, that spoke with greater clarity. I'll grant --",
  "-- you that.",
  "That's gone. But just because Congress could have made it clearer doesn't mean that the Government loses here.",
  "Senator --",
  "It's not of dispositive significance, Justice Souter.",
  "That's a very fair point, Justice Scalia. But even to get at the very -- what happened here is very analogous to the legislative evolution this Court found unilluminating in Martin against Haddocks. There, the attorneys fees provision you had before it -- before you, used to be in 802 of the statute, which was expressly applicable to pending cases. Congress moved it out into its own separate section that didn't expressly apply to pending cases.",
  "This Court did not --",
  "I don't disagree with that, Justice Souter, but there's no special habeas retroactivity law. There is a special rule, under St. Cyr, for habeas, but we amply satisfy that, because --",
  "-- this whole thing is a 2241(e) new section. So, this is all about amending habeas.",
  "I think the answer, Justice Ginsburg, is that, you're right, this isn't like ex parte McArdle. What made ex parte McArdle so unique is, Congress went after this Court's appellate jurisdiction, and that alone. What Congress has done here, which is not that unusual, and it's certainly happened several times since McArdle, is that the Court has modified the jurisdiction of all the courts, and that has had the effect of eliminating jurisdiction in this Court over a pending case.",
  "That's happened any number of times. The Guagliardo cases that we cite in our brief provide one example. And as Justice Holmes made the point there, it's not a situation where you go after this Court's appellate jurisdiction, as such. There, it's a situation, as Justice Holmes put it, that, when the root is cut, the branches fall; when the district court loses jurisdiction over these cases, then this Court loses jurisdiction. But it's much less of an affront to this Court than the kind of statute that Congress passed in the McArdle situation.",
  "And if I could talk to various aspects of that, I'm happy --",
  "-- to do so.",
  "Let me try to hit a couple --",
  "Let me try to hit a couple of highlights.",
  "Let me try to hit a couple of highlights. This is much more of a call for military commissions in a real war than, certainly, the use of military commissions against the Medoc Indians or any number of other instances in which the President has availed himself of this authority in the past. I think the events of 9/11 speak to the fact that this is a war where the laws of war are involved. As to whether or not the law of war encompasses the crime of conspiracy to violate the laws of war, we think that is clearly established. That is something that the United States treated as a valid war crime in the Civil War. That is something that the United States treated as a valid war crime in World War II. I would invite you, as to the former, to look at Winthrop's Treatise, page 839, note 5. He makes it very clear that those conspiracies are not just conspiracies of municipal law, what he called \"of the first class,\" but they included the second class, which are classic war crimes. The most prominent examples are the Lincoln conspirators and a conspiracy at Andersonville Prison to deny POWs their lawful rights. Clearly, those are classic war crimes. In World War II, of course, conspiracy was also charged. And this Court saw it in the Kearing case, although it didn't reach that element of the charge. Now, I think it's very important to understand that history, because the most relevant text on this question is article 21's reference to the law of war. And as this Court was crystal clear in the Madsen case, what that reference is, is Congress's effort, when it extended the jurisdiction of the courts-martials to include more and more crimes, that it didn't want to crowd out the military jurisdiction of the military commissions just because they had concurrent jurisdiction. And this Court, in Madsen, said what Congress authorized was the jurisdiction of the military commissions as it existed in 1916, and then presumably again when it passed article 21 of the UCMJ, the jurisdiction that existed as of 1950. Well, in 1960, you could try conspiracies to violate the law of war. In 1950, you could violate conspiracies to the law of war. So, now let me try to get to the procedures that would be applicable. The argument that's made here is an extraordinary one, that article 36, when it says that military commissions can deviate from the laws of evidence, to the extent the President determines necessary, except that it must apply for the -- comply with the provisions of the UCMJ. Clearly, what that provision means is the provisions of the UCMJ that specifically impose requirements on the military commissions. And there are nine of them. And they impose some -- certain minimum rules. But to say that that provision incorporates all of the UCMJ provisions that put much higher requirements on courts-martials, is to violate this Court's Madsen decision, which clearly recognized that there were differences between court-martials and military commissions. And, although that was an act -- that was a case that addressed the articles of war, article 38 is identical to article 36(a) of the UCMJ, so that's not a difference that matters. And, if I could say, the other thing is, that just violates any normal principle of statutory construction, because then the nine express references to the military commissions are rendered utterly superfluous. Clearly, what Congress had in mind was that, \"You must comply with those provisions of the UCMJ that apply specifically to the military commissions.\" If I could make this point clear, because I think it's helpful in reading the past cases, what made Yamashita and other of the World War II cases so difficult is that the President in that situation constituted commissions that violated even the procedural rules that the articles of war made specifically applicable to the commissions. And so, if you look, for example, at Justice Rutledge's dissent in the Yamashita case, he was at pains to emphasize that very few of the provisions of the articles of war applied to military commissions. And the difficulty was that the -- that the military, in that case, was not complying with even those provisions that specifically applied to military commissions by terms. That's not an issue here. These military commissions comply with all of the provisions of the UCMJ that are specifically addressed to military commissions. So, I just don't think there's a procedural problem here. The import of extending article 2 jurisdiction to new individuals doesn't mean that anything in Yamashita, as to this point, is really no -- is still relevant. What that does is, it takes away the argument -- to the extent that these individuals are within article 2, it takes away the argument that the President doesn't have to even comply with those provisions of the UCMJ that are expressly directed to the military commissions. But that's not an argument we're making here. The argument on the other side of this is really that when Congress specifies that nine rules apply to military commissions, and everything else applies to courts-martials, that somehow all of them have to apply to the military commissions. And as Justice Scalia's question alluded to earlier, in order to accept that argument, you really have to believe that what Congress was doing when it was carefully preserving the military -- the jurisdiction of the military commissions was simply to preserve the option of calling something that had to comply with every single statutory requirement in the court-martials. They got to label it something else. They got to label it a \"military commission.\" Clearly, if you look at the legislative history of Article of War 15 and article 21, as they were developed in the Madsen decision and discussed in the authoritative testimony of General Crowder, that's exactly what wasn't going on. They wanted to make sure that this argument, that as we get more and more things that come within the military jurisdiction of the courts-martials, that somehow we're cutting back on the military commissions. That's not what they wanted. The next thing that may be lurking in the question is the question of, Wwat about the Geneva Conventions? And I think that, very importantly, we have arguments that we have surfaced in our briefs that the Geneva Conventions do not provide relief in these circumstances, that they do not apply, for various reasons. But the first question, at the outset, is whether this Court is going to overrule that portion of Eisentrager that basically said the Geneva Conventions are not judicially enforceable. Now, of course, this Court can say, \"That was the '29 Convention, and this is the 1949 Convention.\" But, as the court of appeals correctly determined --",
  "Well, I don't think it was dicta, Justice Stevens. If there's one thing I think the Eisentrager decision has, it's an awful lot of alternative holdings. And --",
  "-- Justice Black was concerned about that, and said, \"What are you doing reaching the merits when you have, you know, said there's no jurisdiction?\" But the Court, as a holding, said that the Geneva Conventions of 1929 did not apply. There aren't any material differences about 1949 Conventions. And I ask you to think about why that makes sense. Because the 1949 Geneva Conventions were being negotiated contemporaneously with this Court's decision in Eisentrager. And even if you think the rule is different today, at that point, Justice Jackson was quite correct that the idea that an enemy combatant would get access to the domestic courts of a detaining power was absolutely absurd. And so, what the -- the framers of the Geneva Convention recognized that they were dealing with a group of people that were uniquely vulnerable. So, they went to great pains to make sure there were mechanisms to enforce their rights. And so, there are various provisions for party-to-party enforcement. There are various provisions for getting the protecting powers, which is now a role basically taken over by the ICRC, to get access to the detainees and to provide other mediating effects. So, what you have is a treaty that's really written against the backdrop, that of course these people aren't going to be able to get to the domestic courts of their detaining -- the detaining power. If you look at the treaty, and read it as a whole, I think it's almost impossible to read it as applying judicially enforceable rights in the domestic courts. The constant --",
  "Well, Judge Williams found that, you know, Common Article 3 was applicable here. I don't know why that the Common Article 3, and nothing else would be judicially enforceable. And I don't read his opinion as saying otherwise. I think he still took the view that the entirety of the Geneva Conventions were not judicially enforceable. Now, I take it that the thrust of the question, though, is, don't these Geneva Conventions, even if they're not applicable for one reason or another, don't they form the background of some sort of customary international law that influences what -- how we should interpret the word \"law of war\" in the statute? And I would say, at a minimum, if there is some role for customary international law here, it has to, consistently with The Paquete Habana case, take into account and give due weight to a controlling executive act. Here, the President has determined, for example, that conspiracy is an actionable violation of the law of war that can be tried in front of these commissions. He's made that clear. He's also made clear that these procedures are sufficient and supply the rights. And so, I think that has to take -- be taken into account into the analysis. I think, also, since article 21 is the most logical place you would -- you would look to any of this as the law of war, I think it's important to understand that I would read that as incorporating some question about what kind of crimes can be brought in this jurisdiction.",
  "I sure hope not, Justice Breyer, because that's been the tradition for over 200 years. And article 21 itself makes this clear, because what does it say can be tried by military commission? It says anything that's made a violation of statute or law of war.",
  "So --",
  "I think that may be true, Justice Stevens --",
  "-- certainly as to the article --",
  "-- 21 point.",
  "But --",
  "But there's no innovation in trying conspiracy as a violation of the law of war.",
  "Well, I hope so, because there's really no question that conspiracy has been charged. And, like you said, I would encourage you to look at footnote 5 on page 839 of the Winthrop Treatise; and this Quirin case had, also, that charge brought before it. Colepaugh against Looney, which is a Tenth Circuit case from World War II, involved the charge of conspiracy. Now, they're going to come up here and tell you, \"Well, but that wasn't -- you know, in Colepaugh and Quirin, that wasn't the one that the Court settled on.\" But that doesn't dispute the fact that that is a crime that has traditionally been charged as a violation of the law of war.",
  "Well, he's -- I mean, I -- I'm not saying that he isn't somebody who is protected by the laws of war, the customary laws of war. I think that he is protected by those. I don't think he's protected by the Geneva Conventions, but that's largely because he chose not to comply with the basic laws of war. He's obviously --",
  "That is the point --",
  "-- that I'm making --",
  "Right, but not the domestic courts of the detaining power. And if he's any different than a usual prisoner of war, it's because he's disentitled themselves to some protections by what has been determined by the CSRT protections. Let me just address, if I could, the idea that having provided him with CSRT, we now have to provide him with an article 5 hearing. The CSRT provisions provide all of the protections, and then some, that were normally provided in an article 5 hearing. They were focused on the question that is relevant in this dispute, which is whether or not somebody is an innocent civilian or an unlawful enemy combatant. Nobody has a claim here that they were part of the uniformed al Qaeda division that complied with all of the laws of war, such that they are entitled to POW status. The POW unlawful enemy combatant line is not one that really needs to be policed in this conflict. The serious concern -- and it was his claim when Petitioner walked into Federal Court in Washington -- he said, \"I am not an enemy combatant. I did not take up arms against the United States.\" That's the claim that he brought to the CSRT, the CSRT rejected. For these purposes, at this stage in the litigation, that ought to be enough to allow the proceeding to go forward in front of the military commission. One of the defenses in the military commissions is lawful combatancy immunity. He can make the argument that he wants to make in front of the commissions. If the commission rejects the argument, then there will be review of that decision in the court of appeals on a concrete record. This Court can then address that under 1254. The use of military commissions to try enemy combatants has been part and parcel of the war power for 200 years. Congress recognized it in 1916 in the Articles of War, then again, after World War II, in the UCMJ. This Court recognized it in a host of cases, not just Quirin, but Yamashita, Eisentrager, and, most clearly, in Madsen. Since that is such an important component of the law of war, something that has been part and parcel of that power from Major Andre's capture to today, there is no reason for this Court to depart from that tradition. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Arizona has decided to adopt a particular form of the insanity defense, and it has also decided to protect that substantive decision by channeling evidence about a defendant's mental capacity into an affirmative defense with the burden squarely on the defendant. Neither aspect of that judgment violates the Federal Constitution. And I think, with respect to the substantive decision, there are two elements to it. First of all, Arizona wanted to streamline consideration of M'Naghten and focus on the heart of M'Naghten, which is the right/wrong test. But, equally important, as far back as 1965, in the Schantz case, where they first came up with the rule applied in Mott, they also wanted to not have a diminished-capacity defense in the State of Arizona.",
  "I don't think the State -- could the State do that? Is that the question?",
  "I don't think the State --",
  "Right. I don't think they could do that. And I don't think that's what happened here. And I think if you look at the evidence in this case -- I mean, it came in, in sort of a strange way, in part, I think, because it was a bench trial, but I think what the trial court did is say that, \"All of the evidence on insanity, all of the evidence in the second phase of the case, is relevant. It's all coming in. I'm going to take it into consideration, but I'm going to take it into consideration only on the insanity defense, not as part of the mens rea defense.\" And I think that was consistent with Arizona law. What I think would be a harder question -- and let me just say, I think the way that this was postured for the trial court was that the Petitioner argued that all of that evidence comes in for consideration of the mens rea.",
  "Well, I don't think so, Justice Kennedy, but you're absolutely right to say that there's this tradition with insanity, which is quite different than the tradition with respect to other elements of a crime. And I think that goes back to the common law, and goes back to Blackstone. And if you look at Blackstone, and you look at some of the common law cases that this Court cited in its Davis opinion, they describe murder as having several elements. One of them is obviously killing a person, and one is malice aforethought. And then, some of the cases treat a sound mind as a separate element. But, I think, if you look at the history, it's clear it wasn't a true element, because the common law put the -- it started with a presumption of sanity, which you couldn't have with respect to any other element, and said it was perfectly appropriate to put the burden on the defendant. And I think what the common law recognizes is the question of criminal responsibility or insanity, although it has some logical relationship to mens rea, can be separated out and can be dealt with in an affirmative defense. And I think if you don't recognize the State's ability to do that, you end up allowing a defendant to basically sneak in, through, as Justice Souter put it, the front door, all sorts of watered-down insanity defenses in the guise of arguments trying to negate mens rea.",
  "Well, it -- I think, Justice Kennedy, though --",
  "Well --",
  "-- I don't think it's second class. I think what Arizona recognized, in the Schantz case and in Mott, in making this rule in the context of rejecting the diminished-capacity defense, is that if you allow a defendant to argue, \"My evidence shows that I lack the capacity to form the requisite mental state; and, therefore, that comes in on the mens rea case,\" you can make that argument in terms of any insanity defense you like. I can argue that, \"I lack the capacity to form the requisite intent, because I responded to an irresistible impulse.\" Well, a State that's decided to have the M'Naghten insanity defense, rather than the irresistible-impulse defense, has to be able to make the judgment, I submit, that, \"We're going to have the M'Naghten defense, and we're going to keep it as an affirmative defense, and we're not going to allow that defense, that we've rejected, to effectively come in through the front door.\" And, to use Justice Souter's --",
  "But, Justice Breyer, they wouldn't convict him for murder, because he would qualify for an insanity defense. And somebody as insane as you're --",
  "Well, I mean --",
  "But --",
  "I don't think it's in this case, but I don't want to mislead you, which is as -- I think you can hypothesize a situation where somebody would be exonerated by one form of the insanity defense, and not exonerated by a narrow form of the insanity defense. And I don't think it follows that somebody that's in that margin has a constitutional right to make up the difference, effectively, through a mens rea argument. And, otherwise, I think you -- I mean, you --",
  "Well, I think you --",
  "I would think that you might. I mean, I think you could say -- because I think what happened here is, all of this evidence came in on the back door through the insanity defense.",
  "But then he --",
  "I don't think you have to reach that question here. But you do have to reach a related question, I think, which is, I think the trial court here very clearly, in applying Mott, prevented the Petitioner from making a diminished-capacity argument. And then --",
  "It's an argument that is basically a variation on the insanity defense. It's partial responsibility. It was basically the governing law in California until it was --",
  "I think you can draw that --",
  "-- distinction, but I do want to make clear that there are arguments here that you could make in a different State that you can't make in Arizona because of the substantive decision that, \"We don't want to have a diminished-capacity defense, and we don't want to have that policy judgment frustrated by having the evidence come in through the front door.\" And to use Justice --",
  "-- Souter's example --",
  "I think he could, Justice Stevens. As I understand --",
  "-- the hypothetical, we're --",
  "-- basically --",
  "Well, I think it would -- it might depend on exactly what the statutory definition of \"murder\" in the State was.",
  "Maybe not, Justice Stevens. It just depends on the way that the statute deals with it. Because, in my view of the statute, if somebody really thought -- if they had to kill a human being, and they thought, \"I wasn't doing it. I was killing an alien,\" maybe that could come in, on mens rea, but if --",
  "No, Justice Scalia, you have not held --",
  "-- that. And I think -- but, equally, I don't think a State would -- is required to have a diminished-capacity defense. And --",
  "I don't think so. I mean, I think it's very difficult to find, in the Due Process Clause, the tools necessary to superintend those kind --",
  "-- of decisions.",
  "Well --",
  "With respect, Justice Ginsburg, I think that starts to confuse the hypotheticals with the real case, because I don't think Petitioner's argument was that they had no idea that this person was a police officer, and he thought he was killing an alien. I think their argument was much more one for insanity, and that maybe there were other explanations for the conduct. But the psychological testimony here suggests that maybe he sometimes thought that his mother was also an alien, but he kind of knew it was his mother, as well. And so, I don't really think that maps up with the argument they've made. The one point I want to leave you with, though, is, as Justice Souter said, everybody agrees that there's no due-process requirement that Arizona have a diminished-capacity defense. Well, it doesn't make any sense to say that they have to have that implicitly with the burden on the State at the same time. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: This case presents the same basic constitutional question concerning the Federal Partial-Birth Abortion Act as the first case. Of course, the Ninth Circuit in the decision under review here went much further in invalidating the Federal act. If I could begin by talking about whether what we're talking about here is medical necessity or just some marginal effect on the risks. I think in order to fairly understand the argument that respondents are making in this case, their argument has to be a matter of simply marginal risks, because one illustration of this, as I indicated in the first argument, if a doctor really believes that a D&X procedure is the way to go in a case then there's no ban on the procedure as such. What the act bans is the infliction of the D&X procedure on a living fetus. So if a doctor really thinks the D&X procedure is the way to go, he can induce fetal demise at the outset of the procedure.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, let me take as a point of departure the specific risks that you associated with the injection that induces fetal demise, because if there isn't a significant risk to that injection, then all the other benefits that are associated with the D&X procedure don't matter because they can perform the D&X procedure. Now if you look through the record on this point, I think you will not find any testimony that supports a significant risk from that injection. Yes, there are risks because there are risks from any medical procedure, but the risks are not significant.",
  "With all respect, I think if a single injection that doesn't take any particular risk other than the fact that it's an injection, if that counts as a significant risk, then we might as well strike the word \"significant\" from the discussion in Stenberg. And Then I think what you have is that it's very clear that their position is one of zero tolerance for any marginal risk to maternal health.",
  "Well, it's a very difficult question to evaluate in the abstract, Justice Kennedy. And I think it actually, that question, though, has direct bearing on this case, because Congress after all found that there was some risks with the D&X procedure. The most prominent one that I would point to is the risk of cervical incompetence because the D&X procedure does -- it does require additional dilation, which can be associated with risks of losing future pregnancies. And that was born out, although not at a level of statistical significance, in the Chasen study by a plaintiff practitioner, where 2 of the 17 women who had the D&X procedure and were available for follow-up care had an early pre-term pregnancy in the follow-up. So I think those risks are born out in the only study that's available. And I think the question becomes, now, if D&X were some life-saving procedure for something that there was no other known cure for, you might think, well, those are the risks you run. But when there remains available the D&E procedure, which has been well tested and works every single time as a way to terminate the pregnancy, then I think risks that, if you were talking about a life-saving treatment for some life-threatening condition with no known cure, those risks might not be significant in that context.",
  "There is a risk, Justice Kennedy, but I think that, first of all, that even in those limited circumstances, that the marginal risk between the D&X procedure and the D&E procedure are really as far as I can tell nonexistent. Even in that condition, unless there's some reason not to put the injection in, if the doctor really thought the D&X procedure was the way to go, he could begin, as Dr. Carhart does in every single case after the 17th week and start off with a digoxin injection or potassium chloride injection, induce fetal demise, and he has nothing to worry about from this statute. And I think the very fact that they are attributing significant risks to a single injection shows that at bottom their position is a zero tolerance position. And that's a legitimate position, I suppose, but it's completely inconsistent with this Court's precedence, most notably the Casey decision. Because if all you needed to do is point to some marginal risk, then this Court should have struck down the 24-hour waiting period in the Casey decision, because the plaintiffs there said the 24-hour waiting condition has imposed significant risks. They were backed in that point by an amicus brief by ACOG. But this Court didn't say, well, you know, you're right, there's marginal risks, we're going to apply a zero tolerance rule. This Court instead upheld the 24-hour period, even though it required overruling Akron I's contrary decision and this Court pointed, of course, to Akron I as an exemplar of the pre-Casey decisions that put too little weight on the legitimate countervailing interest that the government has in this area. And so with respect, I think that the argument they are making is effectively an argument for returning to Akron I and Thornburgh, where the rule of law was that there would be no interference between a doctor and the doctor's patient and the doctor's best judgment as to how to treat the patient. This Court of course consciously moved away from that in Casey and expressly repudiated the language in Akron I and Thornburgh to that effect.",
  "Well, justice Stevens, let me answer it this way and maybe if you want me to take you specifically to the text, I can do that. But I think the bottom line would be that under our view of the statute, the most important thing is for those doctors, like Dr. Cranen or Dr. Vivicar, who try to do the D&E procedure every time, and they succeed 99 or 100 percent of the time. Well, in the 1 percent of the cases where they inadvertently deliver the fetus past the anatomical landmark, we would say they are not covered by the statute because they would not satisfy what is really a compound mens rea requirement in the statute, which requires that the delivery of the fetus be intentional and deliberate and for the purpose of committing the overt act of killing fetus. And in those cases, of course, the intent of the doctor performing the D&E isn't to deliver the fetus at all; it's to deliver a fetal arm or a fetal leg as part of the dismemberment procedure. So they would not be covered by the mens rea requirement of the statute.",
  "I think you could measure it from either time point. I think the better view is actually that it would be measured from the beginning of the surgical operation, though the evidence of their intent at the beginning of the dilation would be very, very relevant. The reason I would say that is I think if somebody tries to dilate and then gets an extreme amount of dilation at the point they start the procedure, I think the intent of Congress would still be for them to do a dismemberment procedure at that point, rather than an intact removal. But if this Court thought that the constitutional line mattered on the answer to that, then you could start from the beginning of the dilation because I think in fairness the differences between the two procedures are probably most manifest in the dilation regimen. I also think, though, the record supports the notion that there are differences even once you begin the procedure as to how you manipulate the fetus. I mean, Dr. Chasen for example, who is trying to do the intact removal, says that after he has one leg removed he effectively tries to reach back up and swing the second leg across so he can remove the entire fetal body. If you're -- obviously if you're performing a dismemberment D&E you're not trying to swing the second leg across; you're simply continuing to pull or twist on the first extremity that prevents itself. So I think there are differences even at the procedural level. So I think that it would probably be most consistent with Congress's intent to measure it from the beginning of the surgical part of the procedure. But if you, as I say, in order to save the statute, I think it's amenable to the contrary interpretatio.",
  "Oh, but can I respond to that specifically?",
  "Can I respond to that specifically?",
  "Justice Breyer, if I could respond to that.",
  "I mean, there are certain situations where the injection is contraindicated. I think they'd be relatively rare situations. And I think, you know, you could imagine I suppose that the statute might pose a problem if you could identify particular conditions where a D&X was particularly useful, and those were also situations where an injection would be contraindicated. I think, you know, the universe of that may be zero, it may be one in a million; I don't know, but it's very small. Another point that's made in the record which I think is important is they suggest well, you know, maybe, maybe if you can't do the injection into the heart of the fetus, then you're only going to be successful something like 92 percent of the times. I think though for purposes of the mens rea requirement would certainly take care of any concern that the physician would have - -",
  "Justice Breyer, I wish we were talking about just a few rare cases because I think if we were, there would be, the statute would be amenable to not being applied in those rare cases. But this is one thing that I think my colleagues on the other side of the podium will agree with me on, is that their doctors don't think that this is a safer procedure in rare cases. They think it's a safer procedure every single time. And that's why doctors like Dr. Chasen and Dr. Frederickson try to do the D&X procedure every single time, and they don't do it because they are indifferent to health, I suppose. In their best judgment they think that's the better way to go. And it's just a question ultimately of whether you're going to defer to individual doctors' judgments, even when it's very much of a minority judgment; I mean anything you want to say about this procedure it is the heterodox procedure, not the orthodoxy. Most ob-gyns are going to do the D&E procedure, not the D&X procedure. Even in the Nebraska case three of the four plaintiffs don't try to do the intact removal, so I think that just gives you, just a, know you, anecdotal observation that you are talking about the rare procedure, the heterodox procedure. And so the question is when you have a perfectly safe alternative, and you have some doctors who like to do is it a different way, can Congress countermand the doctors' judgment or do the doctors get the final word?",
  "I don't think so. I mean that might be a situation -- I don't know that that's a realistic hypothetical, I mean, let me just say that. If that turned out to be a realistic hypothetical, that might be an example of where this question I talked about with Justice Stevens might matter. Which is in that case it might matter whether or not the intent was measured - -",
  "With respect, Justice Kennedy, I don't think that's born out in this record, it's the other way, which is doctors who want to perform a D&X, often, in a majority of the cases end up performing a D&E. But the doctors that set out to perform a D&E, in Dr. Vibhakar's case she says a hundred percent of the time, she ends up with dismemberment. Dr. Creinen says it's 99% of the time that he ends up with dismemberment.",
  "Yes. And you can, you can, you can tell you can tell from the fact that a doctor, like one of the plaintiffs in the Nebraska case, Dr. Fitzhugh, says, that, well, I don't do the intact removal because if I wanted to do that I would have to do a second round of dilation with a second round of laminarias. And of course, that second round of laminaria is also a medical procedure. Like the injection, every medical procedure has some risks, risks of infection. If you looked at Dr. Creinen's testimony, this is at 174 A to 177 A in the Eighth Circuit petition appendix, he says that he doesn't like to do a second round of laminaria dilation because it's painful to the patient. And that's his testimony. So there are countervailing indications here. And as I say, this idea of trying to prohibit a practice that involves further dilation is not an irrelevant concern from a health standpoint, because one of the things that Congress heard was that there were risks to future pregnancies from cervical incompetence. And that's a particularly important concern because first of all, the plaintiff's experts aren't in a very good position to evaluate that risk because they provide abortion services, not follow-up services. So they're not in a good position to judge that risk. Second of all, the only study we have here points out that there is a greater incidence of that preterm delivery in the group that had a D&X procedure. Now again they say, they are going to come up and say well it's not statistically significant. But the numbers I think are striking. They had 17 women in the group that had a D&X and came back. Two of them had a preterm pregnancy. The D&E group was much larger, 45, and two of them had a preterm delivery. Now I think as a commonsense manner, if you know that you were going to be in a room with 17 people where two people were going to have something bad happen to them, or in a room with 45 and two -- bad things were going to happen to two, I know which room I'd like to be in. And all I'm pointing out - -",
  "That's right.",
  "Well if I could just - -",
  "I think it's even more complicated than that, Justice Breyer, because in fact, you're right that the D&X patients were at a further gestational age, but the D&E patients were actually older. And so I think - -",
  "Right. But it happens that, the D&E patients were on average two years older, which I think also would be associated with greater risk. So I think it's a wash. But I still think the Chasen study net is quite helpful to our side. For one thing, this is a study put together by one of the plaintiff practitioners, a plaintiff in the Southern District case, based on a study of his own practice. And of course one of the intuitions about the D&X procedure is because you remove it intact it's going to be a faster procedure and there is going to be less blood loss.",
  "Well, what did he find when he studied that? It was exactly the same for those two procedures. I'm sorry.",
  "Well, I mean I don't think it should figure in this Court's decision. I mean principally because the other side in neither case makes a challenge based on the Commerce Clause, and I suppose there is two reasons for that. That legal reason that they don't bring the challenge is because there is a jurisdictional element that I think would address the challenges as a doctrinal matter. The practical reason I think is because this isn't the only instance in which the Federal Government has gotten involved to address issues related to the abortion context.",
  "Well but also access to clinics, in the the face act, which is also - -",
  "Well -- it's certainly true that abortion has been dealt with at a Federal level one way or another since 1973. So I think that's also part of the backdrop, but I also think, I mean, you know, the Federal Government gets involved in this issue, you know, depending on your perspective, for good or for harm. It's there to protect access to the abortion clinics - -",
  "Justice Stevens, I don't think we have taken, the Federal Government hasn't taken a definitive position on that. I think it could be interpreted either way. I think my understanding is the face context, a free clinic would be covered. There's not a jurisdictional element in the face statute. So there may be differences as, in application.",
  "Well, I think by, I mean, you know, the Court's precedents in other areas has suggested it's just not a matter of whether the ultimate service is provided in commerce but in order to get the services they have to take - -",
  "Yes. Exactly. I don't, I mean, that hasn't been briefed up in this case. If it had been we'd probably have a definitive position one way or another. But I don't think the constitutionality in this facial challenge where that hasn't been a feature of the challenge turns on the answer to that question one way or another. I think in regards to the Chasen study the last thing I would say about it though is that it's important because most of the arguments on the other side are intuitive arguments. They are intuitive arguments, that they would be less passive, so that will be more safe. And what I think is telling is that the same intuition would lead to the notion that it would be quicker and there will be less blood loss. And when that was actually tested in a controlled study, it turned out not to be the case. The last thing I'll say about the Chasen study is there was this indication that the two most serious complications were associated with the D&E procedure. But one thing that I think is important to understand about the Chasen study is it is a retrospective study of Dr. Chasen and his partner's own practice. Now what they do in every case is they set out to perform a D&X procedure, and so what they are studying and what they call the D&X procedures, that cohort are the times when they tried to do a D&X procedure and they were successful. The D&X cohort from this study, is you know, are those circumstances where he and his partner tried to do a D&X procedure, weren't successful and did a D&E procedure. Now why is that significant? Because it shows as Chasen noted in his article that in those situations that were D&Es and they were associated with serious complications there was nothing he could have done about it. He could have performed a D&X, he tried to perform a D&X and it wasn't successful, so he ended up performing a D&E. And so I really think on balance the Chasen study ends up supporting our position, because the first time you have any kind of controlled study what you find is that some of the intuition turns out not to be true, and the safety benefits from these are a wash, and the one sort of loose end from the study is the threat that you do see from the greater dilation. Now it's not statistically robust, but I think that it does bear out one of Congress's concerns.",
  "Right, I -- I - -",
  "Sure. And as I tried to indicate in rebuttal, that's really not a concern because, the difference is whether some clinics will only offer the D&X and the D&E and will say that basically you've got to go to a hospital to get the induction procedure. But that doesn't really, I don't think matter, because the point is anybody could can got a D&X who is at a clinic can also get a D&E. In every single case the doctor that can perform the D&X can also offer the D&E. And since the D&E is what the district court in the Nebraska case described as the gold standard of Casey, I think every woman in every case is going to have that option of a safe, of a safe pregnancy option. And again one way to illustrate that is Chasen.",
  "Well, but, Justice Kennedy, I think we have our answer to that, which is the best reading of the statute requires the intent at the outset of the procedure, and therefore nobody -- in the 99 percent of the cases that Dr. Crainer sets out to performs a D&E and succeeds, there's no issue in the world because everybody would look at that and say that's a D&E. In the one case - -",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, it's because of the addition of the anatomical landmark language to the Federal statute.",
  "Well, only with the caveat, though, is that I think this Court really didn't have to confront the second concern because it had the first concern. And if you thought that a leg, which this Court did, was a substantial portion, and that was the, that was the act that induced fetal demise, either way it was covered no matter what your purpose was, because the doctor's purpose in removing the leg was to induce fetal demise. Here the compound mens rea requirement works with the anatomical landmark language, so that what you need to satisfy the statute is the deliberate and purposeful intent to remove the fetus past the navel with the purpose of performing an overt act that will, will lead to fetal demise, which is not covered when you don't even have the intent to take it out of the -- past the anatomical landmark in the first place and you're trying to do something that's going to take place in utero. If I could reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A few final points. First of all, I don't think the constitutionality of Congress's act depends on whether the anatomical landmark is the navel or up to the head. Congress, as everyone recognizes, had to draw a line. I think drawing the line at more than halfway out is a pretty good place to draw the line. Second, my learned co-counsel is certainly correct. This is a pre-enforcement challenge, in response to your question, Justice Kennedy. But the point is, this is a pre-enforcement spatial challenge, and if the Court rejects it and allows this statute to go into operation, it will not foreclose the possibility of a future pre-enforcement as applied challenge that focuses on particular medical conditions. That's not something, though, that one can reach in this record, because as the district court in this case found at 147a, there is no specific condition here in which the D&X procedure is particularly ready met for or otherwise is medically necessary. Rather, the claims in this case are that it's always better. That's what some doctors say. It's a heterodox position, it's not the majority position, but it's not focussed on specific situations. The other thing it's not focused on, and this is in reference to something that Justice Breyer mentioned, it's not focused on emergencies. Another thing that the district court noted at page 128a of its opinion is that the D&E procedure and the D&X procedure, neither of them are particularly good in dealing with true medical emergencies where time is of the essence, because both these procedures require substantial advance time to do the dilation. And since the D&X procedure requires more dilation, I actually think in an emergency, you'd probably end up performing the D&E procedure if you performed either one, because you'd need less time for the dilation in an emergency. The other thing I should point out is that, of course, there is this question about what's a significant risk. And one thing about the lethal injection at the beginning of the process, the Digoxin injection, is the other side concedes that the mother gets to make the choice as to whether or not to do that procedure. Well, Dr. Carhart does it as a matter of course after 17 weeks, and I certainly don't think anyone would suggest that Dr. Carhart is needlessly inflicting significant risks on his patients after 17 weeks by following that regimen in every case after 17 weeks. And I think it's worth noting that the legal regime that respondents would construct is a legal regime where the woman can decide whether or not to have that shot, Dr. Carhart can decide it for her and that's okay, but Congress can't make this judgment. But it's important to draw a line here, and say that fetal demise that takes place in utero is one thing. That is abortion as it has always been understood. But this procedure, the banned procedure is something different. This is not about fetal demise in utero. This is something that is far too close to infanticide for society to tolerate. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress held six hearings over four different Congresses and heard from dozens of witnesses in determining that partial-birth abortions are never medically necessary, pose health risks, and should be banned. Under familiar principles of deference to congressional factfinding, those determinations should be upheld as long as they represent reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence in the congressional record. That standard is amply satisfied here. The evidence before Congress was clear that partial-birth abortions were never medically necessary, and that safe alternatives were always available such that no woman would be prevented from terminating her pregnancy. As a result, Congress was entitled to make a judgment in furthering its legitimate interests that they were going to ban a particularly gruesome procedure that blurred the line between abortion and infanticide.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that this Court's precedence, in particular the Danforth case, would stand as an obstacle to that piece of legislation, because in Danforth, this Court struck down an effort to ban what was then the majority method of inducing a second-term abortion. And I think in the same way, there is quite a different situation when Congress comes in and tries to deal with the primary abortion method in the second trimester. Here, though, Congress didn't go after the dog, so to speak, it went after the tail. This very aberrant procedure, atypical procedure. And the numbers are hard to come by, but I don't think anybody suggests that the D&X procedure is anything more than a very small minority of second trimester abortions. And so I do think - -",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me make a couple of points in response to that. I think -- taken at the broader level first, I think there is one very important difference between these two procedures that led Congress to ban one and allow the other to stand. And that is whether fetal demise takes place in utero, which is, of course, the hallmark of all abortions, or whether fetal demise, the lethal act takes place when the fetus is more than halfway out of the mother. Now, as to their suggestion, I think most particularly by Respondents in the second case, that there really is no meaningful difference between those two procedures. And with respect, I just don't think the record supports that. If you look at the record in this case, it's very clear in the district court opinion that you have some doctors, and examples would be Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Creinin, or one of the Nebraska Plaintiffs, Dr. Vibhakar. They go in, in each and every case, and try to perform a dismemberment, or D&E, procedure. And because they're trying to perform the D&E procedure, they need to dilate the cervix only modestly. And so Dr. Creinin, for example, his testimony is he only dilates the cervix two centimeters or two and a half centimeters. Now, in contrast, you have other doctors, and here the examples I would point to are two of the Plaintiff's experts, Dr. Chasen and Dr. Frederickson, they, in every single case, set out to perform the D&X procedure. And that has material differences. For example, the dilation regimen that they use. And so Dr. Frederickson, for example, uses multiple sets of laminaria to dilate the cervix, and she gets a much greater degree of dilation, 5 to 6 centimeters of dilation. And of course, not only do they set out to perform different procedures, but they, in fact, perform different procedures. So the evidence here again reflects that Dr. Vibhakar, for example, in 100 percent of the cases, ends up performing a dismemberment procedure, or a D&E procedure. For Dr. Creinin, it's 99 percent. Now, by contrast, Dr. Chasen and Dr. Frederickson, when they set out to perform a D&X procedure, they are successful in their objective less often. There are different numbers for different doctors, but it seems that, at most, they can achieve their objective about a third of the time.",
  "They did, Justice Kennedy, and in particular, Dr. Creinin is an expert. I think his deposition was taken, or his testimony was taken principally in the California case, but it was introduced in all three cases as part of the evidentiary record. Dr. Vibhakar is one of the Plaintiffs in this particular case. And Dr. Chasen and Dr. Frederickson would also -- their testimony was in the record, I think, in all three cases.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I think you certainly owe deference to both. I think - -",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, obviously I'm at a certain deficit to you in discussing what this Court held in the Stenberg opinion, which you wrote. But my reading of that opinion is that this Court did not focus on what was before the Nebraska legislature. But this Court focused on what the district court found. And in particular, in the critical part of the opinion, which would be Section 2(A) of the opinion, as I read the opinion, what this Court did is it confronted Nebraska's argument that the D&X procedure was not, in fact, safer. And the first thing this Court did is said, well, that argument faces quite a burden, because the district court made a contrary finding. And then this Court in 2(A)(1) of the opinion referenced that finding, and four different times cited the district court record, and then so on and so forth. It then noted the various eight arguments were made by the State in its amici to the contrary. And as I read the opinion, it basically said the latter, the objections don't outweigh the former, the findings. Now, I think if you compare the record before the courts and before Congress, compare that to what was before the district court in Stenberg, I think there is a much more robust factual record here. If you look at the Stenberg case - -",
  "Well, I mean, specifically what Congress found in that finding was that none of them provided it as part of a curriculum. And I think what the record here clearly reflects -- you know, I don't know that the idea of a curriculum -- I don't know exactly what Congress had in mind. But clearly, is a matter of sort of what you teach residents - -",
  "I don't know if it's correct, based on the curriculum.",
  "I think if the evidence in the district court were overwhelmingly to the contrary, I think that the district court could effectively undermine that one finding. I don't think in this case anything turned - -",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, I would answer you this way. You might first want to isolate those situations where, if the district court was addressing something, an issue that just wasn't before Congress at all, but it's somehow relevant, and makes factual findings, I suppose the district court is entitled to the normal kind of deference on review. But I think if you have situations, which you have in this case, where the district court heard some of the same witnesses who testified before Congress and before the district court, and the district court makes a different credibility finding than the Congress made, I don't think that's a basis for the district court to be able to overcome the contrary findings of Congress.",
  "Sure, Justice Stevens, I think I need to clarify an important point there, which is to say, the statute didn't focus on viable versus nonviable, because it applies to both sides of the viability line.",
  "I don't think there is, Justice Stevens, but I wouldn't find that at all remarkable in a statute that applies and bans certain procedures without regard to whether the procedure is applied to a viable or nonviable fetus and when Congress does make specific findings that the procedure it's banning would have the effect of preventing a lethal act on a fetus just inches from being born. It's not - -",
  "Sure.",
  "The issue is whether - -",
  "Yes. Because the issue is to whether it's going to be performed in utero, or when the child is more than halfway outside the womb, and that of course - -",
  "Justice Stevens, again, you're right.",
  "I think you could use either terminology, Justice Scalia. My point is, nothing turns on the terminology. I mean, the terminology that Congress chose to use is a living fetus. I think the point, though, is that when fetal demise is induced in utero, whatever else you think about that procedure that is classically an abortion, as it has been always understood. But when fetal demise is induced when the, when the living fetus is over halfway outside of the womb, then I think Congress - -",
  "Well it may be seconds, it may be hours; it depends on -- because even a pre - -",
  "If we are talking about previability then by definition chances are it won't survive.",
  "But again, I don't think that, you know, that anything in this act - -",
  "Well, I'm not sure if it's whether, that's a fair, that's a fair summary. I mean, you know, the line isn't that fetal demise has to be done before any delivery begins, but the basic point of this statute is to draw a bright line between a procedure that induces fetal demise in utero and one where the lethal act occurs when the child or the fetus, whichever you want to call it, is more than halfway outside of the mother's womb.",
  "Well, in the postviability context it would clearly be, it would clearly be infanticide. I think in the previability context, if you have a complete delivery but the child isn't going to survive, I don't think it would be infanticide to necessarily let the child expire - -",
  "But I do think by contrast if somebody tried to, with the fetus, you know, perfectly alive and in the hours that it might have to live, if somebody came in and ripped its head open, I think we'd call that murder, and in fact Congress passed another statute - -",
  "Justice Ginsberg, that's right, but I don't think that's to trivialize Congress's interest in maintaining a bright line between abortion and infanticide. And the way I would illustrate it is that line, even if you might think it has a temporal line, in the sense that viability versus previability is relevant, it clearly has a spatial dimension as well and the best illustration of that I think is think about a lawful postviability abortion. There is a problem with the mother's health, there is a problem with her life so it's a lawful postviability abortion. I don't think anybody thinks that the law is or should be indifferent to whether in that case fetal demise takes place in utero or outside the mother's womb. The one is abortion, the other is murder. And I think that just recognizes that even in the postviability context you have a very important line which is a spatial line, and that line is basically in womb, outside of womb, and what Congress tried to do in this statute is to draw that line and differentiate between one procedure where fetal demise takes place in utero - -",
  "I think that's probably right, Justice Ginsburg, but I think the point I would make is that Congress has an interest in maintaining the spatial line between infanticide and abortion, even with respect to previability fetuses and that's true for at least two reasons.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, with the caveat that the statute does apply both - -",
  "Right.",
  "Oh, I think that's right, Justice Breyer. I think this, Congress - -",
  "-- took this Court's Stenberg's decision as a given - -",
  "With respect, Justice Breyer, here is the problem with that way of approaching the statute. That might be a permissible way of approaching it if what the evidence on the other side was, that well you know there are cause-specific reasons why you need this procedure. There are particular conditions where you need this procedure. But that's not the evidence on the other side. What their doctors say, the doctors who perform this D&X procedure, the Dr. Chasens, the Dr. Fredericksons, what they will tell you is that every single case the D&X procedure is better and safer and they want to do it. And so it doesn't make, I mean Congress can't pass a statute that bans procedure A, and that ban doesn't apply any time a doctor prefers procedure A.",
  "Well, they do have a different view of the facts. And I guess the question - -",
  "Well, I think - -",
  "If this Court rejects the facial challenge to this statute it is still going to be open for litigants in the future to try to identify specific conditions where this procedure is the safer alternative.",
  "Justice Kennedy, what I think I have in mind principally would be a preenforcement challenge that was an as applied challenge. And what I have in mind, you know that's something that there is in other areas of the law, Steffl against Thompson is an example. But what you would have in mind is a doctor who had standing under this Court's abortion jurisprudence would come in and say, look, in my practice I've seen that this procedure would be particularly useful in dealing with preeclampsia or placental previa or some condition.",
  "Well, there is an effort to make that showing. I don't think that it's been a successful effort to make that showing. In fact I think if you look at the findings of the district courts in these cases, two of the three district courts found that there was no particular condition where the D&X abortion was medically necessary or had marginal safe benefits - - safety benefits. In this case, the Nebraska case, the district court identified only two conditions, preeclampsia combined with maternal cancer, and placenta previa. And as to those particular findings as we point out in our reply brief, there are problems with each of those findings.",
  "Well, I don't think, I mean, they've challenged everything including every application of the statute and they've tried to pick off some particular conditions. What I'm imagining is in the future you might have, you might have additional evidence, you might have additional experience with doctors, and they might come in and target their challenge to particular conditions and try to say - -",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg my understanding is even when you talk about an idiosyncratic condition, I mean, the doctors who perform these abortions perform, you know, hundreds of them a year and they can identify those conditions and they have names for those conditions and I think it would be amenable to bringing a more as applied challenge.",
  "I certainly do, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think that this statute, unlike the Nebraska statute, clearly uses an anatomical landmark approach that is based in the text of the statute and clearly distinguishes between the D&E procedure on the one hand and the D&X on the other hand.",
  "Well, we would urge you to take any one of them.",
  "But in fairness, I mean, you know, we have an obligation to defend the statute. So our first, you know, our first effort would be to say we distinguish the - -",
  "I don't think so, Justice Souter. Let me just -- I'd like to save some time for rebuttal, but let me try to answer it this way, which is our way of looking at Stenberg is Stenberg really doesn't address what you do when there are congressional findings. And there is some tension between Stenberg and Turner on this, because Stenberg seems to suggest, well, when there is a doubt, the kind of doubt that would normally get you past a summary judgment, you defer to the doctors, and Turner seems to suggest when you have a doubt, conflicting evidence, the kind of doubt that might get you past summary judgment normally, you defer to Congress. And it has to be one or the other. It can't go both ways, can't go opposite ways, and we would say resolve that tension, but when there is congressional findings, something that you obviously didn't have to confront in Stenberg, defer to the congressional approach. If Stenberg means something contrary, that even in the face of congressional findings that you have to defer to a minority opinion of doctors and, you know, kind of invert what would normally be the way of approaching it, we think then that would be inconsistent with this Court's decision in Casey, among others, and you should revisit Stenberg to that effect, to that extent. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me make just a couple of points in rebuttal. I'd like to start with Justice Kennedy's question, about whether or not there are going to be alternative methods available to end the pregnancy as a practical matter. And the answer to that is there will always be an alternative available as a practical matter. The alternative will always be the D&E procedure, which the district court in this case called the gold standard. And the best evidence of that, Justice Kennedy, is that their own witnesses like Dr. Chasen, for example, when they set out to perform the D&X procedure, they are only successful about 33 percent of the time. What happens in the other 67 percent of the cases is they actually, even though they tried to perform a D&X, will perform a D&E. And so all of the clinics that provide D&X also necessarily provide D&E, because the D&E is what they end up with if they are not able to remove the fetus intact. So in every single case, there are some, you know, the induction procedure has to be done in a hospital, but the D&X and D&E procedures are both equally available in clinics, so no woman as either a theoretical matter or a practical matter, is going to be denied a safe alternative to end her pregnancy. I wanted to pick up on Justice Souter's question as well. You asked for factual citations in the record on this dispute between us. I think the record is really overwhelmingly in our favor. I point you to Dr. Fitzhugh, who's one of the plaintiffs on this side, 135a. He says he doesn't try for intact delivery in every case because it would necessitate a second round of dilation, a second round of laminarias, so he doesn't do the second round, he gets dismemberment. Dr. Knorr, another one of the plaintiffs, at page 142a, he says the procedure would require greater dilation. And if I could just finish on the citations, Dr. Vibhakar, who does dismemberment 100 percent of the time, 148a -- all of these are in the petition appendix of the district court opinion -- Dr. Cranen explains his procedure at 174a to 177a. Thank you",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondents assert an interest in addressing the most racially isolated schools in the district, yet their plan does not address the two most racially concentrated high schools in their district. They likewise have certain interests in diversity, yet their plan does not directly address diversity other than pure racial diversity, and they do nothing to assemble the kind of critical mass that was at issue in the Grutter case. In fact, if you look at the program and how it operates in practice, the triggering critical mass for the use of the racial tie breaker is when a student -- when a school has less than 25 percent white students or when it has less than 45 percent non-white students. There is nothing in the record or in social science that suggests that there's a radical difference in the critical mass based on the race of the students. Of course what explains that difference in the triggering critical mass of white students versus non-white students, the answer to that does not lie in educational theory, the answer lies in the demographics of the district. The district happens to have 25 percent more non-white students than white students, so they trigger the race tie breaker at a different point under those circumstances. With all respect to respondents, the answer to how this program works lies not in diversity but in demographics. They are clearly working backwards from the overall demographics of the school district rather than working forward to any clearly articulated pedagogical role.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that those decisions are different primarily because the resulting decision is not a racial classification. And if you think about it, when you had an overt racial classification, like you clearly do in these cases, then you naturally ask the strict scrutiny questions and look for a compelling interest. If instead you start with a race-neutral government action that doesn't classify people directly based on race, then I suppose you could try to do some kind of Arlington Heights-Washington Davis type analysis.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, I think - -",
  "Okay. And Justice Kennedy, I will answer the hypo, but let me say it's easy for purposes of the hypo to say the sole reason was for race. In the real world, in fact I can't imagine that a site decision won't be based at least in part on concerns about the overall educational benefits. And I think that's important. The reason I start with that preface is because when you have mixed motives and a variety of factors I think you'd be unlikely to strike down that kind of motive.",
  "No, Justice Stevens. I'm saying you start at a different departure point when you have an express racial classification. I think I'm trying to answer Justice Kennedy's question about what if you have a sort of a race-conscious goal at some level and that's why you select a particular site or you decide that you're going to invest in magnet schools and want to put a magnet school in a particular school district. My humble point is simply that in the real world I think you're unlikely to have the pure racial motive type objective. I would say that - -",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think if what they wanted to do is have an mix of teachers that might be okay. If they're going to start assigning teachers to particular schools and have sort of racial quotas for the faculty at various schools, I think that crosses a line.",
  "Well, with respect, Justice Ginsburg, I think there's a fundamental difference between how the same intent with two programs, there's a fundamental difference if one of them necessarily classifies people on the basis of their skin color and the other does not.",
  "Justice Scalia, we would take the position that there's not and that there's a fundamental difference between whether or not the policy manages to avoid classifying people on the basis of their race.",
  "I think that's ultimately the answer, Justice Kennedy, which is there's a fundamental difference between classifying people and having the real world effect. I mean, in this case don't forget that there were 89 minority students that wanted to attend Franklin High School. They could not solely because of their race. At the same time, every white student who applied to Franklin High School was allowed in solely base would on their race.",
  "We would say that's fine. We would say that that is permissible, for the school to pursue that. Just to get back, though, again, we say that that avoiding racial isolation is -- I just want to make the point, we say that racial isolation is an important government interest. I think if you put this plan up against that objective, it solely fails, because there are two high schools that I think you would look at as being racially isolated. They're Cleveland n Rainier Beach, and this plan does nothing to directly address those high schools.",
  "With respect, Justice Souter, first of all I think the kind of interests we're talking about, avoiding racial isolation and the like, do not lend themselves to absolutely targeted, it has to be 15 percent, it has to be 50, it has to be 25, it has to be 45. I would actually suggest that the danger is in the opposite direction.",
  "Well, I mean, in the second stage - -",
  "Well, I think in the second case you'll see that, you know, the same logic that leads to this leads itself to stricter bands. But let me say, I would have thought the analysis would run the exact opposite way, and I would think that if you got to the point, which the Ninth Circuit did on page 58-A of its opinion, where it says, you know, with this objective that we've allowed, the most narrowly tailored way to get there is to expressly use race. I would have thought that might have suggested there was something wrong with the compelling interest, if that's the way - -",
  "If I could answer the question, I think that the fact that you point to the specific language of Swann is helpful, because the Court there in dictum -- I think everybody would agrees that was dictum -- said that you could achieve a prescribed ratio. And that's exactly where the logic of the other side, of the Ninth Circuit, of Judge Boudin, with all respect, that's where it takes you. And I think anybody that relied on that language in the wake of cases like Crosson, in the wake of Freeman against Pitts, that said achieving a racial balance for its own sake is not constitutional, and Bakke and Grutter against Gratz, that all said that racial balancing is verboten, I think those school districts would have been misguided in relying on that language. Thank you.",
  "Well, they are affected by the plan in this in this way, that in the past the district had used mandatory measures, busing students across town, to try to integrate those schools. And the board decided after many years of effort that it would no longer do that, but it was also of the firm conviction that it would allow students who wanted the opportunity to opt out of those schools to do so. At the same time, it implemented magnet schools at Rainier Beach, there's a new building under construction at Cleveland. And so - -",
  "Well, Justice Souter, this Court over and over again has said once a remedial plan is accepted there should be race-neutral alternatives under the narrow and tailored requirement. What this school board did after I won - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner's son was denied the opportunity to transfer from Young Elementary School to Bloom Elementary School solely on the basis of his race.",
  "Justice Stevens - -",
  "I think I'd have to -- I mean, I think it would depend - -",
  "I think if you build into the hypo that the only purpose was race and then it was done in a way that made it express that the teachers were going to be moved, that you were basically going to have five and five, you were going to have a quota at the two schools on the basis of race, I would say that that would be unconstitutional. I would think, though, that there are many ways you can accomplish similar objectives without making it so explicit. And I do think that in this context, I mean, there is an independent constitutional value in not having these kind of express racial classifications drawn.",
  "Oh, but I think that's the point, which is that is an important objective, but I have little doubt that that can be accomplished without the kind of five by five quotas.",
  "Justice Breyer, if I could be clear, though, what I was saying in response to Justice Stevens' question was really focused not on the broader problem, but specifically with respect to faculties. And I think that one is a little easier in the sense that I don't know of any school districts that have tried to maintain the kind of express quotas in teaching that he was indicating. I'm not here to tell you that this problem is simple to solve. I'm here to tell you, though, that I think the Constitution provides an answer.",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, let me tell you what I certainly think they could do, which is to say, look, you know, we don't have any balance in these two faculties. What we're going to do is we're going to mix some of them up, we're going to do it in a way that looks at a variety of factors, including who is good with young kids, who is good with older kids.",
  "And I think if what they end up doing at the end is not only a hundred percent motive, but a racial classification, then I think runs afoul of the Constitution.",
  "Just to be clear, our answer to the hypothetical a hundred percent motivation, no racial classification, is that it is still okay. Now, some members of the Court may disagree with us on that. But what I would say is it probably doesn't have that great an import in practice, because although it is easy to come up with the hypothetical that race is the absolute and sole motivating factor, I think in this context in particular, I mean, nobody -- you know, nobody is trying to do this solely for a race-based motive. In this context, they also have an educational goal.",
  "He would clearly have been assigned to one school, and one set of schools on the basis of his race.",
  "No, I guess I don't. And maybe I'm missing something. But I think that -- you know, the dual school system predated the court ordered decree, which is part of where we have gotten to with resides schools and the like. If I can come back to the facts of this case, I think it's important to recognize that he was denied transfer to Bloom, even though there were empty seats available at Bloom school. So if he had been an African-American, he would have been allowed to transfer to Bloom. Instead, he was prevented. And there was an empty seat sitting there in that school. And that's why I think this case does prevent a very stark racial quota.",
  "Well, Justice Souter, there are several responses. One is that the Constitution puts a particular premium on avoiding express racial classifications.",
  "Well, Justice Souter, you may have developed that jurisprudence in cases where it was clear there was stigma going on, but you have extended it in Croson and in Adarand across the board. And I have to say - -",
  "I think - -",
  "Well, I think choices were being denied. And I think you made the distinction earlier between an educational -- guarantee of some educational opportunity and a choice. But - -",
  "That may be, Justice Souter. But what I guess I would say is the logic of your argument would certainly require reconsideration of the Gratz case. And this Court in that context thought that individualized consideration even if it was going to be very difficult in the context of the University of Michigan's 25,000 admissions to the undergraduate program, this Court said individualized consideration was part of the constitutional guarantee.",
  "Because I think, Justice Souter, if you think it is an important value to have a degree of integration in the schools, well, I think you can take race neutral means that will get you a degree of integration in the schools. What I think is troubling, and what happens in cases like this - -",
  "That's right.",
  "But if you decide that candor is an affirmative good in the use -- in the race area, I think what you get is necessarily what you have here, which is strict racial bands. 50, 15 percent. That's not a degree of integration. It is a clear effort to try to get the individual schools to mimic the overall demographics - -",
  "Well, I understand that, Justice Breyer. But I think the answer to that is that the lesson of history in this area is that racial classifications are not ones where we should just let local school board officials do what they think is right.",
  "I think everybody concedes that strict scrutiny is going to apply here.",
  "No, we would -- you know, I think we would have to look at the details of the plan. That's what narrow tailoring meant. And I think that's what -- you know, Justice Kennedy made the point in his opinion in Grutter that the problem with approving the first blunderbuss opportunity that you see to use race in a context is that then you deprive the courts of any role trying to refine matters, and seeing, maybe the racial situation would be narrowly tailored, but it is sure not these 50-15 bands.",
  "And Justice Stevens, he probably could have cited two of your opinions for that proposition. But you know, the rest of us do have to work with - -",
  "There's no doubt about that, but the rest of us do have to work with this Court's precedents - -",
  "Absolutely. And it also has some real world consequences when we decides we're not going to apply the normal scrutiny we would to racial classifications just because we've made some -- I don't know based on what judgment that in this case, it is benign, so we can trust the local school officials.",
  "There's a lot of experience in Brown, too, and those were local school boards, too. And I think the lesson is - -",
  "I missed that in the joint stipulation, Justice Scalia. I would like to say one - - if I could make one point here, which is, I really do think that it's worth looking at how this operates in practice. And the fact that it leaves seats effectively fallow in schools. Because that really marks it as a quota. And it's interesting, when that same district court judge - -",
  "It was, Justice Ginsburg. But I think there's a difference when you move past unitary status. It's interesting. In the very case where the court, Hampton II, where the same district court found unitary status, he then because the Equal Protection Clause was not shielded by the decree, had to apply it to the use of these same racial bands in the context of magnet schools. And what did this same district court judge find there? He found they operated, quote, as a hard racial quota. Because the effect of these 50-15 bands was to keep hundreds of seats at Central High School, a popular magnet school empty, and away from African-American students because the district wanted to maintain its predetermined racial balance.",
  "You mean the United States government?",
  "Or the school board? They actually both opposed, which is something -- shows you something of the anomalies that you can get from this situation, which is the school board wanting to continue its practice of using these racial guidelines actually opposed the finding of unitary status. I would say, though - -",
  "Yeah, we had some specific objections in which we thought that two of the green factors were not satisfied. That argument was rejected by the district court. If I can go back to the judge's finding about the magnet schools, what is so interesting is the same judge finds the same guidelines to be a hard racial quota as to the magnet schools, but not as to the neighborhood schools. Why does he make that distinction? Because he finds that the neighborhood schools are basically equal, and therefore, denying a student an opportunity to attend to one rather than another was not an injury of constitutional magnitude. But I would have thought it is far too late in the day, and the Chief Justice suggested this as well, to say that just because two schools are basically equal, you can deny a student the right to attend one, and assigns one and only one based on his race. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The statute at issue here imposes only a narrow limitation on the union's use of agency fees, namely by requiring the affirmative assent of the non-members before the union may use those funds for non- germane political expenditures. The statute does not limit the union's ability to spend its own money on political causes and every avenue that is available to any other organization in the State to solicit contributions from non- members remains available to the union. The court below nonetheless struck the statute down only by treating the workers' minimum constitutional rights as a constitutional ceiling as well as a floor. In the process, the court below rigidly constitutionalized an area of labor law in which the States and the Federal Government have at least since the Lochner era enjoyed substantial discretion to make labor policy. We would request that the Court reverse the decision below, but also reverse and restore room for play in the joints in this area of labor law. I think the starting problem with the court's analysis below is that the rights that are at issue in this area principally are the rights of the individual workers. This court has recognized that agency shop itself raises significant First Amendment issues and First Amendment impingements and so the forced extraction of fees is justified only to the extent that it can be justified by the government's interest in maintaining labor peace or in avoiding free ridership. So as a minimum constitutional matter, the workers have to have an opt- out right. The question is whether the States can go further and either do an opt-in regime or do what was at issue in the Hudson case and not even allow the union to collect the non-germane funds in the first place from non-members.",
  "I think it might well. I mean, I think there might be an argument at that point that somehow the Federal Constitution requires more than opt-out rights. Certainly some of the amici have made that argument. The Davenport Petitioners have made that argument, and I suppose you could at that point confront a second petition in this case. But at least as a starting matter, I think that's an option that's available to the Washington Supreme Court.",
  "Right, though I mean -- I don't mean to be able to constrain the Washington Supreme Court's ability to find a State constitutional problem that it would then think there's a need to avoid.",
  "They are elected.",
  "It might be a harder call, Justice Scalia. I seem to recall a reference -- it might have actually been in the court of appeals opinion rather than in the State Supreme Court opinion -- that as a general matter the Washington courts have not construed their First Amendment, State constituent First Amendment to be radically different than the Federal Constitution. So I would imagine there's going to be some State law that may limit their ability to do that. I'm certainly not an expert on the Washington State law of the First Amendment.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, it's a fair question. As I say, it's a question that's certainly raised by the Davenport Petitioners. I think there's an answer to it and I'll get to it in a minute. But I would say in fairness to Mr. -- one of the anomalies of this case is that in many respects I think that's a more difficult constitutional question than the one that the Washington Supreme Court answered adversely to Petitioners in this case. I think, if I can sketch an answer as to why it is that the opt out is the constitutional minimum and there isn't as a matter of constitutional law required to be an opt-in right, I think it goes back to what the Court has construed as the relevant First Amendment interest here. And the Court has seemingly construed the relevant First Amendment interest here in not having a compelled extraction, and as part and parcel of the constitutional violation, it seems to have assumed there's a need for a stated objection. And I think that's where you get the opt-out right. And so if you put it in the analogy, an analogous compelled speech context like Willie against Maynard and the New Hampshire license plate, in that context an important parcel of the violation is the objection to having \"Live Free or Die\" on your license plate. And the Court hasn't construed the compelled speech there to be that everybody has a compelled speech violation because they are presumptively forced to have the license plate on the back of their car. So I think that - -",
  "I wouldn't think so, Justice Alito. And I think that there are two separate questions, I would think. One is, what is an adequate set of procedures and protections for exercising the opt-out right? And then a separate question would be, do you actually have to go all the way to an opt-in right? And I think that there may well be many cases where the Hudson notice that's provided doesn't provide a sufficient constitutional opportunity. I mean, you have in a case like this, a 100-page packet, I'm told, that has no -- no form in it that you're supposed to return to opt out. You basically have to go to the third page, find the address of the president of the union, and then send in a letter. And I think it's instructive if you look in the joint appendix, I think it's at page joint appendix 45, you have the form that's available to union members to opt in to PAC contributions, and have payroll deductions made for the PAC contributions. The union certainly makes it much easier to opt in to PAC contributions than it makes it to opt out vis a vis the Hudson packet.",
  "That's absolutely right, Justice Ginsburg, and I think the way we look at it is that this whole debate about the purpose of the provision is a little bit of a red herring, because at the end of the day it's clearly a hybrid. If you look at the text, it's hard to understand how it does not have at least the effect of protecting workers. On the other hand, you're absolutely right that it doesn't address the entirety of germane, of non-germane expenses. It addressed a subset that have the most direct impact on the election process.",
  "That's true. That's true, I mean, for example, a nongermane lobbying expense which you might consider to be political in some broad sense, is not covered by the opt-in and remains subject to the Hudson opt out right. But I don't think that there is certainly anything problematic about that. It's not like the interest in protecting electoral integrity is some sort of forbidden government interest that makes this a suspicious piece of legislation. And I think at the end, if you again put the text of the relevant provision together with the overall purpose, it's clear that it's trying to protect the rights of workers but it's doing so in service of a broader intent of improving electoral integrity, and I could suggest where maybe the Washington Supreme Court went awry in its analysis, it focused almost exclusively on the three stated purposes that were included in the text of Initiative 134, which were all focused more on electoral integrity. That's not surprising, because there were 36 sections in Initiative 134 that dealt with the whole manner of different campaign finance initiatives. Before this initiative was passed by the voters of Washington there weren't any campaign contribution limits in the State of Washington. So this initiative is doing a lot more work, just besides Section 760. I think 760 isn't unrelated to those broader purposes because it does make sure that the contributions of the workers here are voluntary, and I think that is certainly something that's very similar to what Federal law accomplishes through the separate segregated fund requirements. If I could make just one note about the fact that this targets unions and not other entities, I think two points are relevant. The first is that argument was very clearly waived, and if you look at footnote 6 of the Washington Supreme Court opinion which is at 25a of the -- of the State's petition appendix, it's clear that any argument about the, the disparate treatment of unions versus corporations or other entities was not before that court.",
  "You've anticipated my second point, which is the power that's being -- I mean, it's no accident that they targeted this particular power or this particular issue because it has always been understood to be an anomaly in this area. That the unions have a right to effectively take a claim on the paycheck on people who are nonmembers of the union. These are individuals who have already opted out of union membership, and that is a sufficient anomaly and sufficiently unlike any other context that I think there is nothing that prevents the State of Washington from targeting that problem and that problem alone. If there are no further questions, thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Flast against Cohen, this Court recognized narrow circumstances in which a taxpayer could satisfy the requirements of Article III in challenging a congressional exercise of its spending and taxing authority. This court in doing so rejected the suggestion of Justice Douglas that it allow all taxpayers to sue in all manner of claims, as well as the slightly more modest suggestion of Justices Stewart and Fortas that the Court allow taxpayer standing for all establishment clause challenges. This Court's subsequent cases such as Valley Forge have made clear just how narrow the rule of Flast is. In order for a taxpayer to satisfy the requirements of Article III, the taxpayer must challenge a congressional exercise of the taxing and spending authority, and assert that the act of spending itself is what gives rise to the establishment clause violation. The court of appeals in the decision below substantially expanded the scope of taxpayer standing and in doing so, the court adopted a doctrine that I think can fairly be only understood as an exception to, not an application of normal principles of Article III standing. The court did so on the rationale that there is much that the executive branch can do to violate the establishment cause, but there is much that all three branches of Government could conceivably do to violate the establishment clause, and that has never been thought a sufficient reason to extend taxpayer standing to all Government action, nor has it been thought a sufficient reason to relax the irreducible minimum requirements of Article III.",
  "Well, I don't think so, Justice Scalia. I mean, first of all - -",
  "I mean, I think that may be sort of over inclusive and under inclusive.",
  "Which is to say, it's not a congressional program, it's a congressional spending statute that is the key predicate. And then once there's a congressional spending program, whether it's facial challenge or an as-apply challenge that relies on an intervening ministerial act of the executive branch, taxpayer standing will lie under this Court's precedent.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg, but let me just be clear. I don't think it's just a matter of this executive order that's challenged in this case and Congress could have enacted that into statute. As I understand it, the -- what is really at issue here is not the executive order. It is the way that certain conferences were conducted by executive branch officials. That's what the dispute - -",
  "I don't think so, Justice Kennedy, because I look at this Court's - -",
  "Because there has to be two things. There has to be a statute. And then there has to be an allegation that the statute creates a unique injury in the context of spending that affects taxpayers differently than anybody -- than any other citizen. And if you have a situation like your hypothetical statue, where you don't have any spending that goes outside of the Government, then you might have an establishment clause problem, but it wouldn't be an establishment clause problem where the nub of the problem is the fact that money is spent. Because if there's a problem with what's going - -",
  "Well, importantly, Justice Scalia, it's not a matter of it being okay. It's a question of whether it logically - -",
  "Yeah, it logically gives rise to taxpayer standing. So -- and I think there is --",
  "What I would say is in either case it's bad. I would say that there is taxpayer standing to challenge the disbursement of funds outside the Government but not your horrible hypothetical about an internal Government church.",
  "Not taxpayer standing. Anybody who's subjected to the mass at the church probably has standing as a matter of direct - -",
  "With respect, Justice Scalia, nobody forced Van Orden to walk by the Ten Commandments display in Texas at gunpoint, and yet this Court said that he could bring an establishment clause challenge. So I think there would be directly injured people who could challenge your sort of end of the slippery slope - -",
  "I think there's a difference in the extent to which there is a conceptually direct injury for the taxpayer as taxpayer. The citizens are clearly injured when the Government sets up the church.",
  "But with respect, in the context of the internal Government church, the fact that money is being spent to establish that church is the - -",
  "-- least of your concerns. It's the fact that the Government is establishing it that's the principal concern.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I think it's a difference suggested by this Court's cases, and they do make an important distinction between the distribution of money outside the Government where the spending itself is the injury and what this Court has termed the incidental expenditure of money in the context of an executive branch activity that itself is alleged to violate the establishment clause.",
  "I'm not quite sure that's right, Justice Souter, because I think that there's really two ways the Government can establish religion. One is they can do it themselves directly. And if they do that, I think that the primary problem is the primary executive branch conduct in doing so. The other way they can establish - -",
  "Exactly. And that is precisely what - -",
  "With respect in the one respect it is the three pence itself that is the establishment violation. It is the act of handing Government money into the coffers - -",
  "Again, I would take issue with that and say the primary concern that Madison was focused on was the taking of the money and then giving it to the outside religious entity.",
  "I think it might depend on the nature of the claim actually. If the nature of the claim - -",
  "But I think the better view, is the challenge is exactly this one, which is not that there's something wrong with the recipient, but that there's something wrong with what goes on at these conferences. Then in that context, I don't think there would be -- standing - -",
  "Again, I think if I understand the question, I would say that there's no taxpayer standing there. And I think -- but, but and I apologize for sort of bleeding over into the merits. But with all due respect, I don't think you can really meaningfully talk about the Flast nexus test without bleeding over a little bit into the merits, because the Court did it itself in Flast. And what I would say is if you have a challenge where the problem is that it's the very act of money going to the third party conference organizers that's the problem, then it really is a spending case, and I think the taxpayer standing would logically lie. But if it's really, what the concern here is the primary conduct of what was done at the conferences, and not the fact that there's spending on the conferences at all, then I think it's more -- it is a case there would not be taxpayer standing.",
  "That's exactly right. And it's a very important point. Because for example, when this Court recognized that the Bible reading in Doremus did not give rise to taxpayer standing, that didn't stop the parents who were directly injured by the same practice in Shemp from bringing an establishment clause - -",
  "I think there would be taxpayer standing if I understand that. And I realize that, you know, one could say well, that's is a fairly artificial distinction. But I do think that it is suggested by this Court's precedents and the reason that it makes sense is that when you have injury -- where the real injury is the spending, the fact that you're not supposed to pay for plane tickets for ministers, that's an establishment clause injury, then it makes sense to say that people that provided that money in the in the first place have a distinct injury.",
  "Well - -",
  "Not necessarily, Justice Scalia, but it's important to focus on what this case is about.",
  "Right. And it would depend a little bit on about where the President is getting the money. I think the way that we would look at it - -",
  "He - -",
  "If he, if he's taking it from a general appropriation that makes no indication it's to go outside the Government so one could not in any way articulate that as an as-applied challenge to the appropriations, then I suppose that there would not be standing. But I think - -",
  "I would say that that's a much harder case than this - -",
  "-- but I say no. I would say no, no.",
  "No. What Flast makes clear is that you can challenge a congressional statute that is a taxing and spending statute. And I think to understand the circumstances in which you should give rise to taxpayer standing, you need two things: You need a congressional statute that is an exercise of the taxing and spending authority; but then you need the money to go outside the Government. And that's precisely what - -",
  "Right. Because there's, again, there's two ways - -",
  "Horrible hypothetical.",

  "Well, we - -",
  "With respect -- with respect, Justice Breyer, I think you're underestimating the ingenuity of plaintiffs to think that somebody that walked by going to Plymouth Rock okay thinking I was going to see a nice historical exhibit, and is and to see a church, wouldn't bring a -- an action. And that there wouldn't be Article III standing for that particular individual, not the taxpayer - -",
  "The latter, Justice Alito.",
  "And I appreciate -- I appreciate the question.",
  "Well, and I've been trying to make sense out of this Court's precedents.",
  "And the best that I can do -- the best that I can do, when I put together Flast - -",
  "Well, I think -- as a matter of first course, the Court tries. And here -- if I could put the precedents on the map, though, I do think they make a modicum of sense in the following way. You start with Flast. Flast says that you can bring a challenge to a congressional spending statute. Okay, fair enough. Valley Forge comes along and says that you, that you don't have taxpayer standing to challenge an executive branch action. Now that raises a very obvious - -",
  "Well, Justice - -",
  "But Justice Ginsburg, in fairness, the Court could not have been more clear in Valley Forge that there were two reasons that there weren't taxpayer standing there. One was there was a challenge to Executive Branch action. The second was that it was the property clause rather than the spending clause. Now, you could sort of take the view that the third of the cases, Kendrick, overrules the first aspect of the decision in Valley Forge. Now I think that's wrong. I think the way to understand Kendrick is as follows: You have a decision that says you can - - you can challenge congressional spending, not Executive Branch action. That naturally poses the question what about an as-applied challenge to a spending statute? Surely, I mean, because spending is something only the Congress does, and disbursement is a ministerial act that only the Executive does, what do you do when there's an intervening ministerial act of disbursement? Does that mean that it's still an as-applied challenge to the spending statute? Or does - -",
  "That mean that it's Executive Branch action?",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, two things. One, in Bowen, there was -- there is certainly always a degree of discretion. But it is worth noting that in Bowen as in Flast, the statute itself on its face made clear that money was to go to outside entities that were religious. In Bowen it did so in express terms by four times referring to religious organizations. In Flast it did so by saying money was going to go, or in-kind aid, rather, was to going to go to private schools. And that was at a time when this Court roughly contemporaneously, in Lemon v Kurtzman that 93 percent of the private schools were religious. The both of those, the gravamen of what's the complaint, that money is being spent by Congress on religious entities, was not within the discretion of the Executive Branch. And again, the way I would understand Kendrick is simply reconciling Valley Forge and Flast and Cohen to preserve, not broad challenges to Executive Branch action, which would have overruled Valley Forge, but rather to simply preserve the notion that you can bring an as-applied challenge to a spending statute.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, it is certainly not the line I would draw from reading these cases side by side and together.",
  "Justice Scalia, I would have said that no one would have conceptualized that as an as-applied challenge to a general appropriation statute. I mean, I guess you would. But I - -",
  "Even, even if you would do that in another case, I don't see how you could do it in this case. If you look at their complaint they don't identify a single appropriation statute that they take issue with. Even before the Tenth -- the Seventh Circuit, if you look at page 10 a of the Petitioner's appendix - -",
  "With respect, Justice Scalia, I've never heard of an as-applied challenge to a statute that doesn't identity that's unconstitutional as applied. And it's your right - -",
  "That's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice. And every constitutional right could be sort of transmogrified into a claim that oh, that's an as-applied appropriations challenge, because the Government's not supposed to spend money to do unlawful things.",
  "Absolutely. I mean, if this Court wants to go the route of Justice Stewart, which it pointedly rejected, the majority of the Court pointed rejected in Flast, and say, establishment clause challenges, we're going to relax the normal Article III standard -- now, I'm not quite sure where the Court gets the authority to relax the normal Article III standards. But assuming that, that would at least be - -",
  "I suppose under that theory, and obviously the plaintiffs in Richardson and Schlesinger were very upset as well, and the Court said that - -",
  "Justice Breyer, let me try to answer in two ways if I can. One is to say that that way of looking at it takes you even beyond where Justice Brennan was in Valley Forge. Even Justice Brennan would have drawn the line at what he called bestowals of Government largesse to third parties.",
  "Well, again, but he - -",
  "But again, he didn't say just spending of money to do the Executive Branch's everyday operations and maybe -- and one day they go a little too far in praising religion. He said bestowal of Government largesse outside the Government. The second point I would make is I still don't understand where in just being upset you satisfy the irreducible minimum requirements of Article III, and even though Flast is probably the outer limit of what's an Article III injury under normal principles, there is at least what Judge Leventhal in Public Citizen against Simon called conceptual directness between the injury to the taxpayer and the injury that comes when tax money is spent outside the Government to a religious entity. He differentiated that from what happens when you have general Executive Branch activity that's unlawful, where he said there's no similar arrow between the action and taxpayers as a class. It's a classic injury that's inflicted on everybody. It's a generalized grievance, which has never been said to satisfy Article III.",
  "But Justice Ginsburg, their challenge is not that the money that's spent on conferences can't be spent on conferences. Their challenge is that what happened at the conference is there was too much promotion of religion. The fact that the money was spent on the conferences is incidental to the gravamen of the complaint. If I may save my time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points in rebuttal. First of all, I think it's important to emphasize that if this Court recognizes that there is not taxpayer standing, that does not mean that there won't be lawsuits, that there won't be directly injured plaintiffs that can bring claims. Doremus and Schemp prove that point. But even more broadly, any time the establishment clause injury takes the form of alleged coercive conduct the individuals who are coerced Are going to have standing to bring the suit. The second point to make clear is it's just not an accurate description of this Court's cases to say that the spending of appropriated funds by the executive is enough to give rise to taxpayer standing. The property distribution plan at issue in Valley Forge took a tremendous amount of appropriated funds to run. Nobody thought that was a basis for taxpayer standing. The Bibles that were purchased and the salaries of the teachers in Doremus presumably cost at least a threepence. But that was not found enough. Now, I think in trying to understand the Court's cases you really have to focus on this word \"incidental.\" And I think that the colloquy in the second half of the argument shows that you can't look at incidental as being minimal. It doesn't mean that. It doesn't mean minimal. It doesn't mean incremental. It is trying to distinguish an incidental expenditure of funds when -- as to something where the expenditure of funds is central or vital to the establishment clause violation. In the context of money going to third party religious entities, nobody would say that the spending is incidental. It's the whole violation. In the context of Bible reading or anything else the Executive Branch does, the fact that money went to fund the Executive Branch to violate the establishment clause is the least of the problems. The problem is the primary conduct of the Executive Branch in violating the establishment clause, but that's not a spending injury. The funding that goes into that is incidental. I think that's the way to make sense of this Court's cases. It's important to emphasize what's at issue here. It's not a general challenge to the Faith-Based Office. It's not a challenge to the name of the office. It is a challenge to the particular offices and the assertion that the Executive Branch officials at the conferences spent too much time talking about faith-based groups and not enough talking about community-based groups. If that isn't intrusive on the Executive Branch, I don't know what is. The last point I would leave you with is that if something has to go in this area, if you have to choose between the logic of Flast and the irreducible minimum requirements of Article III, I think it's an easy choice. You don't abandon the basic requirements of Article III that distinguish the Judiciary from the political branches of Government. I think the Seventh Circuit, with all due respect, lost sight of that. Its decision should be reversed. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States has responsibility for enforcing both the securities laws through the SEC and the antitrust laws through the Justice Department and the FTC. It thus has a critical interest in ensuring that these laws can be reconciled in a manner that gives effect to both, and completely ousts neither. Any effort to try to reconcile those laws in the specific context of the underwriting of IPOs has to begin with an understanding of the particular regulatory context and scheme. The SEC obviously carefully regulates both the registration and the underwriting process for individual IPOs. There are two aspects of that regulatory regime that are particularly important: First, the approval for all sorts of collaborative conduct that is the hallmark of the underwriting syndicate. And second, the very fine nature of the distinctions that the SEC draws between permissible book building activity and impermissible market manipulation. And in that regulatory context, the kind of collaborative conduct that would in many other contexts raise yellow or red flags of an antitrust violation is innocuous, because it's a hallmark of the underwriting process. Equally important, the SEC does make certain conduct like tie-ins and laddering unlawful, but very closely related conduct is not only permissible, but is considered beneficial to the capital formation process.",
  "I think it might, Justice Stevens. The prohibitions on laddering and tie-ins are not just disclosure provisions. And I think as a practical matter, if these kind of things were disclosed, they probably wouldn't happen. So it's a little hard to - -",
  "That may be true, but the way the regulation approaches that conduct is a little bit more of a prophylactic approach. It's not just a disclosure approach, and it does say that there's conduct that is forbidden. But I think it is important to recognize just how fine the lines that are drawn here become, because, to give you a real world example, the guidance document that's at page 216A of the petition appendix makes clear that it is permissible for the lead underwriter, when talking to customers, to gauge their interest at various price points in the initial offering.",
  "Well, I think if you were looking at a challenge that took place solely within the context of a single IPO, it would probably be so difficult that I think we would concede that you can't practically separate the two. What I think is important from the standpoint of the Justice Department and its antitrust responsibilities is you don't want to sweep an immunity so broad that it would, say, give cover to a conspiracy that cut across IPOs, and was an effort to fix commission rates, or to make territorial agreements, or exclude a rival investment bank from the underwriting process.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia - -",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I think that you could certainly perform this test and make the test protect conduct sufficient to protect against that threat. We are certainly sensitive to the threat that a regulatory agency is trying to draw a fine line between two closely related areas of conduct. They're not going to be able to enforce that line as a practical matter if the regulated community knows that the consequence of having a foot fault in crossing that line will be treble damages in a class action suit. On the other hand, we would caution against adopting some sort of broad immunity that would preclude, say, the Justice Department from investigating and prosecuting an antitrust conspiracy that cut across IPOs. And of course, the Congress has addressed the problem of treble damages directly in a number of areas. And I suppose, if they were to address the area in the antitrust context, they might draw a distinction between private treble damages suits and Government enforcement efforts. Now, that's a little hard to do - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, I would warn you off of sort of saying absolutely no. I think as a practical matter, though, it is going to be -- I mean, I can't conceive of a ready example of where an allegation that is specific to an internal single IPO would really be practically inseparable. So I think the role of the antitrust laws will largely be in allegations that cut across IPOs.",
  "Well, I suppose it's possible, Justice Breyer.",
  "Well, I think if you draw a distinction between intraIPO allegations and interIPO allegations, you go a long way towards doing it. And I should note, that's basically the line this Court drew in NASD. If you look particularly at the part of the decision that deals with count 1 of the Government's complaint, that was a horizontal allegation. And it was all in the context of vertical agreements that were specific to a particular mutual fund. And in that context, this Court said that with respect to the horizontal agreement, there's nothing in the SEC regulations that specifically addresses that, but the SEC specifically blesses the vertical agreements, so we're going to give additional immunity to that horizontal agreement. That same page, page 733 of the opinion, they say, what we don't have before us is an allegation by the government that there is a scheme here to reduce competition between mutual funds. There is no allegation that they were trying to cut down, there was an agreement that would cut down competition between Fidelity and Wellington, for example. It was all in the context of individual funds and retarding the secondary market for individual funds. The language the Court used on page 733 of that opinion seems to us a perfectly reasonable test. The Court said, quote: \"The close relationship is fatal\" the close relationship between what the SEC had prohibited in the vertical context and what was sought to be gone after in the context of the horizontal restraints, those are too closely related. I don't think that test has caused the undue confusion. And I think what it does it makes a reasonable balance between a ruling that on the one hand preserves a great deal of immunity, but on the other hand doesn't give a kind of blanket immunity that would basically completely oust the antitrust laws. And I think that's the balance we hope to - -",
  "That's right, Justice Ginsburg, and - -",
  "Well, I think this Court could do one of two things. I mean, the Petitioners for their part have pointed to in footnote 6 of the blue briefs, to a variety of Second Circuit precedents about the standards for repleading. Perhaps the easiest course for this Court would be to just vacate and let the Second Circuit apply its own law of repleading. That would be one option. The other option would be - -",
  "We would have no objection to that, Justice Ginsburg. And I would say, you know, you might say that, particularly based on the guidance this Court gives in this case and the guidance this Court gives perhaps in the Twombley case, that it might be fair to let the plaintiffs have a crack at making a new complaint in this area. Oh the other hand, as I say, we would have no objection to just allowing the Second Circuit to sort it out based on Second Circuit pleading law. I think the important thing from our perspective - -",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's a little hard for me to frame that complaint. I think if it focused on inter-IPO allegations and, contrary to this complaint, paragraph 42 of this complaint, actually alleges that there were a variety of different mechanisms that were used, that doesn't sound like what you would expect from a disagreement that cut across IPOs. You'd expect uniform conduct to be alleged. And if there was that sort of conduct and it was alleged to violate both regulatory regimes in a clear way, then maybe it could go forward. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In McConnell against FEC this Court upheld Title II's restrictions on electioneering communications by unions and corporations against facial attack. In doing so, this Court reviewed a voluminous record and concluded that the vast majority of the ads that had been run in previous cycles and came within the statutory definition could constitutionally be regulated by Congress. Accordingly, this Court rejected the overbreadth challenge and upheld the statute on it face. To be sure, the last time this case was before the Court the Court made clear that nothing in McConnell foreclosed an opportunity for as-applied challenges to the statute and the Court remanded the case for that purpose. But to be consistent with McConnell's overbreadth decision, any as-applied challenge cannot have the effect of calling into question a substantial percentage of the statute's applications. Yet the district court's decision below has precisely that forbidden effect. There is nothing atypical about the three ads that are before this Court. Indeed, they closely resemble the Jane Doe hypothetical ads that this Court identified at page 127 as the prototype of ads that, although they took the form of issue ads, nonetheless were functionally equivalent to express advocacy.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I don't think you were wrong, and I suppose that obviously you thought the rest of the Court was wrong in McConnell, and if the Court wants to reconsider that decision -- I mean, that's an option the Court can take in the appropriate case. I would suggest that this is not the appropriate case for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that I think it was briefed in this case really as something of an afterthought, not as a principal focus of the briefing. In the McConnell case this Court, as you well remember, had an unbelievably exhaustive record before it in making a judgment about the facial constitutionality of the law.",
  "With respect, I don't think you were. And although you didn't have this case before you, you had many, many concrete cases before you that are really indistinguishable from this case. You had the - -",
  "Well, I guess it's hard for me to say how you would decide whether it's typical. I'm not sure that's the question.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, let me try to come at it this way, which is to say I would have thought that if you're not going to overturn McConnell, you're just going to apply it and say, well, what kind of as-applied challenges are left, I would have thought that what you would have in mind is ads that had an identifiable characteristic that marked them as being outside of the mainstream and somehow different from most of the ads. And so - -",
  "One strong indicator that these are in the mainstream is how close they are to the Jane Doe hypothetical that this Court identified as the prototype of the kind of ads that, although they took the form of issue ads, they looked like issue ads, they really were indistinguishable from and the functional equivalent of express advocacy.",
  "There were hundreds. I mean, as you well remember, there were hundreds of ads in the record. And this Court was able to draw conclusions about them both by looking at some of the specifics, but also looking at the forest, if you will. One of the things they recognized, for example, is that these ads weren't turning up uniformly wherever issues were being debated. These ads turning up in the close elections, in the close races. And there was - -",
  "No, no, Mr. Chief Justice, because the Court used \"vast majority,\" and I mean, that could mean 70 percent, it could mean 80 percent, it could mean 90 percent. Equally importantly, on page 207 of the opinion, when it was specifically addressing overbreadth, it made the argument, it made the conclusion, that both in absolute and relative terms this statute was not substantially overbroad. And it seems to me then at a minimum for any as-applied challenge to be consistent with that overbreadth determination, it can't have the effect of opening up the statute wide open such that on a going forward basis the majority, certainly a substantial number, percentage, inconsistent with an overbreadth holding, of the ads that would be run by unions and corporations within the last 60 days of the election would qualify for the exception. That just seems inconsistent with the overbreadth holding.",
  "It referred to all ads that would come within the statutory prohibition.",
  "But with respect, Justice Scalia, there were so many issue ads in the record in McConnell that if issue ads were an appropriate category for as-applied challenges, it would have been impossible for this Court to reject the overbreadth burden.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, the only other obvious candidate that we could carve out would be express advocacy. And the Court was clear in footnote 18 of the opinion what percentage that was, 4 to 5 percent. So as to the 95 percent of the ads that didn't engage in express advocacy, this Court still had no difficulty concluding that the vast majority of them were within Congress' conception of the purposes of the4 statute - -",
  "That's one way to divide it. You're using the term \"issue ad.\"",
  "Justice Scalia, you're use the term \"issue ad\" as if it's self-defining. I don't view it that way. And I mean, even Appellee has tried to narrow it to grassroots lobbying. Now, of course there's a problem with the grassroots lobbying argument and that is it was made to this Court in McConnell, and at that time the nature of the argument wasn't, oh, grassroots lobbying, that's a sort of idiosyncratic or atypical application that would give rise to a narrow as-applied exception. No, the argument there, and a great illustration is Appellee's national affiliate, National Right to Life. At pages 6 and 7 of the reply brief in McConnell, they argued about grassroots lobbying and said, boy, this statute applies to grassroots lobbying, therefore it's substantially overbroad.",
  "Oh, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not saying that. My point is that not all as-applied challenges are created equal.",
  "Well, let me give you a couple of as -- I mean, look, my job is to defend the constitutionality of the statute on its face and as applied. So I'm not suggesting that any of these as-applied challenges would necessarily success or I wouldn't be up here trying to make some argument in defense of the statute. But let me give you - -",
  "Sure.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Well then, let me give you an - -",
  "Let me give you some inspirational as-applied challenges that would be better as-applied challenges than this one. A challenge by a 501(c)(3) corporation that has difficulty separating up a separate segregated fund. Much better as-applied challenge. The challenge that was brought in the Maine case that you have before you in another -- in another petition or another appeal, that was a challenge to an ad that was run in an unopposed primary. That starts to sound like a pretty good as-applied challenge.",
  "With respect, Justice Scalia, it would be a better case if that were the claim. There's no doubt that appellee has a, a PAC, a separate segregated fund. To their claim isn't that they didn't have one. Their claim is it was underfunded vis a vis what it would cost to fund these ads. But that itself is clearly a conscious decision, because if you look at how much money they had in their PAC in 2000, they had 155,000 or something like that in their PAC. Plenty to pay for this ad. This time around they had 13,000. Now why is that? It's pretty clear from the record that they shifted their emphasis not to getting money for their PAC, but to get money in their general corporate treasury to fund these ads. And so they raised 300 million dollars in corporate funds. But that's not hat doesn't make this a good as-applied challenge.",
  "I think - -",
  "I think, I think a 501(c)(3) corporation has a much better as-applied challenge if they can bring it. And that's the as-applied challenge that's sort of been discussed in some of the amicus briefs. The problem is Appellee is not in a position to do that, because they are a 501(c)(4) corporation. Another example of a better challenge would be the Chief Justice's hypothetical from the earlier argument which would be a corporation that runs a series of ads and then wants to continue to run them during the election cycle. Well, that's not guilty this case, but it well could be. The filibuster issue isn't something that came like a bolt out of the blue on the eve of the election. Throughout 2003, there were filibusters in the Senate on a pretty regular basis.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, I don't see -- you may be right that certainly people do tend to focus on issues in the context of an election. But I think the record in this case does not bear out the conclusion that people only care about them at those times or that groups don't bother running ads at other times. I mean if you look at the 2005 time frame, the record reflects that a number of groups, not Appellee, but a number of groups had issue ads addressing the filibuster issue. And what's interesting about that to me is if you look at joint appendix 45 and 46 for the examples they were able to do it in terms of tag line, \"Earth, call the Senate.\" And if, if Appellee had run those same ads which would capture the issue, then they wouldn't even have come within the statute. So it does illustrate both that this is an issue that drew enough public interest to generate ads at different time periods, not just in the reelection context, and even when did it that, it was possible to engage on the issue without coming within the confines of the statute. So it just seems like - -",
  "Justice Kennedy - -",
  "Justice Kennedy, it's certainly possible. I don't think it's common, though. And the reason I say that is just to go back to the record in McConnell, the one thing the record there made pretty clear is when you got to the period 60 days before the election, these ads were not being ran in a way that would have some random distribution that you might expect if they were just interested in the issues or just interested uniformly in all reelections. These ads were really concentrated in the close districts. I mean one of the lines that stick out in my mind from the record is in trying to fund money for these so-called issue ads, the Club for Growth executives said \"we need money for these issue ads because they make all the difference in close elections.\"",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, if your point is that there may be an interest in trying to leverage the upcoming election to get somebody's attention - -",
  "-- I think - -",
  "Sure.",
  "No doubt that's true. But I think it also implicates the, the interests of Congress in the statute that this Court recognized and upheld on its face. When, when the whole point is, we're not just interested in this issue in the abstract, and we're not running this issue just because there's a pending vote in Congress; we're interested in running this ad because it's a pretty effective vehicle both to defeat this candidate's reelection chances, but if we don't succeed on that maybe we'll convince him to change his mind.",
  "Well -- I don't know, the fact that by the time they ran these ads Senator Feingold voted 20 times out of 20 to filibuster suggests to me that they probably concluded that the best to get a Wisconsin Senator who wouldn't filibuster was to change senators not to change to change Senator Feingold's mind.",
  "No. That's absolutely right, Justice Ginsburg. And obviously the statute itself in its bright line test doesn't make you get into those kind of inquiries. But if their claim, if they come into court and say well, we had a pure heart; we didn't have an intent to affect the election - -",
  "Sure I am, Justice Scalia. I'm giving you the statute, on its face, which couldn't be clearer. If you want to have as-applied exceptions, if you want to go down the road, to quote the Chief Justice in dissent in MCFL, of creating \"barely adumbrated exceptions,\" you may inject some vagueness. Now that may be necessary. And there may be as-applied challenges out there that do the trick without creating vagueness. But I don't think this is the one. And just because the first as-applied challenge you see is a problematic one doesn't mean this aren't better as-applied challenges out there. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points in rebuttal. First, I would like to stress the virtue of as-applied challenges. You might wonder in the abstract, wasn't there a problem with the statute that applies to a group running a series of ads and then one of them falls in the period. But then you look at an as-applied challenge and you see that didn't happen here. In fact, the opposite did. This issue was percolating since March of 2003. These ads were run some 500 days after the first filibuster vote. Both before and after Senator Feingold's reelection cycle, they addressed this - -",
  "Justice Scalia, if you're looking for an as-applied challenge that's going to identify a genuine issue ad, I would think that it would go somewhat to intent. And I would think the reason that - -",
  "No. Our position is slightly different than intervenors on that point. And I think the reason that the series of ads hypothetical is beguiling is because it suggests that because they run the same issue ad all the time, they must be interested in the issue, not the election, and the opposite is true here. They run ads about this issue, they run - - they have communications about this issue outside of the period of Senator Feingold's reelection. They don't rely on broadcast ads. They rely on e-alerts when it's not during the election cycle. But when it's during the election cycle, all of a sudden they start running broadcast ads. And I think it shows what the timing suggests. The timing here suggests an intent to influence the election, not an intent to engage on the issue.",
  "No, you don't.",
  "No, they don't, Justice Scalia, and one of the arguments that's made to try to suggest that there should be a reconsideration of McConnell is, as-applied checks don't work. How can you say that? In the two cases that have been brought, there were preliminary injunction proceedings that were completed before the blackout period began. So in that case, bring your preliminary injunction if you have a question. But the virtue of as-applied challenges, and the last thing I'll say, is the virtue of as-applied challenges, they're not all created equal. Just because this as-applied challenge fails doesn't mean the statute isn't open to them.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:",
  "I don't think I do agree with that and there's a couple of the issues here where we take a slightly different take. Obviously we feel the President's determination here that we will comply with the Avena judgment is a critical element in why there's an enforceable obligation - -",
  "That's correct, Justice Scalia. Now, obviously, Mr. Donovan and his clients could get here and ask you to enforce the judgment of it own force without the President's determination and that would ultimately be a question for this Court. We of course - -",
  "I hope that you wouldn't and we would be up here saying don't, because if you look at Article 94 of the UN Charter as a whole, it has two components and I think it makes clear why the President's intervening role here is important. 94-1 says that we undertake to comply with our obligations, with our obligations to comply with the judgment. But 94-2 says what happens when a country doesn't do that. It's a matter for the Security Council. And that, of course, I think necessarily implies that countries do retain the option to put themselves out of compliance with an International Court of Justice judgment.",
  "Exactly, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that - -",
  "Absolutely, and that's why we're supporting Mr. Donovan.",
  "Whether it's an omission or a commission I don't think is the point, Justice Scalia. My point - -",
  "I didn't take that to mean - -",
  "I agree, i think the omission-commission - -",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, let me take that in turn. Let me just first close the discussion of what happened here by saying the reason I think the commission-omission distinction doesn't have much purchase here is because the President did make a determination that we would comply. And I think if you ask the question who makes the determination as to whether we're going to default on our international law obligations or comply, especially vis-a-vis the UN, the answer to that question is quite clear: It's the President, and Congress has acquiesced in that with the UN Participation act at 22 U.S.C. 287.",
  "It depends exactly what form that would take. I think part of the problem - - I'm stumbling with that question - -",
  "And what does it suggest that is supposed to be done with tne end product of that determination?",
  "I would say that it wouldn't -- I would say that it wouldn't, as you suggest, not fully comply and not fully discharge with our obligation. But the extent to which we did and purported to be doing that under compliance with the judgment, it would have the same force as providing the rule of decision, which, to get back to Justice Scalia's question, especially in a context like this, is not so unprecedented. It is not materially different from when the President supplies the rule of decision in the pre-FSIA practice by making a determination, binding on the courts State and Federal, that somebody has sovereign immunity.",
  "No, Justice Alito, I don't think the theory would sweep that broadly, and I think that - -",
  "Well, first of all, there's obviously a limiting principle in our theory, which is to say that the President can't take any action pursuant to this which is inconsistent with other constitutional obligations.",
  "No, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that's true.",
  "That's exactly right as to the Vienna Convention. But this case raises a question, not about the proper interpretation of the Vienna Convention, because as you remember we were four-square with this Court on its interpretation of the Vienna Convention in Sanchez-Llamas. The relevant treaties here the Optional Protocol and the UN Charter, and the question here is not the force of -- of the Avena judgment as precedent - -",
  "No doubt at all, Mr. Chief Justice. And we think with respect to anyone but the 51 individuals that are covered by the judgment that of course this Court has the final word on the interpretation of the Vienna Convention.",
  "Justice Scalia - -",
  "Of course the countries were parties, but these 51 individuals' claims were specifically adjudicated. Why were they specifically adjudicate? Because they were effectively -- the claims were espoused by the Mexican Government. That system - -",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think that reflects that self-executing is one of those words that people use to cover a lot of different meanings; and I think in its most correct sense, you're right to say that the Vienna Convention is self-executing. So there didn't have to be legislation before Texas and its local officials were obligated to provide notice in this case; and of course, it's their default on that treat obligation by the State and local officials that has us in this predicament in the first place. Now, there's another meaning of \"self-executing\", or maybe it's a misuse of the term, to say whether it gives rise to individually enforceable rights in court without more. And we do take the position that if the President had done nothing, and certainly if the President had said we're not going to comply, we're going to respond to this ICJ judgment the way we did with the Nicaragua judgment, we don't think that this judgment would be enforceable as of its own terms.",
  "That's absolutely right, and that gets back to the basic principle of reviewing foreign judgments; and it's not that this Court is disabled from its judicial role. It's just the judicial role here is not a straight-up question of the interpretation of the Vienna Convention. It's a question of what effect to give the judgment that's been effectively validated by the executive branch. And there's two things - -",
  "That's -- that's right, Justice Stevens. As Justice Ginsburg put it - -",
  "I think that's right, and certainly our obligation under that judgment as the executive branch sees it is to these 51 individuals as their claims have been espoused by - -",
  "Then I'd be on that side of the podium, Your Honor. I mean, we would take the position that the President's authority here is, in his view of this, is a necessary step; and that seems to be - -",
  "Oh, but the -- the President can't displace the role of this Court. It's just that the role of this Court in a situation where there's been a judgment and the executive branch has viewed that judgment as something we should comply with, then the role of this Court is limited to deciding whether there was jurisdiction to issue that judgment in the first place; and then the secondary role of this Court would to be to say, does the rule of law embodied by that judgment violate the Constitution. And that's why the answer to the Chief Justice's original hypothetical, about a sentence to 5 years for guards that had no notice -- that's a different case. But here there's no colorable argument that the -- that the judgment here and what's embodied in it lies outside the power of the Federal Government as a whole to adjudicate and to put as an obligation on the States.",
  "Of course not, Justice Souter. That would just be like cases that unfortunately happen, where we would take a position that the judgment on its own is not binding and you would reject that position and that would be the law of the land.",
  "We don't suggest that we wouldn't comply with a judgment of this Court, accepting Mr. Donovan's first theory that the President's role here is unimportant.",
  "-- but we do think, we stick to our view that the President's role here makes this an easier case and is in our view dispositive.",
  "You could. I think another route, of course, that would be available to you is to simply say: Here we have a judgment and we have the President effectively espousing the judgment, and in those cases we don't have to worry about what would happen if we didn't have one or the other.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I think there's two questions there. I'd like to try to answer them both. One is, what degree of formality is required? And we would say that if you look to historical practice, this is not something where you a need a high degree of formality. So look to the executive agreement that this case -- this Court gave its positive effect to in Belmont and Pink. It was an exchange of diplomatic letters, nothing more. Look to the executive determination that this Court give dispositive effect to, dismissed the lawsuit completely in Ex Parte Peru. It was a letter from the undersecretary of state to the attorney general. Going back to the very beginnings of the nation, look at the extradition of Thomas Nash. What was the form of the President's determination we would extradite him? A letter from the secretary of state to Judge Bee in South Carolina.",
  "Well, with respect - -",
  "Well, I don't think Nash is inapplicable, Justice Kennedy; I think it is on all fours.",
  "But it is a wonderful speech, and I really do think you should take a look at that speech. If you want to find it, it's actually appended to volume 18 of the U.S. Reports. And I think you should look at that speech before rejecting our position here, because it really is on all fours in that there you had a treaty obligation duly approved by the Senate, and there was a question: Do we need an act of Congress before the executive can extradite somebody? And Marshall I think put the law exactly right in that case when he said: Sure, Congress can make a determination and if it does, that's the end of matter; but absent the congressional determination, the President has the authority to extradite Nash. Now, that's a situation where somebody's personal liberty was at stake. So I would say that in some respects it's a fortiori that in this case what's at issue is simply recognizing that there's binding Federal law here, that I think if the Texas court had recognized that it was binding Federal law, it would have applied under their own State procedural default law. Now, just to finish up, and then I will sit down, there's a second part of your question, Justice Scalia, which was addressed to what does the reference to comity mean. Obviously, from the very beginning in this case we have taken the position in this Court that the President's memorandum directs the State courts, in its words, to give effect to the Avena judgment -- not decide whether you want to give it effect based on your State law of comity, but give effect to the judgment. I think if you actually look at the law of comity, one of the things that it talks about is comity is really what the courts should do in the absence of a controlling view from one of the political branches. Here the President has made clear, it's clear to me what the answer is applying comity, which would be to give effect to the judgment. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has made clear that speech proposing an unlawful transaction is not protected by the First Amendment. And speech that falsely proposes an unlawful transaction is likewise unprotected. The statute at issue here properly construed does no more than prohibit efforts to offer or solicit materials that are contraband and then prevents somebody from turning around after soliciting or offering contraband and suggesting that the materials either did not exist or were not contraband after all. The statute does not prohibit truthful speech about lawful materials. Accordingly, the court of appeals erred in striking the statute down on its face.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, we do not think that would be covered by the statute. We don't think that that would involve -- in the first point, we don't think it would involve presentation or promotion of the movie in the meaning of this statute. We think those terms are really limited to efforts to make the product available to the market. And I think if you read those terms in conjunction with each other, they are all directed at efforts to make the product available to the market. Now, so if the person whose actually distributing the film wants to try to market it as actual child pornography, then I suppose that would come within the ambit of the statute. But a movie reviewer does not have anything to worry about in the first instance because I don't think that would come within the term - -",
  "Again, Justice Kennedy, it might be conceptually possible for somebody to market, let's say a mainstream movie, on the basis of a - - either their own statement or an attached review, that misrepresents the nature of the movie and makes a claim for the movie, that it's actual child pornography. I suppose in that unusual circumstance, it would be covered. But I guess it would be equally possible for somebody to take one of the countless mainstream movies that portrays a murder on screen, and say this is actually a snuff film. There's actually -- this was a snuff film. This was an actual murder. Now, somebody who did that would be clearly misrepresenting the film. I don't think they would turn around if somebody tried to do something about that false or misleading speech and be able to defend on that speech because it would be clearly false and misleading speech. And I think what is important here is if the underlying movie is not child pornography, then truthful efforts to promote that movie won't be captured.",
  "If the movie itself comes within the - -",
  "And if it were done in a sufficiently graphic way, that it was captured - -",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, there's -- I guess there's an anterior problem, which is if the depiction were sufficiently graphic - -",
  "The person that would have that film would be in possession of child pornography, which itself would be a problem under the statute. He's in the possession of it.",
  "And that might be an example where, starting with the basic prohibition on the possession of child pornography, that might be a situation where there was a valid as-applied challenge. And that also might be a situation where there would be a valid as-applied challenge to the pandering and solicitation provision. But I think the proper way to analyze that is to ask first whether or not something is covered by the basic prohibition.",
  "I agree, and I think in theory, at least, there may be valid as-applied challenges to the underlying prohibition. And this Court of course in Ferber recognized that possibility in upholding the basic prohibition on the promotion of child pornography in that context.",
  "It is, Justice Ginsburg but I think in context that would not be something that comes within the ambit of the statute. And again, if you start with the proposition that - -",
  "I understand that, Justice Ginsburg. What I would say is this statute in order to apply, at least the way we interpret it, requires both an objective and a subjective component. And so you would have to have a situation where that promotion of the movie objectively would lead somebody to believe that you're marketing in a manner that portrays it as actual child pornography. Now I think what you've just said right there would probably fail at the objective test because I think particularly when you start talking about it being a motion picture and the like, the natural assumption -- let's say it's a mainstream motion picture, is going to be oh, that's just actors, it's probably adult actors, or a body double or something. I don't think that comes within the statute. The other thing that's required, of course, is a subjective component -- specific intent is the way that we would read the statute. And clearly the person who's marketing Lolita itself and wants people to go see it in a mainstream box office does not have the intent to convey to people that this is actual, forbidden child pornography.",
  "Justice Souter, I would say that the better answer is no, that he has not. Now --",
  "Justice Souter, I would say no for a more fundamental reason, which is I think you have to read two provisions of the statute here in pari materia. And the other provision I think that is relevant is the affirmative defense that's in subsection (d) of the statute, which is at 6a of the appendix to our opening gray brief. And that provides an affirmative defense in the situation where somebody is in possession of child pornography. Now, the first problem the person who gets child pornography in the mail has is that the statute - - the bans of possession would apply. Now, there's an affirmative defense. The affirmative defense is specific to possession, but one of the things that's a prerequisite to qualify for the affirmative defense, which is in (d)(2)(B) is that you have to afford that material -- you have to afford the agency, the law enforcement agency, access to the material. Now - -",
  "You're right, Justice Souter, but that is a problem both for the prohibition on possession and it is not a unique problem for the pandering solicitation provision. And I don't think the fact that you might have to if -- in that situation, you might have to actually present your affirmative defense in some case is a reason to strike a ban on possession as overbroad. But the - -",
  "Well, Justice Souter, let me try two responses. One is I do think you have a problem even in possession because once you get it in the mail, your possession of it is knowing. And that is precisely why Congress included this affirmative defense in the statute. The second thing I would say though is again, we have to read these statutes in pari materia, and if one of the ways you qualify for the affirmative defense is you afford access to law enforcement agency of the material, I don't think that which is a prerequisite for qualifying for the affirmative defense can be independently prohibited - -",
  "-- by the statute.",
  "Well -- and, again, I think if you did no more than that, I don't know that you would necessarily be covered by the statute, but if you said I got this disgusting child pornography in the mail, it's clearly unlawful, here take a look, I mean I suppose that is covered by the statute. But that doesn't seem like a natural reaction.",
  "Justice Breyer, I think that we would take the position that even if you are presenting the material, making it available, but you're not charging for it, you're not exchanging it, you're just offering it for free, here's a quick free look, it's still covered by the statute.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, you know, I think you could certainly interpret the statute to write around that problem if you wanted to, but I do think the most natural reading of the terms \"promotes, distributes, presents, and advertises\" is to capture not just somebody who is making that available to the market for sale or for barter, but also somebody who says look, I have child pornography, I want to get you interested in this, this is the real stuff, here take a look.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, here -- I mean I think my first cut at drawing the line would to be say it's not a problem to say, can you believe what I got in the mail, and talk to your neighbor about it, describe it. On the other hand, I do think you're presenting the materials if you say, I got this in the mail, look at this, isn't this disgusting, this is clearly child pornography.",
  "If you think though - -",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, if you think that's the difference between expanding this statute in some enormous way and not, then I would invite you to have a more restrictive view of \"presents.\" And we certainly want you to interpret the statute in a way that renders it not overbroad. And, of course, this Court has made clear on a number of occasions that, before you get to the overbreadth analysis, you are applying the early constructions to make sure that the statute if possible - -",
  "-- is construed to be constitutional. But if I could just -- I'm sorry.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think there may be a distinction to be drawn. We certainly don't think that it's limited to commercial speech if by \"commercial speech\" you mean only efforts to buy or sell or even only efforts to barter. Because we think that somebody who sort of systematically is operating a web site where they are giving away child pornography and advertising it as such would be clearly covered by the statute. So, to the extent that the distinction between commercial and noncommercial is at the line where you would say you're giving it away gratis, we think that's still covered. Now, I gather that maybe Justice Breyer had a different conception in mind, that you really have the - -",
  "Well, in fairness, Mr. Chief Justice, I think we had a slightly broader conception of \"presents.\" What we were thinking that \"presents\" means is really when you are not just sort of -- you know -- in some abstract way talking about presenting the material, but you're actually furnishing the material to somebody else.",
  "And - -",
  "Not at all, Justice Alito, and I think that's an important point with respect to Justice Breyer's hypothetical. I mean you have to remember that the materials that we're talking about here are in the main materials that are unlawful even to possess. And it is also true that the -- in the wake of Ferber, a pretty good job was done of getting these materials out of the real world. So the kind of pictures that are - -",
  "Infrequently occurs - - especially in the real world, which is to say when pictures or magazines are being handed around from adolescent to adolescent, there is really no reason in the world to suspect that what's being handed from adolescent to adolescent is child pornography as opposed to adult pornography -- Playboy and that sort of thing. Because the truth of the matter is in the wake of Ferber, a pretty good job has been done in stamping out child pornography in the real world. It has moved, unfortunately, on to the Internet. And, in that context, when people are promoting it as actual child pornography or soliciting it as actual child pornography - -",
  "It does, Justice Stevens, but so, too, for the basic prohibition. And I think what's important here is there may be some definitional, you know, questions. Or you may have a view that there are applications of the statute that would be unconstitutional. But what's important, I think, is that this pandering and solicitation provision doesn't add some new definition, some more aggressive definition. It simply picks up the notion of the basic definition of child pornography, and it says that if you're taking materials and you are offering them to the market as actual child pornography, if you are soliciting actual child pornography, then the government can go after the direct acts of solicitation and offering and -- and - - prosecute those acts without - -",
  "That's right, Justice Ginsburg. If the scienter requirements are satisfied and I'm consciously trying to get you to believe that even though I have something that for some technical reason is not the real thing, what I'm offering you is the real thing, the statute does target that. But that seems to me to not be a First Amendment problem. It seems to be a natural consequence of Congress taking the Court's advice in Free Speech Coalition and moving from a prohibition on materials that had been pandered to the actual acts of pandering and solicitation themselves.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, we think that all those hypotheticals are taken out with more than one reason. I mean, I think from the Catholic Bishops - -",
  "Sure.",
  "Oh - -",
  "But are there real minors engaging in forbidden activity?",
  "Actual child pornography?",
  "Well, if the underlying material is actually child pornography, then you may be in a different situation. All of the hypotheticals in that brief were with materials -- the underlying materials were not child pornography. And I think that's an important distinction, because if you're taking a movie like \"Traffic\" or \"American Beauty,\" which is not child pornography - -",
  "-- and you're simply truthfully promoting it, you have nothing to worry about with this statute. Now, if you took something -- I also think that the Catholic Bishop situation isn't covered, because that is not promoting, presenting and distributing - -",
  "Well, I mean, again -- I mean, if you had a hand held video and the video itself was child pornography, and then you got that on the Internet or otherwise and decided you wanted to promote that, I mean would be covered by the statute. But - -",
  "Here is how I would try to analyze it, Justice Kennedy, which is I would say that there would be an as- applied challenge there because the basic prohibition on child pornography that would apply to the underlying materials, there would be an as-applied exception to that. And therefore, the pandering and the solicitation of that would be equally outside the constitutional - -",
  "I mean there would be another way to try to get at that.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, there might be a way in which the statute could cover it, and it would be, as follows, which basically is if I'm going to portray that as material that is -- and I'm going to portray it only in a way that makes it clear that I have a valid as-applied challenge, then I'm not sure I would be satisfying the objective and the subjective scienter requirements for that statute. Because it would be clear that, although I was presenting it as visual depictions of children who had that happen to them, I was presenting it exclusively for its scientific, artistic, literary value. And, therefore, in a sense, I was building my as-applied challenge into the way I was marketing it. I think you could - -",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, that's exactly right. And that's why I would think the logical way to proceed would be you would find an as-applied exception to the basic prohibition. And then, naturally, that would apply to the pandering provision. I was only sort of suggesting, if pressed, that in some ways it might actually be easier to find a way to get that outside the statute with respect to the pandering and solicitation provision than for the possession for this.",
  "No, that is not correct, Justice Souter. And I would say that that hypothetical is outside the ambit of the statute for two reasons. First of all, I don't think that the movie reviewer is promoting or presenting the underlying materials. They would be out for that reason. I also think they would be out because, when you started applying the objective and the subjective requirements of the statute, you would not find either of them satisfied with respect to that. If I know you're talking about a mainstream movie, and you say it depicts sex with a minor, I'm not going to naturally think that comes within the ambit of the statute, that it is actual child pornography within the meaning of the statute.",
  "With respect, Justice Souter, that's why I think it is important to have both an objective and a subjective requirement. And I think the objective requirement alone would take that out. If I could reserve the remainder of - -",
  "No, I wouldn't think so.",
  "I think we would use a reasonable person. That's why - -",
  "Exactly, and that's why I --",
  "That would be fine, Justice Souter, and if - -",
  "And I would submit that even a 17 year old, non-law student would know that movies depict things that don't actually happen. When they see a murder on screen, that's not actually a murder. And so I think they would understand that that's a movie. It's not child pornography. If I may reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "\"Traffic\" is not child pornography. I understand that the actress was 17 at the time of the film, but we don't think that comes within the ambit of the basic prohibition on child pornography, because we think that simulated sexual activity has to be interpreted with enough subtlety that it doesn't capture that. And that's the position - -",
  "It does. But so does the statute in Ferber. And we don't think that introduced any overbreadth or vagueness that was fatal. This statute here just picks up on that definition. It doesn't add to it. If I may reserve - -",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Overbreadth, as this court has reminded us any number of times, is strong medicine, and that is why, even in the First Amendment context, as-applied challenges remain the basic building blocks of adjudication. Rejection of this overbreadth challenge here does not mean that the courts will not be open to here as-applied challenges going forward. Of course, the Respondent here has no claim that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to him.",
  "Well, I think you could, Justice Kennedy. You could -- I mean the burden here is on the challenger who doesn't say that the statute's unconstitutional as-applied to them to show substantial overbreadth in absolute terms and relative to the statute's legitimate sweep. And it's interesting that neither Respondent nor the court of appeals ever engaged in that latter inquiry. And that's a critical inquiry.",
  "Justice Ginsburg I'm not urging that you get rid of overbreadth doctrine once and for all -- probably be in the government's interest. I am simply saying that if you apply overbreadth analyses, the way it supposed to be applied it's not satisfied here. It's not just enough for you to envision a couple of hypotheticals. It has to be the overbreadth has to be substantial relative to the legitimate sweep of the statute. This Court in Virginia against Hicks said faulted the lower court opinion because it had no analyses whatsoever of valid versus invalid applications. The proportionality aspect of this courts overbreadth jurisprudence was ignored entirely. That could be verbatim the holding of this case. The 11 circuit did engage in that relative analysis. When my brother was asked for empirical evidence about the comparison he said he didn't have any. With all due respect, I think that's fatal to his case.",
  "I think, in the way I would explain that is I didn't think you get -- you found there was such absolute overbreadth that you didn't even reach the proportionality inquiry. In any invent Hicks was decided afterwards, and I think Hicks makes very clear that you have to have both absolute and relative. I would say one last thing, though. This is first and foremost you start with the facts of this case and the facts of this case I think caution against reading the word presents out of the statute or reading it unduly narrowly. The gravamen of the pandering here was not just the offer of pictures of this individual and his daughter, but was his claim that I can post these actual images of child pornography on this group site because I'm for real and I'm not an undercover agent. Now that seems to be within the epicenter of the statute but it's not for profit. It was doing it to establish his bona fide. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Since this Court's decision in Rasul, Petitioners' status has been reviewed by a tribunal modeled on Army Regulation 190-8, and Congress has passed two statutes addressing Petitioners' rights. Petitioners now have access to the Article III courts and have a right to judicial review in the D.C. Circuit. That review encompasses preponderance claims, claims that the military did not follow their own regulations, and statutory and constitutional claims.",
  "Justice Stevens, it is virtually identical. If you look at pages 50 and 51 of our brief, you'll see kind of a side-by-side comparison; and the deviations are ones that, we would submit, enhance the rights of the detainees in this particular circumstance. So they are given a right to a personal representative, which is not something that Army Regulation 190-8 provides. They are specifically provided for the ability to submit documentary evidence.",
  "The personal representative is assigned to the individual by the military.",
  "Well, I don't know about \"unfavorable,\" but I think if there's -- certainly, if there is material intelligence information, he is to provide that information.",
  "No. We are not trying to make the point that the personal representative is a counsel. We're just saying it is something that is provided above and beyond 190-8 in terms of the procedure; and there are other particulars as well, like there is the notice of the charges in the unclassified summaries that are provided. Now, there's the complaint on the other side that the unclassified summaries aren't particular enough, but it is worth noting that that's something that is provided here that's not specified by 190-8.",
  "No, they do not, not under the basic regulations of that. Now, Mr. Waxman correctly indicated that in a particular instance in Vietnam, counsel was provided in 190-8 proceedings, but those are not provided by the basic 190-8 procedures. And, I think it is worth --",
  "Well, I -- the way I would answer that, Mr. Chief Justice, is this: In terms, the DTA does not provide for an order of release. And we would certainly have taken the position that, as a first order, if the D.C. Circuit finds a defect in the CSTR, we think the proper remedy would be to order a remand for a new CSTR. But, certainly, if this Court thinks that the constitutional line is -- essentially necessitates that the D.C. Circuit have the authority to order a release, there is no obstacle to that.",
  "No. And the D.C. Circuit would have available to it the All Writs Act, and the D.C. Circuit, in fact, in its Desmoula decision, which is the decision where the Government has filed an en banc petition -- that protective order that was issued there was done pursuant to the All Writs Act.",
  "The D.C. Circuit hasn't been shy about asserting that authority. And, again, if that's what was required here, they could use that authority to order a release.",
  "\"Uigars.\"",
  "Well, I would disagree, Justice Souter. Let me say a couple of things to that. One is that I think with respect to the Uigars, in particular, there was a problem with ordering release outright. And it is interesting that when Judge Robertson, the same judge, district court judge, who decided the Hamdan case, had before him one of the Uigars in a habeas petition, he recognized that under habeas he couldn't order release. And the problem wasn't any kind of inherent limitation on what he could order in his jurisdiction. There was just a practical problem, which was --",
  "Well, again, Justice Souter, what I would say is simply this: that if what the Constitution requires to make the DTA to be an adequate substitute is the power to order release, there is no obstacle in the text of the DTA to that. And the All Writs Act is available to allow them to order release to protect their jurisdiction under the DTA. And I think that would be a solution to that problem. Now, I think, more broadly, let me -- let me say about the DTA and the MCA, it really does represent the best efforts of the political branches, both political branches, to try to balance the interest in providing the detainees in this admittedly unique situation additional process with the imperative to successfully prosecute the global war on terror.",
  "I'm not sure that he could make that argument.",
  "I'm not sure he can make --",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, let me take it this way, which is, of course, you're getting to the gravamen of their claim, which is that the DTA and the review provided in the D.C. Circuit is not an adequate substitute for habeas review. And I'll start with the assumption for a second, which I hope is right, because it seems that Judge Friendly reached this conclusion -- and it seems to me the right conclusion -- which is that the base line is 1789. And if you compare what these detainees have under the DTA in terms of judicial review to what would have been available to them at common law in 1789, it is not even close. This is the remarkable liberalization of the writ, not some retrenchment or suspension of the writ. These detainees at common law would face not one, but three obstacles, to getting into court to make these claims. The first, of course, is the geographical limits on the reach of the writ. The second, but equally important, is the line of authority that says that the writ was simply unavailable to prisoners of war. And the third problem would be the well-established common law rule that you can't controvert the facts as set forth in the return. So at common law, somebody who took the incredibly, I think, poor strategic call to concede all of their legal arguments away and say only: I have a constitutional claim here to be brought, I don't think they would have gotten into court with that.",
  "Not at all --",
  "Not at all, Justice Souter. And, first of all -- I mean, I take it your -- your principal objection goes to the geographical writ point, because I think that the issues about controverting the facts of the return and the availability of the writs to prisoners of war is something that really wasn't -- had any reason to be before this Court in Rasul.",
  "With respect, Justice Souter --",
  "Well, with respect, Justice Ginsburg and Justice Souter -- because I think it gets to the same point -- we are using \"prisoner of war\" the way that the common law courts use the term \"prisoner of war.\"",
  "No, it --",
  "Well, and -- and -- with respect, the Framers in 1789 had the benefit of the three Spanish soldiers and the Schiever case. They didn't have the benefit of the Geneva Convention.",
  "The writ was denied, Justice Souter.",
  "No, the writ was denied.",
  "They did not have a hearing. The writ was --",
  "Because it said that -- it looked at the pleading in the petition. There was no hearing. It looked at the petition and it said: on their own showing, they are prisoners of war. They are denied the writ.",
  "It didn't even ask for a return, Justice Souter. I mean -- you know, they decided the case --",
  "There is authority for that proposition, Justice Souter. It comes along later in the World War II cases in Britain. The reason there's not authority contemporaneous with the 1759 cases is because these courts are operating with the common-law rule you can't controvert the facts as set forth in a return. So the petitioners in these cases wisely didn't make a factual dispute; they made a legal dispute. And the courts rejected it time and time again. I thought the Spanish sailors and the Shiver -- I'd like to just offer you that the 1941 authority -- because this question of course, over time, by 1941, the British courts have relaxed the rule against controverting the facts of the return, and they addressed this question about what kind of factual inquiry is necessary when the government comes back and says that somebody is an enemy combatant, a prisoner of war, or, under the Emergency Detention Act of 1939, a threat to the realm. And in two cases, Liverridge against Anderson and Green against Anderson, the law lords, in 1941, say that they are not going to look beyond what the government has provided in the return. They're not even, in the Green case, going to ask for an affidavit. So if you're looking --",
  "I think it is a pretty good snapshot of where things were as of 1941.",
  "They were exercising habeas jurisdiction.",
  "I think we do have an answer, Justice Souter. It is in the Liverridge case, because there there's a question of interpreting the Emergency Detention Act. And they basically have a choice. They can interpret it to allow the detention to turn exclusively on the subjective belief of the home secretary, or they can interpret it to reflect an objective standard. And they choose, over the dissent of Lord Atkins, they choose purely subject if standard. So in interpreting a act of Parliament that could have gone either way they interpreted under the common law writ to involve no factual inquiry whatsoever. And the case at common law in 1789 is a fortiori from that because they would not go beyond the facts as set forth in the return. And the only response the Petitioners have to that common law rule is they can point to a couple of cases where the courts were tempted and did accede to the temptation to peek beyond the return in the context of a child custody case or private custody cases. But this is a situation --",
  "As Justice Souter pointed out -- I mean, if you assume that the statute also said any review for that claim should be in the court of appeals, not in the traditional --",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, as I say, I think that if you accept that there would be some deference to the ability to bring statutory claims, I don't know why that deference would be limited to the substance and not to the forum. And Congress here has spoken. It has spoken. The political branch has spoken. They have struck a balance. They've given these detainees better rights and access to administrative and judicial review. Anyone --",
  "The government will certainly take the position that they are not entitled to those things. Presumably the Petitioners will be arguing they are entitled to those things. The answers to those questions will be unclear because the review provided by the DTA and the habeas statute, if it is applied in this context, either way, whatever the vehicle for that judicial review, it will be unprecedented. And there will be difficult questions that will need to be worked out, and I don't understand why --",
  "Not as such, Justice Scalia. Now, of course, we might have an argument as to some of these individuals, that they engaged in unlawful --",
  "Right, and the ones that actually killed somebody would have committed murder.",
  "They don't qualify for prisoner of war status, but just to be clear I think certainly when the British cases are talking about --",
  "They would not qualify for prisoner of war status. They're enemy combatants --",
  "That would be our theory in those cases --",
  "That would be our theory in those cases -- and it is our theory in those cases we've chosen to prosecute --",
  "-- in the military commissions, but there are other individuals with respect to whom we don't have the right kind of evidence in order to go with the full-blown military commission trial, but we still have the option that this Court recognized in Kirin and Hamdi and most particularly in Kirin, not just to try people who are unlawful combatants for their unlawful combatancy, but also to hold them as we would hold anybody else who was captured as preventative detention.",
  "Well, I think if we can show that they were enemy combatants, that's exactly right.",
  "Than? I'm sorry? Broader than what?",
  "Well two things, Justice Souter. One thing is that with respect to the definition that the military commissions -- I'm sorry -- that the C-Cert 7 apply, that is a broader definition, I would quickly add though that with respect to the majority of individuals -- I mean you have the Petitioners from Bosnia that Mr. Waxman represents, but most of these people were seized in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and so the situation is not that different. And obviously we would take the position to the extent you have some concerns about the breadth of the definition, what this Court -- what the plurality said in Hamdi in footnote 1 gets it exactly right. The way to deal with those concerns is in the adjudication of particular cases which can take place under the DTA or can take place in habeas. And again I think the burden --",
  "No, it does not. I mean it's a regulatory --",
  "That was in my points, Justice Souter. So I think that --",
  "Yes, Justice --",
  "It absolutely is. I think Justice Breyer's hypothetical was cleverly crafted, though, to take that off the table.",
  "Well, I think, again, that Justice Breyer's hypothetical, as I understood it, sort of assumed away the adequacy of all of the standards and just said: Putting all of that to one side, I have some other constitutional claim. And I'm just not so sure that habeas ever allowed you to sort of bring every claim that you possibly wanted to; and I think the -- what I -- the way I read this Court's Hamdi decision is what was envisioned on a habeas case in a case where Army Regulation 190-8, which, of course, the plurality cited, was complied with. It was in that case: The habeas petition in court would take that as a starting point, and that you wouldn't necessarily be able to say: Look, it was nice that we had that proceeding, but put that to one side. I have another claim. I don't think the court, even in habeas, would have envisioned that that would go forward.",
  "Absolutely, Justice Kennedy. That would be available to them in the D.C. Circuit.",
  "That is our position. I mean I want to give Justice Breyer's hypothetical its due. I mean there might be claims that you could have brought, hypothetical claims that you could have brought at some level, and that the DTA does --",
  "Absolutely, Justice Stevens. But that question, of course, can be considered by the D.C. Circuit on review, because they're specifically entitled to a preponderance review in the D.C. Circuit. So that's a claim that they clearly could bring. They can also bring the statutory and constitutional claims to the standards and procedures, and they can make claims that the procedures that are set forth in the CSRTs are not provided. And I think, again, if you compare that to what they would have had at the common law, and you ask the question --",
  "It's a preponderance standard, and that's what is set forth in the statute. And, again, that's something where Congress specifically got involved in the CSRTs in a way that I think is different from the Hamdan case and Congress's involvement with the Military Commissions. In the Military Commissions --",
  "That's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice. And that's why, as we say in the brief -- I mean there's a sense in which this is really a facial challenge. I mean, in order for them to prevail with the argument that DTA review is an inadequate substitute, they really have to say that it is inherently an inadequate substitute. That no matter kind of how many times the D.C. Circuit cuts the Petitioner a break --",
  "Well, I mean --",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, I think the delay is going to be relevant to whether or not courts should expedite hearings, and the like. But I don't think it should cloud the basic constitutional question before this Court.",
  "No, of course not. And I think it is worth recognizing that Congress legislated in this area not in year one, and then six years have gone by. Congress legislated with these particular procedures and this level of review in years four and five. And the fact that they didn't immediately take effect, I think, is not an accident. It is a product of the fact that Congress in this area was providing unprecedented review.",
  "And, of course, when you do something unprecedented, new questions will arise.",
  "I think that is our position, Justice Ginsburg. But our position is they want -- they styled something -- they filed something called a habeas petition. Congress subsequently has come in and said: The way we are going to deal with this is we are going to remove jurisdiction for that habeas petition, and we're going to allow you to file a DTA review provision -- a DTA review petition. Now, their argument is that Congress can't force that choice on them because this is an inadequate substitute for habeas. The Suspension Clause applies in Guantanamo; and therefore, the DTA is effectively unconstitutional to the extent it prevents us with proceeding with our habeas petition. Now, there are a variety of ways this Court could reject that claim. It seems to me that the most straightforward way, though, is to simply ask the question: If the level of review provided by the DTA in the DTA petition were provided by statute in 1789 or even 1941, for that matter, would it have been seen as a liberalization of the writ, or a contraction and suspension of the writ? And I think it is very, very clear that if this statute had passed, if this kind of review was provided in 1789 or in 1941, it would have been greeted as a remarkable -- remarkable liberalization of the writ as it had then been understood. And I think we are in the situation where these individuals, for the first time, are really allowed this kind of access to the court system. And when that happens, there are going to be difficult questions. We have difficult questions about what the record on review is. We have difficult questions about the extent to which classified information should come in. But all of those difficult questions are going to be waiting for us if we go back to the habeas courts, because the same kind of issues --",
  "I mean, obviously lower courts take anything this Court says very, very seriously. So, if this Court makes it clear --",
  "Well, I mean -- let me -- if I could, I would answer it as to what this Court should say about what the D.C. Circuit should do on DTA review. I prefer to discuss the opinion where we win rather than the opinion where we lose. As to that opinion, the courts -- the lower courts should be instructed to with due cognizance for the fact these individuals have been detained six years and this is the process that has been provided in order to decide whether or not that continuing custody is lawful, they should expedite this to the greatest extent possible.",
  "With respect if you win -- if we win, you still write an opinion saying that we win, and that opinion can still say everything --",
  "You can certainly affirm on alternative grounds.",
  "I don't think that's right, Justice Souter. There is active litigation going on in the D.C. Circuit over basically these questions and how this litigation is going to take place. And if this Court in affirming on -- begrudgingly affirming and directing the D.C. Circuit to move with all appropriate dispatch, that's going to be read just as carefully and taken just as seriously if it's an affirmance than if it's a vacate or a reversal.",
  "That's exactly right. That's exactly right.",
  "They hadn't decided that, Justice Souter. That might have been a problem back in Rasul. But now whatever the answer to the question of whether the Constitution provides rights in Guantanamo, they have rights. They have the statutory right to preponderance review. They have a statutory right to have the military follow its own procedures. And they have lots of arguments in the lower courts trying to take advantage of those rights that they have. So there will be a meaningful procedure in the D.C. Circuit --",
  "Well, Justice Souter, I'm not sure that this Court -- I understand your question, I believe, which is that the D.C. Circuit, I think, almost unavoidably reading this Court's Rasul decision and reading it as a statutory rather than a constitutional holding, has stuck with its circuit precedent and said that there aren't constitutional rights here. That is going to be true unless this Court reverses it in habeas or in the DTA review. It would seem particularly strange that if that's the real problem that this Court would somehow decide, well, you know, we really think the DTA is an adequate substitute, but the only way we can correct this other mistake, in our view, that the D.C. Circuit is laboring under is to rule against the government.",
  "No. I think that's the issue before this Court now. And this Court, for example --",
  "I'm sorry, Justice Souter, I may have misspoke.",
  "The interesting questions that I think are left on the remand, no matter what, are issues about whether or not based on the Abraham declaration that the military followed their own procedures for assembling the record below, or whether the military followed its own procedures for providing exculpatory evidence. Those are all questions that aren't questions that require the answer to the question of whether Eisentrager is still good law --",
  "I mean --",
  "I think that's right, Justice Ginsburg. I want to be clear that my position is that an alternative ground for affirmance, which would allow this Court to address some of those questions, is that the D.C. Circuit was right to say that the DTA review, that the habeas petition should be dismissed. The reason they were right is because the DTA is an adequate substitute for habeas.",
  "I think that's a fair observation, but obviously this Court --",
  "In the context -- I mean this has been fully briefed in, and in the context of where the Court uses an alternative ground for affirmance, it would not be a novel situation, I don't think.",
  "I think that's a fair point, Justice Stevens, though I would say that really their reasoning encapsulates one of the three reasons why at common law they were right.",
  "Oh, that's right, Justice Stevens, but in fairness, in those situations you were dealing with sort of substitutes for core habeas under situations where they're was no dispute that there was a robust right to habeas at common law, and so here you first deal with the situation of -- all right, the baseline is, as Judge Friendly suggests, 1789, is this an adequate substitute? And that even if somehow -- and I don't know how you get past that -- then you I think still might ask the question that this Court asked in the Felker case, which is, you know, giving some deference to Congress's ability to shape the scope of the writ, is there a problem here? I think we would point the Court to Felker.",
  "That is part of our point.",
  "And we would say, though --",
  "We would start with that proposition, but I think this isn't a case where it's just 1789 versus today because as I read this -- -",
  "It's a hard question for me to answer -- -",
  "Well, no, but I mean the question is, you know, in a different case, sure, there would be a different habeas. But we don't know sort of the answer as to what habeas looks like in the context of enemy combatants detained in a place like Guantanamo, and we suggest, based on our best reading of Hamdi that, if there was habeas jurisdiction now, that the proceeding that would unfold would not be the plenary habeas that is envisioned by Petitioners but would be a much more narrowly circumscribed habeas. I would also point out that, again, it's not just --",
  "I think that's right. I would say, though, that our only baseline is not 1789 because, as we read this Court's decision in Rasul, Rasul is based on the predicate that until 1973 and Braden's overruling of Ahrens, that the habeas statute would not have gone to Guantanamo. And unless this Court is willing to say that there was an inchoate Suspension Clause violation until 1973 when Braden comes along, it seems like the tradition in this country too, based on the immediate custodian rule and the territorial jurisdiction of the courts, was that habeas in Guantanamo is a novelty. It's -- 1973 at best. If I could finish with just bringing the Court's attention to one thing. This is in an amicus brief that is in support of us, the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation brief. But there's sufficiently little precedence for the Court to rely on, and I want the Court to have this: The Schiever case, which is one of the prisoner-of-war cases. There's not -- in the Rasul case, Justice Stevens, and the parties, we both cited to volume 97 of English Reporter and the report of the case by Burrow -- there is in the English Reports an alternative report of that case, from Kenyon. And the report of that case which is 96 English Reports 1249 is actually longer on the law, shorter on the facts, but longer on the law than the report by Lord Burrow. So I wanted the court to have that available to them.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Any system of voting that involves registrations or precincts will necessarily require some mechanism for ascertaining a voter's identity. Accordingly Petitioners cannot take issue that the constitutionality of some mechanism for ascertaining voter ID. And I take it from today's argument that they would concede the constitutionality of a signature match requirement. Likewise, nobody can really dispute the proposition that a government-issued photo ID is an awfully good way of verifying someone's identity. So the dispute really boils down to, in a system where the States can legitimately ask for some kind of basis to ascertain ID, can they insist on a particularly good one, the photo ID? And we would suggest that there's nothing in the First or Fourteenth Amendments that precludes that from happening. Now, with respect to the nature of this challenge, I think one thing that's very evident from the questions is this was a challenge that was brought to the statute on its face and was brought before there was any enforcement of the statute or any significant enforcement of the statute. Now, I would respectfully suggest that there's a better way to test the constitutionality of these statutes.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I mean I can understand that you're concerned with that aspect of the statute and the fact that you can't execute an indigency affidavit in the polling place. I don't know why that's a basis for a facial challenge though. In particular, I think if you look at the Plaintiffs, the individual members, if they are members of the Indiana party that have been identified, they've certainly identified people who do not have the ID currently. I'm not sure that they were specific as to whether they were indigent or not. I'm not sure the individuals, the nine individuals, were really parsed out that way. And I would think the far better way to go about dealing with that issue is to take as a starting point -- I mean you pointed out that there were 32 provisional ballots cast in the Marion County election. Now, I gather from the State that's something like 0.02 percent of the ballots cast. So it suggests that this is not a monumental problem, but those 32 provisional ballots seem to me to be 32 possible plaintiffs with a much more concrete case - -",
  "-- than anything we have before us.",
  "Sure.",
  "And, Justice Ginsburg, I mean I see your concern, and I think if we had an as-applied challenge that wasn't this kind of grab bag challenge that looks at all the various different classes of people that might be adversely affected, if we had a challenge that focused on that particular issue, I would imagine -- I don't know for sure -- I would imagine that the State would probably put on some evidence that says, look, there's a reason we did it that way; we piggybacked on the general provisional ballot provisions and what we decided is that, if we had people executing indigency affidavits at the polling place, it would add to the lines as the the polls.",
  "But with respect, Justice Souter, I mean that's not the way this challenge proceeded. I mean there was a challenge to everything under the sun, to the whole sort of -- this statute ab initio, and it wasn't something that really put the State on notice that that was the nub of the dispute and would put evidence in the record that might join the issue. And again I would say, of course, if there were that kind of as-applied challenge, one of the virtues of it would be that the remedy at the end of the day would not be to strike the statute down on its face, but it would be an injunction consistent with the teaching of this Court in Nayot that said, look, you need to have -- you need to be enjoined to offer the affidavits at the polling place - -",
  "-- because - -",
  "Well, I don't think so. I mean, at this point, like I said -- I mean we have these 32 potential plaintiffs.",
  "What's that?",
  "Well, if the claim could be brought in sufficient time, I suppose it would.",
  "Sure.",
  "But, conversely, nowhere is it -- nowhere is it a rational assumption that all 32 of these individuals has a great claim. It may be that some of them are people who just forgot their ID - -",
  "-- and for those people I don't think they have much of a claim.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I mean I think there's a rationale justification for that which is that, you know, if -- especially if there are only a handful of these people, is do you really want to instruct every poll worker at every precinct on how to deal with this unusual situation or do you want to say, you know, that's sort of an outlying situation, let's instruct one poll worker at the county elections office how to deal with it? Now, at the end of the day, you may not be persuaded that that's the way to do it. I think that's a reasonable argument, but an as-applied challenge could focus like a laser beam on those particular voters and those challenges. You could have particular indigent voters in front of you. And it seems to me that that's the preferable way to adjudicate this kind of claims, and I think what this Court could do is this Court could reject the facial challenge that is before it here that leave open the possibility of that as-applied challenge, or one could certainly imagine a veteran who has a Federal photo ID without an expiration date who comes into court and says, look, it's irrational to make me go get a different form of ID. That as-applied challenge --",
  "I don't see any reason why they couldn't be. I mean it might depend a little bit on the nature of the challenge.",
  "That is true, and there is a provision for judicial review under Indiana law, of the provisional ballots, if there's an ongoing dispute. But I also take the point that some of this could be taken care of well in advance of the election, which is actually, I think, a very healthy way to deal with election disputes. And so my hypothetical veteran with the card, he has got the card in his wallet right now, or her wallet right now. They can go get - -",
  "You know, it may be, Justice Stevens, that it's easier to get somebody to help you out with the Federal case than it is with the second -- with the second affidavit. I don't know. I mean, you know, I think if you look around where there have been these laws - -",
  "Yes. I think, if you look where there have been these laws, there have been -- the one observed phenomenon definitely is litigation. So I do think that these claims will be brought. I just really think that in choosing the mode of litigation, you know, Justice Kennedy for the Court in the partial-birth case said that as-applied challenges are the basic building block of adjudication. And this seems like a particularly appropriate case to apply that lesson, because I can imagine there - -",
  "I think it's a close question, Mr. Chief Justice. I would say that I think there is standing. I think the standing that exists here is the standing to represent the nine or so individuals that are addressed specifically on pages 49a and 51a of the district court opinion. Those are individuals who do not have photo IDs. I think that as to the membership issue, boy, if the Indiana Democratic Party has any members, its probably these individuals, because they are poll workers and active in the parties. And what I would say about those individuals, though, is that it is telling that the only individuals they have been able to identify who don't have photo IDs also happen to be elderly individuals who can, by right, vote by absentee ballot. Now, that's not to say -- and I would -- I would concede there is a legally protected interest in voting in person sufficient to cross the Article III threshold. But I think, when you are looking for the real world impact, it is telling that the people they have been able to identify do have a ready mechanism available to them.",
  "May I answer the question? You know, I don't think that's relevant in this -- I would hate to think that a party line vote would necessarily give the other party standing as a general rule. I don't think that you would adopt that, and this goes out of the record, of course, to a recent study. But the one study that's been done actually shows that the Democratic Party did well in the 2006 elections, and turnout went up a little bit.",
  "Well, again, if I could answer, I mean I would just say that, you know, if this was a cleverly designed mechanism by the Republican Party to disadvantage the Democratic Party, at least in 2006 it looks like it went pretty far awry from their perspective.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has already inferred a private cause of action under section 1981. So the question before the Court now is simply the scope of the basic guarantee in section 1981 and particularly whether it prohibits retaliation against someone who exercised their undoubted right to complain about racial discrimination in a contractual process.",
  "No, Justice Scalia, we're not asking to you to go back to the bad old days. But I think it's important to recognize that we are simply asking you to interpret the scope of the cause of action you've already inferred. And I think that's consistent with the way this Court has approached 1981 cases. Patterson would be a great example. This Court in Patterson didn't say, are we going to infer a new cause of action for harassment? No. This Court interpreted the basic prohibition of 1981 and said it didn't cover harassment. We think if you interpret the basic prohibitions in 1981, it covers retaliation.",
  "Patterson was 1989. I don't think anybody thinks Patterson was the bad old days.",
  "The bad old days ended when you got on the Court, Mr. Justice Scalia.",
  "Now, I think the considerations of precedent as well speak very loudly here. And Justice Alito asked the question, what would cause the Court to interpret 1981 and 1982 differently? And the answer is absolutely nothing. These are two - - these aren't just two closely related statutes that were codified together.",
  "No. We're asking to you interpret the cause of action that exists - -",
  "-- to include retaliation.",
  "Okay, Justice Kennedy. I think part of the disconnect may be, if I could try to address this, is there are two reasons you might think that retaliation isn't covered. One reason you might think retaliation isn't covered is because it's not discrimination on the basis of race. The other reason that you might think retaliation is not covered and the reason that the court of appeals, post-Patterson, pre-1991, thought that retaliation wasn't covered was simply that it was post-formation conduct. And as to that, what is clear is that 1981(b) provides a textual answer to that. A - -",
  "Well -- but neither is the word \"harassment,\" Justice Kennedy. Neither, frankly, is the words \"discrimination on the basis of race.\"",
  "Is - -",
  "Sure, but I don't think there's any doubt since Mr. Humphries was fired that he no longer enjoys the benefits and privileges of his contractual relationship. They were clearly interfered with. His rights under 1981 are clearly implicated. It would seem to me the only argument that he's not covered is that he was retaliated -- he was fired, he lost his contractual relationships not because he was African-American - -",
  "-- but he claimed -- -",
  "We were making a slightly different point, Justice Kennedy, which is we think this case is a fortiori from the Jackson case in a couple of respects. First and foremost, we think that a 1982 precedent, if it governs Title IX, ought to a fortiorari govern 1981. But the second way we think this case is a fortiori from Jackson is that the same textual obstacles are not present here that the Jackson -- that the Jackson dissenters identified. You know, the Jackson dissenters didn't say that retaliation isn't a form of discrimination. They said it's not discrimination on the basis of sex. And if you look at the text of 1981(a), (b), and (c), you find that it's actually more capacious language, and you don't have the same problem. It doesn't say \"discrimination on the basis of race.\" Now, to be sure, we're not saying that 1981 isn't a race statute; of course it is. But those exact words don't appear and don't provide a stumbling block. And if you look at the form that 1981 takes, it doesn't take the form of an express prohibition of discrimination on the basis of race; it actually textually takes the form of a guarantee of equal treatment. And it seems to me that a guarantee of equal treatment quite naturally is violated not just by the basic discrimination but is also violated by retaliating --",
  "-- against someone for exercising their rights.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, you're right. Judge Easterbrook's hypothetical of the equal opportunity retaliator I think as a theoretical matter would not be covered by this statute. But of course I think it's only an interesting theoretical possibility, because I rather doubt that employer would have many employees in practice. I mean, in practice - -",
  "Well, I -- I actually do think that's unusual, and I do think if an employer -- I mean, just in looking at the cases that are actually decided, you don't see that as the nondiscriminatory defense that many employers resort to. And I think as a practical matter that's just not the position that they're taking. And I think as a practical matter you're going to see that those are covered by the statute. You -- Mr. Chief Justice, you also asked about stare decisis and which cases that this Court should point to. I think there are a couple reasons why Sullivan is the precedent that this Court should follow in this case. First of all, this Court followed it in a less analogous context just a few terms ago in Jackson. Second, this Court has a whole line of cases, including Tillman and Runyon, that treat 1982 cases as binding authority for section 1981 purposes. So if this Court were to turn its back on Sullivan, I think it would also be turning its back on cases like - -",
  "It -- I mean, it's hard to say. I mean, you know, Jackson was just three terms ago, Mr. Chief Justice, so -- and I don't know how Jackson would have been decided without the benefit of Sullivan. I certainly think that the current Court would be a tougher Court to make the arguments that carried the day in Sullivan than the Court at the time, but - -",
  "And I think that's a very fair point, Justice Souter. And I guess I would say that, just to amplify something my co-counsel said, I really do think -- I mean, the Jackson Court took the - - the Sullivan case to be something other than a third-party standing case and to be a case about retaliation. I really think that that is the correct reading of the opinion. If you look at the critical paragraph on page - -",
  "Of both, but more to the point, of Sullivan. If you go to page 237 of the Sullivan opinion, after the Court's disposed of Freeman's claim the whole discussion of Sullivan's claim is prefaced with the observation \"we turn now to Sullivan's claim for\" expulsion -- \"for advocacy on Freeman's behalf.\"",
  "But, Justice Kennedy, if that were the only claim that Sullivan could bring, i.e., if he could only bring the second half of the leasehold claim that Freeman had, I would agree with your reading of Sullivan. But what the Court is focused on is not Sullivan's ability to sue for his inability to sell to Freeman. They allow him to sue because he was expelled from the property owner's association after the fact. Now, why was he expelled from the property owner's association? Not because of his race; but because he had advocated on Freeman's behalf. The point about Sullivan getting to sue for his expulsion from - -",
  "I agree with that, but I think what's critical is that he was allowed to recover not just for that injury but for his expulsion from the property owner's association. And that's not an injury that was an obvious injury to Freeman at all. But more to the point, it doesn't really matter if Freeman and Sullivan can sue for that or just Sullivan. The point is somebody could sue for Sullivan's expulsion from the property owner's association. And I don't understand how that's anything other than a retaliation holding. And as I said, this Court on a number of occasions has given 1982 holdings even stare decisis effect, using those words in Runyon in the 1981 context. And so I think that's also something that this Court would have to confront.",
  "When - -",
  "I think you have to apply its reasoning. That would be consistent with decisions like Runyon and Tillman that say that you apply 1982 cases and 1981. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Second Amendment to the Constitution, as its text indicates, guarantees an individual right that does not depend on eligibility for or service in the militia.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Stevens, because we don't take the position that the preamble plays no role in interpreting the amendment. And we would point to this court's decision in Miller, for example, as an example of where the preamble can play a role in determining the scope - -",
  "Oh, I suppose it probably does define two rights that are closely related.",
  "I think that's the better view, and a number of State courts that have interpreted analogous provisions have distinguished between the two rights and looked at them differently. And, obviously, the term \"keep\" is a word that I think is something of an embarrassment for an effort to try to imbue every term in the operative text with an exclusively military connotation because that is not one that really has an exclusive military connotation. As Justice Scalia pointed out, \"keep\" was precisely the word that authorities used in statutes designed specifically to disarm individuals.",
  "Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg, and just -- I mean, to give you a clear example, we would take the position that the kind of plastic guns or guns that are specifically designed to evade metal detectors that are prohibited by Federal law are not \"arms\" within the meaning of the Second Amendment and are not protected at all. And that would be the way we would say that you should analyze that provision of Federal law, as those are not even arms within the provisions of the Second Amendment. I think to make the same argument about machine guns would be a much more difficult argument, to say the least, given that they are the standard-issue weapon for today's armed forces and the State-organized militia.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, I wouldn't say that it has no application there. As I say, I think the term \"arms,\" especially if Miller is going to continue to be the law, is influenced by the preamble. But the way we would look at it - -",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, we would analyze it this way, which is we would say that probably the thing that was foremost in the framers' minds was a concern that the militia not be disarmed such that it would be maintained as a viable option to the standing army. But especially when you remember, as Justice Alito pointed out, that the Constitution in Article I, Section 8, clauses 15 and 16, the militia clauses, as unamended, gave the Federal power -- the Federal authorities virtually plenary authority to deal with the organization and regulation of the militia. The most obvious way that you could protect the militia - -",
  "Except for that which is reserved in - -",
  "Yes -- no, absolutely. There is something reserved in clause 16. But let me just say, if the Second Amendment had the meaning that the District of Columbia ascribes to it, one would certainly think that James Madison, when he proposed the Second Amendment would have proposed it as an amendment to Article I, Section 8, clause 16. He didn't. He proposed it as an amendment to Article I, Section 9, which encapsulates the individual rights to be free from bills of retainder and ex post facto clauses.",
  "I think -- I think Pennsylvania and Vermont are the ones that most obviously protected.",
  "Well, I don't know about quite clearly. The textual indication in the State amendments that probably most obviously goes in the other direction is the phrase \"keep and bear arms for the common defense.\" And, of course, there was a proposal during the debate over the Second Amendment to add exactly those words to the Second Amendment, and that proposal was defeated, which does - -",
  "I'm sorry, Justice Stevens. Which aspect of that did you have in mind?",
  "Oh, but I don't think that ever made it to the floor of the House or the Senate that I'm aware of. And I think that this happened at the actual Senate floor. There was a proposal to add the words \"in the common defense,\" and that was rejected. I mean, but - -",
  "I do, Justice Kennedy, and I think in that regard it is telling that -- I mean, there are a variety of provisions in our Bill of Rights that were borrowed from the English Bill of Rights. Two very principal ones are the right to petition the government and the right to keep and bear arms. I don't think it's an accident - -",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think you could say the same thing for every provision of the English Bill of Rights. And obviously, when those were translated over to our system you had to make adjustment for - -",
  "That's exactly right, Justice Souter. And the way I counted it, I only found three provisions in the English Bill of Rights that had a comparable reference to Parliament.",
  "Again, that is also true and is also relatively unique to this amendment. And if I get to the point in the argument where I talk about why we think that something less than strict scrutiny is appropriate, I think I would point precisely to those elements of the English Bill of Rights as being relevant. But what I was about to say is I think what is highly relevant in considering the threshold question of whether there's an individual right here at all is that the parallel provisions in the English Bill of Rights that were borrowed over included the right to petition and the right to keep and bear arms. Both of those appear with specific parallel references to the people. They are both rights that are given to the people. And as this Court has made clear in Verdugo-Urquidez, that's a reference that appears throughout the Bill of Rights as a reference to the entire citizenry.",
  "The way I would read it, Justice Souter, is that \"keep\" is really talking about private possession in the home. And the way that I would look at it is in order to exercise, for example, an opportunity to hunt, that you would need to bear the arms as well. And I would point you -- I think it's a useful point - -",
  "I would say that and so would Madison and so would Jefferson, I would submit. They use - -",
  "Well, I will grant you this, that \"bear arms\" in its unmodified form is most naturally understood to have a military context. But I think the burden of the argument on the other side is to make it have an exclusively military context. And as a number of the briefs have pointed out, that's not borne out by the framing sources. In one place, although it's not bearing arms, it's bearing a gun, I think it's highly relevant that Madison and Jefferson with respect to this hunting bill that Jefferson wrote and Madison proposed, specifically used in the hunting context the phrase \"bear a gun,\" and so I do think in that context - -",
  "And again, I think various phrases were, were used. I also think that some of the disarmament provisions specifically used the word \"keep.\" And so I think there is some independent meaning there, which is one point. And then I do think that, even in the context of bearing arms, I will grant you that \"arms\" has a military connotation and I think Miller would certainly support that, but I don't think it's an exclusively military connotation.",
  "Oh, absolutely. And I grant you if this, if the Second Amendment said \"keep and bear arms for the common defense\" this would be a different case. But - -",
  "Well, I mean it's -- it's my friends from the District that are emphasizing that no word in the Constitution is surplusage. So I would say that in a context like this you might want to focus both on \"keep\" and on \"bear arms.\"",
  "Okay. I would like to talk about the standard and my light is indeed on, so let me do that. I think there are several reasons why a standard as we suggest in our brief rather than strict scrutiny is an appropriate standard to be applied in evaluating these laws. I think first and foremost, as our colloquy earlier indicated, there is -- the right to bear arms was a preexisting right. The Second Amendment talks about \"the right to bear arms,\" not just \"a right to bear arms.\" And that preexisting always coexisted with reasonable regulations of firearms. And as you pointed out, Justice Souter, to be sure when you're making the translation from the English Bill of Rights you always have to deal with parliamentary supremacy. But it is very striking that, as Justice Stevens said, the right was conditioned on the conditions, which I think meant what class you were, and also subject expressly to the Parliament, the laws of Parliament.",
  "Justice Scalia, let me make two related points. One, even in the First Amendment context, this Court has recognized -- and I point you to the Court's opinion in Robertson against Baldwin, which makes this point as to both the First and the Second Amendment. This Court has recognized that there are certain pre-existing exceptions that are so well established that you don't really even view them as Second Amendment or First Amendment infringement.",
  "Like libel, and I would say like laws barring felons from possessing handguns. I don't think - -",
  "Well, that gets to the self-defense component and I don't know that I ever got a chance to fully answer your question on that, Justice Kennedy, which is we would say, notwithstanding the fact that the preamble makes it clear that the preeminent motive was related to ensuring that the militia remained a viable option vis-a-vis the standing army, the operative text is not so limited. And I think in that regard it's worth emphasizing that the framers knew exactly how to condition a right on militia service, because they did it with respect to the grand jury clause, and they didn't do it with respect to the Second Amendment.",
  "Well, Justice Alito, let me answer the question in two parts if I can, because I think the analysis of the trigger lock provision may well be different than the analysis of the other provisions. With respect to the trigger lock provision, we think that there is a substantial argument that once this Court clarifies what the constitutional standard is, that there ought to be an opportunity for the District of Columbia to urge its construction, which would allow for a relatively robust self-defense exception to the trigger lock provision. And this Court could very well, applying Ashwan to prevent - - principles allow for that kind of - -",
  "If that's going to be the exception, it could clearly be inadequate. And I think that -- I mean the District of Columbia can speak to this, but it seems to me that if, for example, the police were executing a warrant at evening and had cause for doing it at evening and saw somebody with a loaded gun on their night stand, no children present without a trigger lock, it seems to me that that would be a good test case to decide whether or not their construction would provide for an exception to the trigger lock provision in that case.",
  "If it did, I think then the statute might well be constitutional. If it didn't, in my view, it probably wouldn't be.",
  "In our view it makes a world of difference, Justice Ginsburg, because we certainly take the position, as we have since consistently since 2001, that the Federal firearm statutes can be defended as constitutional, and that would be consistent with this kind of intermediate scrutiny standard that we propose. If you apply strict scrutiny, I think that the result would be quite different, unfortunately.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, let me say a couple of things about that, which is to say that if this Court were to decide this case and make conclusively clear that it really was focused very narrowly on this case and it was in some respects applying a sui generis test, we think that would be an improvement over the court of appeals opinion, which is subject to more than one reading, but as Justice Ginsburg's question just said, it's certainly susceptible to a reading that it embodies strict scrutiny. In fact - -",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I think our principal concern based on the parts of the court of appeals opinion that seemed to adopt a very categorical rule were with respect to machine guns, because I do think that it is difficult -- I don't want to foreclose the possibility of the Government, Federal Government making the argument some day -- but I think it is more than a little difficult to say that the one arm that's not protected by the Second Amendment is that which is the standard issue armament for the National Guard, and that's what the machine gun is.",
  "I think, Mr. Chief Justice, why one might worry about that is one might read the language of page 53a of the opinion as reproduced in the petition appendix that says once it is an arm, then it is not open to the District to ban it. Now, it seems to me that the District is not strictly a complete ban because it exempts pre-1976 handguns. The Federal ban on machine guns is not, strictly speaking, a ban, because it exempts pre - - pre-law machine guns, and there is something like 160,000 of those.",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, I -- I hope that you read it that way. But I would also say that I think that whatever the definition that the lower court opinion employed, I do think it's going to be difficult over time to sustain the notion -- I mean, the Court of Appeals also talked about lineal descendants. And it does seem to me that, you know, just as this Court would apply the Fourth Amendment to something like heat imagery, I don't see why this Court wouldn't allow the Second Amendment to have the same kind of scope, and then I do think that reasonably machine guns come within the term \"arms.\" Now, if this Court wants to say that they don't -- I mean -- I mean -- we'd obviously welcome that in our -- in our obligation to defend the constitutionality of acts of Congress. The one other thing I would say is that this is an opinion that is susceptible of different readings. It's interesting that Respondents' amici have different characterizations of it. The Goldwater Institute calls it strict scrutiny; the State of Texas calls it reasonable -- reasonableness review.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Appellant's claim here is an odd sort of First Amendment complaint. He does not suggest that Section 319 has limited his own spending at all. In fact, he has twice spent a substantial amount of his own money in excess of the statutory triggers.",
  "Well -- and we can talk about that as well, but I think it's worth recognizing that his own spending is unlimited both in theory and in fact. And, if anything, he has announced his intent this next time around to spend even more of his own money. And the other thing that I think is relevant is his experience is not atypical in this regard.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia --",
  "Well, I don't think in any way it's a penalty. And I think in order to understand it as a penalty you have to accept the proposition that you start out with a constitutional entitlement to speak freely without the opportunity for the other side to respond, and I don't think the Constitution recognizes this. This isn't a context where they forced the Appellant to pay for the other side's speech, as in Tornillo, or carry the speech, as in PG&E. And I don't think it's fair to look at the record here and suggest that what Congress was trying to do here was actually limit or deter self-financing.",
  "Well, I think 2X would be constitutional. And I think most people would be surprised if Congress passed the statute that gave more generous contribution limits to challengers, but I think it would be a perfectly appropriate regime because it would recognize that incumbents have certainly built-in advantages such that the relatively low hard money contribution caps have a greater influence, greater impact on a --",
  "Justice Scalia, I think there's an important distinction that was suggested in one of Justice Alito's question, between the government trying to level the playing field in the abstract and the government looking out, not at the eloquence of candidates, but at its own campaign finance regime after this Court's decision and recognizing that, look, the differential --",
  "Well, again, Justice Scalia, though, you start with the anti-corruption rationale that underlies the hard money contribution caps. And what Congress has recognized is that after Buckley and after this Court said that a candidate's ability to self-finance is unlimited, it's recognized that in a subset of elections where somebody is going to spend an awful lot of their own money to self-finance, the ordinary hard money contribution caps are going to have a potentially skewing effect.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, what I would say is, if you analogize to a system where Congress decided that because of the advantage that incumbents have, there is a greater scope for coordination of the party with the challengers, I would certainly be here defending that statute. I would like to make clear, though, Justice Kennedy, in fairness, that this focus on the coordinated expenditures of the parties has really not been the focus of Appellant's challenge in this case.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, let me say two things about the fact that this was not the gravamen of the challenge here, because one reason I think that's clear is if you look at the record here, at the point that the record closed in this case no party had taken advantage of that coordinated expenditures provision.",
  "I'm saying that this record would not allow you to invalidate the statute on that ground. The record at the time that it closed should -- there was no time that a party had taken advantage of that. Now, I understand that it's outside the record, but I understand after the record closed there were some coordinated expenditures. But another thing I would certainly want to know before I considered that challenge, Justice Kennedy, is whether this particular Appellant had coordinated expenditures from his own party up to the limit, because we know as a general matter that there is -- parties will fund different candidates differently or may fund --",
  "-- some and not others.",
  "Well, again, Justice Kennedy, in fairness, though, I mean, one would expect if that were the nature of the claim, that at a minimum we would know two facts that I don't know, aren't in the record. One is whether or not his candidate reached the cap from his party's coordinated expenditures, because if he didn't I don't see why that individual would have standing.",
  "Well, I am defending --",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, I always thought it was harder to bring a facial challenge, not easier to bring a facial challenge. And I realized that we relaxed the normal rules about as-applied challenges in the First Amendment context, but I think there has to be a limit to that, too. And I think in a case where we don't know the fundamental facts that at least I'd want to know before even evaluating that challenge, I think it would be bad for us to invalidate the statute, it would be wrong for us to invalidate the statute on those grounds. And I think I would still be here defending it. --",
  "But I don't think mere theoretical possibility is enough, even in the First Amendment context. And I still think you ask the question: Does this individual even have standing to bring the First Amendment challenge? And I would think an element of standing to bring the First Amendment challenge Justice Kennedy has in mind would be a candidate who, first of all, his opposing candidate took substantial amounts of excess contributions. But at a bare minimum, I would think that the plaintiff would have to say that, look, I took up to the cap of the coordinated contributions from my party and I would have loved to have gotten more, the party was willing to give me more, but I wasn't able --",
  "With respect, Justice Scalia, there is two things. There is whether you can bring a facial challenge or not and there's when you can you bring it. And I think if you go in and allege that all of those things are likely, then you probably have standing at the outset. But those allegations weren't made here. The focus of this case has always been on the contribution levels and the contribution provisions of this statute. At the end of the day the analysis is quite similar, so I'm not --",
  "I think all that's right, Justice Stevens. And as you suggest, it's an unlikely challenge to be brought because often times the self-financer is advertising his independence from party and contributors here.",
  "No, I don't think that's true. But I think that they do have different ways of raising the funds necessary to mount their campaigns. And I think -- to get back to the focus of this, I think all that the Court needs to recognize is that the Buckley decision itself has created a potential anomaly, because if you want to think about self-financing, you can think about it as being the ultimate form of soft money, because the Constitution itself precludes Congress from limiting the amount of self-funding.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there are other contexts within the election area where there are comparable disclosure requirements. And I think I would point you to the McConnell case and the fact that this Court approved a 24-hour disclosure requirement for electioneering communications.",
  "Well, I mean, I'm not -- I'm not sure that's right in a sense that these are disclosure requirements that apply across the board. The timing is triggered particularly by a candidate's contribution to their own campaign. So that's the way in which they're different. But I think it's worth focusing on that, because I actually think the constitutional issues that are implicated by a disclosure of a candidate's contribution to his or her own campaign are actually less significant than generally is true of campaign finance disclosure, because what this Court talked about in Buckley as the primary concern in the disclosure context was the associational rights that are reflected when somebody contributes to a candidate or an organization makes an electioneering communication on behalf of a candidate. I think those associational interests are obviously not implicated when all you're forcing someone to disclose is the amount that they spent on their own campaign.",
  "No. I would think the Constitution would be more concerned about the disclosing the associational link because there is more than one constitutional interest at issue. And I think if you look at this as a whole there really isn't a differential regime. Every electioneering communication from the first $10,000 has to be disclosed. If anything, the complaint should be the electioneering communication should come in here complaining about the fact that these self-financing candidates get a free pass for the first $350,000 of their financing, before the disclosure requirements kick in. So I mean, I really think this is a relatively modest disclosure provision and it arises in a context where there aren't associational interests.",
  "But Justice Ginsburg, I think that's the same in the electioneering communications, which is it's triggered for $10,000 but I think it continues to be triggered. Now, it isn't the nature of the challenge, so I may be wrong about that, but I think that's the way that that works. In any event, I think it's a fair point here that the fact that you trigger additional disclosures with each $10,000 I think is useful in informing the electorate; but I also think it's fair to say is necessary in order for the substantive provisions of the statute to operate, because what they want to do is they want to enable as a self-financed candidate spends additional money as the election date approaches, they want to put the opponent, if they have otherwise reached the cap of what they can raise in additional funds in a position to continue to raise additional funds.",
  "I think it would be constitutional, Mr. Chief Justice. I think it's reacting to the same basic phenomenon, which is one aspect of the campaign finance regime gives self- financers an ability to spend a tremendous amount of money and creates a potential disparity. What creates the disparity is the fact that you have relatively low hard money contribution caps, and Congress recognized --",
  "No, Justice Scalia, and again I think there's an important distinction between trying to level the playing field in every respect --",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I mean, in an odd way I think this principle is actually implicit in the plurality opinion against -- in Randall v. Sorrell. I know you didn't join that opinion, but in that opinion this Court said, the plurality said, that contribution limits can in some ways be too low because if they're too low they preclude the ability for somebody to raise enough money and that exaggerates the advantages that incumbents have. And I think Congress really made an analogous judgment here. I'm not suggesting it was constitutionally compelled, but they made an analogous judgment, which is there is more than one source of advantage; one source of advantage is the self-financing candidate's ability to spend unlimited amounts of their own money. They respected the fact that that's a constitutional entitlement, but they said it's not that in the abstract that's the problem; it's the combination of unlimited self-financing and relatively low hard money contribution caps --",
  "-- and they relaxed the one thing that they could control, which was the cap.",
  "I think it might be and it's not that radically different than what this Court approved in Ragan against Taxation Without Representation.",
  "Well --",
  "Maybe there are differences in that particular context. Maybe the Freedom of Press clause informs the analysis. But this Court has upheld the regime that withheld tax benefits to an organization if it engaged in lobbying; and at the same time this Court said that it was okay to give those tax benefits --",
  "Yes, but the next couple of lines of the opinion said: And it's okay if we give those tax benefits back to a veterans organization, but only veterans organizations. So I just think what that case shows up is that the Court has recognized that the government has a fair amount of flexibility.",
  "No, there is -- there is a limiting principle, and I think that, importantly, there is a limiting principle that's very applicable to this very context, which is I think if Congress went to the point where they weren't doing what I think they're doing here, which is not trying to limit the amount of self-financing, but using it as a mechanism here to identify particularly costly races where they should raise the contribution limits, if they went further and basically said we're going to give you public financing if your opponent self-finances, and we're going to give you two dollars for every dollar that your opponent self-finances, I think at that point as a practical matter the regime would operate as a ban on -- as a cap, just like this Court held in Buckley. But I think that's the way to approach this issue, which is to basically say if what Congress is doing is really trying to effectively cap self-expenditures, then Congress cannot do that; but if what Congress is doing is giving candidates choice and is trying to react to the regulatory environment created by self-financing --",
  "I mean, I really don't think that's an accurate description of what happened here, because if you look at the legislative record here -- I know not everybody likes to do that -- but if you look at the legislative record here, you will see that both parties in this, the opponents and the proponents of this amendment, realize that they couldn't limit self-financing and that they were unlikely to limit self-financing because it's such an attractive option for parties and for candidates. And both parties took it as a given that the effect of Section 319 and its Senate counterpart would be to put more money, not less money, into electoral speech.",
  "Well, Justice Alito, what I would say is that what the relaxation of the contribution limits reflects is an adjustment of other interests; and I don't think in principle what Congress has done here is different from what a number of States do, which is they say for the race for governor the contribution cap limit is going to be 2,000; for State auditor it will be a little less; and for local representative it will be substantially less. Now, I suppose somebody could have come in and said, look, you know, the race for governor you can give $2,000; you can only give a 1,000 for this representative race, so surely that's irrational because the State has recognized that a contribution of $2,000 is noncorrupting. It's not the way it's ever proceeded and I think this Court's --",
  "No. But I think you're talking about Congress using a mechanism that is equally effective in identifying races that are likely to be more expensive. When one party is spending more than $350,000 of their own money, that's every bit as likely to be a more expensive race than the race for governor or State treasurer or a local representative. And that's why I think this is so responsive to the problem that Congress recognized with the combination --",
  "Well, can I say two things in response to that? One is it would not be unprecedented for this Court to approve a regime where the choices of the candidates led to different contribution levels in the exact same race for the exact same office, because that's what happens in Buckley in the public financing scheme that this Court approved. If somebody accepts public financing for the general election for presidency, they are effectively agree to a zero contribution limit; whereas, their opponent, minor party opponent for example, would be subject to higher contribution level.",
  "But one --",
  "But one of the prices of accepting the government subsidy in Buckley was to agree to limit your own financing of your own campaign to Now, their whole theory of this case is that somehow a benefit to their opponent is the same thing as a detriment to themselves. And it seems to me that -- I mean, the base lines here are sufficiently manipulable; the analogy is exactly the same.",
  "It certainly would, Justice Breyer, and one thing to keep in mind in interpreting the statute is that it has Section 401 of the original BCRA -- I think we have it at page 28 of our brief -- is what I would describe, I think, as a \"super-severability\" clause, because it says not only are unconstitutional provisions severable, but even unconstitutional applications of the same provision are severable. And I think there would be no problem effectively leaving the statute with the disclosure requirements in place and two of the three means of taking advantage of additional opportunities that the statute affords challengers.",
  "So I certainly think it would be severable.",
  "No.",
  "No. To the contrary, on the theory that this statute operates on this record without that provision being implicated at all. I mean, in the first applications of this, the entirety of the 2004 election cycle, no party took advantage of the coordinated --",
  "-- contributions.",
  "I mean, I would concede that there will be these differential limits, but it's based on the choice of the candidate to engage or not in self-financing, and -- I mean, the restriction there is much more substantial than the public financing scheme approved by this Court in Buckley, because in the general election if the candidate decides that it's going to -- that a candidate is going to take the public financing scheme then in the general presidential election I can't give even a dollar to that candidate. And it's also I think worth recognizing that in Buckley this Court recognized that, for constitutional and associational rights purposes, it's really the ability to associate with the candidate by giving any contribution, rather than the amount of the contribution, that satisfies that limit. In all events, this is not a challenge that's being brought by contributors. And I think it's worth recognizing that Appellant, even though some of its challenge, and I would say the gravamen of the challenge, sounds -- his challenge sounds in equal protection terms, he doesn't really want a leveling-up where the opportunity would be for contributors to both candidates to make triple the $2300 limits. He really wants to keep the yoke of relatively low contribution limits on his opponents. And that's why I think this is such an odd First Amendment challenge.",
  "I mean, I'm not sure I have the hypo. If he can spend twice as much?",
  "If I'm understanding the hypo which we were just talking about contribution limits, because there are no expenditure limits, if I'm understanding the hypo right, I think that would still be okay. I mean, I think if Congress had decided here that if a self-financer spends beyond a certain amount, then what is important is that then the contribution limits would be lifted entirely. I suppose Congress could do that, as long as they maintained what they called the \"parity principle\" or the \"proportionality principle,\" which is in no circumstance will the opponent be able to raise more than the amount of the additional spending. And if your hypo is suggesting that that would be relaxed so that they could raise twice as much, I think that would raise more difficult constitutional questions.",
  "Again, if I'm understanding the hypo right, I think you would say there that the candidate is effectively burdened because if you get to the point where you're past what I would call \"parity\" and you actually -- by spending an additional dollar, you're allowing your opponent to spend $2 additional additionally, I think at that point a rational candidate is not going to engage in self-finance. And so in practice, the provision would operate as an absolute cap, rather than the way it operates here, which is not as a cap. And I think if you look at the numbers in the record, joint appendix page 89 --",
  "They would, but I do think the statute in practice would operate quite differently. And that's why I think it's very helpful that we have a record here in this case that we can cite to.",
  "I would put it differently and say we're not arguing for a principle without limits, but what I would say is that we really benefit here from the fact that this Court found no standing for the challenge to the Millionaires' Provision in McConnell, and we have a record of actual experience.",
  "May I answer the question? I mean, you're right that to the extent that this says this really sounds as an equal protection case more than a First Amendment case, at the remedial stage you'd ask the question: Should we level up and have both candidates have a larger cap or should we level down and hold them both to the $2300 level? I would say two things, if I may. One is it's no accident that Appellant isn't asking you to level up because what -- they're not interested in doing additional financing; they're really taking -- interested in taking advantage of keeping the opponent down to the $2300 level. The only other thing that I would say about this choice between leveling up and leveling down is I would say that the statute that would have relaxed the caps for both candidates would pose the same First Amendment issue as this statute. And so it really is, at bottom, an equal protection claim that you have before you. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me begin with the colloquy that involved Justices Ginsburg and Justice Kennedy about the rates and whether you can have sort of pre-enhanced rates as part of the lodestar or whether you can only do the enhancement after the fact. At the end of the day, as long as it is established in this case that you can have an enhancement for quality, I suppose that my -- my clients would be satisfied. The point is, though, that the preexisting law in the Eleventh Circuit and most circuits does not allow for a pre-enhanced rate to be used to calculate the lodestar. They are either done completely mechanically, as Justice Ginsburg suggests -- the Laffey index in the D.C. Circuit -- or they are done through a simple calculation of the prevailing market rates.",
  "Well, Justice Alito, let me say that I don't think that you need any more standards for the possibility of an upward departure than you need for the possibility of a downward departure. And this Court has already held in Farrar v. Hobby that the results obtained is an adequate basis for departure, and not a small departure. In Farrar v. Hobby, the lodestar amount, the mechanical calculation that we're talking about, was $280,000. What was the reasonable attorney's fee? This Court --",
  "Well, two things, Your Honor. I mean, the results obtained is one of the two factors that are at issue in this case. And I think results obtained can be objective and be a basis for an upward adjustment as well as a downward adjustment. As you heard the lawyer in the earlier case say, you know, in a complaint, it is a wish list. And it's a rare case where the attorney gets everything they ask for in the complaint. This is that rare case where everything that was asked for in the complaint was obtained. So that's one factor, Your Honor.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, I defer to you, but I'm not sure that comports with my experience. I have seen lawyers come into this Court and concede a point in oral argument, and I have seen that prominently featured in this Court's opinion, so it does seem to me that sometimes the quality of the performance and the results obtained do depend on the lawyer's performance and are not foreordained just by the four corners of the complaint. And so I think, again --",
  "No, I think what he says is, in the hands of another counsel, the relief that was obtained might have been significantly less. This was an enormous --",
  "Well, maybe not -- no, not how good. How tenacious. I mean, this case settled. With a different lawyer for the plaintiffs in this case than --",
  "And maybe your perspective's changed, Your Honor.",
  "But I would say certainly in the context of a consent decree, when to give up, when to fight further, is going to be factored into the results. And I think it's a fair point that a judge in today's system, especially in the context of class relief like this, sees a lot of cases that end up with a coupon settlement that really doesn't do any good for the class. They're --",
  "Well, on that my perspective has changed, Your Honor.",
  "But let me say two things: One is, less than 10 percent of the total rates here, the total compensable hours here, were top-of-the-market rates. Only the two lead counsel were compensated, at sort of $495 and $450 an hour. If you want to talk about the -- the Lowry declaration, which is one thing that Mr. Shah brought up, what he quoted from was essentially the conclusion of that, where as part of the existing Eleventh Circuit precedent that looks to prevailing rates in the Atlanta market, there is a recitation that that is the sort of the prevailing rate consistent with the quality. That’s essentially something that the Eleventh Circuit requires you to say. I think the more relevant part of that declaration is at Joint Appendix at page 35, where Ms. Lowry points out that as a matter of fact these rates in the Atlanta market do nothing to account for the fact that she has to pay New York overhead, and that her real rates are a national rate based on providing a service that almost no one else in the country can provide. This is really a unique --",
  "What's that?",
  "Justice Breyer, the numbers aren't broken down. But I can tell you --",
  "Well, what I think you can say for sure, Justice Breyer, is that what came out of that is a lot more if you have your office in New York --",
  "-- than if you have your office in Atlanta.",
  "I do, Justice Breyer, but I also think the question presented here is whether you can ever have an enhancement.",
  "Right. Well, Justice Breyer, let me take issue, though, with the hypothetical that all these lawyers are getting the top, top rate. That's not -- that's not what is happening, either in this case or in general. And one of the things, if you look out at the circuits, you will see that, because this Court has always said that the lodestar method is a two-step process, the first step, as this Court has repeatedly described it, is an estimate. Because of that, the circuits have some looseness as to how they go about estimating the reasonable hourly rate. They do not say: Let's take the tippy-tip-top rate and use that to calculate the rate. They use a variety of formulas. As I say, the Laffey index in the D.C. Circuit is quite formulistic and doesn't -- it puts you in three-year groups and doesn't change your compensation between your 8th and 11th year and your 12th and 20th year, so it's very mechanical. In some circuits, you can get a national rate. So in a circuit -- if this case would have been litigated in Cincinnati in the Sixth Circuit, then Ms. Lowry may have been able to get $700 an hour, which is a national rate. On the other hand, because this was in Atlanta, she was able to get the prevailing market rate in Atlanta, which was 495. Now --",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice --",
  "No, no. But I don't mean to -- I would start with this Court's cases that say it is to be in a rare case. Now, they say that repeatedly, so I take this Court at its word, and I would think that the rare case might --",
  "Well -- but he had one case in 28 years, so, I mean, whatever the denominator is --",
  "-- it's a huge denominator, and this --",
  "I mean, actually, I don't think that's a crazy way to approach it, which is this really is supposed to be something that’s reserved for the rare case. I am not -- I don’t want to see --",
  "Well, maybe the judge stays his or her hand in the first year. I mean, this is a discretionary judgment. There is an element of discretion in this, that starts with the statutory text -- which is “may,” not “must” -- and this Court has recognized time and time again that the --",
  "Well, no, I think it's a –- it’s a discretionary judgment. I mean, the –- the district courts are going to be exercising that discretion guided by what this Court has said. This Court has said it should be the rare case in which there’s an enhancement. I think they are entitled to take this case -- this Court at its word, and I think there’s a reason, by the way, as this Court has rejected enhancement based on other factors, that it has always held out the possibility for the enhancement in the rare case, for the quality of service and the excellence of results. The reason is, if you take that off the table, then the statute becomes unrecognizable to the Congress that passed it. This is not a difficult question about whether the Congress that passed the statute intended for there to be bonuses or enhancements based on exceptional quality and results. Those of you that look to legislative history, in this context of interpreting this statute, have repeatedly looked to the Senate report. The Senate report provides three exemplary cases as to how you should correctly apply an attorney's fee. Two of those three cases applied enhancements based on exceptional performance and results.",
  "Well, two -- two responses, Justice Scalia.",
  "I know you don't, and I know that because I read your dissent -- or your concurrence --",
  "-- in Blanchard. The rest of the Court did that in Blanchard, and I think it should continue to do that because you are interpreting a word like “reasonable,” and I think have you to look somewhere, and the -- and the Senate report provides guidance. The second thing though is, Justice Scalia, you, in a number of contexts, have pointed out that, if you don't look to legislative history, it's okay to look at how a term was interpreted by courts at the time that Congress adopted it. And that's another way to get at the same result, which is, in this is case --",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I would say that -- you know, you can look to the fact that we have had a lot of inflation since then. You can make the --",
  "I don't think you should because, again, what Congress said it was trying to do here was not to try to make people indifferent between whether they became lawyers or not. They were looking at lawyers and they were trying to determine, we want to essentially make you indifferent between engaging in civil rights work and other complex civil litigation, like antitrust, and if that --",
  "Before you adopted the lodestar, sure.",
  "But not before the lower courts had adopted the lodestar, and which way does that cut? I think that cuts very strongly against adopting a rule that says, the lodestar is not just a guiding principle but is an absolute ceiling on the award.",
  "Well, again, Your Honor, with respect, I don't think, in any direct way, the lodestar takes into account the quality of counsel. Prevailing market rates, as Justice Stevens indicated, win or lose -- those are the prevailing market rates. So I don't think it directly takes it into Account. And, the question here is whether you can ever take that into account. And I actually think, if you are looking for guidance, you can look to the early Third Circuit cases that were decided before Congress passed the statute, and what those Third Circuit cases decided -- there was an en banc case, Lindy II, by Judge Aldisert and a panel opinion in Merola by Judge Garth. And what those decisions did is they said the great thing about having a lodestar with adjustments is that, in the mine run of cases, the rates are going to get quality of performance results about right. But what they --",
  "Well, I think, right now, they are sort of, at best, staying stagnant and maybe going down a little bit. I think this Court has always looked to the market in setting rates a bit. I think the main thing the fact that rates are not going up in sort of an inevitable cycle suggests to me is that this Court has to recognize that the one basis for enhancement that it has already consistently recognized, which is an enhancement for delay, which is not the same thing as contingency. This Court recognized that enhancement for delay was appropriate in the case of Missouri v. Jenkins. Now, this Court indicated that you can take account for delay, either through current rates, instead of historical rates, or through an enhancement. I think the one thing we know now is you have to be careful about using current rates to take into account for delay because the assumption that that would work was based on this assumption that rates inevitably go up.",
  "Well -- and maybe that's right, and maybe there should be adjustment in those cases. Maybe you shouldn't just take the prevailing rate for the general provision of services. You should take into account that, actually, you have lawyers here who are willing to do it for free. Sometimes, I think you get what you pay for, but that's a different subject.",
  "I do think that you can make adjustments, and that’s what is -- think about the term “the lodestar.” I mean, the lodestar is not a destination. It's not a complete calculation. The lodestar is a guiding light. It gets you --",
  "It's not, but if we want to resort to what Congress had in mind, I think that only favors the idea that you would have adjustments upward and downward.",
  "And the term is “reasonable,” and, again, I think, if you were looking for fertile ground to derive a bright-line rule that you never, ever have an enhancement for quality --",
  "Well, I guess what I would say, Justice Sotomayor, is that that potentially could be more structured. I'm not sure it inherently is, which is to say I think -- you know, in some ways, it may be more transparent to say, we are just going to use the Laffey index, or we are going to use the prevailing market rates, and then we are really going to hone in on the issue of quality and exceptional results after the fact. I think, if the Court wants to suggest that you should take those factors into account in setting the rate -- and the rate should not be just a rigidly calculated rate that comes from an index or comes from the prevailing market -- I think the one thing I would very much want to urge on you is, if you take that route, that you allow a remand for an opportunity for my clients to make that showing to the district court because there’s no question, from the record here, that they were responding to extant law of the Eleventh Circuit. And that extant law did not provide that possibility for adjustment with the prevailing market rates. Those were --",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, first let me say that I had understood, and perhaps this was wishful thinking, but I had understood that Justice Sotomayor was suggesting the possibility of a broader inquiry at the rate-setting stage, not just a narrow focus sort of within bands. So I just -- that's what I was trying to respond to. As to trying to cabin the discretion, let me try to offer some thoughts about cabining the discretion, but let me also say that, to paraphrase Justice Scalia, what sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. I mean, this Court has said that there are bases for downward departures, and including downward departures all the way to zero in Farrar v. Hobby, and the Court has not been overly concerned about cabining that discretion. And that kind of discretion goes on downward all the time. It can take place in the terms of looking at a particular motion and saying that wasn't a very good motion; you were wasting your time. There are a variety of ways that that can be taken into account downward, and this Court hasn't felt that concerned about cabining the discretion. Now, if this Court wants to cabin the discretion, I think certainly there’s two factors here: There’s the quality of service and there is the exceptional results. As to the quality of service, I would certainly say that you ought not to have a rigid rule, which is essentially what Petitioners are asking for, that would cap you with prevailing market rates. There ought to be some flexibility for that, for the judge to take into account the actual experience that the judge has with the lawyers in the courtroom. The second thing I would say is that I do think it ought to be fair, if you are going to do this kind of calculation, that you don't base it on something like the Laffey index, and you don't base it on a rule that a national expert can never get a national prevailing rate, but even though they are sitting in New York, they have to get the top rate only in the Atlanta market. I think those differences should be taken into account on the compensation side of things. And then if at some point, the judge wants to say, and I want to give either this rate or this multiplier for the quality of the performance, then that's something that you can certainly assess. As to the exceptional results, I also think there, too, you can focus on specific factors of the case before you, and you can say things. Now, I would say, for example in this case, part of the reason the results are exceptional -- I would point to at least three things: One is the advance of capital here in order to take on a case of this breadth and undertaking is really an exceptional undertaking. And if you look at the Goldberg declaration at Joint Appendix 75, that declaration points out that a smaller firm would have essentially been bankrupted by this case.",
  "The district judge cut -- cut out all of them following this Court's decision in Casey, Your Honor.",
  "There was still, though, I should say, something on the order of $750,000 in reimbursable expenses that had to be advanced. It’s worth pointing out that one factor that Judge Shoob took into account in giving an enhancement here was the delay in payment. That is a permissible factor under Missouri v. Jenkins, and even if you use current rates, that doesn't do anything to compensate you for the delay in reimbursement of expenses.",
  "Oh, I was just making a narrow point, Mr. Chief Justice, which is the current rates don't take into account the fact that there was a delay in repayment for reimbursable expenses. Some of these expenses were paid out 4 years ago, I mean at the time of the fee calculation. You don't get sort of, you know, today's copying expenses or today's FedEx expenses. You get the expenses at the time you did them, and you don't get any prejudgment interest on that. So that is one thing Judge Shoob thought ought to be compensated here. Again, that’s one factor that makes this exceptional. Another factor is that this was an entrenched problem that they were dealing with. In 1989 the foster care child system in Georgia was described as a crisis; by 1996 it had been upgraded to a catastrophe. This is a very difficult problem. The last thing is the scope of the relief, which really is, I think, very broad here and that's what Judge Shoob was recognizing. And as I said earlier, I do think in an era of coupon settlements, a judge is entitled to look at a case like this and say this is really a remarkable result that has been achieved here, and the normal rates -- normal prevailing market rates don't compensate for this kind of result. So I do think there are things that the Court could point to in this case or in other cases to try to cabin that discretion. I do think, though, that discretion is an inherent feature of this statutory regime, and this Court has tolerated a degree of discretion in a variety of contexts including with respect in the area of downward departures. I do want to get, before I sit down, this point about getting the incentives right, because one thing that Congress was clearly very concerned about was getting the incentive rights for counsel. And if you accept Petitioner's position that the lodestar is a ceiling and not something that is subject to adjustment up or down, then what you are telling lawyers is the that the maximum amount they can make in a civil rights case is the minimum amount they can make in a different case, where by the way they will get paid every 30 days and their expenses will get reimbursed in real time. Then you are also telling them something else, which is, that's actually just a starter because there are multiple ways for district courts to cut down on the lodestar amount, either because you spent too much time on this or we didn't like your travel expenditures. And so there are multiple ways for those hours to be cut down. If you accept Petitioner's rule and there is no way to get those rates bumped up in any circumstances, then you are basically guaranteeing that, as I say, the maximum you can make in a civil rights is the minimum you can make in any other kind of cases.",
  "Two things, Mr. Chief --",
  "Two things, Mr. Chief Justice: One, it's the law of the Eleventh Circuit and I think every circuit that before submitting your fees to the court you are supposed to use billing judgment and take care of some of those things, approximating maybe what your client would do for you. But, second, and I think more tellingly, the client may do that to you. The client doesn't have the help of your opposing counsel to egg them on and give them suggestions, and that's what a district court does in the context of one of these cases. So I really think, as a practical matter, you are systematically undercompensating counsel. And I mean, if you want to take into account practicalities, I am not here to reargue the Dague case, but if you want to talk about practicalities, the fact that all of these cases are contingency cases and the rational market for those would be much higher than -- if you are worried about sort of windfalls for plaintiff counsel in these kind of cases, you really can worry about something else, with all due respect, because the combined effect of Dague and Casey makes it very difficult to get sort of comparable compensation. As I say, I am not here to reargue those cases. I do think, frankly, Dague is distinguishable because there you had the prevailing party language. The other thing about Dague that’s distinguishable that I will say before I sit down is one of this Court's concerns in Dague was creating an asymmetry. Blanchard had already said that contingency fees could not cap your awards; they didn't want to have an asymmetrical system. That's exactly what Petitioners are asking you for, is a completely asymmetrical system. Farrar v. Hobby says you can reduce downwards based on exceptionally poor results. There would be no basis whatsoever to even adjust a little bit under their rule for exceptional results on the upside. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As I listen to Petitioners, I hear two arguments to why there ought to be liability for the prosecutor -- rather, for the police officer and not the prosecutor, and both of those are arguments this Court has already heard and rejected. On the immunity issue, the argument Petitioners make seems to distill to the proposition that as long as you're suing a prosecutor for injuries inflicted at trial, the prosecutor ought to have absolute immunity. Now, that's not a crazy theory of immunity. It's exactly the theory of immunity that the Seventh Circuit adopted in the Buckley decision and this Court reversed, unanimously as to the press conference and by a majority opinion with respect to pretrial investigatory conduct involving fabrication. If that sounds familiar, it should. That's the conduct that's at issue here. So the absolute immunity issue in this case was decided in Buckley. Now - -",
  "Well, I think, Justice Alito, the place to draw the line is the place this Court drew the line in Buckley, which is probable cause. And before probable cause, when prosecutors are engaging in investigatory functions, I don't think we want them shaping the witness for trial. I think we want them trying to figure out who actually committed this crime and who would we have probable cause to perhaps initiate process against.",
  "Well, Justice Alito, let me try to answer it this way, which is you mentioned both organized crime cases and insider trading cases. Well, I think if there is any circuit in which those kind of claims are going to be brought it's probably the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit has lived with this rule since the year 2000 and the Zahrey decision that's already been mentioned. There has not been a floodgate opening, there's not been a torrent of these claims. There's been a trickle. They remain very hard to allege, and the allegations here - -",
  "What would you - -",
  "I don't - -",
  "As I hear your hypothetical, I don't think so, because the thing that's missing is the allegation that the prosecutors fabricated that evidence. This isn't a case about coaching a witness.",
  "Well, two things, Your Honor. One is obviously without the fabrication allegations that take place during the investigatory stage, you would be protected by Imbler. Now, in the acquittal situations, this Court doesn't have a case directly on point. But if I read the Hartman decision, for example, Hartman v. Moore, and apply it to this context, I assume that in the context of an acquittal if you tried to bring a claim like this, this Court would interpret through the common law the -- a malicious prosecution type element that you would have to satisfy.",
  "Well, Justice Alito, let me say this. First of all, you are going to have to pinpoint those kind of allegations pre-probable cause, which is not going to be the case in a lot of cases. Second of all, I mean, this Court - -",
  "In -- in the typical case, if -- if the witness perhaps in the first instance comes up with one testimony and later comes up in -- with a different story later, the question for purposes of absolute immunity is going to be, did all of the conduct that you're alleging, the fabrication, did all of it take place before probable cause attached? And in a lot of cases prosecutors don't even get involved until after probable cause, until after there have been arrests, something like that. And in those cases - -",
  "And, again - -",
  "I think if I understand your hypothetical, the question would actually be whether there was probable cause before the re-interview, because if at the point - -",
  "Well, two things, Justice Alito. First of all, if you have all -- if you had the interview and the re-interview before probable cause and you have the allegations that it was done for the avowed purpose of depriving the person of their liberty, then you would, I think, apply Iqbal, and you would ask under all the circumstances of that case whether it's a plausible allegation. And this Court is obviously in a better position than I am to say how it would apply Iqbal in those kind of cases. But what I can tell you is that for nearly a decade the Second Circuit has had this rule. Now, the Second Circuit is the circuit that brought you Iqbal. So for that same decade they did not have the rule of Iqbal, and yet they didn't have a torrent of these claims. So, I think going forward, if you recognize these claims - -",
  "I think if you look at reported, both unpublished and published Second Circuit decisions at the district court level and the court of appeals level, you would find very few cases that even cite Zahrey. I think it's something like maybe 17 I think is what we found.",
  "In the Second Circuit? I don't think so. I think it will be the same number in the Second Circuit. Now, in the Seventh Circuit that has lived with the Buckley remand rule, I suppose there will now be a couple of dozen cases there. But I do think it's revealing that the circuit that has certainly the kind of cases that Justice Alito was dealing with, has not had a flood of these cases. As far as I'm aware, the U.S. attorney's offices in that circuit have not had to rework the way they do business in those circuits, and I do think that these are claims that are going to be difficult to allege.",
  "Well, Your Honor, we don't know for sure. We don't know either way, because either way this Court is going to adopt a clear rule. What I can say is at least I'm pointing to empirical evidence in a circuit that has lived with this rule for a decade. That seems to me a better empirical basis to go on than absolutely nothing. But let me give you another example, which is this Court a couple of years ago decided a decision called Hartman v. Moore. Hartman v. Moore sort of recognized that there was a tort called, I think, retaliatory inducement to prosecute. Now, in footnote 8 this Court recognized that actually you could sue a prosecutor for retaliatory inducement to prosecute if you focused on the investigatory activities. That's exactly the same basic theory we have here, which is you focus on the investigatory activities of a prosecutor and say that there is a valid 1983 claim. Now, again, to my knowledge there have not been a flood of Hartman claims brought against prosecutors. I think - -",
  "Without the submission at trial -- I mean, it would depend, I suppose, on the circumstances. You could have, certainly, a Fourth Amendment - -",
  "Well -- and then maybe I just need a concrete hypothetical. Let's say -- let's say - - let me -- let me provide one. Suppose that there was this -- the prosecutor put on this fabricated evidence at trial, and then the -- the whole case sort of unraveled because the system actually worked the way it's supposed to. On cross-examination the witness cracked and it became clear that there was this conspiracy to use perjured evidence. Now, at that point -- I mean, I suppose the government's theory would be because you never deprived the person of their liberty, the knowing use by the prosecutor of perjured testimony at trial does not violate the due process clause. But I hope that's not the rule. I mean, I hope that in a Mooney case, if you bring the -- make a Mooney violation against somebody who is actually guilty, so you knowingly use perjured testimony against somebody that's -- that's guilty, so if you did a harmless error analysis, you would say, well, the use of the perjured testimony really didn't deprive the person of their liberty because they were otherwise - -",
  "I -- I -- I'm not sure I have a best case for that, Justice Kennedy. I mean, let me -- let me give you what I think is a very good case that illustrates a similar principle, but I -- I will -- I will be candid that I think this is an extrapolation from Mooney, but a very sort of clear extrapolation from Mooney. My best case in some ways I think is Malley, because their proposition seems to be that -- this is the other argument you have heard and rejected -- is that if there's an absolutely immune act in the causal chain, then that somehow means that there is no violation. Think about who was sued in the Malley. It was the police officers. What did the police officers do? They procured an invalid arrest warrant. Now, did their actions independent of the absolute immune act of the magistrate injure the plaintiffs? No. Without the magistrate issuing the warrant, there was no arrest, there's no search, there's no injury to the plaintiffs. So we allow in our system somebody to bring a constitutional tort claim, even though there's an absolutely immune act in the causal chain. The lower court in Malley actually accepted exactly this argument, that if you have any absolutely immune act in the causal chain that breaks it off. This Court rejected it and was frankly fairly dismissive, dismissed it in the footnote, footnote 7 of the opinion.",
  "It was a Fourth Amendment violation.",
  "No, I think it illustrates the principle, which is you don't have to have a completed constitutional violation in your 1983 action. I mean, Malley illustrates that principle, but so does the text of -- of section 1983, frankly. Section 1983 doesn't force you to have a completed constitutional violation. It provides liability if you subject someone to a constitutional violation or cause them to be subjected to a constitutional violation.",
  "Well, the - -",
  "Well - -",
  "What's that?",
  "Well, I would ask -- I would ask both of you to go back and read two things, and I would particularly like Justice Scalia to go back and read your separate opinion in Burns. Because in Burns you confronted just this issue. You conceptualized what happens at the warrant stage as a variant of malicious prosecution and you said: Now, could a prosecutor, sort of as kind of a complaining witness in that context, procure a warrant that they were subsequently involved in? And you said: I don't see any reason why not. I think you got it right there. The other thing I would ask you to look at is footnote 8 of the Hartman v. Moore decision, because there you were dealing with a retaliatory prosecution claim. Now, the Court's opinion was very careful to say, you know, it's really not a retaliation -- a retaliatory prosecution claim; what it is is a retaliatory inducement to prosecute case.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice - -",
  "Well, I guess what I would do, Mr. Chief Justice, is try to take issue with your premise, which is that we can't advert to the absolute immune act at all. Of course we can. I mean, this isn't - -",
  "Well, I would still say we do, but please let me try to take one more crack at the premise, which is Imbler is not a use immunity case and this Court has rejected the proposition that just because you're absolutely immune for an act there's no evidentiary use of that in going after conduct that was earlier in the causal chain. This Court specifically confronted that in a case called Dennis v. Sparks that was with, you know, the granddaddy of them all, judicial immunity, and said even the judge's actions could be proved up as part of a tort action. So there is no use immunity for - -",
  "It wasn't against the judge, but I -- but with all due respect, I don't think that matters. And I also think - -",
  "Well, but -- but it's a distinction without a difference. It's a distinction this Court confronted in -- in Hartman in footnote 8. It's a distinction Justice Scalia confronted. And also, the consequences of accepting their view is to really turn all of your absolute immunity cases into a fool's errand. I mean, think about Kalina. I mean, the supporting affidavit wasn't the thing that inflicted injury. Now, the thing that inflicted injury were the two documents that the supporting affidavit supported, the warrant and the information. Now, it would have made no sense for this Court to say, well, there is only qualified immunity for the supporting affidavit, so let's send this back to the lower court, if you couldn't even get into evidence the fact that there was an information or a warrant. So too in the Malley case, of course you can use -- now it's a different -- it's a different person. In Kalina -- Kalina, it's the same person. Or take a look at Burns, for example. In Burns the prosecutor's advice to the police officer, that's not what injured the plaintiff in that case. It was the warrant that was eventually procured.",
  "Well, I think it makes all the difference in the world in the sense that if -- if they know that everything they do at trial is going to be protected, those functions, which is the basis of this Court's functional approach to absolute immunity, are going to be protected. Now, if they're going to be - -",
  "Well, I think there is going to be an effect on the deterrent effect on the prosecutor pretrial, which is they will be procured. I mean, think about the contrary incentive you're - - you're creating. Suppose you're a prosecutor. You've participated in the misconduct before trial. You now have the decision to make: Okay, I was -- I was complicit in the fabrication of this perjured evidence; should I put it on into evidence? Well, let's see. If I don't put it on into evidence and I come clean now, I'm actually liable for the arrest and all the pretrial detention. If I actually introduce it into evidence now, I'm scot-free.",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, I would say that there is no reason for this Court to disturb the line it drew in Buckley. Now I could, because of this case - -",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, I mean, another thing presumably, Justice Breyer, you want to encourage is having the police officers come to the prosecutors and get legal advice about what they're doing. And this Court squarely confronted that question in Burns and said the advice-giving function, which is a function only a prosecutor, only a lawyer anyways, can perform - -",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, let me respond. Let me say why I don't think I can really improve on the probable cause line. I mean, in this case, the police officers and the prosecutors were involved in this from the get-go.",
  "Well, I think - -",
  "No, I don't think so. I think for the purposes of evaluating when there's probable cause, you have to eliminate the fabricated evidence, and so I think that you evaluate probable cause, but here's why I think it's the right line, Because think about the prosecutor's special function. If you don't have probable cause to arrest any individual for a crime, then the function the police officers ought to be performing is one of a truth-seeking function and that is a classic police investigatory function. Now, the moment they have probable cause, I'm willing to listen to the argument that at that point they shift roles, and at that point they're not looking at the evidence the way the police officer is, just to find out whodunit; but they're looking at it to say, well I have a job to do, I have to put a case on, and, you know, this person says what they say, and, you know, there's some problems with that and the jury's not going to believe that, so let me talk to him some more. That's why I think the probable cause line is not only administrable, but it makes sense in this context.",
  "I think at the point -- if the interview begins and he doesn't think he has probable cause, I think that that - -",
  "Of course he is trying to find out. But he's -- but he's not trying to find out if there's probable cause necessarily to identify a particular suspect. What he's trying to do, is there probable cause to arrest anyone? And that's exactly the question a police officer asks every single day.",
  "Well -- you know, I'm not sure what the logical place to push it back any further is, and I think -- you know - -",
  "Yes.",
  "That's right.",
  "And let me say this, Justice Breyer, I mean, I know you don't want to talk about Burns, but I'd like to, just for a second, because I think it's a very similar policy concern. As a policy matter, sure, we want prosecutors to get -- to give advice to police officers, but qualified immunity is not insignificant protection, and think about that, I mean, the incentives you're creating for the same anomaly that the Court recognized in Buckley. The incentive would really - -",
  "I just wanted to say the incentive would really be perverse. Under Burns, if the police -- if the police officer comes to the prosecutor and says -- you know, we want to fabricate evidence to frame it, can we do it? And the prosecutor says, yes, you can do that, go ahead; there's qualified immunity. Now, if the prosecutor says, go ahead and let me help, there would somehow be absolute immunity. I mean, that is really an anomalous result, that it's the n anomaly that caused this Court in Buckley to draw the line at probable cause.",
  "And, again, the Court addressed exactly this Court in the -- exactly that issue in the Buckley decision and said, sure -- you know, from -- with the benefit of hindsight, you can sort of retrospectively look and make anything in the investigatory stage part of -- and part and parcel of the prosecution. And I don't think that was something that this Court saw as a reason not to draw a clean line that's consistent with the functional approach. It's consistent, not just with Buckley, but with Burns and with Kalina and with a whole host of this Court's decisions.",
  "Well, if I could add, I mean, I suppose I might be able - -",
  "And let me say this: If I could add a couple of words, I think we could probably live with that line, which is, if the prosecutor is interviewing those witnesses with an eye towards credibility for use at trial, I mean, that's a line that, I think, would be, I think, probably pretty consistent with probable cause, but something that we could live with, but - -",
  "Well, I mean, I worry that words are being put in my mouth. I would say that, if the prosecutor is interviewing the witness for the purpose of judging their credibility at trial, then that's something for which you may be able to sort of tweak the line on Buckley and say that's covered. I actually think it won't make any difference because I think that should only be happening after probable cause. If I could - -",
  "Well, shoot first -- you mean go to an impartial magistrate and try to get somebody arrested or - -",
  "Well, I suppose - -",
  "Well, if you have probable cause, then I think you're on the other side of the Buckley line, and that's an objective determination, and I think - -",
  "Well, I think it's -- I'm not sure it's a decision you have to make. I think it's actually something that would be evaluated objectively after the fact, and I think the way that this Court should approach this case is neither of the parties before you have asked this Court to overturn Buckley. I wouldn't do it under those circumstances, but, of course, it's worth adding that, if you were going to overturn Buckley, then the place to probably start would be to go back to first principles, and if you're going to go back to first principles, then what you're going to find is that there was no common law support at all for absolute immunity. And I wouldn't think that this Court was particularly interested in coming up with implied immunities that aren't in the statute and had no basis at the common law, and that's why I think some of the Justices that have looked at this as an original matter have tended to be quite reluctant in recognizing absolute immunity because it lacks support in the text and it lacks support at the common law. So we're -- we're happy with the lines that this Court has already drawn. But if the Court's going to go back to first principles, well, let's go back to first principles and look at -- the at the statute Congress passed in 1871. That statute did not provide any immunities, and I do think, as we say in the brief, this is a case where it's important not to lose the forest for the trees because this is a statute was passed -- passed in 1871. This is one of the great civil rights statutes. Is it really plausible to think that the Congress that passed this statute didn't want to provide a remedy in the circumstances before the Court today? I think it's clear, from this Court's cases -- there may not be a case that lines up all the dots exactly, but I think it's clear, from this Court's cases, that the police officer that engages in this misconduct has committed a grave, grave constitutional violation and ought to be liable. I think the prosecutor who engages in the pretrial misconduct and then doesn't participate in the trial is just as liable as that police officer, and I can't think of a single reason why the only reason a prosecutor would get absolute immunity is, if they not only participated in the pretrial misconduct, but completed the scheme by committing further misconduct at trial. For all those reasons, we think the Court should affirm. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under this court's existing jurisprudence, the case for incorporating the Second Amendment through the Due Process Clause is remarkably straightforward. The Second Amendment, like the First and the Fourth, protects a fundamental preexisting right that is guaranteed to the people -- -",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, I think in that respect the Sixth Amendment is a bit of an outlier. For most of the provisions and as far as I know all of the substantive provisions of the Bill of Rights that have been incorporated against the States, this Court has incorporated basically all the jurisprudence that comes with that.",
  "Well, I guess maybe it's Mapp, is one way of thinking about it. I mean --",
  "-- I could quibble about that --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, sure. We could quibble whether -- I think of the Fourth Amendment as more of a substantive guarantee. But in any event, with respect to certainly like the First Amendment guarantees that this Court has incorporated through the liberty -- the liberty subclause, if you will, of the Due Process Clause, there too I think this Court -- certainly I understand this Court's jurisprudence as incorporating all of the cases that go along with that. So New York Times v. Sullivan is the law of all 50 States, et cetera, et cetera. And I think that in a sense the virtue of that approach is probably even more apparent with the Second Amendment than it might be with some other jurisprudence --",
  "That's also right, Your Honor, though I guess I would stress that I think that, whatever the debate’s about substantive due process when it comes to unenumerated rights, I think the gist of this Court's incorporation doctrine is that the textual provisions of the Bill of Rights stand in a favored position with respect to incorporation. And so Glucksberg has its discussion about the standard for unenumerated rights, but it starts that off by saying of course the Bill of Rights are different. And, of course, the Bill of Rights, I think, as I read this Court's selective --",
  "Again, though, it's interesting that the one place that I -- that I see where the Court has not effectively translated all the case law is one of the procedural rights, the Sixth Amendment criminal jury right. And I think with respect to the substantive rights -- and I think the alliance here or the similarity between the First and the Second Amendments are very stark in this respect -- this Court has incorporated essentially not just the amendment and not just the right, but all of the jurisprudence as well. And, you know, I would -- just to dwell for a moment if I'd could on the -- on the First and the Second Amendment, I think it's striking, very striking, that if this Court's not going to reconsider its Privileges or Immunities Clause jurisprudence, the Cruikshank case actually stands as very good precedent for incorporating the Second Amendment, just as it was the precedent this Court relied on in incorporating the assembly and petition rights of the First Amendment in the De Jonge case. And the reason is Cruikshank -- the whole reason that Cruikshank said the First and Second Amendments aren't privileges of national citizenship is because they were preexisting rights that didn't depend on the Constitution for their existence. That seems to me to be a pretty good working definition of what a fundamental right is, one that is so fundamental and basic that it preexisted our very Constitution. And so it's not surprising that De Jonge cited Cruikshank as favorable precedent for incorporation. I think the exact same logic would apply to the Second Amendment here, and, as I say, I do think the consequence of that, certainly the most logical consequence, would be to carry over the jurisprudence under the Second Amendment. Now, right now, that's not carrying over a lot, right? That's carrying over the Heller case. But I think in a way that points up to the fact that one of the virtues of incorporation is that, because the Miller decision of this Court sowed confusion, we don’t have substantial Second Amendment jurisprudence. And I would think that it's going to be difficult enough to develop the Second Amendment jurisprudence that you wouldn't want to make it more difficult by having to develop a Federal Second Amendment jurisprudence and then some sort of shadow version of that jurisprudence for the States. And I think in the more recent incorporation cases, this Court was quite candid that it wasn't going to adopt sort of a shadow version of the Federal guarantee or some watered-down version of the Federal guarantee, but it really saw the virtue of incorporating not just the right but the jurisprudence that came with that right. And so I do think that's in a sense something that counts in favor of incorporating the Second Amendment and doing so through the Due Process Clause, the same way this Court has dealt with the other substantive guarantees of the Bill of Rights. And I think if you apply that jurisprudence, the case really is very straightforward. In fact, I think if you compare the First Amendment and the Fourth Amendment to the Second Amendment, they have the same textual guarantee to the people, they trace their origins to preexisting rights back to the English Bill of Rights, back to even earlier constitutional history.",
  "Well -- and, again, Justice Stevens, you know, since I think that -- that the incorporation clause is -- I mean, the incorporation jurisprudence is, to put it lightly, a gloss on the text of the Due Process Clause --",
  "That's right. That's right, Justice Stevens. But I guess I would say is that, putting the Sixth Amendment to one side, which I think is a bit of an outlier in the jurisprudence here, I think the trend of all of this Court's incorporation jurisprudence has been more towards complete incorporation of the right and the jurisprudence. So -- I mean, Mapp is a perfect illustration.",
  "That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think the same thing can be said for any other one of the other incorporated amendments. So I think the same thing might be true in the First Amendment. There are certainly going to be situations that the Federal government confronts that the State governments won't confront the exact analogue situation and vice versa. Now, you know, there may be unique issues about national parks that the States aren’t going to have to confront, and the jurisprudence can take that into account. But I think that's far different from saying that we really are going to have this shadow jurisprudence for one of the provisions. And I think, again, to go back to Mapp just as an illustration, when this Court first incorporated the Fourth Amendment and said, well, we’ll talk about the exclusionary rule later; maybe we won't incorporate the Fourth -- the exclusionary rule. We’ll just incorporate the Fourth Amendment's basic guarantee. And the trend of later cases was to say, no, kind of in for a penny, in for a pound --",
  "-- let's bring the jurisprudence with --",
  "Well --",
  "Justice Harlan was a terrific justice. Justice Black was a terrific justice in --",
  "-- in his total incorporation --",
  "Well, I think if we are going to go back, maybe we should go back to the first Justice Harlan, who actually had an -- an approach, I think, that would be much more similar to the approach --",
  "-- that we take in this case and that Mr. Gura takes in this case.",
  "Well, I mean, I guess what I -- what I don't understand is why, given the way that this Court wrestled in the Heller decision with how to basically apply the operative clause in light of the prefatory clause, why one would want to come to a different conclusion --",
  "-- with respect to the States.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I mean, obviously this Court was focused very much on Blackstone's writings in the Heller decision, and I think the majority read Blackstone actually as being primarily concerned with the self-defense right, which goes a long way to understand why the Heller decision came out the way that it came out. And I would simply finish by noting that the one thing that I think we can come to a conclusion about Blackstone is the very fact that Blackstone dwelled on the right is good evidence that it's a fundamental right that should apply to the States.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The standing of Petitioner to challenge the constitutionality of the Federal statute under which her liberty is being deprived should not be open to serious question. She clearly satisfies this Court's modern tripartite test for standing. Indeed, it is hard to imagine an injury more particularized or concrete than six years in Federal prison, and the liberty interest she seeks to vindicate is her own, not some third party's. In many ways, I think \"standing\" is a bit of a misnomer here. Plaintiff is not a plaintiff who seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of a Federal court. She is a defendant who has been hailed into court by a Federal prosecutor. There is no logical reason she should not be able to mount a constitutional attack on the statute that is the basis for the prosecution.",
  "Well, I think it was in the habeas context, but the Spencer decision does talk about how, when you have a criminal defendant or somebody who is serving a sentence, their standing to challenge the conviction is essentially one of the easiest standing cases you can imagine. And I think in a sense, the same principles would apply here. But as I said, I think standing is normally something you think about as applying to the plaintiff, who is invoking the jurisdiction of the court. So what's really at issue here is something -- almost more of a bar on somebody's ability to make an argument that would vindicate their liberty, and I see no reason why, in logic, that should be the case. Now, the court of appeals essentially didn't apply ordinary -­",
  "Well, I'm not sure you would call it normal standing principles, Your Honor. There are certainly arguments you could make that you -- would have no business having anything to do with your case. There's arguments you could make that would have nothing to do with -- would be non-justiciable -­",
  "Well, I guess I would have to know why you were a defendant in that case and how it had anything to do with the price of tea in that particular case. But -­",
  "With respect, I don't think that follows. I mean, I think if -- if the Federal executive tried to imprison you based on your religion, you could take issue with that and say that's an Establishment Clause violation. The problem in your recent case, the Hein case, is the only -­",
  "Well, if they said, well, we're hereby establishing a religion and you're not part of our religion and we're therefore imprisoning you, I would think you could bring that claim. But in all events, bringing it back to the case before you, I think there is no reason to think that ordinary principles of standing wouldn't give my client every ability to challenge the constitutionality of the statute under which she's being held.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, principally our argument here is an enumerated powers argument. My problem, though, is I'm not sure I understand some clearly defined set of Tenth Amendment claims that are uniquely only Tenth Amendment claims and not enumerated power claims.",
  "Well, I don't think so, but let me just say that my problem is -- take the Printz case. The Printz case itself went out of its way to say that it was an enumerated power case. In answering an argument in the dissent, the majority opinion says, this is not separate from enumerated powers. If you -­",
  "I don't think so, Justice Kagan, but I'd hate to sort of bet my case that on remand, I'm not going to say something in making an argument that the government or somebody else thinks is too much of a commandeering claim and too much -- not enough of an enumerated power claim.",
  "Again, Justice Ginsburg, that is the basis of our claim. But just to give you a -­",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, you could certainly do that, and as long as it is crystal clear that there will be no obstacle to my client making a constitutional attack on section 229 on remand, I suppose that's fair enough for my client. But one of the arguments we've preserved, for example, is the argument that Missouri vs. Holland is not a blank check for the government, that it requires a balancing of the State's interests against the Federal interests. And if on remand, I wax eloquent about the State's interest in criminal prosecution and law enforcement, I would hate for a trap door to open up at that point and I be told that, wait, wait, that's too much of the State's interest and not enough of your own interest.",
  "Exactly right, Justice Kennedy, and that's the fundamental worry I have here, is that this Court's cases have not drawn a distinction between commandeering claims and enumerated powers claims. The two cases the government points to, New York and Printz, both go out of their way to say that they are mirror images or, in fact, enumerated power claims, because a law that commandeers is not necessary and proper. And I do also think that a part of the problem with the suggestion that somehow Tennessee Electric should be reimagined as a third party standing claim is it fundamentally miscomprehends for whom the structural provisions of the Constitution are there for. Those provisions are there to protect the liberty of citizens. The United -- this Court made that point in the Free Enterprise Fund just last term. There was a case where it wasn't the executive complaining about the infringement on executive power. The Executive Branch ably defended the statute in this Court. It was a disgruntled accounting firm that was allowed to vindicate the separation of powers.",
  "I think it would, Justice Alito. My point is not that there's some special rule for the Tenth Amendment that plaintiffs will always have standing. My point is that you should just apply the normal rules. And what I don't think is sustainable is the proposition that in commandeering claims an individual never has standing. I mean, imagine a Federal statute that purported to save Federal money by commandeering local prosecutors to prosecute Federal crimes. Well, I would hope that a defendant in that kind of case would be able to raise a commandeering argument as a defense. I don't think it would be any different if Congress tried to commandeer the Comptroller General to start bringing criminal prosecutions. In that case -­",
  "I don't -- I don't self-identify as having made a commandeering claim. But what I would say is -- we're not asking you to do anything special. I just think it's the government that's asking you to go out of your way to reconceptualize Tennessee Electric as a different kind of case and preserve it.",
  "Well two things, Justice Alito. First, this is a technical matter. We could go back to the Third Circuit on our way back to coming here and we would still have standing to make an argument that it's foreclosed by precedent. But I think it's a mistake to think that Missouri v. Holland is some bright-line rule that forever answers this question. As I read Missouri v. Holland and as we clearly argued before the Third Circuit, it's not a blank check. It's really is more of a balancing test that looks at the State's interest and the Federal interest in assessing whether or not the statute that implements the treaty is necessary and proper. And I think this case compares pretty favorably with Missouri against Holland because there the state's interests was very weak because these birds were just flying through on their way and there was no real State interest, or so this Court held, whereas in this case the State has a real legitimate interest in law enforcement. I also think we ought to be able to make --",
  "I think it does, Justice Alito. I think it would matter in part for a constitutional avoidance statutory construction I argument, which I think also ought to be open to us. sort of think by analogy to the Jones case, where this Court said that a Federal statute about arson doesn't apply when a cousin throws a Molotov cocktail at a residence.",
  "No, I was trying to respond to the question of whether we would be foreclosed.",
  "No, we're not asking you to do more than do standing. But I do think it's important to understand that we don't think we would be limited to just losing on Missouri v. Holland below and coming back up. We think we have a very good argument about Missouri v. Holland as applied. We also think that there is sort of a statutory construction argument. And this isn't sarin. There is something sort of odd about the government's theory that says that I can buy a chemical weapon at Amazon.com. That strikes me as odd, and that seems to me the kind of thing where you could make a statutory construction to say, well, maybe sarin or maybe actual chemical weapons, that's one thing, but with respect to this kind of commonly available chemical, to say without any jurisdictional element or anything like that, that it's a Federal crime seems like an argument we at least ought to have standing to make.",
  "Could I say two things about that sentence, and then explain what I really think you should say? First of all, the first thing I would say about that sentence is that I don't think, read in the context of the entire opinion, it actually means that the Court is trying to impose a special disability on Tenth Amendment claims, because remember, they have already rejected the plaintiff's basis for having standing.",
  "And it's dictum in another way. But what I think it stands for is the proposition -- it rejects the argument that if you don't otherwise have standing under the governing standing rule of the day that you somehow have a license to bring a Tenth Amendment claim. And if that's what it stands, well, it was right then and it continues to be right. A second point to make about it is it is dictum, and if you read the sentence, what it says is the following: It makes a reference to what it's already established a couple of paragraphs earlier, which is the states at issue here have passed laws to accommodate TVA's sale of power, and then it goes on to say, if this were not so. What does that -- that is a counterfactual hypothetical. It's the worst kind of dictum. It says if this were not so. If it were not the fact that the States had already taken these actions to affirmatively accommodate then we would have a different question and then there wouldn't be standing. So it is dictum I think and can be disregarded as such. But really if you ask me what you should do with it, you should do what you did in Twombly, with some language in an opinion that had continued to cause trouble in the 50 years since. You should just say that's no longer good law because it's not. The central holding of Tennessee Electric was overruled 40 years ago in the Camp case, and I think this language is of a piece from that legal interest test, the legal wrong test of standing, and I think this Court should make clear that it doesn't apply any longer, and the virtue of that would be that it would free up the lower courts to decide these Tenth Amendment standing claims based on an application of normal standing principles, because that's not happening in the lower court right now. In the lower court right now what happens is somebody comes in with a Tenth Amendment claim of whatever stripe, maybe it's a commandeering claim, maybe it's not, and what they're confronted with, especially if it's a commandeering claim, is a quick citation of Tennessee Electric, an equally quick citation of Shearson which says only this Court can overturn its decisions, and that's it. No standing analysis, nothing subtle about the particular claim. And that's not a sustainable situation. If I could reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points in rebuttal. First of all, one reason not to carve out a special rule for commandeering claims is that not all commandeering claims are created equal. Mr. Dreeben raises the commandeering claim that has been litigated in the context of SORNA, the sex registration act. I don't know the details of that enough to know whether that's a valid commandeering claim or not, or whether there's a redressability problem in that particular case. But I can certainly imagine a commandeering case, a Federal statute that purports to commandeer local prosecutors to prosecute Federal crimes, where there would be no standing obstacle; and the problem is right now the lower courts aren't resolving the standing issue in the SORNA challenges based on a careful analysis of Article III standing, redressability or prudential standing, for that matter. They're resolving those challenges with a simple citation to Tennessee Electric and let's move on, and that's really what should stop. A second reason that you should not try to carve out commandeering cases as being somehow the residuum of the Tennessee Electric dictum is because Tennessee Electric says nothing about commandeering cases. It just talks broadly about Tenth Amendment cases. You know, we can disagree or agree; it's kind of hard to figure out what the nature of the claim was in Tennessee Electric. I don't think it was really much different from the claim that we're raising here, which is in Tennessee Electric they said, well, if the Federal Government gets to regulate power, what's left of State's traditional prerogative to regulate the price for power. Here is if the Federal Government can go in and prosecute you for putting vinegar in your neighbor's goldfish bowl, what's left of local law enforcement. I think they're very similar arguments. But whatever else is true, I just don't think Tennessee Electric limited itself to commandeering claims in any way that would allow you to say that Mr. Dreeben refers to the enduring force of Tennessee Electric. With all due respect, I don't think Tennessee Electric has any enduring force. The central holding of this decision was overruled. The further you go in the decision the less satisfying it is. If you go all the way to reading the Georgia Power case cited in footnote 27 as Justice Breyer has done, and you look at the role of consent of the States, it turns out in the district court opinion, that's in the merits section of the opinion. The Court's already held contrary, actually, to the holding of Tennessee Electric that the utility companies there had standing. So what you see is, you know what happens if you apply the legal interest test, you hopelessly conflate the merits and the standing question. That's kind of happened today in oral argument. That's a bad approach. The Court was right to get rid of it in camp, and it should perfect the camp decision by saying this sentence no longer survives. Two other minor points. One is on the Commerce Clause, I think Justice Alito shows why the Government was right never to make that argument below, but I do think it's important that if this Court says anything about the Commerce Clause issue, it doesn't somehow reinject it in the case in a way that would not allow us to argue that it has been clearly waived in the Third Circuit. The Government gets to confess air, it doesn't get to confess, oh, actually, we have a better argument to defend the statute that we've never raised before. Plain error should be a two-way street, and they should not be allowed to sneak the Commerce Clause back into the case at this late stage. Finally, there is no difference between the separation of powers case and the Federalism case. The best example of that is this Court's Free Enterprise Fund case. When it wants a case to cite for the proposition that the Executive Branch cannot waive or acquiesce in a separation of powers violation, because the separation of powers is there to protect the individual, what does it cite? New York against United States. Please reverse the decision below.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The straightforward question in this case is whether the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides a remedy for a worker injured in a forklift mishap on dry land. The answer is no. A worker injured on dry land from operations on dry land has a remedy in the State workers' compensation law, but not from OCSLA's extension of the Longshore Act to the outer continental shelf. Indeed, both the Benefits Review Board and the Ninth Circuit here held that the accident occurred too far inland for direct coverage under the Longshore Act.",
  "No, it wouldn't count as land, Mr. Chief Justice. If there were platforms on there that were themselves treated as land, that might be. I think most of the 3 miles from shore is going to be the navigable waters, and that might be covered, for example, directly under the Longshore Act. But as I say, one of the anomalies here is there was a direct Longshore Act claim in this case, and the determination was that the facility here was too far inland for direct coverage under the Longshore Act. So, therefore, the counterintuitive proposition on the other side of the table today is that in extending the Longshore Act to the outer continental shelf, Congress effectively created a boomerang effect that caused the Longshore Act to apply further inland than it otherwise would.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, I think the best answer is both of those crashes would be covered directly by the Longshore Act because the Longshore Act by its own terms, not extended by OCSLA, covers the navigable waters, and both of those would be accidents occurring in the navigable waters. And in the part of this Court's opinion in the Pacific Operators case addressing the DOHSA claim, this Court said that a helicopter effectively, when it's performing this kind of ferrying function, is a vessel. So, I would think that the right answer there is not that OCSLA extends the Longshore Act, but the Longshore Act applies directly under those circumstances.",
  "Well, Justice Alito, let me talk first about the causation and then about the smuggling, if I can. As to the causation, I think there is both causation in this 1333(b) and a situs requirement that both sides acknowledge. At a bare minimum, there have to be injuries resulting from operations conducted on the shelf. And I think that alone, that causation principle alone, if faithfully applied, is enough to decide this case in our favor. But let me address the smuggling, because I do think - -",
  "Well, I think the best example would be, Your Honor -- is somebody who's on the shelf but they're not employed in the relevant production purposes. And so, you might have an - -",
  "Well, you might have an accountant out there. You might just have some employees who are out there whale watching or something.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think it's worth recognizing -- I mean, I don't know how many go. I doubt very many go. But Congress passed this statute at a time when they didn't know the full scope of the operations that would take place out on the shelf. And so, what they're trying to do is they're trying to -- at the one point, they're trying to limit it to employees who are engaged in the operations out there that are designed for the production of the mineral wealth of the shelf. And so, I think that's what some of the language is directed at.",
  "Sure. And if he was at the - - on the outer continental shelf at the time of this accident, he probably wouldn't have been injured. But the one thing I think the statute clearly speaks to is not status, but it speaks to, as Justice Alito suggested, at a minimum a relationship between the operations that caused the injury and the fact that those operations have to be conducted on the shelf.",
  "No coverage, Your Honor, and I think that - -",
  "No, I disagree, Your Honor, respectfully, and I think your way of looking at that hypothetical doesn't give sufficient import to the phrase \"conducted on the shelf.\" It's -- what Respondents want to do is they want you to look at the statute as saying as long as there is an injury that results from operations that have the purpose of developing the outer continental shelf, that that's enough. And if that were enough, I think the answer to your hypothetical would be that's covered. But the statute very specifically says that they have to be injuries as a result of operations conducted on the shelf for the purpose of extracting the mineral wealth of the shelf. And so, that first \"on the shelf\" I think clearly modifies the operations. Only operations conducted on the shelf are - -",
  "-- covered by the statute.",
  "Well, you can't add that, Your Honor, because if there's one thing that is absolutely clear about this statute it's that it doesn't include a status test that looks for the predominant place you spend your time. And that's not - -",
  "Well - -",
  "Sure. I mean, I have two arguments, and let me try to address both, which is to say, on the causation point, if you look at just causation and you don't have a situs and a status requirement, then in that scenario, there's no way to get just a status test. And the only thing I would implore you to think about in that is not only is it not in the statute, but there is a statute that has a status-based remedy that travels with the worker wherever they go. It's the Jones Act, and it specifically is written in status terms. And that was a model that Congress had before it, but it specifically rejected the admiralty model for dealing with these structures and adopted the model that has them treated as - -",
  "That's their status test, exactly.",
  "I call that their pure status test, which they themselves cite to Chandris, which is a Jones Act case. That just doesn't work. This was not the Jones Act. Now, there is a test where we say that the best reading of the statute is status plus situs. And if I could try to get this argument out -- it's a little bit complicated, because I think the defect of this argument, if it has one, is it doesn't leap out directly from 1333(b), and you have to read 1333(b) in conjunction with both the rest of 1333 and in conjunction with 903(a) of the Longshore Workers' Act. If you do that, I think you will see there is a situs requirement and a status requirement. Let me start with the rest of the 1333. If you think about this statute, the primary engine for applying Federal law to the shelf is not 1333(b); it's 1333(a). It applies all of Federal law to the shelf. But some statutes, it doesn't work, and the Longshore Act is one of them. If you apply the Longshore Act to the shelf without any modifications, it won't cover the shelf because it by its terms has a situs requirement that is limited to the navigable waters and at that point the drydocks. So, Congress has to tailor the longshore remedy to the reality of the shelf, and it does it in two ways. One, it has this language that everyone's focused on that is something of a status requirement in that it limits the recovery to employees who are engaged in certain activities. But the rest of the language in 1333(b) is important. It's these definitions (1), (2), and (3), and they effectively define terms in the Longshore Act to make them work for purposes of extending it to the shelf. And the key definition is (3). Three defines the term \"United States\" when used in a geographical sense, and it defines it to include the shelf, the artificial islands, and the fixed attachments thereto. Now, that's a puzzle if you look at 1333(b) in isolation, because it's defining the term \"United States\" for geographical purposes, and 1333(b) does not use the term \"United States\" for geographical purposes. But another statute does; it's 903. It's the longshore remedy that's extended. And 903(a) uses the term \"United States.\" And 903(a), if you want to look at, is at page 96 of the petition appendix. But that's the situs requirement. The situs requirement of 903(a) unmodified limits recovery to the navigable waters and drydocks. So, if you take that definition from (b)(3) and essentially superimpose it on 903(a), you then get a remedy that has a situs requirement; there's a recovery, but only if the injury occurs on the navigable waters, drydocks, the shelf, artificial islands, and the attachments thereto. So it's -- as I say, it's a complicated argument, and it doesn't stare you in the face if you look at 1333(b) - -",
  "I don't -- with respect, Justice Sotomayor, I think you get that without OCSLA, which is to say I think that there's a remedy under the Longshore Act directly under the adjacent waters because the adjacent waters are navigable waters.",
  "You don't need those, and that just underscores that Congress in the statute is really dealing with a very particular problem with the shelf and the artificial islands and platforms attached to them.",
  "Same way, Your Honor, which is to say they're navigable waters.",
  "Exactly, and they're not. And the statute I think couldn't be clearer about that because 1332 - -",
  "I'm - -",
  "Well -- and I - -",
  "And if I could take that - - there's a couple of pieces to that, Justice Sotomayor. First of all, I would say that I think that the hypothetical, let's say, of, you know, a nut or something coming off the shelf and hitting somebody somewhere else is -- illustrates the difference between our primary argument and our backup argument. On our primary argument, somebody who -- if the nut hits somebody in the navigable waters, they wouldn't recover from OCSLA; they would recover under the Longshore Act directly because they were on the navigable waters. On our backup theory, that it's a tight proximate cause test, then I would say, yes, that person can recover under OCSLA, but that's really a fortuitous set of circumstances precisely because I wouldn't apply a substantial nexus test, which seems to me just an invitation to kind of play around with - -",
  "Certainly not.",
  "Well, I could live with a proximate cause test as long as it's a proximate cause test that's tailored to the statute. And what I mean by that is I think if you look at the statute, you can't have a proximate cause test that doesn't take geography into account. And I think -- in particular, I think in a case like this, you have to ask yourself not just proximate cause in the abstract, but were there operations somewhere other than the shelf that were a more direct proximate cause of the injury? And if that's the case, then the remedy lies in the law that applies to those other operations.",
  "What's that?",
  "Well, you know, it's -- it's funny because, you know, this Court has on more than one occasion sort of remarked that \"proximate cause\" itself is a weird formulation because \"proximate\" sounds like it has a location aspect to it. And we actually think, for purposes of this statute, that should be right. It's proximate cause as tailored to this statute and the policies of this statute, and I think that would want to really take the geography into account.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I would say two things. One is I do think there's an anomaly here, but I do think it's -- you know, you're not being asked to apply proximate cause for purposes of assessing liability because, as you say, strict liability -- it's kind of automatic liability. But what I would say is you are being asked, at least under the backup theory, to apply proximate cause as a way of determining the geographical scope of the statute. And that's anomalous, but I don't think it's so anomalous that you wouldn't do it if you thought that was the better way to read the statute. That said, I do think that the best way to read the statute is consistent with all the other statutes as part of a jurisdictional puzzle. I mean, all of the areas off of the shelf are governed, with the exception of seamen under the Jones Act, primarily as a matter of geography. So - -",
  "Well, two responses, Justice Ginsburg: First of all, this Court has already confronted the objection that, well, if -- under OCSLA workers would move in and out of coverage, and it rejected it in the Herb's Welding case. And I don't -- I think it's common ground -- well, maybe not, but it should be common ground that if you had a worker who was injured on a State platform, that that would not be covered by -- a State waters platform, that that would not be covered by OCSLA. And, again, that was an anomaly that this Court confronted in Herb's welding and the Court said: Yes, well, you know, workers are going to move in and out of coverage, but that's what OCSLA says. That's what OCSLA does.",
  "Yes, and it's the Longshore Act.",
  "Well, my argument - -",
  "It helps me because 1333(b) doesn't apply a different model. It adopts this model. It adopts and extends the Longshoreman Act to the shelf. See, it's a mistake to read 1333 - -",
  "No, it talks about that as part of extending the Longshore Workers' Act to the shelf. It's important that, you know, you can't get -- I mean, 1333(b), like I said, is not a self-contained offshore workers workers' compensation regime. What it does is it extends the Longshore Workers' Act to the shelf, including 903(a). But what I'm saying is Congress recognized that you couldn't just extend 903(a) and the rest of the Act to the shelf without modification, because then you come to this language that says you only get relief if your injury occurred on the navigable waters or the drydocks attached thereto. So, Congress in (b)(3) changes the definition of the United States for geographical purposes in a way that allows you to superimpose this provision to the shelf, but instead of reading it to say you only get a recovery if you're injured on the navigable waters including the drydocks, you get a recovery if you're injured on the navigable waters, including the shelf, the drydocks, the artificial islands, and the fixtures attached thereto.",
  "That's right. Herb's Welding is not a holding, but at the end of that opinion, the Court confronts this argument that isn't it odd that somebody would be moving in and out of coverage? And the Court says that that is a product of OCSLA. And it doesn't say it's a product of OCSLA generally; it says particularly that it's a product of OCSLA's extension of the Longshore Act. And I do think that this objection about people moving in and out was answered by the Court in Herb's Welding. I would also say, Justice Ginsburg, the second point I wanted to make in response to your earlier question is I understand that it might make policy sense to have coverage that encapsulates an individual no matter where they work. But the problem is -- I mean, that's not only a different model; that's the model that Congress rejected. They thought long and hard about having an admiralty remedy, and presumably then the Jones Act would apply, and if you were attached to a vessel or a platform, then you would have coverage no matter where you went. But that's not what they did. They incorporated instead as their model the Longshore Act, and the Longshore Act always had a situs requirement. So, when Congress makes a conscious effort to deal with this unusual geographical problem with -- and solves the problem with the Longshore Act, which is sitting there with a situs requirement, and doesn't adopt the Jones Act, which has a status-only requirement, it seems very, very peculiar to adopt instead a model that would have a status-only test.",
  "And I think that's -- they rejected that with good reason, Your Honor, because you have to remember that, at this point, they're living with the experience that this Court ultimately resolved. But they're living in real time with the experience of people under the Longshore Act, which at that point, did carve out and limit the remedy, the Federal remedy, only when a State remedy was unavailable. And they were watching that play out, and it was a mess. People didn't know if they should bring a State case or a Federal case, and at that point they were viewed as exclusive. So, Congress had ample reasons to reject the idea that we're going to only give a Federal remedy if a State remedy is unavailable.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I don't know which other statutes you're talking about. I mean, the other statute that most plainly has a situs requirement is the Longshore Act, and that's precisely what they extended to the shelf, as I've argued. Beyond that, it's true that some of the other provisions of this Act have slightly different wording, but I don't think anything turns on that - -",
  "Justice Kagan, first of all, it's interesting. The only way they can say that those functions were performed by the statute anyways is to incorporate provisions of the Longshore Act, because 1333(b) itself doesn't take care of latent injuries or doesn't take care of, you know, who's in the scope of their employment. All of that is taken care of in the Longshore Act, which is why I think the best way to read this is incorporating the Longshore Act and its situs requirement. But, beyond that, I would never ask you to make six words go away, never. Those words do play a function, but the function they play is to make it clear that the injury has to result of operations conducted on the shelf for certain purposes. And that precludes an employee accountant who's out on the shelf and injured by something that has nothing to do with shelf operations.",
  "Justice Kagan, I would beg to differ. And I think what you have to understand is, go back in 1953 and when they're -- I mean, you can say confidently that there aren't accountants on the shelf because you have the benefit of 60 -- 60 years of experience with -- post-1953 with what goes on, on the shelf. Congress at this point is sort of legislating for a brave new world, and they don't -- they're trying to provide for all of the occasions that may come to pass out on the shelf. There is a great law review article that actually provides this background, and it's written by, of all people, Warren Christopher, the Warren Christopher, and it's in the Stanford Law Review, and it was written December of 1953, and it's worth a look because it captures this idea that they're kind of, you know, legislating for this brave new world out there, and they don't know who's going to be out there. They don't know if it's going to be all drill workers or if there's going to be accountants and clerical workers out there. And so, I think with that context, it's not at all odd that they would use those six words to say, kind of the way that Congress did later in 1972 in imposing the marine employment test for longshoremen - - it's like, look, we want to provide a longshore remedy, but not to just anybody, any employee who might happen to be on the shelf; we want to provide it to those people who are essentially in the core operations that are going on, on the shelf. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. A few points in rebuttal. First of all, Justice Kennedy, you asked about deference, and I think before you give any deference to the Government's position, you should look at the other Government's position, which is to say the position that the Government took in its brief to this Court in Pickett v. Petroleum Helicopters in 2002. They have a completely different position now, and they've never explained the difference other than to say what they thought was plausible then they now find persuasive now. That's not enough for deference. And in that brief, they took a position very similar to ours. There has to be status plus situs, albeit a slightly different situs, but otherwise it's on all fours with our position. Second of all, the Government comes up here and says that the longshore remedy is an outlier among workers' compensation remedies because it's the only one with a situs. Well, the problem with that is of all the workers' compensation provisions that Congress could have extended to the outer continental shelf, it picked the Longshore Act with that situs requirement. And the Government also says, well, you know, the reason that the Longshore Act had a situs requirement was because of Jensen, and this Court's decision in Jensen created a problem about whether State workers' comp law could go to the navigable waters. Well, that's the exact same backdrop against which Congress is passing OCSLA. It doesn't know that State workers' compensation law can go to the outer continental shelf. Jensen is still good law. Jensen tells Congress that it can't extend -- States can't extend their laws to the navigable waters. What makes - -",
  "Oh, no, Justice Ginsburg. What States overwhelming did is say a worker could be covered in a different State. But covering them on the outer continental shelf was not something that was well established. And, indeed, Congress specifically heard testimony that questioned the ability of either States to get their workers' comp law there directly and also heard that there might be constitutional problems, because of the Knickerbocker Ice case, of Congress extending the State law there. So, that's why they settled on this remedy of taking this Longshore Act that solved the Jensen problem on the navigable waters and solved the same problem for the outer continental shelf.",
  "As other alternatives like the Jones Act?",
  "Sure, when they were on the shelf. But they were solving the exact same kind of jurisdictional problem they solved with the Longshore Act with the shelf -- with the statute. Justice Sotomayor, I don't think you can read too much into (b)(2). All (b)(2) is doing is modifying the same definition for the longshores. You're an employer if you employ a longshoreman or a longshore worker. So, they're just updating this for purposes of extending a longshore remedy to the shelf; (b)(3) does the same thing, and it modifies the situs and creates a situs that makes sense for the shelf: the navigable waters, drydocks, the shelf, artificial islands, and everything attached thereto. Mr. Chief Justice, you talked about the imprecision of their test. It's worse than that. It's imprecision without any text. At least in the Jones Act, you have the seamen and you have some other textual clues as to where you draw these limits. Here there's nothing in the statute that in any way suggests a status-based test. So, you would be completely unmoored, if you will. The last point I would make is this: The answer to the causation test is really -- the kind of the lie to the other side's position is what they say when they're dealing with somebody who's not a 98 percenter but is a 2 percenter. When that person goes out on the shelf, when are they covered? Well, when the injuries operating on the shelf cause them a direct injury on the shelf. At that point, even the Government resorts to a situs-based test. Well, here's the problem: That status-based test, it's in the Jones Act; it's not in OCSLA. And even when you recognize that and you look at what's left of the case, what's left of the case is either our approach that essentially incorporates the Longshore Act through (b)(3) or a tight nexus test that would require a geographical focus and give -- give force to the words \"conducted on the shelf.\" This person was injured by operations for the purpose of exploring the shelf at some level, but he sure wasn't injured by operations conducted on the shelf for those purposes. He was injured by operations on dry land. And under those circumstances, the remedy lies with the State workers' comp law, not with OCSLA.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State's claim to back rent here is truly remarkable. When these dams were built back in the day, PPL's predecessors, Petitioner's predecessors, secured all the necessary property rights and easements. As part of that process, particularly for the dams that created reservoirs, there was an elaborate process of getting flood easements and, in many cases, paying substantial amounts of money. In that process, nothing was hidden; it was open and notorious. Indeed, the State assisted by lending the utilities its eminent domain power to deal with holdouts. But now, a hundred years later, the State comes in with a holdout claim of its own and suggests that it's entitled to massive compensation based on the small strip of riverbed that lies underneath these flooded reservoirs and the dams. The Montana Supreme Court allowed that claim to succeed to the tune of tens of millions of dollars of back rent. Now, it did --",
  "That's exactly where I was going, Justice Kennedy. I was suggesting that the Montana Supreme Court could only approve this result, which clearly did unsettle settled expectations, by deviating from well-settled principles of Federal navigability law. Now, the mistakes were a little bit different for each of the rivers at issue. As to the Clark Fork and the Upper Missouri, the critical error I believe with the Montana Supreme Court decision was its failure to focus on the river segments that are directly at issue and instead focus on the river as a whole. With the Madison, the errors are different, because, as the Madison, there's no evidence that any stretch of that river was navigable at statehood. So, there the problem was principally that the court relied on modern-day evidence of recreational use to substitute for true historic evidence of commercial navigation at statehood.",
  "Well, I -- I mean, it's close to the end of the trail. I mean, you can go back to The Daniel Ball, but that's not going to help you any more than The Montello. I think, though, that the critical cases really are Utah, but I also think there are other cases that this Court has had. Oklahoma v. Texas would be an example where this Court has looked at a discernible segment of a river. Brewer-Elliott is another one. And I think the starting point for the Court's analysis in every one of these cases has been to look at the segment of the river that's at issue, that has been put at issue. Now, if you have a sovereignty battle between the State and the Federal Government, a lot of times it's the segment of the river within a State, or in Brewer-Elliott it was the segment of the river adjacent to an Indian reservation.",
  "There really isn't, Justice Alito, because we get our common law from England. In England, actually, the common law was different. At England, the navigable waters ended at the ebb and flow of the tide. So, every internal stream within Great Britain was viewed as nonnavigable, and the property belonged to the riparians.",
  "Sure. I mean, it was -- it was adopted as part of -- the sort of -- just the idea of creating the sovereign republic of the United States. We borrowed our common law. I think initially nobody focused on these navigable segments. And it's important to recognize this issue really doesn't even arise in the eastern United States, because until about 1850 this idea that States could own the riverbeds if they were nonnavigable never really occurred to anyone. So, in most of the eastern States as a matter of State law, whether a river is navigable or nonnavigable, the riparian owns to the middle of the streambed. So, after 1851, this Court recognizes -- makes clear to the States that they actually have a choice. And so, the States that come into the Union after 1851, many of them, including Montana, adopt the rule that, well, unless these -- if these streams are nonnavigable, then we take the river stream. And so, that's where the question comes up. So, maybe the reason there isn't a great deal of precedent on this is explained by the fact that this is an issue that largely arises in the western United States. But that's why I think it's such a mistake to kind of look a gift horse in the mouth, so to speak, and not focus on Utah, because Utah is a situation that seems irreconcilable with the Montana Supreme Court decision and the State's basic theory, because there the special master and this Court recognize a nonnavigable segment right in the middle of two navigable portions of stream.",
  "Well, I -- I'm -- I'm happy to try, but I think -- I'm not going to give you --",
  "Well, here -- I'm not going to --",
  "I've thought about this a lot, Justice Sotomayor, and I'm not here to give you a sound bite that's a bright-line definition of \"de minimis.\" I think \"de minimis\" almost by its nature takes its -- its meaning from the context of the inquiry. But let me -- let me offer at least three guideposts that I think are helpful. One, as a practical matter, I think this Court can look to its own cases dealing with islands in navigable stream, and those cases are on page 17 of the Government's brief. And this Court's cases say, if there's a small island in navigable stream, under an acre, of negligible value, we basically ignore it. Later cases, though, came along and dealt with islands that were much larger, and the Court analyzed those separately from the navigable stream and said the United States actually retains ownership to the larger islands, and they don't go. So, that's one place to look. The second place to look, I think, is also a practical judgment based on the nature of the lawsuit. And here the State itself has come in and identified stretches of riverbed that they think are significant enough to generate $50 million in back rent. And I think they, having identified those riverbed stretches as being worth $50 million, are hard pressed to then turn around and say, oh, but they're de minimis, just ignore them. The third rule I would point to is that I think topography has something of a role to play here. If you look at the special master's report in Utah or some of the other cases that have decided the point at which the navigability stops, they've pointed to features of the river as defining a discernible segment like a tributary coming in or the geology of the -- of the bed over which the river runs. If it shifts from kind of a silty loam to hard rock in a canyon, that's something that you can point to.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I mean --",
  "Sure, but, Justice Sotomayor, I think -- I mean, there are sort of two portages that are floating around in The Montello, and I think it's important to distinguish between the two. There's kind of the classic overland portage between the Fox River and the Wisconsin River.",
  "Well, afterwards. But originally that was an overland portage. And so, that's really not at issue, but that's kind of the -- you know, the classic portage I have in mind is an overland portage. Now, they're also talking about the extreme efforts, and you could call them portages. I don't think you need to. But there's also talk about the extreme efforts to enable navigation on the Fox before improvement. But that's nothing like what's at issue here because those were efforts basically to use the riverbed to -- and they had to do some extraordinary things: get ox to pull the boat, lift them up over some rocks. But they never really left the bed of the river there. Where they left the bed of the river was the portage over to the Wisconsin.",
  "Oh, absolutely.",
  "Sure, but my understanding of what was going on there -- and maybe I misunderstood it, but I understand what they're talking about there is a portage where you take the cargo out of the boat in order to lighten the draft of the boat so it's not sitting as deeply in the river, and that allows the lighter boat to be carried over the --",
  "Well -- and that may be, but, I mean, again, I don't think we're talking about anything like the distances that we're talking here, and I also --",
  "Well, sure, because these are all matters of degree, and those would be two different cases. But here's what I would point you to, which is, if at the point that you have to take the cargo off of the boats, and then you then have to leave the channel, you don't just do a little cut around some de minimus amount, but you leave the channel and go overland, at that point, I think, that portage demonstrates the non-navigability of the bypassed stretch. And then I think --",
  "Well, I don't --",
  "Well, two things, Mr. Chief Justice. One is I do want to make clear that we very much dispute factually that there ever was this kind of commercial portage over the Great Falls. And the really -- you know, there's very little evidence for the record. The State's own evidence identifies Fort Benton 30 miles below the Great Falls as the head of navigation on the Missouri. So, there is very much a factual issue here. But to answer the legal question you're asking, first of all, I'm not sure I would have the same instinct about the common parlance if you had to go from JFK to LaGuardia in a cab. And I'm even less sure that you would have the same notion if you had to drive from San Francisco to LA to switch planes. And I think the distance here really does matter. And I would submit the way you think about this, the way I would think about this, is that the very need to bypass, especially a substantial bypass where you leave the river channel, is evidence that that part of the channel, that part of the river, is nonnavigable.",
  "And then the question that's left is whether that's de minimis.",
  "Well, I'm with you on that, Justice Alito, and I think, you know, logically, if you think what's the highway of commerce here, if there really was this 18-mile overland portage route, that would be the highway of commerce, but the 17-mile bypassed stretch of the Missouri and the Great Falls Reach would not be a highway of commerce. And I think that gets back to the expectations of the property owner that ultimately underlie these title questions. I mean, if you have boats going by a river in your backyard, I mean, you have -- you're on sort of notice that you don't own the riverbed. But if you're in a part of the river that's -- that's so unnavigable that it has to be bypassed and you've never seen a boat in your experience ever, then I think you have very different expectations, and your expectations would be the same as somebody who --",
  "It is --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, with respect, if I could take both points, I mean, you're absolutely right. Seventeen miles is very long. I mean, for the New Yorkers, you know, the East River is 16 miles long, the whole river. The Anacostia River is 8-1/2 miles long. So, this bypass stretch --",
  "Well, these -- this is still a big stretch and I do think, like I said, longer than some entire rivers. But the Thompson Falls -- I mean, the 2 miles of the Thompson Fall, I don't know exactly where that number comes from. It's kind of an artificiality. I mean, there -- again, the State's own evidence, look at JA 57, says that navigation stopped at Thompson Falls. There wasn't a portage around. But the other point is I would also ask you to look at the 1910 court decree because, as I said at the outset, you know, these companies didn't just put these dams up overnight as, you know, kind of -- as a lark. They went through elaborate efforts to secure the property rights. That's what generated that 1910 court decree about the Clark Fork River. The Clark Fork River court decree in 1910 addresses a stretch of river specifically that's not just the falls but those 6 miles of the reservoir that's created. And the court holds that that entire region and, indeed, the entire Clark Fork in Sanders County is nonnavigable. So, the stretches that are nonnavigable are much longer than 2 miles. If I may reserve my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. A few points in rebuttal: First, it's --",
  "I mean, I don't have any de minimis portages for you. The portages he's talking about, as far as I can tell, the 5-mile and the 8-mile, are portages between rivers, and that has nothing to do with whether the bypassed stretch of a river would be nonnavigable because it's de minimis, because if you portage between two rivers, you're not bypassing anything. Where I can talk about sort of portages being de minimis, if you look at the special master's report in the Utah case, there are a few places in the Cataract Canyon where he talks about portages, and he talks -- you know, in parts where they got boats to. But the key point is, whenever the Court has talked about portages in the context of navigability, they've pointed to them as suggesting non-navigability, and in certain circumstances said, well, you had to portage a little bit, but that's not enough to make the stretch nonnavigable.",
  "Well, I was going to give you a couple, Your Honor. I'd start with the deeds. You know, the State wants to make something of the fact that the deeds stop at the river. But that's true throughout the State. And the question then becomes, what rule governs the ownership of the riverbeds? And that's where navigability versus non-navigability. So, the deeds don't prove anything. That's just the way the deeds were written. The next point: Justice Kagan, you asked about, you know, do the other owner -- other people on the river have anything to fear. And the answer as far as I heard was, well, these are different. They sit on the riverbed. Well, two things, Your Honor: So do some of the piers, and that's why people have filed amicus briefs and are very concerned. But more to the point, these things have not moved under the riverbed recently. They've been sitting there for a hundred years, and the State lent its eminent domain power to us to help us build these dams. These dams were critical to developing energy and development in this area. And now a hundred years later, they want compensation for the little river strip under that.",
  "We pay the United States compensation right now. The difference is the United States isn't going in afterwards and trying to put a hold-up to us and saying they want $50 million for this. We pay rents to FERC for some of these lands. Actually, the State gets 37.5 percent of that back.",
  "Well, look at footnote 3 of the Government's brief. I mean, again, the problem here is if you want people to have deeds that really parse out whether it's riverbed or upland, they don't because everybody defaults to the bottom line -- the background rule. The background rule is if it's a nonnavigable river, the riparian owners, whether it be the United States or private property owners, get to midway, or if they own both on both sides, they get the whole thing. I think on \"de minimis,\" we talk about it a lot, but I would point out that the one thing we know that's not de minimis from Utah is 4.35 miles, because that's what the Court analyzes separately in the portion of Cataract Canyon. Every stretch at issue here, every dam at issue here, is more than 4.35 miles. Fully five of the dams are on the 17-mile Great Falls stretch, which they agree is impassable. The other five are reservoir dams that create reservoirs that extend over 4.35 miles. So, there's nothing de minimis in the best evidence that is the $50 million in compensation. I think the $50 million in back rent also shows that although this is a dispute between Montana and the United States, my client is caught in the middle of it, and they're obviously concerned about it, too. I want to talk about what's disputed and what's undisputed. What is undisputed is the 17 miles is impassable. That's enough, as I say, to give us judgment as a matter of law for the five dams on that stretch. What is hotly disputed, despite my friend's representation, is whether or not there was through commerce through this bypass route. He suggests it's undisputed that gold went from Helena down to Fort Benton down to St. Louis. And that, of course, is not disputed, but it went on roads. It didn't go on the upper -- on the upper Missouri. And if you want to know who's got the better of this argument, I ask you to think about this question: The United States Army built a 600-mile overland road from Fort Benton, the traditional head of navigation on the Missouri, to Walla Walla, Washington. Now, if the State is right and the upper Missouri and the Clark Fork were navigable, all they had to do is -- is have a 60-mile road to connect the two. They were never navigable. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The judicial maps drawn here are truly remarkable. They reflect the reality that the district court below lost sight of first principles. The court repeatedly invoked the principle that these were only interim maps and not remedial maps, but that obscures the reality that a court has the authority to draw an election map, surely one of the most powerful judicial tools in the judicial arsenal, only if it is identifying specific statutory or constitutional violations or a substantial likelihood thereof.",
  "But - -",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor, obviously, section 5 is clear that the new map drawn by the Texas legislature, the new maps drawn by the Texas legislature, cannot take effect of their own force. But that doesn't answer the question of whether a judge, when having to impose a remedial map to address what all concede is a one-person, one-vote problem with the benchmark maps, can look to the new maps which also remedy that same one-person, one-vote problem, for guidance. And this Court in its - -",
  "That's right, Your Honor. We think they - -",
  "Right. We are -- in fairness, we're asking for it to be used as the starting point for drawing the new map, but that's because - -",
  "No, I don't think so, Your Honor, for a number of reasons. One is that the obligation to go to the preclearance court or to go to the Attorney General remains fully in place. So, the only question is, what is going to inform the district court in Texas's exercise of remedial authority to remedy the one-person, one-vote problem with the remedial plans -- with the benchmark plans, rather? Now, this Court from the very beginning of its reapportionment cases has emphasized the need to look for legislative guidance in order to inform the judicial exercise of solving that reapportionment problem. And the need to look to the new maps I think is most acute, of course, with the congressional maps because the benchmark is -- is a fine map, but it's a map for 32 seats. And Congress here -- the legislature of Texas has spoken as to how it would like to divide the new 36-seat allocation up. And it seems to be quite odd that the court would simply ignore that judgment when it could look to that as the starting point.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, as a practical matter, I suppose at that point Appellees would go to the court in Texas and say you need to revise your interim maps once again. Now, I think, since the premise for the court drawing its interim maps is that time is of the essence, it can't wait any longer, the Texas court may deny that motion or it may grant that motion. I mean, I don't -- I don't really have a crystal ball to take that into account. But what I do think is particularly anomalous is let's suppose that the D.C. court does deny preclearance. At that point, it's common ground that the plan, the legislatively enacted plan, even though it's denied preclearance, would be something that the Texas court would have to defer to. That's basically Upham. So, it's the oddity of the other side's position - -",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I mean it's true that the Justice Department does raise a purpose objection to the plans as a whole, but of course even that takes its force from the way particular districts are being drawn. It seems to me quite likely that -- you know, obviously, our position is that the D.C. court is most likely to grant preclearance. But if they were to deny it, it seems quite likely that they would deny it as to particular districts. And then Upham would make clear that you would give -- that the Texas court would give deference to the legislative plan. And the anomaly of the other side's position is you give less deference to a plan when preclearance is pending than you do when preclearance is denied.",
  "Well, Justice Alito, two - - two answers: One is, as a practical matter, all of the affected, you know, entities in Texas have gotten together, and they've agreed on the ability to move the primary back to April, given -- on the assumption that a map could be in place by February 1st. Now, you know, the primary has been moved from March to April already. So, I can't tell you that it's impossible to move it again, but it's also quite, you know, in a sense -- I mean, the question becomes - - I mean, Texas has made its own determination that it wants to have a relatively early primary. That's not something it cocked up for this set of elections. It's had that in place since at least 1988. And so, the question is how much do you want to interfere with that judgment?",
  "Well, look, Texas wants the Court to have the opportunity to get this right. We think the decision below is profoundly wrong. We think it's important for this Court to send a clear signal to the courts that would provide relief not just in this case but to future situations where this arose.",
  "Sure.",
  "Well, I don't think there's a road map for the extent to which they give a road map. I think there are two things that are crystal clear. One is that when the D.C. authority, be it the Attorney General or the court, denies preclearance, it denies preclearance. The plan is not precleared. There's no such thing as preclearance in part or partial preclearance. As the Justice Department puts it, it doesn't work like a line item veto. Now, that's not to say -- and here's the second point. That's not to say that the court doesn't provide reasoning for its decision, or the Attorney General. And that's why in Upham, for example, that the Court - - this Court knew that the objections were to two particular districts, even though the effect in Upham was to not preclear the whole plan. And it seems to me the mistake of the district court is it effectively treats the un-precleared plan as a nullity. And that's the exact word that Judge Johnson used in the lower court opinion in Upham. And this Court reversed because it said no, you don't ignore that, but on the other hand, what you do is you take into account the judgment of the Attorney General in that case; but other than that, you take the plan into account notwithstanding the fact that it hasn't been precleared.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, here's why we're -- we're not asking the regional court to mimic the D.C. court's function. We're asking it to perform correctly the one -- one of the roles that this Court has always made clear the regional court retains. And that's to provide temporary relief. If you look at this Court's decisions that essentially warn off a regional court from arrogating to itself the final preclearance decision -- I'm thinking, for example, of Connor v. Waller -- those same decisions say: But this is not with prejudice to your ability to provide temporary relief. Now, our position is quite simple. If we're in a situation where the regional court has to provide temporary relief, then it should apply the same standards that always apply everywhere to courts issuing temporary relief.",
  "Justice Kagan, I think we are taking that into account. I mean -- and I think that's at the heart of what's going on here. You have to ask yourself the question: What is the remedy that the Texas court in this case was trying -- what is the violation, rather, that the Texas court was trying to remedy? The Appellees proceed and I think your question proceeds on the assumption as if the violation is a section 5 violation. But that's not what motivated the court's opinion, and you can -- I mean, look at page 96 of the Joint Appendix, where the court specifically says: Look, Texas has always been clear. They need to get preclearance. So, this is not about enjoining them from implementing the plan. The constitutional violation that's being remedied here and the only thing that gave the Texas court any authority is the one person, one vote violation with the old plans. And so, the - -",
  "Well, I think on January 9th, Justice Breyer, you should take another look at El Paso County. Because I think if you look at El Paso County - -",
  "In either the congressional map or the house map. I think if you look at El Paso County, what you cannot conclude is that all -- -",
  "What's that?",
  "Well, it depends. If we're looking at the congressional map, I believe it's district 16 or 17. And that's -- those maps start on page 1.",
  "Well, I mean, I think you're understating it. I mean, on the benchmark plan - -",
  "-- that was a straight line.",
  "On the enacted plan, it was a different straight line.",
  "And in the court's plan - -",
  "I want to -- I want to say two reasons why it's wrong, but first I think that really does answer your premise, which is that all the court was doing was remedying one person, one vote.",
  "No, what I'm -- I'm not saying it's my strongest case. I'm saying it's illustrative of the problem. Another thing that's illustrative of the problem - -",
  "The problem is that the court lost sight of what it was supposed to be doing. It was supposed to be - -",
  "And what's wrong with it is because they neither started with the old benchmark plan and said we're going to solve a one person, one vote problem, nor did they start with the new legislative plan and say is. There some violation that allows us to change that plan? They instead, as they told you, said that they were on their own drawing an independent map.",
  "What I was hoping to say is that they -- they told you they were drawing an independent map, and what they told you is that they thought that they were under an affirmative obligation not to defer to the legislative enactment because it hadn't been precleared. And the oddity of this -- I mean, look, you're right. In certain places, they then turn around and say: But we deferred where we could. But the oddity of their position is their first premise, which is the one thing we can't do in drawing these maps, is look at that -- look at that un-precleared map. There's no explanation for why -- if that premise was right, why would it be even a good thing that they were pointing to the other map.",
  "The basic principle they violated is they drew an interim order that they thought wasn't a remedial order without it being based on any finding of substantial likelihood of a violation.",
  "You may be right. You may be right. There may be a problem with those maps in El Paso. I don't think so, and I'd like to talk about that. But if the district court had said, you know, there's a problem with this because the two - the two antler -- the deer with two antlers, that violates -- that's a substantial likelihood of violating the Constitution. We're going to remedy that. If that's what they did, this would be a very different case. Now, I do want to talk about the deer with two antlers, because what that ignores is that in the benchmark plan, the deer had one antler and an antenna. And so, the district court -- the map the district court drew doesn't look anything like the benchmark, and actually the map that the legislature drew looks very much like the benchmark. And so, I think that just shows that what was going on here by the district court was something very different from either remedying a one-person, one-vote problem with the benchmark or from correcting specific identified problems with the legislative map.",
  "Well, that is the case, Your Honor, and that is one of the many problems with the way that the court proceeded here. Because once you lose sight of the fact that, look, we only have remedial authority if we're remedying substantial likelihood of violations that are identifiable and particular, well, then what are you going to do? What this district court did, after he started where Justice Breyer suggested, is that the district court judges then said, look, we want to avoid the challenges that are brought by the plaintiffs. And what they mean by \"avoid\" is they basically take all the allegations at face value and then redraw the district to avoid this.",
  "Absolutely no problem at all - -",
  "-- Justice Kennedy. And the great thing about that is that gives the district court a familiar role to play applying familiar standards, and it gives this Court something to review.",
  "Can I -- can I respond to that, Justice Ginsburg, as follows? Which is, I had assumed that Justice Kennedy's question was not specific to section 5 and could just as well be a section 2 problem - -",
  "-- or an equal protection under the Constitution problem. And in this case, there is no problem. All the court is doing is making a substantial likelihood determination of an issue that it's ultimately going to confront.",
  "Absolutely, Justice Kagan. But I think it's important to understand that to the extent that the district court in this remedial phase should take section 5 into account, it's just in considering whether or not the remedial plan is consistent with section 5 principles. And that's what the judges did in this case with respect to their own plan. So, we're not asking them to do something with section 5 that they otherwise wouldn't do. And, again, I think if you come back to the particular question of what are they trying to remedy - - I mean, they're trying to remedy the one person, one vote problem. So, if that's what they're trying to remedy, why wouldn't they take into account the legislative policy judgments reflected in the un-precleared plan if that's -- if that's the state we're in, if that's the snapshot we're in. I mean, keep in mind, this Court has throughout - -",
  "Two things, Justice Kagan: One, I would beg to differ that what section 5 says is that there's no presumption of regularity. And I think that's -- it's not just a quibble because I think if what section 5 says is that there's no presumption of regularity or no presumption of good faith, then section 5 I think is closer to the constitutional edge than this Court said in Northwest Austin. I think all it says - -",
  "Absolutely. But I don't think that means that the assumption is that the legislature didn't act in good faith in enacting the provision. And that brings me to my second point - -",
  "Okay. I agree, but then the question is, if there's not a presumption of bad faith, then why wouldn't the court take that legislative judgment into account in drawing its remedy for the one person, one vote violation in the remedial district? If I could add my second point, which is the other thing to keep in mind is the preclearance obligation is not driven by congressional judgment that these covered jurisdictions are particularly bad at remedying one person, one vote problems. Obviously, section 5 is driven by concerns about racial discrimination. So, in that sense, it's particularly odd, given that what's at issue here is a remedy for a one person, one vote problem, that you would assume that you're not going to take into account the legislature's judgment as reflected in an un-precleared plan.",
  "Well, I think you try to split the difference by trying to apply the preliminary injunction standards. And I think if you do that, then what you're going to do is that you're going to ensure that the remedy that the district court draws for -- as an interim matter for the one person, one vote problem, which is not the same thing as preclearance, that remedy is both consistent with the legislative policy judgments but also with section 2, with the Equal Protection Clause. And I suppose if this Court wants to, it can say that for purposes of interim temporary relief, the Court can look at section 5 directly. I would think the better answer is, no, you just focus it on section 2, the Equal Protection Clause, and then you ensure that the judicial plan is consistent with section 5 principles, because that's the test that the Court's going to apply in any event.",
  "I -- I don't think Judge Smith -- if I can answer your question, I think this does: I don't think Judge Smith did this the way that we think he should or focused on the benchmark. If you look at the congressional plan, what he did is he just basically picked one of the proposals that was a bipartisan proposal, so-called C216. With respect to the house plan, I think he got it -- the Texas house plan -- I think he got it closer to right. But I don't think he applied the right standard. And I would ask you to look at Joint Appendix 193, and particularly his consideration of house district 33, because there what Judge Smith did is said, well, you know, there's these allegations, and I find this -- he said the State has persuasive responses, but out of an abundance of caution I'm going to redraw the district. That doesn't seem quite right. I mean, if the State really does have persuasive responses, that ought to be enough to not redraw the district.",
  "That's right, but it's -- it's certainly a fair improvement over what the district court majority did. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points in rebuttal. As one of Justice Alito's questions highlighted, one of the things that makes remedying a one person, one vote problem particularly unique is there's literally an infinite number of ways to solve the problem. And for that reason, this Court has always looked wherever it could to legislative guidance, so much so that in White v. Weiser, this Court looked for legislative guidance to a plan that had been declared unconstitutional for failing to accommodate one person, one vote problems, but yet this Court still said that the district court erred in not taking that into account to the extent that it could. As to the hard choice, if it comes to that, of using either the legislative plan that reflects the legislative will or the judicial plan that even the United States concedes is flawed, I think this Court has faced even more difficult choices in the past: Bullock v. Weiser and in Whitcomb. And in both of those cases, this Court chose between an adjudicatedly unconstitutional State plan and a judicial remedy that it determined was flawed. And in both cases, it ordered the election to take place under the flawed constitutionally adjudicated imperfect plan. Compared to that, simply saying that an election should go forward under a plan that hasn't been precleared is a far less serious step. Now, there was a reference made to the 3 days of hearings. But the problem is, 3 days of hearings with an unadministrable standard is worse than 1 day of hearing with an unadministrable standard. And what we ask is for a preliminary injunction standard that's familiar to everybody, everybody understands, and everybody can apply.",
  "Well, I'll join everybody in saying that that's -- that's better than the -- than the worst alternative I face, which is to say it's better than the district court's opinion. But here's why it shouldn't: That actually further intrudes on the D.C. court because the question that the remedial court should not be asking is, geez, do I really think -- you know, what are the odds that the D.C. court is going to preclear? It shouldn't ask that question at all. It should ask the questions that are before it. Is there a section 2 violation? Is there an equal protection violation? If there aren't those and I use the State's plan, does that create a section 5 violation? That's different from the preclearance question. And on that section 5 question, the burden is not logically on the State. And that's the same section 5 question that the court considered on its own motion, because it understands that even when it takes a plan, it has to be consistent with section 5 principles. Now, Justice Kennedy, you've asked the question, what if we take section 5 out of this, what happens? Then it's an easy case. Then it's the preliminary injunction standard. Now, the objection to that, of course, is, well, but how can you take section 5 out of it? But there's not interference with section 5 because Texas still understands it needs to get preclearance. Before its changes can take permanent effect, it absolutely, positively needs preclearance. It's never wavered from that recognition. So, you go back -- I'll - -",
  "Okay. Well, I was simply going to say if you go back, the default problem here is that there's an infinite number of solutions. It's particularly a problem with respect to the congressional map, where there's now four new seats. There's nothing else to defer to than the judgment of the legislature reflected in this plan, notwithstanding that it hasn't been precleared. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2005, the City of -- the City of Indianapolis decided that it wanted to abandon its reliance on the Barrett Law, a program that had proved unpopular for financing public improvements. In doing so, they decided to make a clean break and forgive the outstanding balances that were due under the Barrett Law program. The alternative of maintaining those accounts and maintaining the tax liens associated with those accounts for nearly three decades was particularly unattractive. Now, the -­",
  "Well, Justice Alito, it -- it might well be rational. I mean, sometimes things that make policy sense that the public likes also make good government sense. And in this context, what they wanted to do is they wanted to get out of the Barrett Law business. That's the exact words -­",
  "Can I put it very concretely? I mean, before this -- you know, when they used to have the Barrett Law and used it on an ongoing basis, within the controller's office, they had a Barrett Law office. They wanted to get rid of the Barrett Law office. How do you get rid of the Barrett Law office? You get of the obligation to continue to collect these payments for 30 years; you get rid of the obligations to keep all these files together and see whether you're in a position to enforce a tax lien.",
  "Well, Justice Alito, of course, they could have continued to collect. I think that's common ground here, which I think ultimately shows why this is a very curious equal protection theory, because if the city would have continued to collect these, you know, for 30 years, then they agree, there's no Equal Protection Clause problem at all. Now, I think as Justice Kagan was suggesting, if you now create a rule that says when they do forgive, they actually have to provide refunds and face Equal Protection Clause violations, then in the future, nobody is going to ever forgive. What they're going to do in the future is, even though they're trying to move away from this policy, even though they're trying to get out of the Barrett Law business, they're going to be stuck.",
  "No, Justice Kennedy, I don't think that's right. But the fact that that's your reaction I think shows that this is not really an equal protection claim, and it's not really like Allegheny Pittsburgh because, as your colloquy with Mr. Stancil suggested, they would admit that if the government said, as part of the Barrett Law, look, you know, we reserve the right to abandon the Barrett Law, and if we do so, we -- you know, we may forgive installment payments -­ if they said that, the equal protection claim would go away in their view.",
  "Two differences, Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, you know, there's no -- there's no real analogue to Allegheny Pittsburgh because Allegheny Pittsburgh is a one time in time case. There the problem was that statute was very different. It was facially neutral, and it was being applied in an unequal way. Nothing, not one word, in Allegheny Pittsburgh suggests that if the State of West Virginia wanted to change its policy and adopt proposition 13 as the law of West Virginia, that it couldn't do so. And that's the anomaly here. This equal -- this equal treatment requirement they get, they get it from the Barrett Law.",
  "That's the exact law that -­",
  "No, I -- with respect, I think it's the change that makes this case different from Allegheny Pittsburgh. It's the change that makes this government action rational. This would be a different case if they didn't change the Barrett Law program, and they just stuck by it and said, you know, we're going to forgive some people. But here they decide they're going to -­ they're going to abandon the very law that imposes, supposedly -- I want to talk about what State law really does. But it supposedly imposes this equal protection requirement. That's the very law they want to move away from.",
  "And this idea that -­",
  "Well, you know, I count five, Justice Alito. If you want to hear -- I mean, I'll go through them. One is what I call making a clean break, having not to deal with the vestiges of the old program. You may call it political expedience. I don't think it is. I think that's, you know, a good government concern. The second is avoiding the administrative burdens of particularly the refund process. And I think it's worth recognizing that -- you know, they say, well, what could be simpler; just cut a check. But to whom and for what amount? I mean, you know, if you're going to go back to close accounts, the first thing you're going to have to confront is what do we do with the people that have sold their house? Well, I mean, you know, we've got to figure out where they are now. We've got to figure out, I mean, do we -­",
  "Well -- okay. But, if I could, they don't challenge the forgiveness. So, the reason that I'm trying to explain that there are rational bases for not giving refunds is because the challenge that's really brought here is to Resolution 101, and it's -­",
  "-- it's forgiveness without refunds.",
  "Would have the option what, Mr. Justice Kennedy?",
  "They certainly have the option in the future. I think it's a dispute between the parties whether they have the option as a part of the remedy. I would say, not to get ahead of myself, but to address the remedy, this is very different from Allegheny Pittsburgh. And it has to be that one option is to simply invalidate Resolution 101. I'm not -- I don't -- I'm not aware of any other area of the law where you can have a statute or an ordinance that draws an invalid distinction, and one remedial option is not to invalidate the statute or the ordinance. And that's the position. Their position is, you know, if you would have put something in there that said we're not going to do anything, you'd be fine. But having given forgiveness and said we're not going to give refunds, you're stuck not only with the forgiveness but also with giving refunds.",
  "No, Mr. Justice Kennedy, because the expectation here is at the time of Resolution 101. At the time of Resolution 101, I think it's common ground. The city was under no obligation to provide forgiveness. So, if in 101, by providing forgiveness without refunds, they violated the Equal Protection Clause, why isn't the logical remedy for that to simply invalidate Resolution 101? No forgiveness; everybody gets equal treatment.",

  "No, I think they said that was, with respect -­",
  "Exactly.",
  "No, but -­",
  "Right. So, then you -­",
  "If the law that created the violation is Resolution 101, than the remedy in every other area of constitutional law, including sex discrimination, is clearly that the State has the option. They can level up or they can level down. The only case that's different is Allegheny Pittsburgh and the assessment cases it relies on. But there's an important difference.",
  "Sure, there is, Your Honor. I mean, you look to a number of places. I would look to Carmichael v. Southern Coal where, you know, this Court is confronting a case where the State says, you know, we're not going to tax employers -- employers who are smaller than eight, because, you know, the game is not worth the candle. And in a similar way here, they say we want to get out of the Barrett Law business. We want to make a clean break. And they say, you know, we don't want to keep this office in the controller's office.",
  "I would have thought, Justice Scalia, if this was an equal protection case, not a contracts case, not a Winstar case, not an estoppel case, if this was an equal protection case, the relevant time period would be the time period of the ordinance that's challenged, Resolution 101. At that time, there is a difference already in real-world fact between those who've paid in full and those who have outstanding balance, and are going to keep the city in the Barrett Law business for three decades.",
  "It -­",
  "No, it -- it could be. There still has to be a rational basis for it.",
  "And -- and -­",
  "Right, but a rational basis is -- boy, you know, we have two sets of accounts. Half of these accounts are going to be a nightmare to maintain. We have an estimate from our controller -- this is in the Cox litigation, but it's cited in one of the amicus briefs. We've got an estimate from our controller that's going to cost us $200,000 to upgrade and maintain this system. We really don't want to spend that.",
  "Now, is that $200,000 associated -­",
  "With all due respect, Mr. Chief Justice, you're making this sound like it's an estoppel case, like it's a Winstar case. It's not a broken promise case. This is an equal protection case. And the reason there's a rational difference at the time Resolution 101 is, is because that point in time has passed and they're in an different position. But I also do want to make clear that you will look in vain in the Barrett Law for this stern promise that no matter what happens, we will eventually collect the same amount from everybody. What there is, is there is a requirement for equal assessment in the first instance -- nobody says that was violated -- and then, if you elect four installments, there's a provision that says you shall collect. The irony of their position is they say it's perfectly okay for the city to break that promise. It's perfectly okay to give forgiveness. They don't have a quorum -- a quarrel with forgiveness. They want forgiveness. They just want to get some refunds, too, as a result.",
  "Justice Alito, as I hear you, you've switched from rational basis to it has to be, you know, a net -- unless we can show a net loss, we lose. Why can't we make a rational judgment that there's a unique $200,000 cost associated with maintaining this program? We don't want to maintain the program. It's tremendously politically unpopular. We've moved away from it. We don't want to -- I mean, can you imagine the city -­",

  "Do you really think -­",

They'd get laughed at. They couldn't do that. And if they could make that judgment in -­ another way of thinking about it, 10 years from now, okay, they've collected everything from the 10-year payers.

  "No, it's not what it's about, the way you're describing it. Maybe there's a takings claim for somebody to bring, but it's not an equal protection claim.

  "Yes.",
  "Yes, that's the -- I -- I -­ that's the provision I already mentioned about appraisals. That's talking about the costs -­",
  "The costs of the project when they are doing the appraisal. When they're coming up with the cost for how much it's going to cost to stick the pipes in the ground, they have a law that says it has to be divided equally among the lots. That's an assessment. There's a specific provision that you can challenge the assessment if you don't like it. Once you don't challenge it, it's final. There's actually two provisions in the Barrett Law that you won't search in vain for that talk about the interest of finality, which is yet another reason that justifies the differential treatment here between people who have paid in full, their accounts are closed, and people who have ongoing outstanding balances.",
  "They're referring to the costs of the project, the improvement, that will then be reflected -­",
  "No, but it's the costs that are then reflected in the assessment on each lot. And there's then a process for challenging that assessment on the assumption that the costs are allocated equally to each lot, and then when that's done, the finality provisions kick in.",
  "And nobody says there was anything wrong.",
  "With respect, that's not. The original idea is, sure, you know, we're going to assess the costs of the project equally among everybody whose benefiting from the project. And then we're going to have an assessment, and if the Barrett Law doesn't change, the assumption is everybody's going to pay the same amount. I'm not here to tell you otherwise, but the point is the Barrett Law, like most laws, doesn't have a clause that plans for its own demise. It doesn't say, well, you know, if -- if we get rid of this law, we either will or will not enforce the installments. And I think the question here is at a different point in time when they've made a different judgment -- we don't like the Barrett Law. It's proven unpopular. It's proven unwieldy. It's not just popularity or political. It's that, you know, they're facing lots of low-income subdivisions with septic tanks, and, you know, they're forcing the prospect of trying to get people to pay $10,000 to improve a -- the sewer on a house that's worth $50,000. They realize that's a non-starter. We've got to get out of this business.",
  "It's not just popularity. You know, every once in a while the people have a point. And it's not just that they don't like something; it's their right to not like it. And they're very much right to not like a law that says you got a $50,000 house and we're going to make you pay for a $10,000 sewer hook-up. They were right to get out of the business. Having done that, I don't understand why they're saddled with a provision of law that exists in the old law that they're trying to get away from. And just to be clear -- I mean, if you want to look at a case that I think shows you why the State law is not as equality über alles as they're presenting, take a look at an old Indiana case called Allendorf, 176 N.E. 240. That's a case where some people in the project challenged the -- the assessment, said, you know, that's unfair; it's too much. Other people paid in full. The people who challenged it went to court. They eventually settled with the city for a reduced amount. Then later on the people who had paid in full went into court and said we're entitled to pay no more than those guys. You know what the Indiana appellate court said? No dice. That doesn't work. You basically -- you either waived your right in express waiver or if you paid in full, it's -- you know, it's too late. It's too late. So, the -- and this is, with respect, I think part of the problem with the Allegheny Pittsburgh, and particularly this extension of it. You're putting so much weight on the State law, and it gets you in this business of flyspecking the Barrett Law. I mean, you know, this -- I mean, Justice Thomas made this point very well in the Nordlinger case, that there's an anomaly here, which is you're looking -­ supposed to be looking at Federal law, and the violation seems to be tied to potentially a violation of State law. If I could focus on that for a minute, because this is another really important difference between Allegheny Pittsburgh and this case, which speaks right to the remedy. In Allegheny Pittsburgh, it's a facially neutral statute. And so, it would be an anomaly there to say that when there's a facially neutral statute, you're going to invalidate the -- the statute. The statute's fine. The problem is you've been assessed at 100 percent; everybody else has been assessed at 50 percent. The Court in that unique context says, you know, there's no obligation to go and sort of mandamus the assessor, to bring everybody else up. You get to sort of go back to that level. This is very different. The challenge here, like in Nordlinger, is a challenge to a distinction drawn in a law. Resolution 101, unlike the law in Allegheny Pittsburgh, is not facially neutral. It draws a distinction. So, the relevant question is the rationality of that distinction. Is it rational? We submit there are multiple reasons why it is rational. But if you disagree with me, the obvious remedy is to strike down the statute or at least remand to the State court with express instructions that they have the option, which is exactly what happened in the sex discrimination cases. And, Justice Scalia, if you're worried about incentives and standing, look at Heckler v. Mathews, another sex discrimination case. This exact issue came up. And what the Court said is standing is based on your right to guaranteed equal treatment. Whether or not it's a pocketbook injury, you have standing if you're denied equal treatment. Now, these guys may have been denied equal treatment on the assumption they're right. But they can get equal treatment restored just as easily by Resolution 101 being invalidated in full as they can by getting an additional windfall by getting a refund. And as Justice Alito -­",
  "Okay. But, I mean, that's a big difference because that's different from what they're saying. They're saying there's no remedial option. They're saying we are stuck now. We -- we have to give refunds. That's the only permissible constitutional remedy. And, obviously, the city would prefer to get out of the Barrett Law business and to provide these forgiveness, but it would certainly be a lot better for the city if they would at least -- this Court made clear, they have the option of leveling up or leveling down. I do think, though, that gets to Justice Kagan's -­",
  "Yes.",
  "If that were the rule, Heckler v. Mathews would have come out the other way. The Court was -- you know, the Court -­",
  "Well, they were talking about a specific situation (a) under Federal law. So, I don't know why the rule would be the same. And the sex discrimination cases are much more on point for purposes of this. But they're also talking about a very specific context where you have a limitation on a benefit. And the idea is, if you strike down the limitation, the default option is everybody gets the benefit. This is different. I mean, you know, really what Heckler is talking about is severability concerns. There's no severability that works here. Resolution 101 -- if you look at it, it doesn't say anything about refunds. It simply says we're going to forgive the balances on the outstanding accounts. If that's somehow impermissible, then the law goes. There's nothing to sever. There's nothing -­ there's not one word in the statute about refunds. And that's different from the context where you have a general extension of benefits and you have some limitations on the benefits.",
  "And -- and in what amount?",
  "Well, you're absolutely right. And, you know -- and, you know, I talked about the question -­",
  "Well -- okay. Then the answer is it would be an administrative nightmare. If I understand the question -­",
  "With respect to -­",
  "Well, with respect, what I heard him say is we probably would. And I think we certainly would as to most of the projects. There might be a couple of the projects where the differences are so small that he would say there's no gross inequality there. But as to most of the other projects, there are still substantial differences -­",
  "It involves -- you know, I don't -- I know the number of projects. It's like 20 projects. So, I'm guessing it's at least 1,000 people. And then, of course, somebody's going to come in if we do that, as you suggested, and say wait a second -­",
  "The stakes in the other case without interest I think are $2.7 million. So, you know, I think the -- the ballpark figures are right.",
  "It's -- it's a class action, the Cox -- the Federal litigation. But still, that's not a -- that's not an insubstantial amount. Of course, the relevant question is not, you know, are the damages a set figure after you've had litigation in Federal court? The question is what is the city administrator, at the time he's trying to decide whether he has a refund obligation, to do? And, Justice Scalia, you said, well, it's clear as mud. I mean, did you listen to the answer about gross inequality? What, are they supposed to run it through the gross inequality calculator that tells them, well, you know, it's close, but it's not really -­ there's not a discrete obligation? I don't know how -- I would not know how to advise them as to which of the other 21 projects they owed a refund to and which they didn't. I would be at a complete loss. And the reason -­",
  "No, actually it would -- plus this one. So, it would be a little over 3.",
  "Well, I mean -­",
  "Yes, in this case. And the -­ and the law that you develop here is not going to be limited to this case; it's going to apply in other contexts as well. Heaven knows where it stops. As I said, Allegheny Pittsburgh -- it was at least limited to a particular context. Now, I mean, I don't know why any city ever -- I mean, maybe this is the limiting principle that no city ever again will provide amnesty or forgiveness under any circumstances.",
  "But, Mr. Chief Justice, it's the -­",
  "It's the same principle. I mean, I could certainly see some -- you know, suppose the city elects a laissez-faire mayor and says you know what? Parking tickets -- it's not worth the hassle; we're going to getting out of the parking ticket enforcement business, and we're going to forgive everybody their parking tickets. If I had just paid my parking tickets, I'd be hacked off, but I wouldn't feel like I had a Federal constitutional right to get my money back. And that's the difference -­",
  "I think if they really got rid of the -- the Federal tax forever, I don't think there would be an equal protection violation. I think there might be a different constitutional violation. If you listen to him, the first thing he ticked off about why that would be so horrible is there was no notice. Well, that sounds like a due process concern to me, not an equal protection concern. And that's really what's happening here. When they transport Allegheny Pittsburgh from the context it arose in to this very different context, they're converting it from an equal protection case to something more like a contract clause case or to a Winstar case or something like that. And not one word in that opinion suggests that once a State adopts a certain policy, that it's trapped. It can't make a reasonable and rational transition away from that policy to a policy that better serves the citizenry.",
  "And if it doesn't -­",
  "Well, I think the one -- I don't think there's a demographic difference. I think the one concrete difference that really is a difference is, from the city's perspective, they're looking at two groups, all of whom are going to have to pay a new higher monthly fee. And I think they can make a rational decision that says, look, you know, one of these groups has to make two monthly payments to the city for sewer and water. That seems a little crazy. So, why are we -- what we'll do is we'll just make everybody in the city in terms of their ongoing payments to the city for sewer and water -- we will treat them all exactly the same. One fee. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The mandate represents an unprecedented effort by Congress to compel individuals to enter commerce in order to better regulate commerce. The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate existing commerce. It does not give Congress the far greater power to compel people to enter commerce, to create commerce essentially in the first place. Now, Congress when it passed the statute did make findings about why it thought it could regulate the commerce here, and it justified the mandate as a regulation of the economic decision to forgo the purchase of health insurance. That is a theory without any limiting principle.",
  "That's right, Justice Sotomayor. We say, consistent with 220 years of this Court's jurisprudence, that if you regulate the point of sale, you regulate commerce, that's within Congress's commerce power.",
  "Well, Justice, I think there's two points to make on that. One is a lot of the discussion this morning so far has proceeded on the assumption that the only thing that's at issue here is emergency room visits, and the only thing that's being imposed is catastrophic care coverage. But, as the Chief Justice indicated earlier, a lot of the insurance that's being covered is for ordinary preventive care, ordinary office visits, and those are the kind of things that one can predict. So, there's a big part of the market that's regulated here that wouldn't pose the problem that you're suggesting; but, even as to emergency room visits, it certainly would be possible to regulate at that point. You could simply say, through some sort of mandate on the insurance companies, you have to provide people that come in -- this will be a high-risk pool, and maybe you'll have to share it amongst yourself or something, but people simply have to sign up at that point, and that would be regulating at the point of sale.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, we don't think it's a matter of timing alone, and we think it has very significant substantive effects, because if Congress tried to regulate at the point of sale, the one group that it wouldn't capture at all are the people who don't want to purchase health insurance and also have no plans of using health care services in the near term. And Congress very much wanted to capture those people. I mean, those people are essentially the golden geese that pay for the entire lowering of the premium --",
  "Well, I don't know, Justice Kennedy, but, if it is, I think there's at least two problems with it. One is, as Justice Alito's question suggested earlier -- I mean, somebody who is not in the insurance market is sort of irrelevant as an actuarial risk. I mean, we could look at the people not in the insurance market, and what we'd find is that they're relatively young, relatively healthy, and they would have a certain pool of actuarial risks that would actually lead to lower premiums. The people that would be captured by guaranteed rating and community issue -- guaranteed issue and community rating would presumably have a higher risk profile, and there would be higher premiums. And one of the things, one of the things, Congress sought to accomplish here was to force individuals into the insurance market to subsidize those that are already in it to lower the rates. And that's just not my speculation, that's Finding (I) at 43a of the Government's brief that -- it has the statute. And that's one of the clear findings.",
  "No. I don't think it is, Justice Ginsburg. I think there are other options that are available. The most straightforward one would be to figure out what amount of subsidy to the insurance industry is necessary to pay for guaranteed issue and community rating. And once we calculate the amount of that subsidy, we could have a tax that's spread generally through everybody to raise the revenue to pay for that subsidy. That's the way we pay for most subsidies.",
  "The government might be able to do that. I think it might raise some issues about whether or not that would be a valid exercise of the taxing power.",
  "Well, I do think that --",
  "Well, I think it would depend a little bit on how it was formulated, but my concern would be -- the constitutional concern would be that it would just be a disguised impermissible direct tax. And I do think -- you know, I mean, I don't want to suggest we get to the taxing power too soon, but I do think it's worth realizing that the taxing power is limited in the ability to impose direct taxes. And the one thing I think the Framers would have clearly identified as a direct tax is a tax on not having something. I mean, the framing generation was divided over whether a tax on carriages was a direct tax or not. Hamilton thought that was a indirect tax; Madison thought it was a direct tax. I have little doubt that both of them would have agreed that a tax on not having a carriage would have clearly been a direct tax. I also think they would have thought it clearly wasn't a valid regulation of the market in carriages. And, you know, I mean, if you look at Hylton v. The United States, that's this Court's first direct tax case.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, let me start at the beginning of your question with McCulloch. McCulloch was not a commerce power case.",
  "It was not -- no, the bank was not justified and the corporation was not justified as an exercise of commerce power. So that is not a case that says that it's okay to conjure up the bank as an exercise of the commerce power. And what, of course, the Court didn't say, and I think the Court would have had a very different reaction to, is, you know, we're not just going to have the bank, because that would be necessary and proper; we're going to force the citizenry to put all of their money in the bank, because, if we do that, then we know the Bank of the United States will be secure. I think the Framers would have identified the difference between those two scenarios, and I don't think that the great Chief Justice would have said that forcing people to put their deposits in the Bank of the United States was necessary and proper. Now, if you look through all the cases you mentioned, I do not think you will find a case like this. And I think it's telling that you won't. I mean, the regulation of the wheat market in Wickard v. Filburn, all this effort to address the supply side and what producers could do, what Congress was trying to do was support the price of wheat. It would have been much more efficient to just make everybody in America buy 10 loaves of bread. That would have had a much more direct effect on the price of wheat in the prevailing market. But we didn't do that. We didn't say, when we had problems in the automobile industry, that we're not just going to give you incentives, not just cash for clunkers; we're going to actually have everybody over 100,000 dollars has to buy a new car --",
  "Well, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I suppose the first thing you have to say is what market are we talking about? Because the government -- this statute undeniably operates in the health care insurance market. And the government can't say that everybody is in that market. The whole problem is that everybody is not in that market, and they want to make everybody get into that market.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, I'm not sure that's right. I think what health insurance does and what all insurance does is it allows you to diversify risk. And so, it's not just a matter of I'm paying now instead of paying later. That's credit. Insurance is different than credit. Insurance guarantees you an up-front, locked-in payment, and you won't have to pay any more than that even if you incur much greater expenses. And in every other market that I know of for insurance, we let people basically make the decision whether they're relatively risk averse, whether they're relatively non-risk averse, and they can make the judgment based on --",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me say this, which is to say -- you're right in the first point to say that it's the States that do it, which makes it different right there. But it's also --",
  "No. I think you might make a different argument about cars than you would make about health insurance, unless you tried to say -- but, you know, we're --",
  "But, Justice Sotomayor, what I think is different is there's lots of people in Manhattan, for example, that don't have car insurance because they don't have cars. And so, they have the option of withdrawing from that market. It's not a direct imposition from the government. So, even the car market is different from this market, where there's no way to get outside of the regulatory web. And that's, I think, one of the real problems with this because, I mean, we take as a given --",
  "At some point, that's right, but all sorts of people will not, say, use health care in the next year, which is the relevant period for the insurance.",
  "Of course not --",
  "Of course not, Justice Breyer, but the point is that once Congress decides it's going to regulate extant commerce, it is going to get all sorts of latitude to make the right judgments about actuarial predictions, which actuarial to rely on, which one not to rely on. The question that's a proper question for this Court, though, is whether or not, for the first time ever in our history, Congress also has the power to compel people into commerce, because, it turns out, that would be a very efficient thing for purposes of Congress's optimal regulation of that market. And I --",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, once again, it depends on which market we're talking about. If we're talking about the health care insurance market --",
  "And with respect to the health insurance market that's designed to have payment in the health care market, everybody's not in the market. And that's the premise of the statute, and that's the problem Congress is trying to solve. And if it tried to solve it through incentives, we wouldn't be here; but it's trying to solve it in a way that nobody has ever tried to solve an economic problem before, which is saying, you know, it would be so much more efficient if you were just in this -- the market.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, I don't think that's right, certainly in any way that distinguishes this from any other context. When I'm sitting in my house deciding I'm not going to buy a car, I am causing the labor market in Detroit to go south. I am causing maybe somebody to lose their job, and for everybody to have to pay for it under welfare. So, the cost shifting that the government tries to uniquely associate with this market -- it's everywhere. And even more to the point, the rationale that they think ultimately supports this legislation, that, look, it's an economic decision; once you make the economic decision, we aggregate the decision; there's your substantial effect on commerce -- that argument works here. It works in every single industry.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, there are other markets that affect every one -- transportation, food, burial services -- though we don't like to talk about that either. There also are situations where there are many economic effects from somebody's failure to purchase a product. And if I could -- if I could talk about the difference between the health insurance market and the health care market, I mean, ultimately I don't want you to leave here with the impression that anything turns on that. Because if the government decided tomorrow that they've come up with a great -- somebody -- some private company has come up with a great new wonder drug that would be great for everybody to take, it would have huge health benefits for everybody; and by the way, also, if everybody had to buy it, it would facilitate economies of scale, and the production would be great, and the price would be cheaper -- and force everybody in the health care market, the actual health care market, to buy the wonder drug, I'd be up here making the same argument. I'd be saying that's not a power that's within the commerce power of the Federal Government. It is something much greater. And it would have been much more controversial. That's one of the important things. In Federalist 45, Madison says the commerce power -- that's a new power, but it's not one anyone has any apprehension about. The reason they didn't have any apprehension about it is because it's a power that only operated once people were already in commerce. You see that from the text of the clause. The first kind of commerce Congress gets to regulate is commerce with foreign nations. Did anybody think the fledgling Republic had the power to compel some other nation into commerce with us? Of course not. And in the same way, I think if the Framers had understood the commerce power to include the power to compel people to engage in commerce --",
  "Justice Kagan, again, with all due respect, I don't think that's a limiting principle. My unwillingness to buy an electric car is forcing up the price of an electric car. If only more people demanded an electric car, there would be economies of scale, and the price would go down.",
  "Justice Kagan, first of all, I do think there -- this is not the only place where there's uncompensated care. If some -- if I don't buy a car and somebody goes on welfare, I'm going to end up paying for that as well. But let me also say that there's a real disconnect then between that focus on what makes this different and the statute that Congress passed. If all we were concerned about is the cost sharing that took place because of uncompensated care in emergency rooms, presumably we'd have before us a statute that only addressed emergency care and catastrophic insurance coverage. But it covers everything, soup to nuts, and all sorts of other things. And that gets at the idea that there's two kinds of cost shifting that are going on here. One is the concern about emergency care and that somehow somebody who gets sick is going to shift costs back to other policy areas -- holders. But there's a much bigger cost shifting going on here, and that's the cost shifting that goes on when you force healthy people into an insurance market precisely because they're healthy, precisely because they're not likely to go to the emergency room, precisely because they're not likely to use the insurance they're forced to buy in the health care insurance. That creates a huge windfall. It lowers the price of premiums. And, again, this isn't just some lawyer up here telling you that's what it does and trying to second-guess the congressional economic decisions. This is Congress's findings, Findings (I) on page 43a of the appendix to the Government's brief.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, let me take them in --",
  "Let me take them in turn. would encourage this Court not to Garcia-ize the Commerce Clause and just simply say it's up to Congress to police the Commerce Clause. So, I don't think that is a limiting principle. Second of all --",
  "I agree --",
  "I agree 100 percent, and I think that was the Chief Justice's point, which was once you open the door to compelling people into commerce based on the narrow rationales that exist in this industry, you are not going to be able to stop that process.",
  "Well, the other two principles are Lopez -- and this case really is not -- I mean, you know, Lopez is a limit on the affirmative exercise of people who are already in commerce. The question is, is there any other limit to people who aren't in commerce? And so, I think this is the case that really asks that question. And then the first point, which was -- I take it to be the Solicitor General's point, is, with all due respect, simply a description of the insurance market. It's not a limiting principle, because the justification for why this is a valid regulation of commerce is in no way limited to this market. It simply says these are economic decisions; they have effect on other people; my failure to purchase in this market has a direct effect on others who are already in the market. That's true of virtually every other market under the sun.",
  "I'd be delighted to, which is -- I mean, I -- you're absolutely right. Once you're in the commerce power, there -- this Court is not going to police that subject maybe to the Lopez limit. And that's exactly why I think it's very important for this Court to think seriously about taking an unprecedented step of saying that the commerce power not only includes the power to regulate, prescribe the rule by which commerce is governed, the rule of Gibbons v. Ogden; but to go further and say it's not just prescribing the rule for commerce that exists, but it is the power to compel people to enter into commerce in the first place. I'd like to say two very brief things about the taxing power, if I could. There are lots of reasons why this isn't a tax. It wasn't denominated a tax. It's not structured as a tax. If it's any tax at all, though, it is a direct tax. Article I, section 9, clause 4 -- the Framers would have had no doubt that a tax on not having something is not an excise tax but a forbidden direct tax. That's one more reason why this is not proper legislation, because it -- it violates that. The second thing is I would urge you to read the license tax case, which the Solicitor General says is his best case for why you ignore the fact that a tax is denominated into something other. Because that's a case where the argument was that because the Federal Government had passed a license, not a tax, that somehow that allowed people to take actions that would have been unlawful under State law, that this was some special Federal license to do something that was forbidden by State law. This Court looked beyond the label in order to preserve federalism there. What the Solicitor General and the government ask you to do here is exactly the opposite, which is to look past labels in order to up-end our basic federalist system. And this --",
  "I represent 26 States. I do think the States could pass this mandate, but I --",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor, I have to resist your premise, because I didn't answer, yes, the States can do it because it would be a valid regulation of intrastate commerce. I said, yes, the States can do it because they have a police power, and that is the fundamental difference between the States on the one hand and the limited, enumerated Federal Government on the other.",
  "Justice Alito, that is exactly the Government's argument. It's an extraordinarily illogical argument.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If the individual mandate is unconstitutional, then the rest of the Act cannot stand. As Congress found and the Federal Government concedes, the community-rating and guaranteed-issue provisions of the Act cannot stand without the individual mandate. Congress found that the individual mandate was essential to their operation. And not only can guaranteed issue and community rating not stand, not operate in the manner that Congress intended, they would actually counteract Congress's basic goal of providing patient protection but also affordable care. You can -- if you do not have the individual mandate to force people into the market, then community rating and guaranteed issue will cause the cost of premiums to skyrocket. We can debate the order of magnitude of that, but we can't debate that the direction will be upward. We also can't debate - -",
  "Well, a couple of questions - - a couple of responses, Justice Sotomayor. First of all, I think that it's very relevant here that Congress had before it as examples some of the States that had tried to impose guaranteed issue and community rating, and did not impose an individual mandate. And Congress rejected that model. So, your question is quite right in saying that it's not impossible to have guaranteed issue and community rating without an individual mandate. But it's a model that Congress looked at and specifically rejected. And then, of course, there's Congress's own finding, and their finding, of course -- this is finding (i), which is 43a of the Government's brief, in the appendix. Congress specifically found that having the individual mandate is essential to the operation of guaranteed issue and community rating.",
  "Well - -",
  "Well - -",
  "I think a couple of things. One, you get -- I mean, I would think you'd sort of have to take the bitter with the sweet. And if Congress - - if we're going to look at Congress's goal of providing patient protection but also affordable care, we can't - - I don't think it works to just take the things that save money and cut out the things that are going to make premiums more expensive. But at a minimum - -",
  "Well, let me answer the bottom line question, which is, no matter what you do in this case, at some point there's going to be -- if you strike down the mandate, there's going to be something for Congress to do. The question is really what task do you want to give Congress? Do you want to give Congress the task of fixing the statute after something has been taken out, especially a provision at the heart, or do you want to give Congress the task of fixing health care? And I think it would be better in this situation - -",
  "And, of course, that's right, Justice Sotomayor, and no matter what you do here, Congress will have the options available. So, if you - - if you strike down only the individual mandate, Congress could say the next day, well, that's the last thing we ever wanted to do so we are going to strike down the rest of the statute immediately and then try to fix the problem. So, whatever you do, Congress is going to have options. The question is - -",
  "Well, that's exactly - -",
  "-- what I was going to say, Justice Scalia, which is I think the question for this Court is -- we all recognize there's legislative inertia. And then the question is what's the best result in light of that reality?",
  "No, I - -",
  "And I agree. We're simply asking this Court to take on, straight on, the idea of the basic remedial inquiry into severability which looks to the intent of the Congress - -",
  "Well, two responses, Justice Scalia: We can look at this Court's cases on severability, and they all formulate the test a little bit differently.",
  "But every one of them talks about congressional intent. But here's the -- there's the other answer - -",
  "It is right. And here's how I would answer your question, which is, when Congress includes a severability clause, it's addressing the issue in the abstract. It doesn't say, no matter which provisions you strike down, we absolutely, positively want what's left.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I think it can be, which is to say that the basic proposition, that it's congressional intent that governs. Now, everybody on this Court has a slightly different way of divining legislative intent. And I would suggest the one common ground among every member of this Court, as I understand it, is you start with the text. Everybody can agree with that.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, I'd be delighted to take you through my view of the text and why there are other things that have to fall. The first place I'd ask you to look is Finding (J), which is on the same page, 43a. And as I read that, that's a finding that the individual mandate is essential to the operation of the exchanges. But there are other links between guaranteed issue and community rating and the exchanges. And there, I think, it's just the way that the exchanges are supposed to work, and the text makes this clear, is they're supposed to provide a market where people can compare community-rated insurance. That's what makes the exchanges function.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, I think there are situations where half a loaf is actually worse, and I want to address that. But before I -- more broadly -- but before I do that, if I can stick with just the exchanges. I do think the question that this Court is supposed to ask is not just whether they can limp along and they can operate independently, but whether they operate in the manner that Congress intended. And that's where I think the exchanges really fall down, because the vision of the exchanges was that if you got out of this current situation where health insurance is basically individualized priced based on individualized underwriting and you provide community rating, then it's going to be very easy for people to see, okay, well, this is a silver policy, and this is a bronze policy, and this is a gold policy. And we can -- you know, I can just pick which insurer provides what I think is going to be the best service based on those comparable provisions.",
  "But, Justice Kagan, I mean, I actually think Booker supports our point as well, because there are two aspects of the remedial holding of Booker. And the first part of it, which I think actually very much supports our point is where the majority rejects the approach of the dissent, which actually would have required nothing in the statute to have been struck, not a single word. But, nonetheless, this Court said, boy, if you do that, then all of the sentencing is basically going to be done by a combination of the juries and the prosecutors, and the judges are going to be cut out. And the Court said the one thing we know is that's not the manner in which Congress thought that this should operate. Now, later they make a different judgment about the -- which particular provisions to cut out. But I do think Booker is consistent with this way of looking at it. It's certainly consistent with Brock, the opinion that we rely on, because there the Court only reached that part of the opinion after they had already found that the must-hire provision operated functionally independent from the legislative veto. So - -",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, two kinds of responses to that: One, I do think there are some provisions that I would identify as being at the periphery of this statute, and I'll admit that the case for severing those is perhaps the strongest. But I do think it's fundamentally different, because if we were in here arguing that some provision on the periphery of the statute, like the Biosimilars Act or some of the provisions that you've mentioned, was unconstitutional, I think you'd strike it down and you wouldn't even think hard about severability. What makes this different is that the provisions that have constitutional difficulties or are tied at the hip to those provisions that have the constitutional difficulty are the very heart of this Act. And then if you look at how they are textually interconnected with the exchanges, which are then connected to the tax credits, which are also connected to the employer mandates, which is also connected to some of the revenue offsets, which is also connected to Medicaid, if you follow that through what you end up with at the end of that process is just sort of a hollow shell. And at that point, I think there is a strong argument for not -- I mean, we can't possibly think that Congress would have passed that hollow shell without the heart of the Act.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, you know, they tried to make them germane. But I'm not here to tell you that, you know -- some of their -- surely, there are provisions that are just looking for the next legislative vehicle that's going to make it across the finish line, and somebody's going to attach it to anything that's moving. I mean, I'll admit that. But the question is -- when everything else from the center of the Act is interconnected and has to go, if you follow me that far, then the question is would you keep this hollowed-out shell?",
  "Sure. Justice Kennedy, the reality is I think this Court's opinions have at various times applied both strains of the analysis.",
  "I'm -- I'm a big believer in objective tests, Justice Kennedy. I'd be perfectly happy with you to apply a more textually based objective approach. I think there are certain Justices that are more inclined to take more of a peek at legislative history, and I think if you look at the legislative history of this, it would only fortify the conclusion that you would reach from a very objective textual inquiry. But I am happy to focus the Court on the objective textual inquiry - -",
  "It is whether the statute can operate in the manner that Congress -- that Congress intended. And - -",
  "Justice Sotomayor, every one of your cases, if you have a formulation for severability, if you interpret it woodenly, it becomes tautological. And Justice Blackmun addressed this in footnote 7 of the Brock opinion that we rely on, where he says: Of course, it's not just -- you know, it doesn't operate exactly in the manner because it doesn't have all the pieces, but you still make an inquiry as to whether -- I mean, when Congress links two provisions together and one really won't work without the other - -",
  "Justice Sotomayor, let me try to answer the specific question and then answer the big picture question. The specific question is -- I mean, you could do that. You could adopt a new rule now that basically says, look, we've sever - -",
  "Right. But - -",
  "I think in fairness, though, Justice Sotomayor, to get to the point you're wanting to get to, you'd have to ratchet up that presumption a couple of ticks on the scale, but -- and because the one thing - -",
  "Well, one thing that's wrong with that, which is still at a smaller level, is that's inconsistent with virtually every statement in every one of your severability opinions, which all talk about congressional intent.",
  "I don't think that's right, Justice Kagan. I mean, I think there are more recent examples. A great example I think, which sort of proves and maybe is a segue to get to my broader point, is a case that involves a State statute, not a Federal statute, but I don't think anything turns on that, is Randall v. Sorrell, where this Court struck down various provisions of the Vermont campaign finance law. But there were other contribution provisions that were not touched by the theory that the Court used to strike down the contribution limits. But this Court at the end of the opinion said, you know, there's no way to think that the Vermont legislator would have wanted these handful of provisions there on the contribution side. So, we'll strike down the whole thing. And if I could make the broader point, I mean, I think the reason it makes sense in a democracy with separation of powers to in some cases sever the whole thing is because sometimes a half a loaf is worse. And a great example, if I dare say so, is Buckley. In Buckley this Court looked at a statute that tried to, in a coherent way, strike down limits on contributions and closely related expenditures. This Court struck down the ban on expenditures, left the contribution ban in place, and for four decades Congress has tried to fix what's left of the statute, largely unsuccessfully; whereas it would have I think worked much better from a democratic and separation of powers standpoint if the Court would have said: Look, expenditures are -- you can't limit expenditures under the Constitution. The contribution provision is joined at the hip. Give Congress a chance to actually fix the problem, not just - -",
  "Right. What I would propose is the following, Justice Breyer, is you follow the argument this far and then you ask yourself whether what you have left is a hollowed-out shell or whether you have - -",
  "What you should do is let me say the following, which is follow me this far, which is the mandatory, individual mandate is tied, as the Government suggests, to guaranteed issue and community rating, but the individual mandate, guaranteed issue, and community rating together are the heart of this Act. They -- they're what make the exchanges work. The exchanges in turn are critical to the tax credits, because the amount of the tax credit is key to the amount of the policy price on the exchange. The exchanges are also key to the employer mandate, because the employer mandate becomes imposed on an employer if one of the employees gets insurance on the exchanges. But it doesn't stop there. Look at the Medicare provision for DSH hospitals, okay? These are hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of the needy. This isn't in Title I. It's in the other part that you had in your other hand. But it doesn't work without the mandate, community rating, and guaranteed issue.",
  "Sure.",
  "Well, I -- I think what I would suggest, Justice Alito -- I don't want to be unresponsive -- is that you sort of follow the argument through and figure out what in the core of the Act falls. And then I guess my fallback would be if what's left is a hollowed-out shell, you could just leave that standing. If you want a sort of practical answer, I mean, I do think you could just -- you know, you could use Justice Breyer's off-the-cuff as a starting point and basically say, you know, Title I and a handful of related provisions that are very closely related to that are really the heart of the Act.",
  "The bigger volume in his other hand -- I mean, you could strike one and leave the other, but at a certain point -- I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "At a certain point, I just think that, you know, the better answer might be to say we've struck the heart of this Act; let's just give Congress a clean slate. If it's so easy to have that other big volume get re-enacted, they can do it in a couple of days. It won't be a big deal. If it's not, because it's very - -",
  "Well, but -- I mean, you can laugh at me if you want, but the point is I rather suspect that it won't be easy. Because I rather suspect that if you actually dug into that, there'd be something that was quite controversial in there and couldn't be passed quickly - -",
  "-- and that's our whole point.",
  "Well, maybe that's right, Mr. Chief Justice. And I don't want to, I mean, spend all my time on -- fighting over the periphery, because I do think there are some provisions that I think you would make, as an exercise of your own judgment, the judgment that once you've gotten rid of the core provisions of this Act, that you would then decide to let the periphery fall with it. But if you want to keep the periphery, that's fine. What I think is important, though, as to the core provisions of the Act, which aren't just the mandate, community rating, and guaranteed issue, but include the exchanges, the tax credit, Medicare, and Medicaid -- as to all of that, I think you do want to strike it all down to avoid a redux of Buckley. If I could reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Mr. Chief - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I'll make four points in rebuttal, but I'll start with Justice Sotomayor's question, which is to simply say this isn't just a tool; it's the principal tool. Congress identified it as an essential tool. It's not just a tool to make it work. It's a tool to pay for it, to make it affordable. And, again, that's not my characterization; that's Congress's characterization in Sub-finding (I) on page 43a of the Government's brief. Now, that brings me to my first point in rebuttal, which is Mr. Kneedler says, quite correctly - - tells this Court don't look at the budgetary implications. Well, the problem with that, though, is once it's common ground that the individual mandate is in the statute at least in part to make community rating and guaranteed issue affordable, that really is all you have to identify. That establishes the essential link that it's there to pay for it. You don't have to figure out exactly how much that is and which box -- I mean, it clearly is a substantial part of it, because what they were trying to do was take healthy individuals and put them into the risk pool -- and this is quoting their finding -- which is in order -- they put people into the market, which will lower premiums. So, that's what their intent was. So, you don't have to get to the final number. You know that's what was going on here, and that's reason alone to sever it. Now, the Government -- Mr. Kneedler also says there's an easy dividing line between what they want to keep and what they want to dish out. The problem with that is that, you know, you read their brief and you might think, oh, there's a guaranteed-issue and a community-rating provision subtitle in the bill. There's not. To figure out what they're talking about you have to go to page 6 of their brief, of their opening severability brief, where they tell you what's in and what's out. And the easy dividing line they suggest is actually between 300g(a)(1) and 300g(a)(2), because on community rating, they don't -- they say that (a)(1) goes, but then they say (a)(2) has to stay because that's the way that you'll have some sort of -- kind of Potemkin community rating for the exchanges. But if you actually look at those provisions, (a)(2) makes all these references to (a)(1). It just doesn't work. Now, in getting back to the -- an inquiry that I think this Court actually can approach is, to look at what Congress was trying to do, you need look no further than the title of this statute: Patient Protection and Affordable Care. I agree with Mr. Farr that community rating and guaranteed issue were the crown jewels of this Act. They were what was trying to provide patient protection. And what made it affordable? The individual mandate. If you strike down guaranteed issue, community rating, and the individual mandate, there is nothing left to the heart of the Act. And that takes me to my last point, which is simply this Court in Buckley created a halfway house, and it took Congress 40 years to try to deal with the situation, when contrary to any time of their intent, they had to try to figure out what are we going to do when we're stuck with this ban on contributions, but we can't get at expenditures because the Court told us we couldn't. And for 40 years, they worked in that halfway house. Why make them do that in health care? The choice is to give Congress the task of fixing this statute, the residuum of this statute after some of it is struck down, or giving them the task of simply fixing the problem on a clean slate. I don't think that's a close choice. If the individual mandate is unconstitutional, the rest of the Act should fall.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The constitutionality of the Act's massive expansion of Medicaid depends on the answer to two related questions. First, is the expansion coercive? And, second, does that coercion matter?",
  "Justice Kagan, if everything else in the statute remained the same, I would be making the exact same argument.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, let me -- I mean, I eventually want to make the point where, even if you had a standalone program that just gave 100 percent, just 100 percent boatload, nothing but boatload --",
  "Why, there would still be a problem.",
  "It is. But before I make that point, can I simply say that you built into your question the idea that there are no -- no conditions. And, of course, when you first asked, it was what about the same program with 100 percent matching on the newly eligible mandatory individuals, which is how the statute refers to them. And that would have a very big condition. And the very big condition is that the States, in order to get that new money, they would have to agree not only to the new conditions, but the government here is -- the Congress is leveraging their entire prior participation --",
  "-- in the program -- sure.",
  "Well, I guess I'd want to know where the money came from --",
  "-- and if the money came from --",
  "Sure. If I told you, actually, it came from my own bank account. And that's what's really going on here, in part --",
  "-- and that's why it's not simply a matter of saying --",
  "Right. And if New York and the United States figured out a way to tax individuals at greater than 100 percent of their income, then maybe you could just say it's two separate sovereigns, two separate taxes. But, we all know that in the real world, that to the extent the Federal Government continues to increase taxes, that decreases the ability of the States to tax their own citizenry, and it's a real tradeoff.",
  "What's that?",
  "No, Justice Sotomayor, I'm not. What I'm suggesting is that it's not simply the case that you can say, well, it's free money, so we don't even have to ask whether the program's coercive.",
  "No, Justice Sotomayor --",
  "And -- and Justice Sotomayor, I'm really saying the opposite, which is not that every gift is coercive, no matter what the amount, no matter how small. I'm saying essentially the opposite, which is there has to be some limit. There has to be some limit on coercion. And the reason is quite simple, because this Court's entire spending power jurisprudence is premised on the notion that spending power is different, and that Congress can do things pursuant to the spending power that it can't do pursuant to its other enumerated powers precisely because the programs are voluntary. And if you relax that assumption that the programs are voluntary, and you're saying they're coercion, then you can't have the spending power jurisprudence that’s different.",
  "Well, it's --",
  "Well, maybe -- maybe I can talk about what makes it coercive by talking about the actual statute at issue here and focusing on what I think are the three hallmarks of this statute that make it uniquely coercive. One of them is the fact that this statute is tied to the decidedly nonvoluntary individual mandate. And that makes this unique, but it makes it significant, I think. I'll continue. I thought you had a question. I'm sorry. The second factor, of course, is the fact that Congress here made a distinct and conscious decision to tie the State's willingness to accept these new funds, not just to the new funds, but to their entire participation in the statute, even though the coverage for these newly eligible individuals is segregated from the rest of the program. And this is section 2001(a)(3). It's at page 23A of the appendix to the blue brief.",
  "No, Justice Ginsburg, this is distinct in two different directions. One is, in some of the prior expansions of the program, but not all, Congress has made covering newly eligible individuals totally voluntary. If the States want to cover the newly eligible individuals, they'll get additional money; but if they don't, they don't risk any of their existing participation programs. The 1972 program was a paradigm of that. It created this 209(b) option for States to participate. This Court talked about it in the Gray Panthers case. There were other expansions that have taken place, such as the 1984 expansions, where they didn't give States that option. But here's the second dimension in which this is distinct, which is here, Congress has created a separate part of the program for the newly eligible mandatory individuals. That's what they called them. And those individuals are treated separately from the rest of the program going forward forever. They are going to be reimbursed at a different rate from everybody who was covered under the preexisting program. Now, in light of that separation by Congress itself of the newly eligible individuals from the rest of the program, it's very hard to understand Congress's decision to say, look, if you don't want to cover these newly eligible individuals, you don't just not get the new money, you don't get any of the money under the --",
  "It says it at -- well, it -- where does it say what, Justice Breyer?",
  "Right. And then --",
  "It says it -- there's two places where it says it.",
  "The 2001(a)(3) makes a part of my --",
  "That's at page 23A --",
  "Blue brief.",
  "And -- and this makes not the point about the funding cutoff. This makes the point just that these newly eligible individuals are really treated separately --",
  "-- forevermore.",
  "Right. And there, Justice Breyer --",
  "I don't have that with me --",
  "Great. Perfect. Thank you.",
  "Right.",
  "Exactly.",
  "I -- if that's the -- if that is the provision that gives the Secretary --",
  "-- among other things --",
  "-- the authority to cut off participation in the program, yes.",
  "And Justice Breyer, here's where it comes from, which is from the very beginning of this litigation, we've pointed out that what's coercive is not the absolute guarantee that the Secretary could cut off every penny, but the fact that she could.",
  "It doesn't for this reason, Justice --",
  "Well, but here's the reason. Here's the reason -- Justice Breyer, it doesn't. One is -- I mean, I don't know the opinion to cite for that proposition. Second is, I've been -- we've been making in this litigation since the very beginning this basic point, the government has had opportunities at every level of this system, and I suppose they'll have an opportunity today to say: Fear not, States. If you don't want to take the new conditions, all you will lose is the new money. And when we --",
  "You know --",
  "Well -- and, Justice Scalia, I mean --",
  "That's the way I would read the law, Your Honor.",
  "And if I could just add one thing just to the discussion, is the point that, you know, this is not all hypothetical. I mean, in -- there was a record in the district court, and there is an Exhibit 33 to our motion for summary judgment. It's not -- it's not in the joint appendix. We can lodge it with the Court if they'd -- if you'd like. But it's a letter that's in the record in this litigation, and it's a letter from the Secretary to Arizona, when Arizona floated the idea that it would like to withdraw from the CHIP program, which is a relatively small part of the whole program. And what Arizona was told by the Secretary is that if you withdraw from the CHIP program, you risk losing $7.8 billion, the entirety of your Medicaid participation. So, this is not something that we've conjured up --",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I'm not sure that the Court's federalism jurisprudence should force States to depend on how a lower court reads Holly Hill. I think that really, right here, what we know to an absolute certainty is that this Secretary -- this statute gives the Secretary the right to remove all of the State's funding under these programs. And think about what that is --",
  "Justice Sotomayor, we're not saying we have a vested right to participate in the Medicaid program as it exists now. So, if Congress wanted to scrap the current system and have a new one, I'm not going to tell you that there's no possibility of a coercion challenge to it, but I'm -- I'm not going to say.",
  "-- this ought -- well, can we --",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor, before -- I mean, I'll try to answer that question, too. But the first part of the question was, you know, what if the Congress just tried to scrap this and start over again with a new program? Here's why this is fundamentally different and why it's fundamentally more coercive, because Congress is not saying we want to scrap this program. They don't have a single complaint, really, with the way that States are providing services to the visually impaired and the disabled under pre-existing Medicaid. And that's why it's particularly questionable why they're saying that if you don't take our new money, subject to the new conditions, we're going to take all of the money you've previously gotten that you've been dependent on for 45 years, and you're using right now to serve the visually impaired and the disabled --",
  "That's right, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, that's right, but that shouldn't be a terrible concern, because if Congress wants to do what it did in 1972 and pass a statute that makes the expansion voluntary, every State that thinks that this is a great deal can sign up. What's telling here, though, is 26 States who think that this is a bad deal for them actually are also saying that they have no choice but to take this because they can't afford to have their entire participation in this 45-year-old program wiped out, and they have to go back to square one and figure out how they're going to deal with the visually impaired in their State, the disabled in their State -- of course --",
  "There's a correlation, Justice Scalia.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, there's two reasons that might be different. One is, this whole line of coercion only applies -- is only relevant, really, when Congress tries to do something through the spending power it couldn't do directly. So if Congress tried to impose Title IX directly, I guess the question for this Court would be whether or not Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed Congress to do that. I imagine you might think that it did, and I imagine some of your colleagues might take issue with that, but that's -- that's the nature of the question. So, one way around that would be, if Congress can do it directly, you don't even have to ask whether there's something special about the spending power. That's how this Court resolved, for example, the FAIR case about funding to -- to colleges.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, if -- I'm going -- to say the second thing about my answer to your prior question, which is just that I also think that, you know, it may be that spending on certain private universities is something, again, that Congress can do, and it doesn't matter whether it's coercion. But when they're trying to get the States to expand their Medicaid programs, that's something --",
  "Okay. Then there -- then there may be some limits on that. I mean -- but again, I'm not sure, even in that context, there might not be some things Congress can do. It's a separate question. But once we take the premise, which I don't think there's a disagreement here, that Congress could not simply, as a matter of direct legislation under the commerce power or something, say, States, you must expand your Medicaid programs. If we take that as a given, then I think we have to ask the question of whether or not it's coercive. Now, you -- in -- in your second question, you asked, well, you know, I mean, where's the case that says that we've crossed that line? And this is that case, I would respectfully say --",
  "Justice Breyer, I don't think that our position here would necessarily extend to say the 1984 amendments, and let me tell you why. You know, I'm -- I'm not saying that absolutely that's guaranteed that's not coercive, but here's reasons why they're different. The one major difference is the size of the program. I mean, the expansion of Medicaid since 1984 is really breathtaking. Medicaid, circa 1984, the Federal spending to the States was a shade over $21 billion. Right now, it's $250 billion, and that's before the expansion under this statute.",
  "Not necessarily, Justice Kagan. And, again, it's because we're not here with a one trick pony. And this -- one of the factors -- we point you to three factors that make this statute uniquely coercive. One of them is the sheer size of this program. And, you know, if you want a -- if you want a gauge on the size of this program, the best place to look is the government's own number. Footnote 6, page 10 of their brief.",
  "$3.3 trillion over the next 10 years. That's -- that is --",
  "The answer is no, and that's because we're here saying there are three things that make this statute unique.",
  "Yes, exactly. Well, one is the sheer size. Two is the fact that this statute uniquely is tied to an individual mandate which is decidedly nonvoluntary. And three is the fact that they've leveraged the prior participation in the program, notwithstanding that they've broken this out as a separately segregated fund going forward, which is not to prove --",
  "No, I think that is constitutional because I think that's something that Congress could do directly. It wouldn't have to limit that to the spending program. And I think 18 U.S.C. 666 is -- is a statute -- you know, it may -- it's in the criminal code. It may be tied to spending, but I think that's -- that's a provision that I don't think its constitutionality's called into question.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, I think there's a difference, but if I'm wrong about that and the consequence is that Congress has to break Medicaid down into remotely manageable pieces as opposed to $3.3 trillion over 10 years before the expansion, I don't think that would be the end of the world. But I really would ask you to focus on specifically what's going on here, which is they take these newly eligible people -- and that's a massive change in the way the program works. These are people who are healthy, childless adults who are not covered in many States. They say, okay, we're going to make you cover those. We're going to have a separate program for how you get reimbursed for that. You get reimbursed differently from all the previously eligible individuals. But if you don't take our money, we're going to take away your participation in the program for the visually impaired and the disabled. If I may reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Well, if you --",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor, a couple of points. One is, I actually think that sort of misdescribes what happened with Medicaid. I mean, States were, as you suggest, providing for the poor and the visually impaired and the disabled even before Medicaid came along. Then all of a sudden, States -- the Federal Government said, look, we'd like to help you with that, and we're going to give you money voluntarily. And then over time, they give more money with more conditions. And now they decide they're going to totally expand the program, and they say that you have to give up even your prior program, where we -- first came in and offered you cooperation, we're now going to say you have to give that up if you don't take our new conditions. Secondarily, I do think that our principle is not that when you get past a certain level, it automatically becomes coercive per se. But I do think when you get a program and you're basically telling States that, look, we're going to take away $3.3 trillion over the next 10 years, that at that point, it's okay to insist that Congress be a little more careful that it not be so aggressively coercive as it was in this statute. And I would simply say that -- we're not here to tell you that this is going to be an area where it's going to be very easy to draw the line. We're just telling you that it's exceptionally important to draw that line, and this is a case where it ought to be easy to establish a beachhead, say that coercion matters, say there's three factors of this particular statute that make it as obviously coercive as any piece of legislation that you've ever seen, and then you will have effectively instructed Congress that there are limits, and you will have laid down some administrable rules.",
  "Well, yes. It is.",
  "And it is. But I mean --",
  "I might have missed something, but both of those seem to be --",
  "-- to be the hallmarks of coercion.",
  "I was going to say, Mrs. Clement's not going to --",
  "I wouldn't do that either, Justice.",
  "It's both, Your Honor. And I think that that's -- I mean, there really is -- there really is, you know, three strings in this bow. I mean, one is the sheer amount of money here makes it very, very difficult to refuse, because it's not money that, you know, that's come from some -- you know, China or from -- you know, the – the – the export tariffs like in the old day. It's coming from the taxpayers. So, that's part of it. The fact that they're being asked to give up their continuing participation in a program that they've been participating in for 45 years as a condition to accept the new program, we think that's the second thing that's critical --",
  "With all due respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think we can say that, you know, the States have gotten pretty dependent, so let's call this whole federalism thing off. And I just think it's too important, because, again, the consequence -- if you think about it -- if -- the consequence of saying that we're not going to police the coercion line here shouldn't be that well, you know, it's just too hard, so we'll give the Federal Congress unlimited spending power. The consequence ought to be, if you really can't police this line, then you should go back and reconsider your cases that say that Congress can spend money on things that it can't do directly. Now, we're not asking you to go that far. We're simply saying that, look, your spending power cases absolutely depend on there being a line between coercion --",
  "-- and voluntary action.",
  "It -- it certainly can, Justice Sotomayor. I didn't mean to suggest, in answering Justice Kagan's question, that my case was no better than that hypothetical. I mean, but it's in the nature of things that I do think the amount of the money, even considered alone, does make a difference, and it's precisely because it has an effect on their ability to raise revenue from their own citizens. So, it's not just free money that they are turning down if they want to; it really is --",
  "Well, then I'll make --",
  "Well, then I'll make that argument on behalf of Texas.",
  "But it's not -- it's not what my argument depends on, and that's the critical thing. It's one aspect of what makes this statute uniquely coercive. And I really think if you ask the question, what explains the idea that if you don't take this new money, you're going to lose all your money under what you have been doing for 45 years to help out the visually impaired and the disabled? Nobody in Congress wants the States to stop doing that. They're just doing it, and it's purely coercive, to condition the money. It's leverage, pure and simple.",
  "I have, and I would like to elaborate, but the one-word answer is \"accountability.\" If the Federal Government decides to spend money through Federal instrumentalities, and the citizen is hacked off about it, they can bring a Federal complaint to a Federal official working in a Federal agency. And what makes this so pernicious is that the Federal Government knows that the citizenry is not going to take lightly the idea that there are huge, new Federal bureaucracies popping up across the country. And so, they get the benefit of administering this program through State officials, but then it makes it very confusing for the citizen who doesn't like this. Do they complain to the State official because it's being administered by a State official in a State building? Or do they --",
  "-- or do they --",
  "Well, that's exactly what Medicaid was. The question is, what will it be going forward? And I absolutely take your point, Justice Kagan. Cooperative federalism is a beautiful thing. Mandatory federalism has very little to recommend it, because it poses exactly --",
  "-- the kind of accountability --",
  "But -- I absolutely agree that if it's cooperative federalism and the States have choices, then that is perfectly okay. But when -- that's why voluntariness in coercion is so important. Because if you force a State to participate in a Federal program, then -- I mean, as long as it's voluntary, then a State official shouldn't complain if a citizen complains to the State about the way the State's administering a Federal program that it volunteered to participate in. But at the point it becomes coercive, then it's not fair to tell the citizen to complain to the State official, they had no choice. But who do they complain to at the Federal level? There's nobody there, which would be -- I'm not saying it's the best solution to have Federal instrumentalities in every State, but it actually is better than what you get when you have mandatory federalism, and you lose the accountability that is central to the federalism provisions in the Constitution.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Just a few points in rebuttal. First of all we've talked a lot about the sort of hallmark of coercion, your money or your life, with somebody with a gun. I would respectfully suggest that it is equally coercive and certainly not uncoercive if I say your money or your life -- and by the way, I have discretion as to whether or not I will shoot the gun. I don't think that eliminates the coercion. I also don't think this is a discretion that the Secretary would ever be able to exercise. And the reason is we disagree on the details, but the Solicitor General and I agree that, over the years, Congress has had different approaches to expanding Medicare. Sometimes, as in 1972, it makes the expansion voluntary. That's also, by the way, what happened with the stimulus funds, which were voluntary funds. You didn't lose all your Medicaid funds, which is why 17 States could say no. Sometimes, they take the voluntary approach. Sometimes, as in 1984, they take the mandatory approach. If the Secretary exercised the discretion to say, you know what, it really isn't reasonable for you to have to give up your funding for the visually impaired and the disabled, just to cover these newly eligible people, so we will make it voluntary; we'll make that discretionary -- that would essentially be creating -- converting a 1984 amendment approach to a 1972 amendment approach, and I just don't think that is the kind of discretion that the Secretary has, with all due respect. Now, moving on to the next point, Justice Alito, your hypothetical, I think, aptly captures the effect on this, based on the fact that these tax dollars are being taken from the State's tax base, and it's not like Steward Machine, where the Federal Government would say, and oh, by the way, if you don't take the option we're giving you, we're going to have a Federal substitute that will go in, and we'll take care of the unemployed in your State. Here, if you don't take this offer that we're giving you, your tax dollars will fund the other 49 States, and you'll get nothing. But, of course, this situation is much more coercive, even than your hypothetical, because it is tied directly to the mandate. It's also tied to the participation in the pre-existing program. So, it's as if there was yet another program for post-secondary education; they gave them exactly your option -- option -- and then they also said, oh, and by the way, you not only not get these funds, but you lose the post-secondary funds as well. It's really hard to understand tying the pre-existing participation in the program as anything other than coercive. The Solicitor General makes a lot of the fact that there are optional benefits under this program. Well, guess what? After the Medicaid expansion, there will be a lot less opportunity for the States to exercise those options, because one of the things that the expansion does -- precisely because the expansion is designed to convert Medicaid into a program that satisfies the requirement of the minimum essential coverage of the individual mandate, things that used to be voluntary will no longer be voluntary. The perfect example is prescription coverage. That's a big part of the benefits that some States, but not all, provide voluntarily now. It will no longer be voluntary after the expansion because the Federal Government has deemed prescription drugs to be part of the minimal essential health coverage that everybody in this country must have under the mandate. So, that option that the State has is being removed by the expansion itself. The Chief Justice made the point --",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, if we can start with the common ground that there's a need for a repair because there is a coercion doctrine and this statute is coercion, then we're into the question of remedy. And we do think -- we do take the position that you describe in the remedy, but we would be certainly happy if we got something here, and we got a recognition that the coercion doctrine exists; this is coercive; and we get the remedy that you suggest in the alternative. Let me just finish by saying that I certainly appreciate what the Solicitor General says, that when you support a policy, you think that the policy spreads the blessings of liberty. But I would respectfully suggest that it's a very funny conception of liberty that forces somebody to purchase an insurance policy whether they want it or not. And it's a very strange conception of federalism that says that we can simply give the States an offer that they can't refuse, and through the spending power, which is premised on the notion that Congress can do more -- because it's voluntary, we can force the States to do whatever we tell them to. That is a direct threat to our federalism. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioners are two pharmaceutical sales representatives. They were hired for a sales job. They were given sales training. They attend sales conferences. They are assigned a sales territory, and they are evaluated and compensated as sales people.",
  "With respect --",
  "With respect, Mr. Chief Justice, we disagree. We think they do make sales in the way that is relevant in this industry, and we do think they make sales in some sense, which is the practical construction that the agency has always put on the sales requirement in the --",
  "What's that?",
  "Yes, but, Justice Sotomayor, if I could, there's two important qualifications that avoid the slippery slope concerns you're talking about. One is it's, I think, common ground among everybody that you -- to qualify for any exemption or certainly all of these relevant exemptions here, it has to be your primary duty. So, you can't just slip in a little sales activity for something and get that person qualified. The other thing, and I think this is very --",
  "With respect, Your Honor, the commitment is very important in this industry. It is the objective of the sales call. It's to get a commitment to prescribe when medically necessary. Now, it is true that there is prologue to that, and there is efforts to promote before you get that particular sale. But the regulations address that particularly, and they say, as long as you --",
  "The second limiting principle is actually what I'm talking about now, which is if you look at 503, which are the regulations that draw the distinction between promotion and between being outside sales, they do not say that promotion is nonexempt activity. What they say is it depends who does the promotion. And as long as the outside salesperson does the promotion in conjunction with his or her own sales or solicitations, then that is exempt activity. And what they're trying to --",
  "Is not covered.",
  "You're right, but --",
  "But, Justice Ginsburg, I think it's important to recognize that the reason that 503 draws a distinction between promotional activity in conjunction with the salesperson's own sales or promotional activity with respect to somebody else's sales is they're concerned about the consideration where somebody else is going to follow up with the same customer to close the deal. And if you look at the regulatory commentary, that's what they're concerned -- they don't want to sort of have double counting, where somebody promotes with a sales target and then somebody else follows up to close the sale. And --",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, I really think if you look at the regulations as a whole and the commentary in the Stein Report and the Weiss Report, they're not worried about sorting out the pitchmen because they understand that that classic outside salesperson is a pitchman who then tries to get a commitment to buy or some other commitment from the sales target. So, what they're trying to do is really distinguishing not between pitchmen and sales people, but between what they refer to as missionary men or people who pave the way for somebody else to make the sale. And I really think that's the focus of the 503 regulation. And so, the Government's argument really boils down to the notion that there's nobody in this industry that makes enough of a commitment with the doctor for anybody to be involved in anything but promotion with the doctor. And that seems --",
  "Justice Kagan, it's theoretically possible, but it would be odd, especially in an industry that employs 90,000 people, in order to get a commitment to prescribe from the doctor. And I think if you look across --",
  "The commitment is generally not in writing, Justice Kennedy.",
  "I don't know that anything would turn on whether it was in writing or not because what --",
  "I -- I think the answer is yes. It's important for the commitment not to be binding because of the nature of the doctor's role. Nobody wants to go into a doctor's office, let alone these sales people, and say, look, whoever is the next person who walks in the door, prescribe them the product.",
  "That's not the kind of commitment they're looking for, Justice Kennedy. They're looking for a commitment that -- sometimes it's the next patient that presents the condition for which the medicine is medically appropriate, that they will prescribe. And if you think just practically --",
  "It has to be non-binding. I agree. But I don't think that the Government --",
  "Well, but you can have a non-binding commitment in writing. You can have a binding commitment that's oral, as long as it's -- you know, I don't want to get into the statute of frauds here. But it seems to me that the binding nature is not dispositive either. You can have a situation -- look, if I agree as -- that I'm going to buy something, I can often return it. Sometimes there is a cooling-off period, things like that.",
  "I'd love to, Justice Kennedy. I think, to the contrary, I think that -- I mean, the Government actually ironically says that the 2004 rulemaking, which was the last time there was any rulemaking, didn't change anything substantively. We think that's wrong. We actually think there was an important substantive change to the 503(c) regulations and others which addressed the following problem, which is not that the basic role of the outside salesperson has changed, but the technology has changed in such a way that it would be silly to draw a distinction between whether the salesperson actually takes the order and writes it down or gets a form in triplicate, or rather gets a commitment to buy from the sales target who then actually enters the order on a computer on their own. And that I think is the specific situation that the agency was confronted with. And in 2004 they said: We don't want things to turn on who enters the order, whether it's the customer on their own computer or the outside salesperson.",
  "Absolutely, Justice Kagan, but there has always been an effort to try to get all promotional people treated as being exempt. But that's different from what's being asked for here, which is the last person who makes a visit to the person who places the relevant order in the industry and gets the commitment from that person. That, in contrast to general promotion, often directed at the world at large, has always been the hallmark of a sale in the Department's own flexible approach. And I think that's really important because if --",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I want to say two things about that. One is to say, obviously, that may depend a little bit on how the particular role was described. If you're reading from the 1945 opinion letter, I mean, that may be somewhat different. But I do think that what's important here is that promotional activity itself is not problematic. Promotional activity is exempt as long as it's in conjunction with the person's own sales or solicitations, is the word of the regulation. So, I don't think that's dispositive.",
  "Well, and again, Justice Ginsburg, we would take issue with that and say, no, there is an interest in getting a specific commitment. It is commitment to prescribe. It may be somewhat -- it is non-binding, and it may be somewhat forward-looking, but I don't think that distinguishes this industry from many industries. It's not --",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me say -- I mean, certainly as the regulatory environment has changed, the nature of how the sales are transacted in this industry have changed, but I think the focus is very much on the doctors appropriately because they're the ones that place the order. But I also want to be responsive to the administrative exemption.",
  "I wouldn't, Justice Scalia --",
  "-- but I do want to --",
  "They've changed their view on that, too. And I certainly don't want this Court to think that the industry somehow has the administrative exemption as an ace up their sleeve or in their back pocket. And it's really the same exact issue, because, once again, the agency has changed their view. And once again, their view is not based on anything that has to do with label --",
  "We did, Your Honor, in the district court. It's not before this Court because we got summary judgment in our favor on the outside sales exemption. But I really would think it would be a -- a mistake for this Court to say --",
  "It would, Justice Ginsburg. But you're just deferring the same inquiry, because the Government's position once again is after 70 years of having the industry proceed on the assumption that these individuals were exempt, they now have changed their mind. And, again, their view has everything to do with FDA regulation --",
  "-- and nothing to do --",
  "-- and nothing to do with labor policy, because what they say is that now because of the government's own off-label prosecutions, these outside salespeople have to stick to a script and -- in order to avoid off-label liability. And because they have to stick to the script, they are told they don't exercise sufficient discretion to come within the administrative exemption. And the problem here is the Labor Department, instead of looking at this and making a rational judgment about labor policy and whether these individuals who make $93,000 on -- for the median should rationally be the kind of workers that are protected by the Fair Labor Standards Act, instead they're looking at things that have everything to do with FDA regulation and nothing to do with labor policy.",
  "He receives incentive compensation.",
  "Right.",
  "And the answer is -- for the Petitioners on this record, the answer is yes. They're not the commissions that are a one-to-one correspondence, but what they do is they receive substantial incentive compensation, about 25 percent of the total, and it's based on the sales of the product in their sales territory. So, if the --",
  "Certainly, based on the facts in this record, it -- at the time of this case, it's much more tied to the performance of the product in the sales territory. And I don't think that's -- you know, it's not based on the company's overall performance --",
  "Justice Sotomayor --",
  "-- two responses to that. One is you can't defer to the Labor Department's preferred construction, because it's flatly inconsistent with the statute. This idea that you have to have a transfer of title cannot be squared with 3(k); it cannot be squared, at least as I understand it, with some of the -- the own advice they've given, which is all you need is a commitment to buy. That's what they've told people since 1949. There's an example in that Weiss Report from 1949 involving a jobber where you have a situation where somebody's treated as an outside salesperson even though they never have title over the product. So, they get the commitment to buy from the sales target, and then a jobber who works for a different employer is the one that transfers title. That's at page 11 of the NFIB brief, if you want to look at it. So --",
  "It is a possible reading, Justice Kagan. But it's not the one that the Labor Department has advanced in their amicus brief. So, you can't defer to that. I mean, you can decide that it's the best reading of the statute if you want, but --",
  "Well, and with respect, Justice Kagan, that's one of the many problems with deferring to amicus briefs. Because when an agency gives guidance in an interpretative rule or something, there's one place, and they provide \"the\" answer. Now, I don't know if the Government wants you to defer to the -- defer to the argument on page 12 or the argument on page 20 or the argument on page 24.",
  "Well, with respect, they have --",
  "No, with respect, they have seen that person.",
  "Well, consignment is in the statute, but this jobber example is right out of the Weiss Report in 1949, and the outside salesperson in that case never had title. The title comes from the jobber who works for somebody else. So, the salesperson in that instance never had title, not even in the chain of distribution. Yet, they say that is a clear case where the person is an outside salesperson and exempt.",
  "Well, I understand from the Government that there was a request in 2007 and that the Labor --",
  "It was a request for an opinion letter. I'm sorry.",
  "No, there wasn't, Justice Ginsburg, but I think that actually cuts in our favor, because in 2004, a lot of companies were coming in with things where they thought it was unclear, where they thought there was some doubt, and asking for clarification. This was so well understood that the outside sales exemption, or perhaps the administrative exemption, covered the outside sales force of this industry --",
  "I would -- I would ask you not to be bound by having to cite a case. I would ask you to just use the following reasoning, though, which I think is 100 percent -- and there's plenty of cases you could cite as perhaps Cf. cites.",
  "Sure. Well, here's -- let's start -- let's start with Fox and just the basic notion that in administrative law, if you're going to change your position, you have to acknowledge that you're making a change. I think at a minimum here, if they're going to impose this kind of massive retroactive liability on this industry --",
  "Justice Kagan, here's the thing. We can quibble about whether or not there is a change in their position or whether they just didn't have a position before, but I think the important thing is they've imposed, by taking this position in an amicus brief and asking for deference to it, massive liability on this industry. The PhRMA brief estimates it's billions of dollars. Now, I --",
  "Here's the answer as to why that's not the answer, and then let me circle back and say why, if you're going to err on one side or the other, you shouldn't err on the side of imposing massive retroactive liability. The reason that that's not a simple matter of deferring to that is because that same regulation earlier says that promotional work is exempt if it's in conjunction with the individual's own sales or solicitations. Now, I happen to think it's pretty clear that these -- by getting this commitment, which is the functional equivalent of a commitment to buy, which is what the regulations and the regulatory interpretations have always said is a sale in some sense, I think these are sales. Certainly --",
  "It's not this kind of outside sales force. It's a much less sales-oriented transaction. The PhRMA amicus brief, for example, gives the example of a company that has 2,000 outside sales reps and 10 people that handle the movement of transfer of product to the wholesalers and the distributors. If you look at district court's opinion at the page 42a of the petition appendix, the district court addresses this issue and I think gets it exactly right, which is the reason there isn't a sales effort focused on the wholesalers and distributors is because their job is to have on stock the kind of medicines that physicians are prescribing.",
  "There's a handful of people, Justice Ginsburg, but that's -- I mean, there's nothing anomalous about that. Most industries have some sales force that operates on the wholesale --",
  "What's that?",
  "I don't believe so, Your Honor, at least not under the outside sales exemption, in part because they're not outside, in part because they're not really engaged in a sales effort. It does them no good -- if they can convince some wholesaler or distributor that the GSK product is far superior to a competitor's product and it doesn't make any difference at all because as a result of that -- I mean, they need to have product that actual doctors are writing prescriptions for. That's what drives sales in this industry. There's nothing anomalous about that. If you think about any industry, sales activity is always directed at the people who place orders. In this industry, because of the learned intermediary doctrine, the person who places the order is the doctor, not the ultimate end user.",
  "We think it is, Your Honor, but if you have any doubt about that, certainly at the point that the doctor then, when he sees the next patient, writes the prescription, at that point I think there's a sale, because, again, what the regulations and regulatory history looks for is a -- is a commitment to buy. That's the relevant commitment to buy. That's the order in this industry --",
  "I think they're probably two sales, Your Honor. But, you know, it's the same thing -- imagine somebody who's, you know, just sitting in their house, and they get an encyclopedia salesperson. And they say, you know, I'll -- maybe I'll buy that. That looks good, I'll buy it. And they say, but you know, maybe the State law has a law that says you've got to wait 24 hours before you put the order in, in the computer.",
  "But -- well, if -- I mean, what I was suggesting is maybe you're talking about a State that has a 24-hour waiting rule or something like that. So, it's a commitment that, sure, I'm going to enter the order in 24 hours. Well, maybe another encyclopedia salesmen comes in, in 12 hours, and he gives another commitment. One of the two people he's going to put the order in, and one of the two people will certainly have finally had a sale. I think, again --",
  "Sure, Justice Kagan. But you don't want to look at this like it's an isolated, one-time, you know, sort of interaction. I mean, one of the things that -- that happens in this industry, like other sales industry, is there are multiple trips. The detailer goes there maybe the first time and lays the ground work. Then maybe the doctor reads some other information. Then maybe on the final visit, after all that information is there, finally the detailer gets the commitment to prescribe to appropriate patients. I think one way to think about the absurdity of making the difference turn on the prescription is to compare this salesperson to another salesperson of medical devices who goes in, but these are medical supplies that the doctor uses in the doctor's office. Now, they're both hired for their sales experience. They both get sales training. They both have a sales territory. They're sitting in the same doctor's waiting room, waiting for the same doctor; they have samples in their bags, and they both get a commitment from the doctor. Now, what sense does it make as a matter of the FLSA and its labor policies to say one of those people is exempt and the other one is not exempt, because for perfectly sensible reasons, we say that one of those products is a prescription where the doctor writes the order and then with that order, the end user, the ultimate end user, can make the purchase at the pharmacy, whereas the other one --",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, you heard the Government's explanation; and, as you suggest, if the Government's explanation is right, then this shouldn't be a matter of just trying to limit things to 3 -- to the 3(k) definition. I think, even though -- at the 3(k) definition, though, if you look at that definition, it has every hallmark of being broad and functional and flexible. I would want to make one very important point, though, about the ultimate question here, because ultimately the decision whether to go one way or another on this issue has remarkable significance for retroactive imposition of liability. We all know that retroactive rulemaking is disfavored. Well, think about the consequences here. You have massive liability, between 4 and 6 years of effective time and a half, because of the way that the statute works. It has time and a half plus liquidated damages. You are talking about people who are very well paid, close to six figures. So, unlike the classic worker who you might think is covered by the FLSA, who is a relatively low hourly worker, the amounts of damages here are quite significant. Of course, the effort to try to reconstruct these people's hours, given that they were told they were exempt and they were outside the office, trying to reconstruct how many overtime hours they actually worked is going to be a crapshoot at best. So, if you think about all of that, and then you think about, as Justice Breyer indicated, the other option, which is to --",
  "Sure.",
  "I -- may I answer?",
  "I would start by citing -- I know it's not always in fashion to cite lower court opinions, but I'd start by citing Judge Posner's opinion in Yi, because the Seventh Circuit -- they're a very distinguished panel, Judge Posner, Judge Wood, and one other judge. The three of them considered this question -- Judge Sykes. I'm sorry; it slipped my mind. A very distinguished judge.",
  "The -- it's -- the point being that he said along these lines that the 70 years of history makes a significant difference. And here's the thing. Just like you expect an agency to confront a change in position, you'd at least expect an agency to confront the retroactive consequences and in that sense address them and make sense of it. And I would just simply say this, which is if you had a rulemaking, you could bring in all of the affected parties, including the current sales representatives, who are not the ones bringing these lawsuits, whose jobs are going to be changed, and you could make a comprehensive view, as opposed to just getting one side of an ongoing litigation and then making a decision about an amicus brief. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State of Arizona bears a disproportionate share of the costs of illegal immigration. In addressing those costs, Arizona borrowed the Federal standards as its own and attempted to enlist state resources in the enforcement of the uniform Federal immigration laws. Notwithstanding that, the United States took the extraordinary step of seeking a preliminary injunction to enjoin the statute as impliedly preempted on its face before it took effect. The Ninth Circuit agreed with respect to four provisions, but only by inverting fundamental principles of federalism. The Ninth Circuit, essentially, demanded that Arizona point to specific authorization in Federal statute for its approach. But that gets matters backwards. A state does not need to point to Federal authorization for its enforcement efforts. Rather, the burden is on the parties seeking to preempt a duly enacted state law to point to some provision in statutory law that does the preempting. Now, the United States can't really do that here, and the reason is obvious. There are multiple provisions of the Federal immigration law that go out of their way to try to facilitate state and local efforts to communicate with Federal immigration officials, in order to ascertain the immigration status of individuals. So, for example, 1373(c) specifically requires that Federal immigration officials shall respond to inquiries from state and local officials about somebody's immigration status. 1373(a) goes even further. That provision says that no Federal agency or officer may prohibit or in any way restrict the ability of state and local officers to communicate with Federal immigration officers to ascertain somebody's immigration status. Indeed, if the DHS had - -",
  "Yes.",
  "That's exactly right, Justice Sotomayor. So this only operates when somebody's been, essentially, stopped for some other infraction. And then, at that point, if there's reasonable suspicion to try to identify immigration status, then that can happen. Of course, one of the things that - -",
  "Sure.",
  "Well, it's different in one important respect, Justice Sotomayor, and that's why I don't think that the issue that divides the parties is only the issue of how long you can detain somebody because I think the Federal government takes the rather unusual position that, even though these stops and these inquiries, if done on an ad hoc basis, become preempted if they're done on a systematic basis - -",
  "Okay. But -- so that's - -",
  "And -- and, with respect, I don't think Section 2(B) really speaks to that, which is to say I don't think Section 2(B) says that the systematic inquiry has to take any longer than the ad hoc inquiry. And, indeed, Section 2 -- in one of its provisions -- specifically says that it has to be implemented in a way that's consistent with Federal, both immigration law and civil rights law. So, there - -",
  "Well, I don't know that it speaks to it in specific terms, but here's what I believe would happen, which is to say, at that point, then, the officer would ask themselves whether there's any reason to continue to detain the person for state law purposes. I mean, it could be that the original offense that the person was pulled over needs to be dealt with or something like that.",
  "But -- but, if what we're talking about is simply what happens then, for purposes of the Federal immigration consequences, the answer is nothing. The individual, at that point, is released. And that, I think, can be very well illustrated by Section 6 -- I don't want to change the subject unnecessarily, but there is arrest authority for somebody who has committed a public offense, which means that it's a crime in another state and in Arizona, but the person can't be arrested for that offense, presumably, because they have already served their sentence for the offense; and then there is new arrest authority given to the officer to hold that person if they are deportable for that offense. Now, I think, in that circumstance, it's very clear what would happen, is an inquiry would be made to the Federal officials that would say, do you want us to transfer this person to your custody or hold this person until you can take custody? And if the answer is no, then that's the end of it. That individual is released because there is no independent basis in that situation for the state officer to continue to detain the individual at all.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think there's two answers to that. One is -- you're right, sometimes, it's a complex inquiry. Sometimes, it's a straightforward inquiry. It could be murder. It could be a drug crime. But I think the practical answer to the question is, by hypothesis, there is going to be inquiry made to the Federal immigration authorities, either the Law Enforcement Support Center or a 287 - - 287(g) officer. And, presumably, as a part of that inquiry, they can figure out whether or not this is a removable offense or at least a substantially likely removable offense.",
  "Oh, I don't - -",
  "I don't think so, Your Honor, and I think that -- you know, what -- in all of these provisions, you have the Fourth Amendment backing up the limits, and I think so - -",
  "Yes, ultimately, it's a reasonable inquiry. And I think that, under these circumstances, what we know from the record here is that, generally, the immigration status inquiry is something that takes 10 or 11 minutes, I mean, so it's not -- we're not talking about something -- or no more than 10, if it's a 287(g) officer, and, roughly, 11 minutes on average if it's the Law Enforcement Support Center.",
  "I don't want to represent that - -",
  "Sure, sure. But what I can represent - -",
  "-- is that he's not going to be detained any longer than the Fourth Amendment allows.",
  "And - -",
  "I don't think it is, Justice Breyer, and here's why it's not: Because, even though there certainly are situations where state authorities will arrest somebody and then release them relatively rapidly, they generally don't release somebody until they can nail down their identity and whether or not they are likely to come to a court hearing at a subsequent - -",
  "It - -",
  "Justice Scalia, it is neither - -",
  "No, of course, the Federal government, that also has a lot of immigration arrests that are subject to the Fourth Amendment, is not making a Fourth Amendment claim here. And it's neither an immigration law concern or something that should be the basis for striking down a statute on its face.",
  "But I do want to -- but I do want to be responsive and make the point that I think the factual premise that this is going to -- 2(B) is going to lead to the elongation of a lot of arrests is not true.",
  "I think what you could say is that - -",
  "I don't think you can say just that.",
  "I think you can say something similar, though. I think you probably could say that, look, this is a facial challenge. The statute's never gone into effect. We don't anticipate that Section 2(B) would elongate, in a significant number of cases, the detention or the arrest. I think you could say that. And the reason is, as I indicated, it's something that happens even without this law that, when you arrest somebody -- and there are some offenses that are -- you can arrest and release under state law, but before you release the individual, you generally want to ascertain that that individual is going to show up at the hearing, and that's what really distinguishes those cases, where there's arrest and release, from those cases where there's arrest and you book somebody. Now, here's the other reason why I don't think, factually, this is going to elongate things because, already, in a significant number of booking facilities in Arizona, you already have the process that people are systematically run through immigration checks when they are booked as part of the booking process. That's reflected in the record here in the Maricopa County system, that that's done by a 287(g) officer as a matter of routine. The Federal government doesn't like this statute, but they are very proud of their Secure Communities program. And their Secure Communities program also makes clear that everybody's that's booked at participating facilities is -- eventually has their immigration status checked. And so I don't think that this immigration status check is likely to lead to a substantial elongation of the stops or the detentions. Now, obviously - -",
  "Exactly. Obviously, if this is somebody who was going -- you know, 60 miles an hour in a 20-mile-an-hour school zone or something, they may decide, wholly apart from the immigration issues, that this is somebody they want to bring back to the station. But, for the purposes of once they make the contact with Federal immigration officials, if the Federal immigration officials say, look, we have no interest in removing this person, we have no interest in prosecuting this person under the Federal criminal provisions, then that's the end of the Federal case of the - -",
  "No, I don't accept that, Justice Scalia, but - -",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, here, Justice Scalia, here's my response, which is all of this discussion, at least as I've understood it, has been about 2(B) and, to a lesser extent, 6. Now, Section 3 of the statute does provide an authority, under state law, to penalize somebody who has violated, essentially, the Federal registration requirement. So if that's -- as to that provision, there would be a state authority, even under these hypotheticals, to take action with respect to the individual - -",
  "-- but not with respect to the Federal - -",
  "Well, and I think - -",
  "And I think my answer to that is no. I think the reason my answer is no has more to do with our defense of Section 3 and other provisions than it does with respect to the inquiry and arrest authority provisions, 2(B) and 6.",
  "Well, if I can just kind of work back for a second? I mean, obviously, it's a pretty unusual circumstance, where somebody produces an out-of-state driver's license, and that doesn't dispel reasonable suspicion for the officer. But I'll take the hypo - -",
  "And that might be a situation where that's the case, and then -- then it wouldn't dispel the reasonable suspicion. But, say, in the average case, I think it would. They would then go further. And then they would then make the inquiry to the Federal officials. And then if -- because of the fact that the individual actually is a citizen or something like that, then what would happen is, at some point, you'd get to the end of a permissible Terry stop, and the officer would release the individual. Now, it might not be the end of the matter because, of course -- you know, they -- they still have the name, they still have the ability to collect that information and try to continue the check as they move forward, taking down the information on the New Mexico driver's license. But I think the important thing is that - - you know, this statute doesn't authorize them to detain the individual, certainly beyond the -- the Fourth Amendment limits. And it really doesn't authorize them to do anything that the official couldn't do on an ad hoc basis without the statute. Now, it does do - -",
  "I think that's correct, Your Honor. Now, as we read Section 6, because there's a pre-existing definition of public offense in Arizona law, we don't think this is kind of the -- the full Office of Legal Counsel situation, where you have broad arrest authority for removable individuals. This is a relatively narrow slice of additional arrest authority that happens to give arrest authority for people that seem to fit the Federal government's priority because it really is going to apply to criminal aliens. But I don't -- I don't take any issue with what you're saying. I do think, though, it's important to understand that 2(B) really doesn't give the officer an authority he didn't otherwise have. It does do one thing that's very important, though, which it does have the effect of overriding local policies that actually forbad some officers from making those communications and -- because that's one of the primary effects of 2(B). It just shows how difficult the government's preemption argument is here because those kind of local policies are expressly forbidden by Federal statute. 1373(a) and 8 U.S.C. 1644 basically say that localities can't have those kind of sanctuary laws. And so one effect that 2(B) has is, on a state level, it basically says, look, you can't have local officers telling you not to make those inquiries. You must have those inquiries.",
  "They are removable. I don't think they would have committed a public offense - - absent a very unusual situation, I don't think they would have committed a public offense under Arizona law. So I don't think there actually would be arrest authority in that circumstance, as Justice Alito's question has -- has - -",
  "A public offense definition - - it's actually -- it's a petition appendix -- well, I'm sorry. The definition is, basically, that it's something that is a crime in another jurisdiction and also a crime in Arizona. And so what makes this kind of anomalous is, normally, if something is a crime in Arizona, there's arrest authority for that directly. So what this really captures is people who have committed a crime are no longer arrestable for the crime because they have served their sentence or some other peculiarity, but they are, nonetheless, removable because of the crime. And so - -",
  "Well, it's certainly imposing different sanctions. I mean -- you know, it's -- it's a little bit -- kind of hard to weigh the difference between removability, which is obviously a pretty significant sanction for an alien, and the relatively modest penalties imposed by Section 5(C). But I take the premise that 5(C) does something that there is no direct analog in Federal law. But I -- but that -- that's not enough to get you to preemption, obviously. And one of the things that makes 5(C), it seems to us, a weak case for preemption is that it only targets employment that is expressly forbidden by Federal law. And so, then we look at -- you know, essentially, the government is reduced to arguing that because, in 1986, when Congress passed IRCA, it only focused on the employer's side of the equation and didn't, generally speaking, impose restrictions on employees, that, somehow, they are going to draw a preemptive inference from that.",
  "I think it's an acceptable test. I mean, Justice Kennedy -- you know, there obviously have been subsequent cases, including DeCanas that -- and Whiting, that give additional shape and color to that test, and -- but I don't have any -- I don't have any real quarrel with that test. And here's why I don't think that - -",
  "It may be what you're going to hear, Justice Kennedy, but I don't think you just take the Federal government for its word on these things. You know, it's interesting, in DeCanas itself, the SG said that that California statute was preempted. And, in DeCanas, this Court didn't say, well, you know, we've got this language from Hines, and we have the SG telling us it's preempted, that's good enough for us. They went beyond that, and they looked hard. And what they did is they established that this is an area where the presumption against preemption applies. So that seems one strike in our favor. We have here a situation where there is an express preemption provision, and it -- it only addresses the employer's side of the ledger. So the express preemption provision clearly doesn't apply here. So the only thing they have is this inference - -",
  "Sure. And - -",
  "But -- but, Justice Sotomayor, there's a big difference between Congress deciding not as a matter of Federal law to address employees with an additional criminal prohibition and saying that that decision itself has preemptive effect. That's a rather remarkable additional step. And here's why I think, if you consider the legislative history, for those who do, it really supports us because here's what Congress confronted. I mean, they started thinking about this problem in 1971. They passed IRCA in 1986. At that point, here's the state of the world: It's already unlawful, as a matter of Federal law, for the employee to get -- to have this unlawful work; and, if they seek this unlawful work, they are subject to removal for doing it. In addition, Congress was told that most of the aliens who get this unlawful work are already here -- they illegally entered, so they are already subject to an independent criminal offense. So, at that point, Congress is facing a world where the employee is already subject to multiple prohibitions. The employer is completely scot-free as a matter of Federal law. And so, at that point, in 1986, they address the employer's side of the equation. They have an express preemption provision that says nothing about any intent of preempting the employee's side of the ledger. And, in that, I don't think - -",
  "Two quick responses, and then I'd like to save time for rebuttal, Justice Ginsburg. The first is that, if you look at what they regulate on the employee's side, it's really things that actually assist in regulating the employer's side because what they are worried about is a fraudulent document that then is used, essentially, to trick the employer to employing somebody who shouldn't be employed. The second thing is the more that you view IRCA as actually regulating part of the employee's side, then I think the more persuasive it is that the express preemption provision doesn't reach the employee's side of the equation.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I appreciate the opportunity to do that. I do think, as to Section 3, the question is really -- it's -- it's a provision that is parallel to the Federal requirements and imposes the same punishments as the Federal requirement. So it's, generally, not a fertile ground for preemption. But, of course, there are cases that find preemption even in those analogous circumstances. They are the cases that the government is forced to rely on, cases like Buckman, cases like - -",
  "I think they could under general double jeopardy principles and the dual sovereignty doctrine. Obviously, if that was a particular concern to you, that might be the basis for an as-applied challenge, if somebody was already prosecuted under Federal law. But, of course, this Court has confronted exactly that argument, in California against Zook, where you had the statute of California that prohibited somebody operating as an interstate carrier without the ICC license. It was raised -- you know, you have to let just the Feds enforce that law. Otherwise, there is a possibility of duplicative punishment, duplicative prosecution. And this Court rejected that argument there.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think that's part of the reason why I accepted Justice Kennedy's characterization of the relevant language in Hines because, although there is some general discussion there of field preemption, when the Court actually states what its holding is, it does state it in terms of obstacle preemption. And here's where I think there is a critical difference between what the Court had before it in Hines and what you have before you here. In Hines, Pennsylvania passed its statute before Congress passed the alien registration statute. So, not surprisingly -- you know, they weren't -- they weren't soothsayers in Pennsylvania. They couldn't predict the future. So, when it got up here, there was a conflict between the provisions of the Pennsylvania registration law and the Federal registration law. And this Court struck it down on that preemption basis. Here it's quite different. Arizona had before it the Federal statute. It looked at this precise provision in the Federal statute. It adopted those standards as its own, and then it imposed parallel penalties for the violation of the state equivalent. And so I -- I think the right analysis is really the analysis that this Court laid out in its Whiting decision, which says that, in these kinds of cases, what you look for is whether or not the state scheme directly interferes with the operation of the Federal scheme.",
  "I think it probably wouldn't apply. There's two provisions that might make it inapplicable. The first question you'd ask is whether that individual in that category would be subject to prosecution under 1304 and 1306. And, if I understand -- you know, the Government's position, there are certain people where -- you know, they can't really get the registration document because of the narrow class that they are in. And, as I understand it, it is not a violation of either 1304 or 1306 to not get a registration document when you're somebody who can't get one. So you're not liable for the willful -- willful failure to get a registration document. And, when you don't have a registration document to carry, you don't run afoul of 1306 in the - -",
  "Well, sure.",
  "But -- but that's not the narrow class we were talking about.",
  "Well, if you're in -- no, if you're in the country lawfully, I mean, you can try to register. And so somebody who enters illegally -- I mean, they are already guilty of one Federal misdemeanor by the illegal entry.",
  "But, at the point that they stay 30 days and don't try to register, then that's an independent violation. And so maybe I need to fix what I said and say, look, if you're somebody who -- if you did go to register, would be told, you're fine, but we can't give you a registration document. Then that individual is not subject to prosecution under the Federal statute, therefore, wouldn't be subject to prosecution under the state statute.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start, briefly, with the enforcement issues and then talk about the other provisions. The last thing I'll say about the enforcement provision, since I do think that the Government's rather unusual theory that something that's okay when done ad hoc becomes preempted when it's systematic. I think that theory largely refutes itself. But I will say one thing, which is to just echo that there is no interference with enforcement priorities by simply giving the Federal government information on which to bring their enforcement priorities to bear. And this is really illustrated by a point this Court made in its Florence decision earlier this month, which is that, sometimes, you pull somebody over for the most innocuous of infractions, and they turn out to be the most serious of offenders. And so if you preclude officers, as happened in Phoenix, from communicating with the Federal government, the Federal government will not be able to identify the worst of the worst. And if you want an example of this, look at the declaration of Officer Brett Glidewell at Joint Appendix 183 to 186. He pulled somebody over in a routine traffic stop and was shot by the individual. Now, the individual, it turns out, was wanted for attempted murder in El Salvador and was also guilty of illegal reentry into the United States. He was stopped on three previous occasions and his status was not verified. Now, if it had been, he certainly would have been apprehended. In at least two of the stops, his immigration status wasn't checked because of the city policy, city of Phoenix. Now, if the state, I submit, can do anything, it can, at the state level, override those kind of local policies and say, that's not what we want. Community policing is all well and good, but we want to maximize communication with the Federal authorities. So I think the enforcement policy and priorities argument simply doesn't work. As to Section 3, two points about that, one is, I respectfully disagree with the Solicitor General as to whether the various things that he led off -- read off, the litany of situations where somebody is - - technically doesn't have registration would be a violation of 1306(a). And the reason I take that position is that provision says a willful failure to register. Now, maybe the prosecutors take the view that there is willfulness in those circumstances, but I don't think many judges would. I think they would say that, if you've been told by the Federal government that you're perfectly fine here and you don't need to register, that that would be good enough to defeat a finding of willfulness. So I don't think 1306(a) covers this case.",
  "Well - -",
  "No, we're going to say that we communicated with the Federal immigration officials, and they told us this is somebody who's perfectly fine and doesn't have to register. The - -",
  "My supposition, Justice Sotomayor, is that they would use that call to not bring the prosecution, so the issue wouldn't even arise. But I do want to be clear about - -",
  "And they bring a prosecution under Section 3 and then - -",
  "I think they would get it from the Federal authorities. I think it would be admitted. There might be a challenge in that case. I mean -- you know, this is a facial challenge. I'm not going to try to address that potential Sixth Amendment issue. What I would like to say is two things. One, if there is some sloppiness in the way the Federal government keeps its records, so that there's lots of people that really should be registered, but aren't, I can't imagine that sloppiness has a preemptive effect. The second thing I would say is that I do think, in thinking about Section 3 in particular, the analogy is not the fraud on the FDA claim in Buckman. It's really the state tort law that says that it's a violation of state tort law to not even seek the approval that's needed under the FDA for a device. Now, states impose tort law for people that market a device without getting the necessary approval. And nobody thinks that's preempted because it serves the Federal interest. It doesn't have a deluge of information. It forces people to get FDA approval. And in the same way, this state law will force people to register, which is what the Federal government is supposed to want in the first place, so there is no preemption there. There is no conflict. As to the employment provision, I do think it's important to recognize that - -",
  "-- before 1986, the -- the government was not agnostic about unlawful employment by aliens. The employees were already covered, and they were subject to deportation. So the government said, we're going to cover the employers for the first time. I can't imagine why that would have preemptive effect. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The DPPA is an unusual statute. It directly regulates the State's use of their own databases and imposes massive civil liability and criminal penalties for violations. It regulates it in a relatively distinct way, which is it makes disclosures presumptively unlawful, but then has 14 permissible use provisions for which the State may, but does not must, may disclose the information. The scope of those 14 permissible use provisions then becomes quite important for determining whether or not a statute that was originally designed primarily to regulate the commercial sale of DMV information becomes intrusive into matters of traditional State regulation or imposes massive liability without the requisite clarity. Now, I would have thought that it was fairly clear that, but for a resort to the specific controls to the general canon, that all of the activity at issue here comes comfortably within the language of (b)(4) because, if you look at that language, it is remarkably broad. Congress uses the word \"any\" three times. It uses \"in connection with,\" which I think we all know is a term of breadth. And then it uses \"including\" and uses illustrative examples. And I think the only thing that really brings these examples together is Congress seems to be covering the litigation process from cradle to grave.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, that's exactly right. But the whole reason it has to have some limit is because it's presumptively quite broad. And if -- I mean, for those who look at legislative history, the evolution of this provision, as it -- it was changed twice in the legislative process. And it started out that Congress was going to have a permissible use just for use in litigation involving motor vehicles. Then they dropped \"motor vehicles\" and just said, \"use in litigation.\" And then, in the final iteration, they said, \"use in connection with litigation.\" So, clearly, they were trying to broaden it. Now, I -- I would be the first to admit that there has to be some limit, and we certainly wouldn't say, for example, that if lawyers -- you know, decide in this case, well -- you know, we got this DMV information for perfectly legitimate purposes involved in a litigation, but, now, we are sitting on a gold mine, so we should try to sell -- sell these same people floor mats or wiper blades or something. I mean, of course, they can't do that. So there are limits, but I think --",
  "It may or may not, depending on where you draw the line.",
  "But can I say something before we talk about that? You know, if they are really trying to go after the dress manufacturers --",
  "-- they can go to the phone book, they can go to the title records office, there is lots of places they can go, if what they want is just general information about people. And the only State database that Congress has seen fit to regulate is DMV databases.",
  "But, Justice Breyer, that's part of the reason I'm pointing --",
  "Sure. And --",
  "I think, actually, the best answer, at the end of the day, is it depends on whether you are focused on a specific transaction, occurrence, defect, so I think you might ultimately --",
  "I would say the best answer is that you can. If you don't like that answer and you want to draw the line in a different place --",
  "Well, here -- here's the thing -- is I think there is a couple of places you could draw the line, and I think there is a line drawing question any time you have language like \"in connection with.\" The first would be, okay, I'm lawyers, and I want to get clients for litigation. You could say, well, that's enough of an \"in connection\" requirement, so you can use that. I would say that that's probably on the other side of the line, but you could just say that's close enough. The other place you could draw the line is when you have a specific transaction, occurrence, defect, so that there be would be a difference. If I -- if I get this information and send people letters and say, I see you bought a new car in the last two years -- you know, there is a lemon law in this State --",
  "Well --",
  "No, they are not in the following sense, Justice Breyer -- okay. Just to understand kind of the chronology here, no request -- FOIA request is made at all here until my clients have been approached by individuals who are complaining, okay? No letter goes out until the litigation is actually filed. Now, they want to say - -",
  "Okay.",
  "Right.",
  "If you want to draw the line south of the trolling line, then I think what you would say is this is an easy case because no communication took place until my clients had a client. And then they want to say, well, wait a second, your clients didn't have a beef with the other dealers. That's wrong. At all times in this suit, they had a conspiracy claim against those other dealers. So, even as to the individuals they already represented, they had a beef with those dealers.",
  "Justice Kennedy --",
  "A FOIA request was made before the suit was filed. No letter to a potential witness/client was sent until after it was filed.",
  "Sure. And the FOIA -- the two FOIA requests that were made beforehand were specifically noted that they were in anticipation of litigation, and they were investigating, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, as they needed to under State law, whether this was a widespread practice. And --",
  "I think it would, Justice Ginsburg, because I think that, when you are trying to figure out where to draw the line, you look to the words in the statute, which you know that \"investigation in anticipation of litigation\" is covered, and I would think that would fit comfortably within \"investigation in anticipation of litigation.\" And the --",
  "I couldn't agree more, Mr. Chief Justice, which is why the line can't really be between investigation in anticipation of litigation and solicitation in anticipation of litigation because that is too thin a line to make a $200 million difference.",
  "The line is whether or not it is in anticipation of litigation or in connection with litigation --",
  "I think the way you do is you would basically say that, when they are saying, \"in anticipation of litigation,\" they mean in anticipation of a particular litigation, particular problem, and so it's different --",
  "Oh, absolutely not. I mean, it seems to me --",
  "No. They are -- they are concerned about a particular thing, and I think the \"in anticipation of litigation\" language, I mean, that's not the only time you have ever seen it before --",
  "It --",
  "I think it is, though I guess my point would be, even if you can identify some solicitation that is not investigation, as long as it's in connection with litigation, it's in (b)(4), and then I think --",
  "I agree with everything, except the first thing you said --",
  "-- which is that this is a prohibition on solicitation. If you look at the structure of the statute, it says, presumptively, you can't use this for anything. And then there are 14 permissions. And some of the permissions, like (b)(4), are unconditional. If you come within (b)(4), you get to use it. Now, when you get to the end of the statute, which is -- I respectfully suggest is not where you put the core provisions, it's where you put the less favored provisions -- then you have, in (b)(12), a conditional permission that you can use it, but only if you get consent. Now, the thrust of their position is, if you are in one of the unconditional permissions, but you also are, presumptively, in one of the conditional permissions, somehow, that condition from (b)(12) hops over to (b)(12) -- (b)(4) and says --",
  "No, you don't. There is no discrepancy. A conditional -- like you get a green light for use in litigation. You get a yellow light for solicitation. If you have solicitation in connection with litigation, you're covered by both, you take the green light, there is no conflict. And the premise for your discussion was we have to harmonize. I would take issue with that. If you look at these 14 exemptions, there is tons of overlap in them. Congress is not telling you that each of these 14 exceptions has an exclusive area, and you have to find out which field is preempted by (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7). If you look at (b)(1) and (b)(4), there is complete overlap. One of the things I would take issue with is my brother said that, well, (b)(4) is about the tribunal. No, it's not. (B)(1) is principally about the tribunal. (B)(1) is the provision that talks about government actors and their functions, and it specifically talks about torts.",
  "Justice Alito, it is important to recognize lawyers presumptively get it under Federal law, but Federal law is only a floor. And so let's take Social Security numbers, please, because, sure, as to (b)(4) and (b)(1) and two other provisions, Congress says, presumptively, you can get Social Security numbers. You know what -- you know what State -- the State of South Carolina says? You never get Social Security numbers, unless you have a court order. They put that right in their State FOIA law. And so that is just another example of how -- this is a Federal floor. States can release this information. They don't have to. And, to Justice Breyer's point, it makes sense that you would distinguish between an attorney who is subject to the Bar discipline, is subject to oversight and solicitation process, and treat that solicitation differently from a solicitation by a direct marketer, which is what (b)(12) is clearly aimed at, not the practice of law.",
  "It's certainly not an all-purpose privacy statute. I do think that's fair. And the principal thing that they were concerned about, of course, is that you could look at somebody's license plate and indiscriminately go down, pay a fee, and get their home address. Now, the one thing we know from (b)(4) is, if a lawyer wants to do that exact thing, to serve process, the lawyer gets to do it. You can get somebody's license plate, go to the DMV, get an address, and serve process. And they specifically preserve that. So we know, as to the core of the statute, they treated lawyers differently. They were also concerned with direct marketers taking this information and using it to market people, but I don't think you'd lump lawyer solicitation in anticipation of litigation, which may put some limit on it, together with that.",
  "There's two problems with that way of looking at the statute, I think I would respectfully suggest, Justice Kennedy. One is we are talking about items on an inclusive list, so even if you took your premise that -- that the anticipation of litigation in that list somehow is anticipation post service of process -- which I want to come back to -- even if you took that position, they are just things on an inclusive list. And so it wouldn't stop you from saying that the ultimate test here is whether it's in connection with litigation. But I guess I would go back to that and say I've never once thought that investigation in anticipation of litigation was something that would take place after service of process. I thought -- I mean --",
  "Yeah, but I don't think that that was an intentional thing on the Court's part, that we're going to name these and we're going to name them in chronological order. If they tried to do it, I think they got it wrong.",
  "Last word \"conflicting\"?",
  "I think --",
  "I think they are necessarily overlapping, and I guess I would point to several things. First of all, the language in (b)(2), I don't think helps them nearly as much as they do. I think that language in there about survey research, like much language in many statutes, maybe avoids the marketers -- or the -- the motor vehicle marketers from having to be here in a lawsuit because it removes all doubt about it. But I think they would be covered, even without those words. But the point is -- you may say, well, that's horrible, that's superfluous. But, no, if you look at the way the statute operates generally, there's lots of overlap. So this isn't a context where you want to make sure that there is no overlap and everyone operates independently. I pointed to (b)(1) and (b)(4). They both cover courts and litigation. If this Court uses DMV information in its opinion, it's covered by (b)(1), it's covered by (b)(4). Or look at (b)(3). (B)(3) is a provision that says, generally, companies can use DMV information to verify somebody's identity. And then it specifically says, and if somebody lies to you about their identity, you can pursue legal remedies. Okay. When you're pursuing that legal remedy pursuant to (b)(3), you're also doing things in connection with litigation pursuant to --",
  "But, as we've discussed, Mr. Chief Justice, if you -- if you are saying you are not going to apply the specific controls the general, but you may be using a junior varsity version of it to harmonize the statute --",
  "-- as -- as we suggested in our colloquy, I think the line between solicitation in anticipation of litigation and investigation in anticipation is far too thin a line to make a $200 million difference. And if I could direct the Court to page 93 of the Joint Appendix because that will show you just an example of the postcard that is attached to these letters. And the postcard does ask specifically, as Justice Ginsburg was suggesting -- again, this is at 93 of the Joint Appendix -- it asks people to fill out their name, address, the dealership they bought the car from, the type of car, and then the administrative fee or processing fee that was charged. Now, I think it's common ground between the parties that we get to ask about that administrative or processing fee because that is investigation in anticipation of the -- of the litigation. As I understand where my clients arguably made a $200 million mistake is by adding the line \"I'm interested\" -- \"I am interested in participating\" signature, that crosses the line into solicitation.",
  "Not under South Carolina law, it absolutely couldn't.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "But, Justice Breyer, let me try to help you this way, which, is first of all, every State in the country is focused on identity theft. And the only circumstances in which I can imagine a State ever giving Social Security numbers to a lawyer is if there case was -- you know, these car dealers are putting the Social Security numbers on the forms and we are --",
  "I don't know that offhand. I can get that to you in a supplemental letter. I just know South Carolina, it says, right in their FOIA statute, you can't get that information. And, like I said, the only situation -- it's kind of --",
  "What's that?",
  "Right.",
  "And it may be -- it may be lawyers -- it may be the lawyers want to enforce that Federal law against the dealers. And in enforcing that Federal law against the dealers, they might ask for the information. It's the same kind of thing. The only circumstances in which I could imagine a State would ever give a lawyer disability information is if they were bringing an ADA suit. If they were bringing an ADA suit against a dealer, you might actually want them --",
  "Fair point --",
  "Well, sure, but they can -- they can solicit for their legal services in connection with litigation. And that, I think, is different --",
  "Well, again, if you're going to draw a line -- there's two things here -- you know, there's -- there's an impulse to draw a line with \"in connection with,\" and, at some point, you will have to. But I don't think solicitation provides the line because the --",
  "Sure.",
  "Sure.",
  "Yeah.",
  "I think that's right, Justice Kagan. And I just want to emphasize that my -- my clients fall on the other side of even yet another line, which is they already had clients before they asked DMV anything.",
  "Yes.",
  "Exactly. Or to put -- you know, to give just another sort of example, this seems to be what clearly surely should be covered is, okay, I understand there's a defect with the particular make and model of a car. I've used the DMV records, consistent with State law, to get access to the fact that you've bought one of these cars; do you want to join the suit? I don't think there's anything nefarious with that. There's certainly nothing --",
  "Yeah, that's -- that's not my case because this -- these people came to us before we did anything. But I don't think there's anything wrong with that, Your Honor. And, yes, you might say it's solicitation, but I don't think, if you look at these provisions, that you would interpret them that way when they're all permissive uses. And --",
  "Well, Justice Alito, I think when it uses \"in anticipation of litigation,\" it actually wants to cover activity that takes place before there's an actual proceeding. And what I was going to say is -- you know, that language doesn't come out of the ether. I mean, that's the language you use in attorney work product. And, as I understand it -- I've looked into this a little bit, the basic rule there is you distinguish between litigation in the abstract and the point at which you've identified a particular transaction, occurrence, defect. And, at that point, if you're doing something, it's in -- it's in anticipation of litigation. The one other point I haven't yet made, which is, to the extent you're going to resort to the specific controls of the general, I think it is worth noting that this would be the first time, that I'm aware of, that the Court would ever have applied that canon to impose this kind of massive civil liability and even potentially criminal liability.",
  "I agree, and I think that's the best reason why the canon doesn't work. These are equally specific. And, in the case of an overlap between the two that you have here -- and you have in (b)(1) and (b)(4) and (b)(3) and (b)(4) -- you just say, okay, Congress thought it was okay, and you just call it a day.",
  "Paradoxically.",
  "Yeah. And the reason I think that --",
  "Right. But the line-drawing problem is really drawing the line about \"in connection with.\" The line-drawing problem -- drawing the line between solicitation in anticipation of litigation and investigation in -- in anticipation of litigation just doesn't work. They're two sides of the same coin. As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, if my clients had sent a letter that nobody objects to, that says, we're bringing a lawsuit, we think you may have been charged the same kind of fee, I think what the State Bar would have said -- the natural next question for anybody getting that letter is, will you represent me? And precisely because of that, we want you -- we want to treat this like it's solicitation, and we want to add these additional bells and whistles. And part of the irony here is, I think, the things that make our letter look most like it's advertisement or solicitation are the things that are required by the State Bar. And, keep in mind, that's another reason why treating attorney solicitation differently from general solicitation makes perfect sense because they're subject to --",
  "Well, and -- they would -- it's so natural that somebody will say, can I join your lawsuit --",
  "-- that they would require all the language that says, you have alternatives, other people can -- can -- can hire you.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Exactly.",
  "And, Justice Scalia, the last thing you can infer from the statute is that Congress wanted, for the first time ever, get in the business of managing attorney solicitation, a subject they'd always left to the States. And --",
  "My -- my preferred reading is that transaction, occurrence, defect -- which I took her red light camera to be an example of a particular identified defect. But I do want to emphasize, before I sit down -- it's the last thing I'll emphasize, that my case is a little bit better because we had a client and a specific defect before anything happened.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case has its origins in a decision by the British government in the Major Thatcher years to privatize a number of previously State-owned utilities. The government's plan was to keep prices constant and allow the companies to make profits by increasing efficiencies and reducing costs. Only after an initial period in which prices would be fixed would the prices be re-jiggered and then savings passed on to the consumers. Now, this, in practice, worked very well for the companies. They were able to increase their efficiencies and cut costs to a greater extent than people expected. This was not, however, greeted as a uniform success. Instead, the opposition party criticized this and said that the fat cats at the utility companies had earned too much and the conservative government had made a mistake by valuing the shares at IPO too cheaply. And so they promised, as an express election promise, to impose a tax on the excess profits of privatized utilities. And, when elected, they made good on that promise and passed the Windfall Act --",
  "Well, it has to be my way because of the way the specific tax was designed. But the first --",
  "Well, Your Honor, we're not artificially freezing the -- the number. The number -- the D -- 1461 for almost every company -- is, itself, part of the statute because they picked a period by which they were going to measure the profit in value-making terms.",
  "Well, I can talk about the outlying --",
  "I can talk about the outlying companies. They paid a different effective rate because the D was different. But there's two important things to remember. One, I believe it's common ground between the parties, that the way you applied this regulation is to look at the tax in -- to use the regulatory phrase -- in the normal circumstances in which it applies. So I believe it's common ground that you ignore the outliers anyway.",
  "No. That particular provision -- think of it as like a Clark v. Martinez principle for taxes. They either are creditable or they're not. That's what that principle has been interpreted to. The case you should look at, if you're really interested in it, is the Exxon case, the tax court, we cite it in both our briefs. And, there, it was a situation where, again, a British Excess Profits Tax, in the main, it was an Excess Profits Tax on the companies that were developing the North Sea oil field. But, as the tax applied to a couple of companies that really hadn't gotten any oil out, it applied very differently. And the tax court and the government in that case both conceded, no, you look at the tax in its main applications. And in those main applications, everyone concedes that this tax operates exactly like a 51.75 percent tax on profits above a threshold, a threshold of 4/9ths of the floatation value. And that is not an accident. That's not some kind of tricky math thing that somebody pulled up. It's right there in the statute itself because --",
  "It wouldn't, Justice Kennedy, because, at the end of the day, it's the substance of the tax, not its purpose behind it that matters. Now, I do think, in this case, as Justice Sotomayor alluded to, everybody in this process really understood that those were just the flip side of the same coin. You can talk about the profits being too high, vis-à-vis floatation, you can talk about floatation being too low vis-à-vis the subsequently reported profits, but what makes --",
  "Well, in this particular case, you would say it's creditable because the only measure of value here is by looking at retrospective earnings over a 4-year period. And the best hypothetical I can give you is think about a foreign government that says we want to tax the value of corporations, but the way we are idiosyncratically going to measure value is to look at their earnings over the past year. Now, I would hope that tax would be for U.S. substantive economic tax purposes fully creditable. Of course, it's a tax on income, by our eyes. Now, in saying that, you're not suggesting that the other company -- the other country did something wrong or that's not value in their conception. But the whole point that this Court made clear in the Biddle case, going back 75 years ago, is when you're looking at foreign taxes, for purposes of applying the foreign tax credit, you don't take the foreign characterizations, the foreign classifications, as a given. You look at the substance of the tax for our purposes. And, if you look -- if you apply that mechanism to this tax, this tax looks exactly like a U.S. Excess Profits Tax. It is really --",
  "Yes. And, of course, you could have had a one-time, one-off tax, to use the British phrase, and you could have taxed the difference between the value at floatation and -- let's say the London Stock Exchange price at some later point. And that would have been a normal estimate of value, and it would not have been creditable for a number of reasons. But when you do what this tax uniquely did, which is you don't look at a normal rubric of value, but you look at a construct -- I mean, the very fact that they had to use the phrase \"value in profit-making terms\" tells you something weird's going on here. I mean, if they were really --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I can't put all the pieces of that together and say there's one case that had all of these various features, and then it was still creditable, but I don't think that matters. It's very clear, I think, for starters, that the fact that this is a retroactive tax is not dispositive. You look at one of the regulatory requirements, and that's realization. And that treats an estimate of future income generation very differently because that doesn't involve a realization event. But what the regulation says is that the tax has to be imposed upon or subsequent to.",
  "No, it is not. It is emphatically not. And let me tell you why there is no slippery slope here. First, the big thing they want to tell you is this is a normal way of valuation. And, if you allow this, then any valuation is going to be creditable. That is flat wrong, and the reason that's flat wrong is because almost every effort in valuation is prospective. If you want to try to value a piece of property, you could value it by saying, well, what kind of rents can I get on this property, and I'll discount them back to net present value. And I suppose you can conceive of a property tax as a tax on a percentage of those projected future earnings. But you know what? Easily obviously not creditable because the first requirement on the regulation is that there be a realization event. And when you're talking about projected future income streams, there's no realization events. So all of those are off the table.",
  "Exactly --",
  "Because you never would do that in any normal valuation. What you would do -- occasionally, in valuation, you have to go back in time. This isn't the only place in the world that anybody said, I wonder what Google's stock was worth, like, back in the day. But, when you do that for valuation purposes, the first rule of thumb is to avoid hindsight bias, and so this tax uniquely taxes nothing, but hindsight bias. It's going back to 1990 --",
  "I would love to talk about those other variables. The floatation value -- I mean, it's a tax between the difference between -- between two variables. The reason I am focusing on the value and profit-making terms is because it's the larger of the two numbers, and the tax falls in the difference between the two, and the floatation value is basically taken as a given. And --",
  "Go ahead. I mean, I could talk floatation value all day.",
  "Yes, and that's true of every Excess Profits Tax, Your Honor. What matters for those tax --",
  "No. They -- they would pay different taxes. I mean, they pay the same rate --",
  "They have the same -- they'd have the same rate. They'd have -- I mean, the same calculation, but it would affect them very differently. But in --",
  "I -- I don't think --",
  "Right.",
  "Right -- that's right. But, of course, the floatation value is going to play a bigger role in the other company --",
  "Then -- then maybe it could, Justice Kagan, but let me say two things about that --",
  "No. With all due respect, it's taxing profits above a threshold, and the threshold is determined by floatation value. For most companies that the tax applies -- and that is the way you look at the creditability of these taxes, you ignore the outlier. For most of those companies, it's going to be 4/9ths of the floatation value.",
  "No, that's not right, Your Honor. I -- it really is not. And what they were trying to do -- first of all, the outliers, the reason they included them in is they figured they had to because it fit within their definition of the regulated companies they were trying to catch. Now, they knew they had -- and this is only two companies we are talking about -- they knew they had a shorter period, so they knew this would fall differently on them as a substantive matter no matter -- no matter how they did it. The reason they didn't care much is because those companies got something that the other companies didn't, which is they got to operate for the next three years in a favorable regulatory environment in which no Excess Profits Tax would be imposed on them. So it may look like they have a higher rate -- effective rate under our calculation. They do have a higher effective rate over a -- over a relatively small amount over the threshold, but they make that up, essentially, in the out-years because they make money under the favorable regulatory regime. And, again, the theory of this is, for four years after floatation, there is a favorable regulatory regime in which they make excess profits. Those two companies get to make money in the out-years, two, three, four, without any excess profits because it was really important for them to make this a one-off tax. But if I can get back to your question because there is this phenomenon --",
  "They were. They weren't -- but they weren't subject to any tax for it because, remember, they -- this is very important for Labour. They are coming in after 20 years of conservative rule. They don't want to be the old Labour party. They don't want to put in a new permanent tax, so they want to do this once. And so that works great for my clients because they -- they were privatized in 1990. But, when they're doing this in 1997, they get a couple of outlying companies that were only privatized in '96. So what they do is they hit them with a reasonably tough tax in year one, but year two, three, and four, they were in a favorable regulatory environment, and they get no tax at all. So -- you know, don't -- don't cry any tears for them. Now, the point I thought you were going to ask me, though, is, even with the companies with the same denominator, it is true that companies with the same profits can be subjected to different taxes, but that's because it's an Excess Profits Tax. And that is what is true of --",
  "With respect, that's only true of --",
  "With respect, I disagree because, first of all, it's only those two companies, from what you said, is -- it could possibly be true. As to the rest of the companies, the reason that they were trying to use D is because they were trying to capture the excess profits during a period in which there is a particular regulatory environment with -- where they -- where they thought they earned excess profits. For all of the companies they reached, that period was the D with the exception of the outliers, and the reason they had a different outlier is because they were recently privatized. But, if you think about the substance of this tax, it is taxing -- their term -- value and profit-making terms, but not any abstract profit-making terms, profits over a reported period.",
  "Because they had three free years in the out-years. And, if you are looking at how this applies, in the normal circumstances of its application, then you don't have the full analysis of a railroad track.",
  "No, that's not right.",
  "No, that's -- with all due respect, that's not right. The floatation value is calculated the same way for each of these companies, and the theory of why the floatation value is too low is the same for all of them, which is, under the regulatory policies, they are going to hold the prices firm for a four-year period, and they are going to increase efficiencies and reduce costs, and they are going to make money. That is supposed to incentivize them, and then that's the basis for all the regulatory policies going forward.",
  "Right. Right.",
  "Well, I -- I think so, but I think I get there in a slightly different way because I guess I don't see the natural relationship between the 23 percent and the floatation value, but I think I get to a similar place, which is, if you think about it the way that we formulate it, it's 51.75 percent of 4/9ths of floatation value. Now, the -- the floatation value is calculated based on the initial share price, plus the number of shares. And the initial share price for all the electrical utilities was 2 pounds, 40 pence. So it's just 2 pounds, 40 pence, by however many shares there were. Okay. So that's floatation value. The -- the floor for the excess profits is 4/9ths of floatation value. Now, if you want to get it on an annualized average basis and if you want to -- you know, this is at 64a of the petition appendix when the Tax Court did it -- but what that means in practice is this tax is taxing 51.75 percent of the profits above 1/9th of the floatation --",
  "Yes.",
  "It -- it will give you a different number.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's not true.",
  "I mean, of any company here -- of any company here, that's not true.",
  "It's stipulated --",
  "Railtrack. But, again, Railtrack did not pay more in taxes than they made in --",
  "And -- and -- and that is a very important fact because when you are trying to figure out --",
  "-- what -- and, again, their regulation says, you look to the application of the statute, in the normal circumstances in which it applies. In the normal circumstances in which this applies -- and, this, the parties stipulated to -- every company paid less in this Excess Profits Tax or windfall tax than they made in initial period profits. And that is all that really matters. They want to focus on the fact that, well, for a lot of these companies, the base amount was larger than the -- than their initial period profits. Who cares? I mean, that's just an artificial number. This --",
  "No. I don't think so because, again --",
  "No, it's not, Justice Sotomayor. Now, there's two things your question, I think, got to; one, I thought I already dealt with, which is future valuation is not a problem. There is no realization of it.",
  "And it's not right or wrong. We would say it's creditable, if that's its predominant character. So if you want to put that as part of a ten-factor test, where past realized profits is one of the ten factors, but you also look at real market valuation and some other factor, then I'm probably going to lose. But, in this instance, the only moving factor -- the only thing that changes from company-to-company, other than the floatation value, which is fixed, is their profits. And nobody -- you know, nobody doubts --",
  "Right. But --",
  "But, again, that is classic Excess Profits Tax. So let me try to come at it this way, which is to say, suppose you had a country that had a tax that said, we are going to tax your value, and we are going to measure your -- your -- your value based on the income you made in the last year or the last 2 years. Now, I would say that that is clearly a creditable income tax. If they said the same thing, we are going to tax your value, and we are going to calculate your value based on your income over the last 2 years, but we are going to subtract 10 percent of your market cap, that would be an Excess Profits Tax. The market cap would be different for every company, so there would be another thing that was different for each company, and the effective rate might be different, but that's okay because that's how an excessive profits tax works. The last thing I'd say before I go sit down is that's how the 1917 United States Excess Profits Tax worked. In 1918, when Congress said that foreign excess profits taxes are creditable, surely, that's what they had in mind, and this is very similar to that classic, prototypical Excess Profits Tax. If I could reserve the remainder of my time?",
  "Thank you. Just a few quick points in rebuttal. First of all, just for the record, if what they really wanted to do in the British government was to tax value, as we normally understood it, there was a ready mechanism available, the London Stock Exchange price. Now they want to say, well, but we wanted to go back and value it in 1990, but, as alluded to, they could have done that because, on day one, there was about a 20 percent pop -- that's -- to use the IPO word -- there's about a 20 percent pop in value at the end of the first day's trading. They could have taxed that. If they wanted to be a little less precise, but capture a little more value, they could have gone 30 days out or 60 days out, on the theory that it took a while for the information to make it in to the market. That would have been a value tax. I wouldn't be up here arguing that it's creditable. But what they did was something very different. They used a sui generis, very unique concept of value, not value unmodified, but value in profit-making terms. And not profit-making terms in some abstract sense that takes into account future income streams, but profit-making terms, as measured by 4 years of reported profits that satisfy every test of the regulation. They're realized profits, they're based on gross receipts, and they reflect exactly to the penny -- to the pence, the net income. That's what they base this tax on.",
  "I would be here with a more difficult case, Justice Kagan. I would love to argue that that is still creditable because I think you could live in a country that has an income tax, especially an Excess Profits Tax on a few disfavored industries, that has a rate over 100 percent. But I would run into a regulatory hurdle, and, if I had had that case, I would have had to challenge the regulations. I would have loved to do it.",
  "Can I just say, though, it wouldn't have been a fluke because one of the things that the people that constructed this tax wanted out of this tax is they wanted it paid. So it's not a fluke that they didn't impose a huge tax in excess of initial period profits on any company because they wanted to make sure the incidents of this tax was on companies that could actually pay it. And, if you do that based on 4 years' of reported profits, you're pretty sure that people are going to be able to pay it. I would like to bring back to the -- the concession, I think, that ultimately was made by the government, that, if a foreign government has a tax on value, that the only measure of value is the past years' reported income, that that would be a creditable income tax. Well, I don't think it changes if you multiply it by 9. I don't think it changes if you divide it by 4. I don't think if there is one company, that you divide it by 1/4, instead of 4 -- any of that changes the analysis, nor does it change the analysis if you subtract out some figure that represents a market cap or initial floatation value. That would make it an Excess Profits Tax, rather than a simple income tax, and that is what the British government did. I'll just close by bringing you back 75 years to the Biddle case. In the Biddle case, there was an argument about a British tax and whether we should follow the form of the tax or the substance of this tax. This Court said that we, of course, in looking at a foreign tax, don't bind ourselves by foreign classifications or characterizations. We look to the substance of the tax. In the Biddle case, the rule that you look to substance, not form, benefited the Commissioner. There's no reason for a different rule when the shoe is on the other foot. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about the scope and continuing existence of a doctrine that has been a feature of this Court's cases and a necessary corollary of its willingness to extend arbitration to Federal statutory claims, the vindication of rights doctrine. Ever since this Court 30 years ago, roughly, got in the business of extending arbitration to Federal statutory claims, it's used the effective vindication doctrine as an assurance that Federal statutory claims would not go unvindicated just because of the arbitral forum. And so, if you look at this Court's cases, they stand for a simple proposition. When the choice is arbitration or litigation, surely the FAA favors arbitration and it's no threat to the underlying statute because the underlying statutory claim is vindicated in the arbitral forum.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, let me take --",
  "Justice Scalia, let me take on the premise and then we get -- then also say where really the concern comes in for the differential treatment. I would take issue with the premise, which is, sure, there wasn't a Sherman Act -- there wasn't a class action Rule 23 back when the Sherman Act was first passed. But there were procedures in like joinder that allowed for multiple claims to be litigated together; there were not confidentiality agreements that came in and limited your ability to share information from one claim to another, and, of course, back in the good old days, you didn't necessarily need a $300,000 expert to bring a Sherman Act claim. But what I think is the problem is when you have a difference, and that is the assumption on which this case comes to the Court, where you could vindicate this claim in court because there are mechanisms to share or shift costs and you cannot vindicate them in the arbitration because of a combination of features of the arbitration agreement that prevent any sharing or shifting of costs.",
  "Well, you could do it by category, and I suppose you could treat antitrust claims differently, but I think there's an answer that's already built into the Court's cases, which is Randolph, and it's putting the burden on the plaintiff to make a nonspeculative showing. And in the case you've described, I would think you would say, boy, that's speculative. I mean -- you know, you don't need that --",
  "Well -- well, don't be too concerned, Justice Breyer. First of all, if you look at the cases where the doctrine's been applied, it's largely been in antitrust cases. The First Circuit Kristian case is an antitrust case. And I don't think that's an accident. I mean, if you look at the Hovenkamp amicus brief, it make clear that you just can't bring this type of claim without an expert --",
  "Well, I mean, Justice Breyer, none of us can know for sure what Professor Arita would say. But we know what Professor Hovenkamp says, and he says to bring these claims you need an expert. Now, in --",
  "He says in arbitration or anywhere. He assumes that anywhere you bring these claims, you're going to need a market power expert.",
  "And what I would say, Justice Breyer, is the place for that debate, if it were going to take place, was in the district court. Because we made our case, as Randolph requires -- and it was a nonspeculative case. We said it's going to cost $300,000 to $500,000 or even a million dollars to get a market power expert. They didn't come back and say, no, in arbitration, I think you can do it for 50,000.",
  "I think what you do is you, with all due respect, fault Petitioners for that. Because we put in that report -- they could have criticized it exactly the way you are and we'd have a different case. But they argued before the district court and the court of appeals just what they argued to you, Justice Kennedy, it doesn't matter if you can do it. It doesn't matter if it's too expensive. We don't think this doctrine exists, or we don't think it extends to this kind of cases, and having put their -- their money on that extreme position that the effective vindication doctrine doesn't exist, I think it's --",
  "Well, our -- our view on that is -- you know, the Court is balancing two things here. It's trying to apply the effective vindication doctrine, but it's also trying to honor the principle of this Court that you treat the parties to the bargain that they have committed. Now, if they would have come in and said in the district court -- which they didn't -- that we'll get rid of the confidentiality -- they said you could share costs, but they -- you know, the confidentiality was the problem. It was the problem the Second Circuit saw. You can look at 92a of the Petition appendix. And they didn't petition on that issue, so I don't know how they get to say, well, the Second Circuit was wrong about that, but isn't that a shame. I mean, if they thought that was wrong, they should have petitioned. And that just shows you, these issues were in front of the Court. Now --",
  "Sure. I don't think this Court would have necessarily granted it because it's not very cert-worthy. But it's also -- I don't know how they can keep that issue in their back pocket and then say well, we got cert -- we got cert on the cert-worthy issue and now we have this factual finding where the Second Circuit held that the confidentiality agreement precludes the sharing of this information from arbitration to arbitration.",
  "It doesn't, Justice Scalia.",
  "It doesn't. It's a simple comparison of the necessary unrecoupable costs of bringing the claim in arbitration compared to the maximum recovery.",
  "If you have -- if you have a claim, Justice Scalia, that can't be vindicated in arbitration or in court, that claim's not going --",
  "Right. But that's --",
  "No you don't.",
  "With respect, Justice Scalia, you don't have to make that comparison part of the test because the cases that can't be vindicated in either place won't show up at the courthouse door. So once you show up at the courthouse door, you've got a plaintiff's lawyer. They may be crazy, but you have a plaintiff's lawyer that thinks I can do this in the litigation system. And so at that point, the only question is, all right, I think I can do this in the litigation system. If the only thing that's precluding me from doing it is this arbitration agreement -- so this arbitration agreement is not operating as a real arbitration agreement, it's operating as a de facto as-applied exculpatory clause. If they can make that showing, then -- and the option is not arbitration or litigation --",
  "And -- and God bless it, Justice Kennedy -- when it does that, and it can effectively address claims that can't be addressed in the litigation system, that's exactly what we want arbitration to do. But there are some cases where the arbitration system -- not generally -- I mean, if you have the kind of pro-vindication agreement you had in Concepcion, or that Sovereign Bank has that we mentioned in our brief, then you can vindicate these claims in arbitration. But when you have a specific arbitration agreement that has a variety of clauses that don't allow for any mechanism to shift or share the costs, so you know it's not litigation versus arbitration, of course we'll go with arbitration. It's litigation or nothing. In those circumstances, this Court has always said that we'll have --",
  "Well -- and, Justice Kennedy, I would say that -- I mean, shame on them, with all due respect. Because there was an opportunity in the district court to make an apples to apples comparison, and they could have said, no, $300,000 is way off; you can do this for $25,000, and here's how. But they didn't make that showing. They said -- you know, we don't think the effective vindication doctrine applies in these circumstances at all.",
  "Well, I don't think it is, Mr. Chief Justice. I -- they don't have to say -- you know -- they don't have to tell us how to prove our case to the lowest possible price. They just have to show us something that will allow us to vindicate our claim --",
  "Well, what I'm going to say, Justice --",
  "But -- but what I was going to say is look, I mean, take a step back. You know, one of the great things about the effective vindication doctrine is it gets the incentives rights. It gives companies incentives to draft clauses that will allow for the maximum vindication of Federal rights. And so there are lots of clauses out there that would allow for even this claim because they have cost shifting of expert costs or they don't have confidentiality agreements or they'll waive the confidentiality -­",
  "No, Justice Scalia.",
  "No, it's not part of the inquiry because --",
  "No, it's just that if by virtue of showing up in court and saying, I want to litigate my claim, the lawyer has already made a judgment that I can vindicate it in Federal court. Maybe it's because of class action, maybe it's just because of joinder, maybe it's because there's no confidentiality rule in the Federal proceedings, so it can bring a lot of these claims, maybe it's a difference in collateral estoppel. Whatever it is, that lawyer has already spoken that I can make this claim work in litigation.",
  "That might be what they most want, but they don't get that. They just get some way to vindicate the claim. And if this had a cost-shifting provisions that the expert costs were shifted, that would get the job done, that's the Sovereign Bank example we talked about in our brief. There are more than one way. We're not trying to get a guarantee for class treatment in one form or the other.",
  "We -- in fairness, we focused below on the class action because that's --",
  "Well, don't just look at the question presented, look at the opinion below. And look at 91(A) and 92(A). The questions that the Second Circuit addressed --",
  "No, it would not --",
  "-- Your Honor. You just have to answer the question, is there a problem with the arbitration, is there something with this specific agreement that precludes this claim going forward. Here it's a combination of no class arbitration, no way to shift costs because they don't provide cost shifting, and no way to share costs because of the confidentiality. Whatever they put in the question presented, they can't make the Second Circuit's holding that the confidentiality provision blocks the sharing of information to go away. They're stuck with that.",
  "They -- they could do that much, Mr. Chief Justice. The critical point at which the confidentiality provision creates a practical problem is you're trying to get all the information, you're trying to get a single expert report in order to share the costs, and you're trying to do not just the market survey, but do a damage calculation, have a damage formula. Because when you have a market like this where the allegations are they've distorted the market, so we can't rely on the market price, we need to know the sales volumes of all the individual stores. Their confidentiality agreement protects that and doesn't allow that to be shared. That's not that unusual. This Court in Nielsen and Concepcion both remarked that one of the features of arbitration is you generally keep it confidential. And that's something that the Second Circuit said because of that --",
  "With all due respect, Mr. --",
  "Well, I mean, I don't think it's that difficult, Mr. Chief Justice. Certainly, cost shifting is not difficult, and there are other ways to solve this problem. But the Amex agreement forecloses all of them. And the question for this Court is, do you say, well, tough or do you say what you've said every time you've confronted this problem, the effective vindication doctrine provides the solution. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court not only addressed the issue of the House's standing in Chadha, it held that the House is the proper party to defend the constitutionality of an Act of Congress when the executive agency charged with its enforcement agrees with plaintiff that the statute is unconstitutional.",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor --",
  "Sure, generally, unless and until they stop defending it, at which point we submit --",
  "Because the House is very -- in a very different position in a case like this and in Chadha from just the general taxpayer. Now, in a case like Chadha, for example, you're right, it was the one-house veto, if you will, that was at issue. But it would be a strange jurisprudence that says that the House has standing to come in and defend an unconstitutional one-house veto, but it doesn't have standing to come in and defend its core Article I prerogative, which is to pass statutes and have those statutes --",
  "Well, with all due respect, Justice Kennedy, I think the House --",
  "Sure. And it -- there is a presumption that its acts are constitutional. That presumption had real life here because when Congress was considering this statute it asked the Justice Department three times whether DOMA was constitutional, and three times the Justice Department told them that it was in fact constitutional. So I think it's a fair assumption that they at least have standing to have that determination made by the courts, and this Court has held that in the context of State legislatures and the courts have --",
  "Well, I would say two things.",
  "I don't think -- I don't think it's irrelevant. I would say two things. One is, I don't think there was anything particularized about the fact that it was the House that exercised the one-house veto because the Court allowed the Senate to participate as well. And the Senate's interest in that was really just the constitutionality of the legislation and perhaps the one-house veto going forward. But what I would say is I just -- I would continue to resist the premise, which is that the House's prerogatives aren't at stake here. The House's single most important prerogative, which is to pass legislation and to have that legislation, if it's going to be repealed, only be repealed through a process where the House gets to fully participate.",
  "No, I would say we would not, Mr. Chief Justice. I would say in that circumstance the House would have the prerogative to file an amicus brief if it wanted to. But that's because of a sound prudential reason, which is when the Executive is actually discharging its responsibility, its traditional obligation to defend an Act of Congress, if Congress comes in as a party it has the possibility of second-guessing the way that they are actually defending it. But if the Executive is going to vacate the premises or, in a case like this, not just vacate the premises, but stay in court and attack the statute, you don't have that prudential concern. And that's why what I --",
  "Well, I think -- if in a particular case, which is obviously not this case, the Executive decides, we are not going to defend the statute as applied I think in that situation the House could come in. I think as a matter of practice it probably wouldn't. And it's not like the House and the Senate are very anxious to exercise this prerogative. In the 30 years since the Chadha decision, there's only been 12 instances in which the -- in which the House has come in and intervened as a party. And I think it's very important to recognize that whatever --",
  "That includes all courts, but excluding the DOMA cases. So from the point of Chadha until the DOMA cases, there were a total of 12 cases where the House intervened as a party. And I do think that particularly in the lower court cases, it's very important to understand that party status is critical. I mean, in this case it doesn't make a huge differences if you are an amicus with argument time versus a party. But in the district court that makes all the difference. Only a party can take a deposition.",
  "Well, I would -- a couple of things, Justice Breyer. I mean, I would point you to Chadha and I realize you can distinguish Chadha.",
  "Well, if I --",
  "Well, it's understandable. I mean, obviously nobody's suggesting, at least in the Legislative Branch, that this is a best practices situation.",
  "I can point to you a couple of cases that will help, but may not be a complete solution for some of the reasons you built into your question. The cases I would point to help are Coleman v. Miller, Karcher v. May, and Arizonans for Official English. And all of those -- I don't think Coleman involved any specific legislative authorization, but you can distinguish it, I suppose. But in trying to distinguish it, keep in mind that this Court gave those 20 Senators not just standing to make the argument about the role of the lieutenant governor, but also gave them standing to make the separate argument, which is the only one this Court reached because it was divided four to four on the lieutenant governor's role, the only issue that the Court reached was the issue whether prior ratification disabled them from subsequent legislation action, which is just a way of saying what they did was unconstitutional. So I think Coleman is quite close. Karcher, Arizonans against English, there was an authorization. We would say H. Res. 5 is enough of authorization for these purposes.",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor, I can point you to two places. One is the House rules that are pursuant to the rulemaking authority and approved by the institution. They're approved in every Congress. Rule 2.8.",
  "I'm not sure there is another one, but that's the sole purpose of Rule 2.8. It creates the Office of the General Counsel --",
  "I don't think so, Justice Sotomayor. That's the same authority that gave the House, essentially a predecessor to it -- - it would be the same authority that has had the House appear in litigation ever since Chadha. In Chadha, there was a vote that authorized it specifically, but we have that here in H. Res. 5, which is the second place I would point you.",
  "We do. We do have a vote in H. Res. 5. At the beginning of this Congress in January, the House passed a resolution that passed, that authorized the BLAG to continue to represent the interests of the House in this particular litigation. So I think if there was a question before H. Res. 5, there shouldn't be now. I would like to --",
  "No, Justice Kennedy, they wouldn't have the standing to be on the other side of this case. They would have standing to be on the same side of this case, and I think that's essentially what you had happen in the Chadha case.",
  "It -- because it wouldn't have the authority to do so under Chadha. What -- Chadha makes the critical flipping of the switch that gives the House the ability to intervene as a party is that the Executive Branch declines to defend the statute. So if the Senate wants to come in and basically take -- share argument time or something as an amicus, they can, but there's no need for them to participate as -- as a party. And I would want to emphasize that in the lower courts, participation by a party is absolutely critical. It doesn't make sense to have the party that wants to see the statute invalidated be in charge of the litigation in the district courts. Because whether the statute is going to be invalidated is going to depend on what kind of record there is in the district court. It'd be one thing, Justice Scalia, if all that happened is they entered consent judgment. I suppose then the thing would end, and then in the long run, the Executive would be forced to do their job and actually defend these statutes --",
  "-- but if that's not going to happen --",
  "Justice Alito, I think it makes perfect sense in this context because every -- each individual house has a constitutional rule before a statute is repealed. And so yes, it takes two of them to make the law. But each of their's participation is necessary to repeal a law. So if the Executive wants to go into court and effectively seek the judicial repeal of a law, it makes sense that one house can essentially vindicate its role in our constitutional scheme by saying, wait a minute, we passed that law, it can't be repealed without our participation.",
  "I don't think that's right after Raines, Justice Alito. In Raines, this Court carefully distinguished between the situation of an individual legislator and the situation of one of the houses as a whole. And it specifically said this might be a different case if we had that kind of vote. And that's what you have here. That's what you had in Chadha. And again, I do think that -- I mean, the only alternatives here are really to say that the Executive absolutely must enforce these laws, and if they don't, I mean because after all -- you know, I -- I really don't understand why it's -- if they're not going to -- if they've made a determination that the law is unconstitutional, why it makes any sense for them to continue to enforce the law and put executive officers in the position of doing something that the President has determined is unconstitutional. I mean, think about the qualified immunity implications of that for a minute. So that's problematic enough. But if they're going to be able to do that and get anything more than a consent judgment, then the House is going to have to be able to play its role. And it's going to have to play the role of a party. An amicus just doesn't get it done. And I really think, in a sense, the Executive gives the game away by conceding that our participation as an amicus here is necessary to solve what would otherwise be a glaring adverseness problem. Because once you recognize that we can participate as an amicus, you've essentially recognized that there's nothing inherently executive about coming in and defending the constitutionality of an act of Congress. Or more to the point, there's nothing inherently unlegislative about coming in and making arguments in defense of the statute. And if that's critical, absolutely necessary to ensure there's an adverse presentation of the issues, well, there's no reason the House should have to do that with one hand tied behind its back. If its participation is necessary, it should participate as a full party. And as I say, that's critically important in the lower courts so they can take depositions, build a factual record, and allow for a meaningful defense of the statute. Because the alternative really puts the Executive Branch in an impossible position. It's a conflict of interest. They're the ones that are making litigation decisions to promote the defense of a statute they want to see invalidated. And if you want to see the problems with their position, look at Joint Appendix page 437. You will see the most anomalous motion to dismiss in the history of litigation. A motion to dismiss, filed by the United States, asking the district court not to dismiss the case. I mean, that's what you get under their view of the world, and that doesn't serve as separation of powers.",
  "It -- it does. It does. And then -- you know -- and the last thing I'll say is, we saw in this case certain appeals were expedited, certain appeals weren't. They did not serve the interest of defending the statute, they served the distinct interest of the Executive. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue of same-sex marriage certainly implicates profound and deeply held views on both sides of the issue. But the legal question on the merits before this Court is actually quite narrow. On the assumption that States have the constitutional option either to define marriage in traditional terms or to recognize same-sex marriages or to adopt a compromise like civil unions, does the Federal government have the same flexibility or must the Federal government simply borrow the terms in State law? I would submit the basic principles of federalism suggest that as long as the Federal government defines those terms solely for purposes of Federal law, that the Federal government has the choice to adopt a constitutionally permissible definition or to borrow the terms of the statute.",
  "And I think the answer to that, Justice Ginsburg, would be to say that that is a marriage under State law, and I think this Court's cases when it talks about the fundamental right to marriage, I take it to be talking about the State law status of marriage, and the question of what does that mean for purposes of Federal law has always been understood to be a different matter. And that's been true certainly in a number of situations under a number of statutes, so it's simply not the case that as long as you are married under State law you absolutely are going to be treated as married --",
  "Well, we've never had that, Your Honor, and I think that there is a difference when it comes to divorce because with divorce uniquely, you could have the -- possibility that somebody's married to two different people for purposes of State law and Federal law. But with the basic question of even whether to recognize the marriage -- or probably the best way to put it is just whether the Federal law treats you as married for a particular purpose or not, there always have been differences between the Federal law treatment and the State law treatment. The Federal treatment, for example, recognizes common law marriages in all States whereas a lot of States don't recognize common law marriages, but Federal law recognizes that for some purposes -- the Social Security Act, I think it's at page 4 of our brief. And --",
  "No, I don't think that is true for purposes of that provision.",
  "That's my understanding, that's -- as discussed --",
  "My understanding is that there is a Federal -- that the Federal law recognizes in -- in the Social Security context even if it doesn't. And in all events, there are other situations -- immigration context, tax consequences. For tax consequences, if you get a divorce every December -- you know, for tax consequences, the State may well recognize that divorce. The Federal government has long said, look, we are not going to allow you get a divorce every December just to get remarried in January so you have a filing tax status that works for you that is more favorable to you. So the Federal government has always treated this somewhat distinctly. It always has its own efforts, and I do think for purposes of the federalism issue, it really matters that all DOMA does is take this term where it appears in Federal law and define it for purposes of Federal law. It would obviously be a radically different case if Congress had, in 1996, decided to try to stop States from defining marriage in a particular way or dictate how they would decide it in that way.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, two points. First of all, the very fact that there are 1,100 provisions of Federal law that define the terms \"marriage\" and \"spouse\" goes a long way to showing that Federal law has not just stayed completely out of these issues. It's gotten involved in them in a variety of contexts where there is an independent Federal power that supported that. Now, the second thing is the fact that DOMA affects all 1,100 statutes at once is not really a sign of its irrationality. It is a sign that what it is, and all it has ever purported to be, is a definitional provision. And like every other provision in the Dictionary Act, what it does is it defines the term wherever it appears in Federal law in a consistent way. And that was part and parcel of what Congress was trying to accomplish with DOMA in 1996.",
  "Well, that's true but I don't think that's a mark against it for federalism purposes. And it -- it addressed a particular issue at a point, remember in 1996, Congress is addressing this issue because they are thinking that the State of Hawaii, through its judicial action, is about to change the definition of marriage from a way that it had been defined in every jurisdiction in the United States. And what that meant is that when Congress passed every one of the statutes affected by DOMA's definition, the Congress that was passing that statute had in mind the traditional definition. And so Congress, in 1996, at that point says, the States are about to experiment with changing this, but the one thing we know is all these Federal statutes were passed with the traditional definition in mind. And if rational basis is the test, it has to be rational for Congress then to say, well, we are going to reaffirm what this word has always meant for purposes of Federal law.",
  "Well, I think for these purposes actually, Justice Alito, if you go back to the beginning of the estate tax deduction, what Congress was trying to do was trying to provide uniform treatment of taxpayers across jurisdictions, and if you look at the brief that Senator Hatch and some other Senators filed, they discussed this history because what was happening, in 1948 when this provision was initially put into Federal law, was you had community property States and common law States, and actually there was much more favorable tax treatment if you were in a community law State than a common law State. And Congress didn't want to have an artificial incentive for States to move from common law to community property. It wanted to treat citizens the same way no matter what State they were in. So it said, we will give a uniform Federal deduction based on marriage, and I think what that shows is that when the Federal government gets involved in the issue of marriage, it has a particularly acute interest in uniform treatment of people across State lines. So Ms. Windsor wants to point to the unfairness of the differential treatment of treating two New York married couples differently, and of course for purposes of New York law that's exactly the right focus, but for purposes of Federal law it's much more rational for Congress to -- to say, and certainly a rational available choice, for Congress to say, we want to treat the same-sex couple in New York the same way as the committed same-sex couple in Oklahoma and treat them the same. Or even more to the point for purposes --",
  "Well --",
  "But -- but the only way --",
  "But the -- the only way they are different is because of the way the State law treats them. And just to be clear how -- you know, what this case is about, and how sort of anomalous the -- the treatment, the differential treatment in two States is, is this is not a case that is based on a marriage license issued directly by the State of New York after 2011 when New York recognized same-sex marriage. This is -- the status of Ms. Windsor as married depends on New York's recognition of an Ontario marriage certificate issued in 2007.",
  "Well, I guess I would -- I would say two things. I would say that the first question would be what's the relevant level of scrutiny and I assume the level of scrutiny for the things --",
  "Again, I think the right way to analyze it would be -- you know, is -- is there any distinction drawn that implicates what level of scrutiny is implicated. If the level of scrutiny is rational basis, then my answer to you would be, yes, they can do that. I mean, we'd have to talk about what the rational basis would be --",
  "Well, I -- I think the uniform treatment of individuals across State lines --",
  "No, I see exactly where you're going, Justice Breyer.",
  "And -- and obviously, every one of those cases would have to be decided on its own. But I do think there is a powerful interest when the Federal government classifies people --",
  "-- there's a powerful interest in treating --",
  "Well, again, if we're -- if we're coming at this from the premise that the States have the option to choose, and then we come at this from the perspective that Congress is passing this not in a vacuum, they're passing this in 1996. And what they're confronting in 1996 is the prospect that one State, through its judiciary, will adopt same-sex marriage, and then by operation of the full faith and credit law, that will apply to any -- any couple that wants to go there. And the State that's thinking about doing this is, Hawaii, it's a very nice place to go and get married. And so Congress is worried that people are going to go there, go back to their home jurisdictions, insist on the recognition in their home jurisdictions of their same-sex marriage in Hawaii, and then the Federal government will borrow that definition, and therefore, by the operation of one State's State judiciary, same-sex marriage is basically going to be recognized throughout the country. And what Congress says is, wait a minute. Let's take a timeout here. This is a redefinition of an age-old institution. Let's take a more cautious approach where every sovereign gets to do this for themselves. And so Section 2 of DOMA says we're going to make sure that on full faith and credit principles that a decision of one State --",
  "Well, at least two -- two responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First is that one interest that supports the Federal government's definition of this term is whatever Federal interest justifies the underlying statute in which it appears. So in every one of these statutes that affected, by assumption, there's some Article I Section 8 authority --",
  "Just to clarify, Justice Sotomayor, I'm not suggesting that the Federal government has any special authority to recognize traditional marriage. So if -- the assumption is that nobody can do it. If the States can't do it either, then the Federal government can't do it. So the Federal government --",
  "Okay. So then the question is --",
  "So then, if the States can --",
  "-- the Federal government has sort of two sets of authorities that give it sort of a legitimate interest to wade into this debate. Now, one is whatever authority gives rise to the underlying statute. The second and complementary authority is that -- you know, the Federal government recognizes that it's a big player in the world, that it has a lot of programs that might give States incentives to change the rules one way or another. And the best way -- one way to stay out of the debate and let just the -- the States develop this and let the democratic process deal with this is to just say, look, we're going to stick with what we've always had, which is traditional definition. We're not going to create a regime that gives people an incentive and point to Federal law and say, well, another reason you should have same-sex marriage is because then you'll get a State tax deduction. They just stayed out of it. They've said, look, we're --",
  "No, no. They treat them -- which is to say they -- they are preserving, they are helping the States in the sense of having each sovereign make this decision for themselves.",
  "With respect, Justice Kennedy, that's not right. No State loses any benefits by recognizing same-sex marriage. Things stay the same. What they don't do is they don't sort of open up an additional class of beneficiaries under their State law for -- that get additional Federal benefits. But things stay the same. And that's why in this sense --",
  "With respect, Justice Ginsburg, that's not what the Federal government is saying. The Federal government is saying that within its own realm in Federal policies, where we assume that the Federal government has the authority to define the terms that appear in their own statutes, that in those areas, they are going to have their own definition. And that's -­",
  "A couple of responses, Justice Kagan. First of all, I think I would take issue with the premise, first of all, that this is such an unusual Federal involvement on an issue like marriage. If you look at historically, not only has the Federal government defined marriage for its own purposes distinctly in the context of particular -- particular programs, it's also intervened in -- in other areas, including in-State prerogatives. I mean, there's a reason that 4 State constitutions include a prohibition on polygamy. It's because the Federal Congress insisted on them. There is a reason that, in the wake of the Civil War and in Reconstruction, Congress specifically wanted to provide benefits for spouses of freed slaves who fought for the Union. In order to do it, it essentially had to create State law marriages because in the Confederacy, the slaves couldn't get married. So they developed their own State -- essentially, a Federal, sort of, condition to define who was married under those laws. So where there have been needs in the past to get involved, the Federal government has gotten involved. The other point I would make -- but I also eventually want to get around to the animus point -- but the other point I would make is, when you look at Congress doing something that is unusual, that deviates from the way they -- they proceeded in the past, you have to ask, well, was there a good reason? And in a sense, you have to understand that, in 1996, something's happening that is, in a sense, forcing Congress to choose between its historic practice of deferring to the States and its historic practice of preferring uniformity. Up until 1996, it essentially has it both ways, every State has the traditional definition. Congress knows that's the definition that's embedded in every Federal law. So that's fine. We can defer. Okay. 1996 --",
  "Does the House Report say that? Of course, the House Report says that. And if that's enough to invalidate the statute, then you should invalidate the statute. But that has never been your approach, especially under rational basis or even rational basis-plus, if that is what you are suggesting. This Court, even when it's applied more heightened scrutiny, the O'Brien case we cite, it suggests, look, we are not going to strike down a statute just because a couple of legislators may have had an improper motive. We're going to look, and under rational basis, we look, is there any rational basis for the statute? And so sure, the House Report says some things that we are not -- we've never invoked in trying to defend the statute. But the House Report says other things, like Congress was trying to promote democratic self-governance. And in a situation where an unelected State judiciary in Hawaii is on the verge of deciding this highly contentious, highly divisive issue for everybody, for the States -- for the other States and for the Federal government by borrowing principles, it makes sense for Congress --",
  "That's true. I -- but again, I don't know that that fact alone makes it irrational. And I suppose if that's what you think --",
  "I think -- I think there is so clearly is a Federal power because DOMA doesn't define any term that appears anywhere other than in a Federal statute that we assume that there is Federal power for. And if there is not Federal power for the statutes in which these terms appear, that is a problem independent of DOMA, but it is not a DOMA problem. So I will assume we have Federal power. Then the question is --",
  "And -- and it doesn't have the authority to regulate marriages, as such, but that's not what DOMA does. DOMA provides certain -- DOMA defines a term as it appears in Federal statutes, many of those Federal statutes provide benefits. Some of those Federal statutes provide burdens. Some of those Federal statutes provide disclosure obligations. It appears in lots of places, and if any one of --",
  "That would make no difference, Justice Alito. It does -- the hypothetical helpfully demonstrates, though, that when the Federal government is defining this term as it appears in the Federal Code, it is not regulating marriage as such. And it is important to recognize that people that are married in their State, based on either the legislative acts or by judicial recognition, remain married for purposes of State law.",
  "Well, I -- I think that's true, Justice Scalia. The point about the courts, though, is -- I mean, it's particularly relevant here.",
  "Well, let me -- let me just get on record that -- to take issue with one of the premises of this, which is we are at somehow rational basis-plus land because I would suggest strongly that three levels of scrutiny are enough. But in all events, if you are thinking about the justifications that defend this statute, that justify the statute, they are obviously in the brief. But it's uniformity -- but it's not -- it's not just that Congress picked this -- you know, we need a uniform term, let's pick this out of the air. They picked the traditional definition that they knew reflected the underlying judgments of every Federal statute on the books at that point. They knew it was the definition that had been tried in every jurisdiction in the United States and hadn't been tried anywhere until 2004. And then, of course, it was, as they correctly predicted, a judicial decision. And in this context, in particular, they are thinking about an individual -- I mean, this couple goes to Ontario, they get the -- they get a marriage certificate. A couple could -- from Oklahoma, could have gotten -- gone to Ontario and gotten a marriage certificate that same day and gone back to Oklahoma. And from the Federal law perspective, there is certainly a rational basis in treating those two couples the same way. If I may reserve my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, just three points in rebuttal. First of all, I was not surprised to hear the Solicitor General concede that there is no unique federalism problem with DOMA because in the Gill litigation in the First Circuit, the State of Massachusetts -- the Commonwealth of Massachusetts invoked the Tenth Amendment, and on that issue the United States continued to defend DOMA because there is no unique federalism problem with it, as the Chief Justice's question suggested. If 10 years from now there are only 9 States left and Congress wants to adopt a uniform Federal law solely for Federal law purposes to going the other way, it is fully entitled to do that. It has the power to do that. I would say also the Federal government has conceded in this litigation that there is a rational basis for this statute, something else to keep in mind. I would also say that this provision is not so unique. The very next provision in the Dictionary Act --",
  "Well --",
  "And, Justice Ginsburg, applying rational basis to DOMA, I think that there are many rational bases that support it. And the Solicitor General says, well -- you know, the United States is not the 51st State to be sure, but the Federal government has interests in uniformity that no other entity has. And we heard today that there's a problem when somebody moves from New York to North Carolina, they can lose their benefits. The Federal government uniquely, unlike the 50 States, can say, well, that doesn't make any sense, we are going to have the same rule. We don't want somebody, if they are going to be transferred in the military from West Point to Fort Sill in Oklahoma, to resist the transfer because they are going to lose some benefits. It makes sense to have a uniform Federal rule for the Federal government. It is not so anomalous that the term \"marriage\" is defined in the U.S. Code. The very next provision of the Dictionary Act defines \"child.\" These terms, although they are the primary province of State governments, do appear in multiple Federal statutes and it's a Federal role to define those terms. The last point I would simply make is in thinking about animus, think about the fact that Congress asked the Justice Department three times about the constitutionality of the statute. That's not what you do when you are motivated by animus. The first two times they got back the answer it was constitutional. The third time, they asked again in the wake of Romer, and they got the same answer, it's constitutional. Now the Solicitor General wants to say, well, it was want of careful reflection. Well, where do we get careful reflection in our system? Generally, careful reflection comes in the democratic process. The democratic process requires people to persuade people. The reason there has been a sea change is a combination of political power, as defined by this Court's cases as getting the attention of lawmakers, certainly they have that. But it's also persuasion. That's what the democratic process requires. You have to persuade somebody you're right. You don't label them a bigot. You don't label them as motivated by animus. You persuade them you are right. That's going on across the country. Colorado, the State that brought you Amendment 2, has just recognized civil unions. Maine, that was pointed to in the record in this case as being evidence of the persistence of discrimination because they voted down a statewide referendum, the next election cycle it came out the other way. And the Federal Congress is not immune. They repealed \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\" Allow the democratic process to continue. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: But for the application of ICWA, two things would be crystal clear: The birth father would have absolutely no parental or custodial rights under State law or the Constitution; and second, the baby girl would be entitled to a custodial determination that focused on her best interests. Now, the lower courts --",
  "Justice Sotomayor, would that it were true that the Federal preference was one factor in a multifactor test that looked at this child in her best interest. That did not happen here. And if you have any doubt about that, look at page 40a of the petition appendix. And what the lower court --",
  "What you do with that, Justice Sotomayor, is you look what context those findings were made. Those findings were made in the context of 1912(f), and the court specifically said that for those purposes all I can look at is the birth father and whether this new custodial relationship, beyond a reasonable doubt, would pose a serious harm to the girl. And what he --",
  "What the court specifically said is they looked at the expert testimony of how it would cause trauma, despair, anxiety, depression on this baby girl to be taken from her parents, and the court specifically said all of that was legally irrelevant because 1912(f) only lets you look at the harm from the new custodial relationship. It doesn't let you look at any harm from the breakup of the previous custodial relationship. And all of that would make sense if you were talking about 912(f)'s application to the situations it's designed for.",
  "It's miles away. And it's the appropriate standard when you're taking somebody who has existing legal custody and depriving them of it. But everywhere in the law, including ICWA, when you make an initial placement of a child in a new custodial setting, you don't do that unless you look at the child's best interest. And look at 1916(a) of ICWA, which is the only provision in the Act that specifically contemplates a child being placed in a new custodial setting. It talks about what happens if you have an adoption and then the adoptive parents for some reason terminate their rights and then you send the child back to their original Indian custodian. And in that situation, recognizing that when there's been a break of custody, you don't just send somebody off to a -- a new setting based on beyond a reasonable doubt; you look at the best interests of the child. And that's --",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor, I'm here representing the guardian who represents the best interest of the child. From the child's perspective, the child really doesn't care whose fault it was when they were brought in one custodial situation or another. They just want a determination that focuses on at the relevant time, that time, what's in their best interest. And so in the same way that we think if you rule in our favor and you remand to the lower court that there has to be a best interest determination that takes into account the current situation, notwithstanding that that would be on the hypothesis that the last 15 months of custody were based on a legal misunderstanding, we still think this girl --",
  "You freeze it at the time that somebody's talking about --",
  "You freeze it at the time that somebody's talking about changing a custodial situation. But what is so tragic here is that the lower court applied 1912(d) and (f), which are clearly designed for a situation when you're contemplating transferring custody away from an existing custodial relationship. They looked at that and applied those inapposite standards to create a transfer to somebody with new custody. Now, the Solicitor --",
  "Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg. We're not here to try to say that anybody is entitled to automatic custody of this child based on some legal rule.",
  "Absolutely. And I would hope with instructions to please make that determination as quickly as humanly possible.",
  "Well, a couple of things, Justice Kennedy. If you got to the point of applying 1915(a) and the placement preferences -- and we agree with Petitioners that they're not squarely applicable here because the birth father's argument was not that I get to adopt, but that I have an entitlement -- if you got to that, I think the good cause standard gives you a vehicle for importing a lot of best interest standards. I also think you could look --",
  "That's right, but even the Justice Department doesn't say that the guidelines are binding or entitled to anything more than Skidmore deference, and I'd take constitutional avoidance over Skidmore deference any day. But the second thing I would put on the table is I think the fact that 1916(a) tells you that the one time you are thinking about transferring custody, Congress looked to the best interest standard. That's a clear hint that if you are talking about transferring custody you should look to the best interests. And, again, I think it's imperative to look at 1912(d), (e), and (f). As the government and the Solicitor General recognizes, they all contemplate continued custody, (e) and (f) do. Now, then the government turns around and says, well, but (d) was a basis for what the lower court did, which is to transfer custody. With all due respect to the government, (d) makes even less sense as a basis for transferring custody than (f). At least (f) has some standard designed for some transfer of custody. It happens to be the wrong transfer. It's the transfer away from continuing custody out and it's beyond a reasonable doubt. But (d) has no standard to satisfy. And their position is that because this birth father was not presented with remedial and rehabilitative services, therefore, because he didn't get remedial services that presumably he needed, he gets the child. That's crazy. And what it shows is that 12(d) assumes that it's like an exhaustion requirement, and unless and until these services are provided you preserve the status quo ante. But the lower court didn't preserve the status quo ante. The lower court ordered this poor girl sent to somebody who, at least under state law and just a matter of practicality, is a stranger to her. And nowhere in the law do you see any child being transferred to a new custodial arrangement without a best interest determination. And why did it happen here? It happened here because of ICWA, which by its terms does not apply to these situations, and it happened because of 3/256ths of Cherokee blood. Now, the Justice Department back in 1978 recognized there were profound constitutional problems with the statute. Then-Assistant Assistant Attorney General, later Judge, Patricia Wald, told Congress that there were applications of the statute that raised equal protection problems because they treated people differently solely on the basis of race. One of the things she pointed to is what she point -- described as \"the (b) portion of the definition of 'Indian child.'\" And that's what makes this child an Indian child here, its biology, its biology combined with the fact that the tribe, based on a racial classification, thinks that somebody with 325 -- 1 percent Indian blood is enough to make them a tribal -- a tribal member, eligible for tribal membership. And as a result of that, her whole world changes and this whole inquiry changes. It goes from an inquiry focused on her best interests and it changes to a focus on the birth father and whether or not beyond a reasonable doubt there is a clear and present danger. Again, that is --",
  "You correct the lower court. And there's two paths to correct the lower court. One way to correct the lower court is to say, look -- can I finish the answer?",
  "You could -- you would either do it by changing the definition of \"parent\" and recognize that, given the consequences that flow from a parent in the statute, it only makes sense to prove something more than bare paternity. Or you could do it by recognizing that if somebody gets in the front door of this statute based on bare paternity, you have to interpret provisions like (d), (e), and (f) with sensitivity to the fact that under that reading just because you are a parent doesn't mean you have these kind of extraordinary rights.",
  "The exact language -- it appears -- it is reprinted on page 8 of the blue brief in the indented text, and it says, \"Within this -- within this subbasin, the signatory States have equal rights to the use of,\" and then it defines the water that they have the rights to the use of, \"at times of normal flow\" -- with the flow of the Red River at 3,000 cubic feet per second at the Arkansas/Louisiana border -- \"provided that no State is entitled to more than 25 percent of the water in excess of this amount.\" So the -- the gist of the language is States have -- all -- all four signatory States have equal rights to the use of --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The crime of extortion under the Hobbs Act, like the related crimes of larceny, burglary and embezzlement, is at bottom a property crime. Accordingly, understanding the scope of obtainable property under the Hobbs Act is critical to deciding the scope of the basic criminal prohibition. The Government has offered you a definition of property that only a prosecutor could love. Any intangible right with economic value, but that definition is fundamentally incompatible with this Court's precedence and with Congress's conscious decision in the Hobbs Act to criminalize the State -- New York State crime of extortion, but not the New York crime of coercion.",
  "Well, I don't think it's irrelevant, Justice Kennedy. I would have a different argument. I think that I would stand first and foremost on this Court's decision in Cleveland, where it recognized that something like, I think the commitment, certainly the video poker license was at issue there, the Court also referenced an unissued patent. And it recognized that there are things that have value once they're issued, but in the hands of the Government, they don't have value, and therefore don't qualify as property.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, it might have been possible to say that what was obtained here was money, but I think if the Government had prosecuted it under that theory, it would have to prove that somehow the Government paid too much. I don't think it can point just to the commissions. And I would analogize it to the McNally case. In the McNally case, you know, there was this scheme in which various sort of friends of government officials were getting the commissions from a workmen's compensation policy. And what this Court said is, well, it would have been one thing if the Government had come in and said that the Government paid commissions that were too high, or the Government had received inferior quality insurance. But what the Government did there instead was sort of take the shortcut and plead that what had happened is, the Government had been deprived of its interest in having the honest services --",
  "Well, I think the reason that they didn't charge that is probably practically twofold. One is that a commitment under New York law and practice is not quite as what it sounds, it's not really a commitment. And the best evidence of that is with the last fund for this particular management company, they got a commitment from the State and there was no ultimate investment made. So there's a subsequent step down the road.",
  "So I think that's part of it. The other thing I would say is as in McNally, I think they would have had to prove that the management fees were somehow excessive or something like that, so they -- they didn't do that. They focused on this recommendation.",
  "I would say that that -- I would say a couple of things. I would say that's a harder case than the one I have before you today. I would say that I don't think that's actually extortion if what they charge is the commitment, not the money that goes -- that flows from the Government. And then what I would say -- and the reason I would say that is because of Cleveland.",
  "Right. And I would say that under McNally, in that kind of case, what the Government has to prove is that if they want to make the property the money interest that the Government is paying out and the person is obtaining, they have to show that there's some sort of excessive commission or excessive sort of management fee.",
  "Again, that would be my position. And I think it would follow from this Court's decisions in cases like Cleveland and McNally because in McNally, of course, the people who were part of that fraudulent scheme, they were getting commissions from the workmen comp program. And the Government's theory was that just interfering with the Government's decision about who to give the workmen -- where to place the workmen's comp policies was enough of an interference to -- to support a fraud conviction. And this Court said no. And one of the things it then said is well, it would be different if -- if the Government went in and proved that the commissions that were paid were too high, or that the Government somehow got inadequate insurance. But if all they're doing is saying that what's going on here is sort of the interest of the Government in having its employees serve them honestly and in their best interest, and not in some third party's best interest, that brings you squarely into honest services. And nobody's saying that doing that's a good thing, but it's -- it's the traditional office of the State law crime of coercion. It's --",
  "I don't believe that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. This was charged by New York State authorities as coercion. So the very crime that Congress didn't incorporate into the Hobbs Act, the New York crime of coercion, was charged here, and it's my understanding that the New York crime of coercion, like the earlier version of coercion in the racketeer -- in the Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934, like the traditional model penal code definition of coercion -- it's the -- the threat part of it is the same as extortion. So it covers a threat to a person or to property. And it's been interpreted certainly to include threats to disclose information like this. So I think the real difference between the crime of extortion and the crime of coercion, both as a general matter and under New York law, is whether or not property is obtained. And that's ultimately what's so problematic about the Government's definition here because their definition is essentially the property includes the autonomy interest of a business to operate free from coercion.",
  "I would say that for property to come within the terms of the Hobbs Act prohibition on obtaining property, it has to be alienable, transferable, moveable. That's the critical thing. So the distinction is not between alienable and inalienable. A patent is an inalienable -- I mean, rather, a patent is an intangible property right, but it's transferable, it's obtainable, it is sellable, and so it has the characteristics of things that I think come within the traditional definition.",
  "I think --",
  "Right. I -- I would say that that hypothetical that you've given me would be coercion, it would not be extortion under the Hobbs Act.",
  "I think, at least as I understand your hypothetical, where the relationship between the two parties, basically they are competitors, I would say that that's two distinct relationships.",
  "Well, I think the answer to it is, it depends. I don't think I can give you a definitive that the --",
  "Well, what -- what I would tell you is I think the assumption of most of the cases is that the person that is the pressure of --",
  "Is the person who's offering up the property. This Court's --",
  "I think that's basically right, Justice Scalia. What I would say, though, is I think there's an exception to the -- at least to the following extent, which I think it would be open to the Government, to basically say that within an entity, if you sort of put the pressure on one agent of the corporation and you actually get the money from another agent of the same corporation, that that's probably close enough. And so in this case, if the pressure was put on a particular individual and they obtained like actual cash from the Government, that might be a different case. But, of course, here what they received was this commitment, which I think is analogous to the video poker license in the Cleveland case, so I don't think that's --",
  "I -- I don't disagree with that, Justice Kagan, but I think that's because they're all sort of agents to the same principal. And I'm not sure you get all the way to what Justice Breyer was suggesting, which you can sort of run it through competitors or something like that.",
  "No. I --",
  "Exactly, Your Honor. But what I would also say is, you know, this is a real case and there are real jury findings, and as Justice Kennedy alluded to, there were a variety of theories of property put in front of the jury. They were invited to circle as many of them as they could, as many as they found satisfied, and the only one they circled was the recommendation.",
  "Well --",
  "Justice Sotomayor, I'm happy to have you rule in favor of my client on \"obtained\" or \"property\" and, as Scheidler II demonstrates, those terms are really kind of married together. And I guess the reason I sort of think that the \"obtained\" and the \"property\" should be construed together is twofold. One, structurally that's what the statute does. So when you're talking about, in a statute, property that can be obtained, I think that's a clue that you're not talking about property in its broadest manifestation. And you contrast that with, say, the Clayton Act that talks about disjunctively property and -- or property rights, and there you have a clue that Congress means a very broad conception. When it's talking about it in conjunction with \"obtained,\" I think it has a narrower ambit in mind.",
  "Right.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, what I would say is obtaining, as this Court made clear in Scheidler II, is not some metaphysical obtaining. I mean, the argument was made to this Court that the abortion protesters obtained the autonomy interest of the business in -- the clinics, in deciding whether -- who to serve and when to serve and when to be open and when to be closed. And this Court said no, and it said principally that that's not obtaining, but it's -- but it also noted, I guess you'd call it dictum, that what -- what -- obviously, what the Hobbs Act, based on its common law roots in extortion, is talking about is the kind of property that can be deprived, it can then be transferred, sold, exercised. And I do think. Just to get the second part of my answer out if I could, it's just -- the common law roots here are also where you see the definition of property can't be as broad as the Government suggests. Because extortion is one of the classic common law property crimes. The definition of property, for purposes of extortion, ought to be the same as the definition of property for larceny, embezzlement, burglary. You can't go into somebody's house and steal their honest services or their autonomy interests. So the kind of property you can obtain for purposes of the Hobbs Act is that same kind of alienable, transferable, moveable property.",
  "I don't --",
  "It would not, Justice Scalia, and I would say because -- if the State of Louisiana in the Cleveland case, if there was a corrupt official who was putting those video poker licenses on sale on the on the sly, I don't think that would change the result there. This Court said that those kind of government things do not have value in the hands of the government. The fact that somebody, you know, could sort of be corrupt and therefore have a little auction on the side I don't think changes that basic fact. I would say, too, that there's an important difference here between a hypothetical case where what somebody's trying to do is kind of get something for nothing and essentially get the benefit of the work of a government official. But that's not what's at issue here. This is not a client who's trying to get -- like, you know, they wanted an opinion on how to incorporate in the State of New York and they thought, well, the lawyers are kind of expensive in the private sector, so I'm just going to coerce it from this government official. All they care about in this case is the bottom line, thumbs up, thumbs down recommendation. I don't think this case would be any different if there were an investment committee within the State government and you had to get unanimous assent to an investment and there was one holdout.",
  "With respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I wouldn't think so. Now, there are some voting rights that are transferable in that sense. I mean, if you have a stock -- a proxy in a stock, or something like that, that may well come within the definition. But when you have these essentially voting or autonomy interests that are really -- you know, they're -- they're sort of inherently inalienable because this recommendation matters because it's the general counsel and the comptroller's office recommendation. And --",
  "Well, the confident -- I may not be understanding the hypothetical. Certainly, the confidential information that the potential coercer has may be transferable, and under this Court's decision in Carpenter, that may be property. But the voting right within the State government or the role within the State government's internal deliberative process, that really belongs to the general counsel, and he can't --",
  "I would say no, but I would say it's a much more difficult case. And the reason I would say no is because the Government -- or I'd say potentially no. I would still say that the Government has to prove something more, which is that it's an investment where there either was not the optimal investment or they paid too high a commission. And -- and I take that from McNally.",
  "Right, because -- but my point is simply that if the Government --",
  "Yes.",
  "I think that's right. If what's obtained is money, and that's what the Government focuses its prosecution on, then that is -- that satisfies the property requirement of the Hobbs Act.",
  "Right, exactly. Exactly, exactly. So you obtained the property, so that box is checked, but the -- sorry.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I would say that what you've just articulated is exactly the Government's theory, and the problem is that I can use that same theory to take any autonomy interest and turn it into property that can be exercised, it can be obtained by somebody and then exercised by them in a way different from the way that the person would otherwise exercise it. And whatever -- I mean, you know, we're talking about one word in a three-word phrase in Scheidler II. And the first thing I would say is I think it's a mistake to read that phrase the way you would read a statute. But the second thing I would say is the one thing the Chief Justice did not mean with respect to the word \"exercise\" is it meant that it opened up a big gap so you could take every coercion case and turn it into an extortion case.",
  "There's -- there's no Federal crime and that's the result of a very deliberative decision by Congress in 1946 in enacting the Hobbs Act. Of course, they had in front of them the model of the Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934 that prohibited both coercion and extortion. Congress made a conscious decision to, in the Hobbs Act, prohibit robbery and extortion, but not pick up the prohibition on coercion. And so there isn't a Federal crime directly on point, but it's a very conscious decision by Congress. And, of course, the New York crime on point is exquisitely on point because not only is there a coercion offense under New York statute, but it is an aggravated offense if the victim is a government official discharging their public duty. And so this is really a situation where the State courts have a crime that directly fits. It's as -- I mean, it's almost amazing because it's not just any State, it's the State of New York. And Congress, in passing the Hobbs Act, was looking at New York law. And they looked at New York law and they said, New York has a coercion prohibition and extortion prohibition.",
  "Well, I'd be happy to address that. What happened is there were some pretrial rulings. And one of the pretrial rulings gave the defendant an opportunity to do some discovery on the State government to figure out whether this was really done in the discharge of public duties or maybe this was sort of a political thing that was going on. And once that State law discovery happened into the government of Albany, all of a sudden the State prosecution didn't seem like such a great idea anymore. And the Federal prosecutors are just down the street, so they were very happy to lateral it to the Federal prosecutors and have them take it over. And because the Federal offense doesn't have an element of interfering with the public duty, they didn't have to worry about the discovery. And that is just a very concrete illustration of the problem of over-federalizing crime because this -- we're talking -- this is the opposite of the typical public corruption case where you think, well, maybe there are people in the State government who aren't going to -- State prosecutors won't be willing to prosecute one of the bigs in the State government, so we need the Federal Government to step in. The one thing a State doesn't need extra incentive to do is to protect the integrity of its internal deliberative process from coercion or extortion, for that matter. But the -- the real cost then to having these duplicative Federal crimes, and they were front and center in this case -- if I may reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. A couple of points in rebuttal. Ms. Harrington started by pointing to the language in McNally. And she is absolutely correct that at the same time that McNally got rid of the honest services prosecution that was brought there, they reserved two possible prosecutions. One would be the obtaining of money, where there was a difference in what the government paid for and what the government got. The other thing that she alludes to is there -- the Court did say, well, maybe there's a possibility that you could prosecute based on the government's loss of control over its allocation of these workman's comp policies. The problem is, of course, that McNally precedes Cleveland. And in Cleveland, the government seized on that language and said, well, even if the video poker license isn't property, the right to control who gets it is property, and that got exactly zero votes from this Court. So I think that argument is no longer viable. Ms. Harrington also points to these New York cases about the scope of property for purposes of 851 of the New York Penal Code. But of course, what we're talking about is 850 of the New York Penal Code, the kind of property that can be obtained. I think it's common ground that -- they are not co-extensive. There are -- there is property that you can obtain that you can't threaten. Indeed, the classic thing you obtained in -- in an extortion case is money, and I'm not sure how you really threaten money. You can threaten to take money from someone, but you don't really threaten the money. So these are different terms. So relying on the Barondess case, which is the same case that Justice Stevens relied on in dissent in Scheidler II just doesn't work. Now, she's also absolutely correct that extortion at common law only involved official extortion, but that doesn't mean that there aren't common law places to look for a relevant definition of property. Because the same basic concept was in the larceny statutes, the -- not statutes, the common law crime of burglary, larceny, and embezzlement. And indeed to this very day, New York refers to extortion as larceny by extortion. And if you go to those New York cases, the place I would point you to is the Ashworth case, which is cited in both of our briefs. This is a case that makes very clear that under New York law, they didn't even think that services at all were property. This is a case where the foreman of a mill gets the bright idea that he's going to do some work for his own company using the mill's facilities. And he's charged with larceny. And the court in that case says, no, that's not larceny, you didn't obtain any goods. Classic sort of common law property is in order to be the kind of property that you can steal or extort it has to be moveable. One of the elements of the common law crime is asportation, literally moving it --",
  "And if I can just sort of put the point, they say all of that and they reject that argument. And they use a line which I think really captures what's going on here. They say, well, maybe you can conceive of such a conception of property, but they say to conceive this requires a certain intellectual flexibility which is probably not possessed by the average person. And I would simply submit it also is not the kind of flexibility that should be possessed by the average judge in a criminal case.",
  "Well, a couple of things, Justice Sotomayor. I went back to the Tropiano case because it is sort of the pro genitor of this whole line of Second Circuit cases, and I noticed two things. One, I noticed it was written by a district court sitting by designation. So I mean, I -- I don't mean anything by that other than this is not Marbury. Second, I would say that the second thing I noticed is that the debt --",
  "Well, it's not -- it's a good thing you're no longer sitting in that capacity, Your Honor --",
  "-- because I -- I certainly mean you no offense. You could write Marbury here. So the -- the difference is, Your Honor, that that could have also been, I think, actually prosecuted as a property crime because in that case, there were customer accounts that were obtained, and those customer accounts, as the facts of Tropiano discussed it, actually had value, they could have been transferred from one business to another. So I think what would happen in the Second Circuit, if you decide this case the way we would like you to, is the Government's going to have to be careful. They're going to have to write their indictments to focus on things like money or obtainable property, and they can't get sloppy and put together these autonomy interests and call them property. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Stanford Ponzi scheme was a massive fraud, but that fraud clearly included material misrepresentations about transactions in covered securities. The complaints in this case bear that out. Plaintiffs allege specifically that their money was ­­ there were misrepresentations about how their money would be invested in covered securities, that the misrepresentation was material, and that, indeed, the security of the underlying investments was the most important factor in securing Plaintiff's own investments in the CDs.",
  "Well, I certainly agree with you in the latter assumption, Your Honor, which is both lower courts decided this on the case that the complaint specifically ­­ referred to covered securities specifically enough. I don't want to belabor the point because I don't think it's in the case, but I will say I do think there's a reason that that was not a contested issue because, if you think about the securities that were referred to, strong multinational corporations, major international banks, those are companies that are traded on U.S. national exchanges. Also, if you get into the details of the record, I mean, if you want to look at something, Joint Appendix page 746 is an attachment to the Willis complaint. And there, there's a reference to the New York Stock Exchange, and it's a translated letter to investors, and you can read it more than one way. But I sure think the whole point of that paragraph is to lead the Plaintiffs to think that their stocks ­­ they're buying an interest in stocks that would be traded on the New York Stock Exchange particularly. So ­­",
  "Well, I don't know, Mr. Chief Justice. That would depend on the answer to a question that I don't think the Court has to decide in this case, which is whether a reference to your stockholdings would be sufficient to ­­ to come with ­­",
  "Yeah, I think that probably would be covered, Your Honor, and I don't think that's any great surprise.

  "Well, that's right. I'm just saying, though, that I don't think the fact that you can have a misrepresentation in connection with a loan application or something like that is all that surprising in the sense that the way that both 10b, 10b­5, and SLUSA are structured. The \"in connection with\" requirement can take something that might otherwise be plain fraud, and if there's a misrepresentation in connection with a security or a covered security, that makes it securities fraud. But that ­­",
  "Well, with ­­ with respect, I don't think, in most of these cases, anything is going to particularly turn on that. I also think ­­ I'm happy to answer ­­",

  "Your Honor, I don't know that there are cases directly on point. But let me be clear. Our theory here does not, by any means, necessarily have to extend to those holder situations. What is at issue here is not just a misrepresentation about holdings of securities. It is ­­ they are misrepresentations about covered securities transactions. And more particularly, they are false promises to purchase covered securities for Plaintiffs' benefit. And there are SEC cases that are brought under those circumstances and, as well, there should be because, when you sell something, whether it's a noncovered security or something else based on a misrepresentation about covered securities, you trigger the interests of the SEC and SLUSA in a distinct way.",
  "I would think probably not, at the end of the day, but I also would say that this is so far removed from that. I mean, first of all ­­",
  "With respect, Your Honor, I think this Court has already crossed the bridge that you don't have to effect the specific transaction in which you are ­­ the fraud is alleged to be associated with.

As we point out in the briefs, if you imagine that this was a thing where they said, look, we're going to purchase multinational corporations; and, instead, they purchase domestic corporations. Well, then, there would be a transaction that would not have otherwise occurred on the market and domestic transactions that would have been perfectly analogous to the kind of normal transaction that took place in Bankers Life or in Zandford on the market. And yet, the fraud was sufficiently associated with this. And I don't think this Court wants to say that the only frauds that are not in connection with are the really big ones ­­",
  "I don't think there's a particularly close case because, A, I think the SEC has better things to do.",
  "And I think privately ­­",
  "Well, I ­­ I think, probably, I would start with the Richard Line case, which is cited on page 21 of their brief. And what that case shows is that you can have frauds in connection with covered securities that affect things that are either not covered securities or, in that case, are nothing at all. Mr. Line was very clever. He took people who were interested in having their kids go to college and needed financial aid, and he said, I'll take your assets from you, and they'll be ­­ they'll be mine, I'm not going to give you anything in return, not a covered security, nothing, because the whole point of this is to get your assets off your books. And what I'll do is I'll invest those in the market, make a bunch of money, and in four years, when you're no longer worried about financial aid, I'll return your principal and some of the proceeds. And ­­",
  "I think that ­­ I would agree with that, Justice Alito, but for a slightly different reason than you may be imagining, which is I think one of the mistakes that can be made here is to ask in connection with ­­ do all the work. And the statute has multiple requirements, including a materiality requirement. And as your question suggests, if you're making a misrepresentation and the whole point of it is to just tell somebody that, look, I have wealth, or I have sort of assets, I don't know that the specific nature of them makes any difference. But in a case like this, the whole point of this fraud was to take a noncovered security and to imbue it with some of the positive qualities of a covered security, the most important of which being liquidity. And if you look at sort of the underlying brochures here that were used to market this, that's really what this fraud was all about. These ­­­ these CDs were offered as being better than normal CDs because we can get you your money whenever you need it.",
  "It doesn't matter, Your Honor, for the reason I indicated earlier, which is you don't want to draw a line that basically says, look, if you buy different securities than you were supposed to or you sell fewer than you were supposed to, that's covered, but if you're a Madoff, and you go all the way and simply lie about the whole thing and there never were any securities purchases at all, that that's somehow better.",
  "Well, I think, again, if ­­ if you want to start with SEC adjudications, again, on page 21, there is the Jett adjudication where, again, there was a broker/dealer in that case, and they just made up the trades. They told their employer, you know, look how I've done, look at these great trades. And there just weren't any trades. And of course, all of the Madoff cases ­­ or a substantial number of Madoff cases fit that ­­ fit that ­­ that categorization. It's actually not clear whether this case does because, at the end of the day, I think what's alleged is either there were no purchases or substantially less purchases of covered securities than represented. Nobody has really thought the difference between zero and substantially less made much of a difference in this case. And I would certainly, like I said, suggest that that's the right result because, whatever else is true, you can't somehow have a better fraud that's immune from the SEC, just because you completely made the whole thing up and there were no transactions at all.",
  "Sure. Let me start with ­­ I mean ­­ with a hypothetical that Zandford used because I think it helps illustrate why, even if coincide is the test, we satisfied here. What Zandford was really distinguishing is two cases, one where a broker/dealer gets money from a potential client with the purest of intentions and only at a later stage do they say ­­ you know, I'm kind of below on own payments, I need some money, I'm going to embezzle the funds. And Zandford said, in that context, the fraud and the security purchases are independent events. I don't think anybody would look at this case and say that the misrepresentations about covered securities purchases and the fraud were independent events, nor would anybody say that this isn't a case where, from the very beginning, there was intent by Stanford not to make good on the promise to purchase covered securities on behalf of the plaintiffs. So this is like Zandford itself or Wharf ­­ Wharf Holdings itself, where the fraudulent intent is there at the very moment the transaction takes place. And, again, Wharf Holdings is another example where this Court says, in dictum, that, well ­­ you know, it would be one thing if they sold the option and only, later, independently decided that they weren't going to perform on the option. But if they had that intent all along, they clearly coincide. Now ­­",
  "Well, there ­­",
  "A couple things, Your Honor. First of all, obviously, the Federal securities laws apply to non­covered securities, as well as covered securities. So the real question here is going to be SLUSA's coverage because, as I said, 10b­5 applies to non­covered securities. Second of all, this Court is well over the bridge about not requiring that it be the plaintiff's own purchases or sales that are what the inquiry focuses on. And that's been true in a whole line of this Court's cases. And in ­­",
  "Well, and here, there are purchases of covered securities. They're the alleged purchases. They're the false promises that I'm going ­­",
  "Well, as I said, I don't think anything turns on it, but there actually were some purchases. And they ­­",
  "Right, but ­­",
  "Right, Mr. Chief Justice, and that has been the case in other cases as well. The security transactions in Bankers Life, neither the seller nor the buyer of those transactions had ­­ was affected by ­­ directly by the fraud. In Zandford, there were security sales. Those security sales ­­",
  "Sure, and ­­ and the plaintiffs were clearly affected by this fraud.",
  "And, again, that's true, in so many of the cases. Dabit, the holders didn't purchase or sell at all, but that was okay. O'Hagan, the defrauded party was the company with the confidential information.",
  "The simplest ­­ the simplest, narrowest way to decide this case is to say that, when there is a misrepresentation and a false promise to purchase covered securities for the benefit of the plaintiffs, then the \"in connection with\" standard is required. If I may reserve my time.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor. A couple of points. First of all, this ­­ it is just simply wrong that courts have not decided that a purported sale is covered. The Grippo case from the Eleventh Circuit, which we cite in both our opening and reply brief, is one of those cases. There are others consistent with the SEC's longstanding position.",
  "Zandford is a case from this Court that, essentially, says that as well.",
  "I don't know that I would adopt any of them, Your Honor, because I think a lot of them make the same mistake, which is they get materiality, and they sneak it into the \"in connection with\" requirements. So ­­",
  "Yes, and I think, if you were going to accept one test, I would accept ­­ I would ask you to have the Siegel test from Judge Sutton, but I do think it's a mistake to have materiality or causation slip into the \"in connection with\" requirement. I'd like to start with Justice Kennedy's very apt observation that this fraud here is very similar to the paradigmatic securities fraud where I simply ­­ a broker simply says, give me your money, I will buy securities, and never does. And from the perspective of the defrauded party, it doesn't matter whether what they get in return is a statement that says they own some securities or a statement in a feeder fund that says they have an interest in the Madoff fund or whether they get, here, a CD that they are told by the ­­ the brochure that tells them what this is all about, that it's backed by the investments in the securities. They're all one and the same. Another thing I have to correct is it's simply not true that the returns here were not variable on the performance of the portfolio. It's not really well developed in the record here, but if you want to, we could lodge the brochures that are used to market these things that tell these guys that their returns are variable and that they could lose all of their principal because of the investments in covered securities. A second thing is, of course, Mr. Goldstein correctly says there are particular problems when broker dealers lie about covered securities. Well, so, too, there are particular problems when an unregistered investment company lies about covered securities. And that's what their own complaint says was the reality of these ­­ of the Stanford Investment Bank, that it was an unregistered investment company. That's interesting for two reasons. One, if it were a registered investment company, all of its securities would be covered securities. That's another way you can get within the covered security band. So this idea that Mr. Goldstein proclaims, this is not a covered securities fraud, is simply wrong. It is. It was material to this fraud to make misrepresentations about purchases of covered securities. Without those representations that we're going to take their money and we're going to reinvest it ­­ again, words from their complaint ­­ in covered securities, nobody's going to give their money to a bank in Antigua. The reason you give your money to a bank in Antigua is because you think it's backed by something more than a piece of paper, and the something more was purchases of covered securities on the market. So ­­",
  "If I can answer? First of all, I think that Mr. Goldstein was quite prudent to not defend the Fifth Circuit's rationale. So the fact that there are other misrepresentations should not mean that a misrepresentation in connection with the purchase or sale of covered securities is somehow okay. SLUSA makes clear that any misrepresentation is enough. Now, the other thing I would say, very briefly, is that they may have an opportunity to try to replead. That, in a sense, is the next case. I assure you that we would be arguing here, where the essence of their claim is to hold the Petitioners secondarily liable for the underlying misrepresentations, they have to sort of have to take them all, but that's the next case. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If the statute at issue here really does reach every malicious use of chemicals anywhere in the nation, as the government insists, then it clearly exceeds Congress' limited and enumerated powers. This Court's cases have made clear that it is a bedrock principle of our federalist system that Congress lacks a general police power to criminalize conduct without regard to a jurisdictional element or some nexus to a matter of distinctly Federal concern. The President's negotiation and the Senate's ratification of a treaty with a foreign nation does not change that bedrock principle of our constitutional system.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I guess I would quarrel with your premise, which is, it is true that the convention in the statute used similar terms and terminology, but there's one very important difference between the convention and the statute, and that actually differentiates this case from Missouri v.

And I would respectfully suggest that making that translation, if you will, between what violates the convention if you're a nation state and what would be comparable individual conduct is not obvious.

  "I think that's right, Justice Alito. And I didn't mean, in answering Justice Kagan's question, to fully accept the premise that there's no limit on the treaty power whatsoever. But I do think that it's important to recognize that, in the context of non­self­executing treaties, there's a real opportunity to leave for another day the question of whether the treaty itself is valid because, sometimes, a treaty is non­self­executing precisely because the Senate recognizes ­­",
  "No. Absolutely not, Justice Kennedy, but that's precisely because it's a valid non­self­executing treaty. By its terms, it doesn't do anything to direct ­­ directly regulate individual conduct. And if I were the President's counsel, I would have said, honestly, Mr. President, I don't think this requires us to have any law that applies to garden variety assaults with chemicals. But if we need that to discharge our treaty obligations, the States are absolutely ready and able to shoulder that task. There's no State in this country that doesn't have a general assault statute that would be covered by this conduct. There is no State that doesn't have a murder statute to cover this conduct ­­",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, one way to understand that is that the State of Pennsylvania exercised its prosecutorial discretion not to pursue this matter. I don't think that ­­ I don't even think the government says that that exercise of prosecutorial discretion put us in violation of our treaty obligations. Our treaty obligation, at most, is to have a law that prohibits this conduct, which the States certainly do. The treaty obligation is not to make sure that every single use ­­ malicious use of chemicals is, in fact, prosecuted by the State or local officials.",
  "No, that's not my test, Justice Kagan. I would actually come at it from the other end of the stick, which is to say, that the one thing I think I know from this Court's precedence is that the Federal government doesn't have a general police power. So as I look at this statute, it can either be saved by essentially creating a jurisdictional element out of the phrase \"peaceful\" and equating it with non­war­like or, if the statute really has this general character, then at least as applied to the chemicals here, which are pure dual use chemicals, it can't be constitutionally applied.",

  "I would say that, if a Federal statute exercises the police power ­­ by which I mean it criminalizes conduct without regard to jurisdictional element or some nexus to a matter of distinctly Federal concern, then that statute exceeds Congress' power. That was the case in Lopez; that was the case in Morrison. And I think, unless you accept our narrowing construction, that's the case here.",
  "It does, Your Honor, and it would be valid legislation precisely because Sarin is something that, clearly, Congress could prohibit in all its uses. And as I understand how this statute applies to Sarin gas or other things, certainly, on Schedule I ­­ there are some Schedule I substances that are talked about both in the convention and the treaty ­­ those things are always unlawful. What is particularly unusual about the statute's application to something like potassium dichromate or vinegar or whatever you have is that, in most of its possession and uses, it's perfectly lawful, and what makes it a chemical weapon in the government's theory is when it's used purely intrastate in a malicious way.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, I would beg to differ. I actually think that our approach to this case avoids judges being put in that difficult position, precisely because we distinguish, unlike the government, between the validity of the convention and the validity of the implementing legislation. And then, as to the implementing legislation, we simply ask the courts to do what they do in every other context, which is to check and see if that implementing legislation is consistent with our basic chartering document. And it's the government's position, which I don't really understand why this would work, but their theory is that, if the non­self­executing treaty is valid, then the implementing legislation is ipso facto somehow valid.",
  "And think about the convention that was before this Court in the Medellin case, the Vienna Convention on Consular Notification. It puts an obligation on any arresting official to provide notification to the consulate about an arrested foreign national. Now, I suppose it would be a perfectly rational way to implement that convention to have a national police force, and so every arresting officer is a Federal officer who's fully apprised of the Vienna Convention responsibilities. That would be a rational way to implement the treaty, but it wouldn't be remotely consistent with our Constitution. On the other hand, that same valid non­self­executing treaty can be validly implemented by chartering the State Department to work with police officers on a State and local level to understand their obligations.",
  "Justice Alito, I think that would be one way of approaching the question. I think that would be a ­­",
  "I don't think it would be beyond their ability. I also don't think it would be beyond ­­ beyond the ability of a Federal judge to say, okay, let's hypothetically ask the question in the absence of a non­self­executing treaty, would Congress have the power to pass this statute? And if the answer to that is no, then I think the burden sort of shifts to figure out why it is that the treaty adds something to the powers of the Federal government. And I think this, just to make clear, I think this is a very different context from what the Court had in Missouri v. Holland because, there, the treaty itself prohibited individual action. An individual violated the treaty if they took a migratory bird out of season. And so in that sense, the enforcement statute did nothing more than put a criminal penalty on violating conduct that was already prohibited to the individual. And in that ­­",
  "I think that would be a fair characterization of our argument, but only to add that this would be the anti­clear statement case. Because the one place that this convention talks about imposing obligations on individuals, it's a promise by the nation state to pass penal legislation that is in accordance with their constitutional systems. So it's very bizarre ­­ that's Article VII, Section 1, it's, I think, 33a. And so it's very bizarre when the only way we're reaching individual conduct here, unlike the treaty in Holland, is a United States promise to pass legislation that comports with our constitutional process, to say that the convention, therefore, allow us to pass legislation that doesn't comport with our constitutional process.",
  "Because Sarin gas is, I think, more equivalent to something that the Congress would try to deal with like the way it dealt with marijuana in Raich. I think ­­ it's just a reflection of the idea that, when you're talking about things where the Federal Government is trying to prohibit it, then there's a greater Federal power to do that. And I think, with Sarin gas, you could imagine ­­ put aside the commerce power for a second, put aside the treaty power ­­ it may be that, with Sarin gas, even under the war powers, the Federal Congress can say, look, that's something that's ­­ you know, it's sort of inherently a chemical weapon, and we're going to prohibit people from having that. That's very different from these situations where, if you think about it, the only thing that makes these chemicals chemical weapons instead of chemicals is their internal, intrastate use in a malicious way. And that's different, I think, from at least a hypothetical statute that says, look, here are ­­ I mean, there's three schedules in the statute, 43 different chemicals that are particularly problematic. If the Federal government wants to regulate those and prohibit the unauthorized possession of those, I don't see why they couldn't do that with or without the treaty. But when ­­ what is so anomalous here is the idea that these chemicals, everything, rat poison, vinegar, whatever it is, these things are perfectly lawful, we don't think of them as chemical weapons, unless and until they're used in a malicious way, and then all of a sudden, they become classified as chemical weapons. That's a very odd statute. But it does, I think, operate in a way that is just inconsistent with the bedrock principle that the Federal Congress just doesn't have this kind of police power.",
  "I don't believe so. It's certainly not one that is listed on the three schedules. There are 43 chemicals. Neither of these are on there. And I do think there is an important difference because ­­ this is perhaps an odd way to think about it, but ­­ you know, this is a statute that's really trying to regulate nouns, chemical weapons. And with respect to something like weaponized chemicals or Sarin gas, it makes sense to say those are chemical weapons. But with respect to otherwise harmless chemicals, the only thing that under the government's theory turns them from chemical weapons ­­ I'm sorry ­­ from chemicals into chemical weapons isn't a noun, it's a verb. It's their malicious use. And that puts you in a very odd sort of situation. And I think that ­­ you know, if Congress had come in and said, look, there are certain chemicals that, by their very nature, are almost inherently weaponized, I think Congress would have a lot more authority to proceed in that kind of situation.",
  "Well ­­",
  "A couple points ­­",
  "Justice Sotomayor, a couple of points. First of all, generally, you might be right that ­­ that the criminal law takes objects that are otherwise innocent and say ­­ say they can be used in a malicious way and criminalizes it. But most of that work is done by State and local criminal law, and at the Federal level, you need something else. You need a jurisdictional element, something that has a distinct Federal concern. Second, as to the concerns about this convention ­­",
  "Well, I don't think that the treaty power ­­",
  "­­ especially when there's this much of a disconnect between what the treaty power does and what the statute does, which is the treaty, again, does not directly regulate at all individual conduct. It is regulated at nation state conduct. Now, with all due respect, I don't think that nation states poison romantic rivals, attempt to commit suicide, or try to get rodents out of their houses. And so, when individuals do those things, I think it's ­­ it's hard to draw an analogy between what's forbidden to a nation state and the individual action. But any work that is done in the statute by drawing that analogy is done by the statute and not by the convention. So I don't ­­",
  "Right. And we would say that, under our narrowing construction, that that's covered.",
  "Because it's a war­like use of the chemicals.",
  "We would also point out for the record that that same conduct would obviously be covered directly by Federal statutes that target terrorism directly. So no matter how you decide that case, whether you accept our narrowing ­­ if you accept our narrowing construction, that conduct will be covered by two Federal statutes. If you don't accept our narrowing construction, but hold this statute unconstitutional, then that conduct is still going to be covered. And I just think, when you are trying again to think about what the convention is after, it is not really after Ms. Bond's conduct. I don't think any one of our treaty partners said, oh, my goodness, there's been a deployment of chemical weapons in Norristown, Pennsylvania; I sure hope the United States steps up to its treaty obligations and prosecutes this horrible deployment of chemical weapons. Nobody would say that because nobody speaking normal English would identify this as a deployment of chemical weapons at all.",
  "Two things, Justice Kagan, neither of which will surprise you, I suppose. One is I don't think this is consistent with our constitutional processes ­­",
  "Justice Kagan, I think you have to read Missouri v. Holland both in the context of the treaty that the Court had before it and the argument that it had before it. Missouri made a very strange argument in Missouri v. Holland, one that no modern litigant would make. They made an argument that ­­ they went out of their way to identify a conflict between the Federal treaty and State law and said, therefore, we win under the Supremacy Clause. And Holmes scratched his head and said no. The treaty under ­­ under Article 6 is supreme to both State law and not the other way around. But he also said this one sentence that sort of bedeviled the lower courts here, which says, well, and if the treaty's valid, of course, the legislation is valid. That made sense in the context of the treaty he had before him because he had a treaty that directly prohibited individual conduct and a statute that enforced that individualized prohibition with criminal penalties. So in that case, I suppose it was right, that the treaty and the implementing legislation stood or fell together. That's not the case here. If I could reserve my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points in rebuttal. First of all, the Senate's role in the ratification of treaties cannot be a sufficient political check, and one reason is that, sometimes, the precise role they play as a check is to make a treaty non­self­executing. And so, to take Justice Scalia's hypothetical example of an international treaty that purported to regulate marriage rights, one thing that the Senate very well might do in that case is to say, well, we will ratify it, but we're going to make sure it's non­self­executing, and maybe we will use our spending power or something to get the States on board, but we are not just going to impose a national solution. So it doesn't make any sense to say that a non­self­executing treaty necessarily, even if it's valid, guarantees the validity of the enacting legislation, because some of the reason that you make a treaty non­self­executing is to preserve federalism. A second point is to respond to the argument, which I think I've already explained why it's not correct, but it is the suggestion that there is no daylight between the convention and the statute. There is huge daylight, and the daylight is precisely whether it affects individual conduct and how it affects individual conduct. With all respect, everything on Justice Breyer's List A is not stuff that I think implicates the convention at all. But, yet, under the government's unwavering theory that you can't make any limitations on the statute, that's all covered by the statute. There's your daylight. Now, I would respectfully suggest that our statutory construction argument is one way out of this. I think that you have to understand the way that \"peaceful\" is used in the statute is, essentially, a term of art. I would analogize it to a situation where two scientists in Antarctica get in a fistfight. Okay. That's not conduct we would condone, but I don't think we've violated our pledge to reserve Antarctica for only peaceful purposes. And that's the same way we would like you to interpret this statute. Now, the government says you can't do that because that's going to mess up what's going on in Syria. With all due respect, I assume that the issue in Syria is whether or not the nation state of Syria is doing something that would violate the convention if, contrary to fact, they were signatory to this convention. So if you want to make clear that you're only talking about individual conduct, I think you can solve that whole problem right there. But if I'm wrong and the only way, as the government assures you that you can make this legislation work is to have it be an exercise of the police power, well, then the answer is that the legislation is simply unconstitutional.",
  "I would say it's not, but I think it has to do more with the particular qualities of Sarin gas, the fact that it's on Schedule A, the fact that nobody can possess that for any lawful use. And what makes something like vinegar or even potassium dichromate different is what puts it over the ledge from being an ordinary chemical to a chemical weapon is precisely its use and its use alone. Now, Justice Kagan, you asked a great question. What was Congress thinking when they did this? I think, with respect, the Congress wasn't focused on this issue at all. If you look at the legislation they passed to implement this, the chemical industry and others put in front of them the possibility that there was a Fourth Amendment problem with the inspections of chemical production facilities that were authorized under the convention. When Congress had the constitutional problem in front of it, they had all sorts of provisions to deal with that constitutional concern. Now, the future Ms. Bonds of the world didn't have quite the same lobbying resources as the chemist ­­ the chemical industry, so they didn't avert to this problem. And that's precisely why some kind of clear statement rule or the like would make perfect sense in this, to make sure Congress doesn't exercise the police power, when all it thinks it's doing is implementing a treaty. The last thing is just to say about the State Department legal advisor's ­­",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under this Court's decision in Wolens, there are only two relevant questions here, and the Ninth Circuit got both of them wrong. The first question is whether a claim for additional benefits under a frequent flyer program, like flight upgrades, relate to prices, routes, and services. This Court answered that question in the affirmative in Wolens and, indeed, underscored that the question's not particularly close. The Ninth Circuit's ability to reach the contrary conclusion in the precise same context underscores how far they have strayed from this Court's precedence. The second question is whether the Plaintiffs' claim here seek merely to enforce the parties' voluntary undertakings or, rather, seek to enforce State law to enlarge those undertakings and enlarge the parties' bargain. And it's to that question 2 we think Respondent's own claims here make the case quite clear. Respondent did bring a claim here to enforce the parties' voluntary undertakings, a breach of contract claim, and lost on the merits. The implied preemption claim is different. It seeks to impose a duty of fair dealing and reasonableness and superimposed that on the bargain, even where the parties to the contract have essentially given one party absolute discretion.",
  "Well, there are a couple of answers to that, Justice Ginsburg. The first is I think although the focus on whether a contract is illusory is sometimes used as part of the analysis under the implied covenant for a bilateral contract, I don't think that same analysis would apply to something like a frequent flyer program, which I think would be properly understood as a unilateral contract, where you don't worry about those sort of illusory promises. The second thing is I think you have to understand in the context ­­",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "There ­­ there is a distinction, if you go back to the Horne books on contract law between a unilateral contract and a bilateral contract. A unilateral contract is ­­ is a typical sort of outstanding promise, that promise doesn't require an exchange of consideration, and the party who makes the promise has the ability to withdraw the promise until there's ­­ there's performance, essentially, relying on the promise. And that's why I think it's actually a little bit of a mistake to apply that doctrine to something like a frequent flyer program.",
  "Well, I ­­ I suppose you could conceive of it that way. You could also conceive of it as, basically, being a premium that's offered by the company to reward your loyalty, but you've already gotten full performance.",
  "I don't think there really is ­­ you know, I looked at the ­­ the treatises for that, and I just don't think that concept really applies in the unitary ­­ the unilateral contract context.",
  "And that, really, I think, gets to the nub of this because, of course, what you're suggesting is that there would be a market solution to this problem. And that's what the Airline Deregulation Act is all about, letting the market decide these issues. So, if some airline really were crazy enough to systematically turn on its most lucrative and loyal customers, surely, the market would solve that. And, of course, if a bunch of airlines did it, the Department of Transportation stands ready to police that. But ­­",
  "There ­­ there is consideration ­­ I'm not sure anything turns on this ­­ but there is consideration because this is not something where the airline says, look, we can do anything we want. They say, look, if you present us with miles while you're still in good standing in the program, we'll give you upgrades, we'll let you into a lounge. But if, pursuant to the contract, you abuse the program, in our sole discretion, then you lose your membership status. And that's what's happened here.",
  "Well, that is true, but I suppose the argument might be that you could, as a matter of breach of contract law, use this principle to interpret the contract. And, if that were an argument, it's an argument that's made under Count 1 of this complaint.",
  "Well, a couple of points, Justice Sotomayor. First of all, I think it's ­­ it's really important to emphasize that the claim about pretext and this all being about the merger is actually not something that's made in the breach of contract count or the breach of implied covenant count. That's pled, actually, in the misrepresentation counts, Counts 3 and 4 of the complaint, that everybody recognizes are preemptive. Now, what's pled in contract Count 1, the breach of contract count, is that, under the contract, somehow, we don't have the ability to terminate somebody without just cause. And that's the argument that the district court rejected on the merits. Now, the implied covenant count, Count 2, is different. It says that, under State law, there is a duty of good faith and fair dealing, and that duty is superimposed on the contract, even if the contract gives one of the parties absolute discretion. And those aren't my words. Those are the words of Count 2 of the complaint at Joint Appendix page 51.",
  "Well, the way I would think about it, Justice Sotomayor, is \"absolute\" might not quite mean absolute, and the place to make that argument is under the breach of contract rubric; that, you can cite Cardozo and Lady Duff­Gordon. But when you get to saying, even if the contract's absolute, State law still superimposes a reasonableness requirement on the contract, that's the point at which preemption kicks in.",
  "It might well, Justice Scalia, because ­­",
  "It depends on the State. So the majority ­­",
  "Okay. Minnesota. I ­­ as I read the cases, the rule in Minnesota is that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not waivable. So there's a case that we found called New Amsterdam Casualty. It's in the indemnity context, so I assume that ­­ and it says that in the indemnity context a covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not waivable. So I don't think you could do that, which I think underscores that this is not the parties agreeing to this. This is having this condition superimposed on them by State law.",
  "Yes. The ­­ the good­faith John Doe can do two things. One, as your question suggested, he can go to the DOT. The DOT has the authority to investigate complaints about frequent flyer programs. It exercises that authority. It's discussed at pages, I think, 20 and 21 of the SG's brief. They heard something like 289 of these complaints last year. So that's ­­ so that's one place you can go. The other place you can go in a case ofmistaken identity ­­ I mean, if you followed up and, certainly, if you went so far as to bring a routine breach of contract claim, I assume that would get addressed in that forum because airlines are not in the interest ­­ do not have an interest in getting rid of their most lucrative and loyal customers.",
  "No, I don't think there's Federal common law. This Court, I think, essentially rejected that in Wolens. I'm making a more practical point, which is in a real case of mistaken identity, I think that would get sorted out in the process, certainly at the point where a breach of contract action was brought. Because, again, if there's ­­ if there's a John Doe who really is a frequent flyer ­­",
  "You can refer to State law for the breach of contract. You can't, we would submit, add the implied covenant of breach of good faith because that enlarges the bargain.",
  "I think the reliance on the implied covenant in that context should be preempted. I think that's the better rule. If this Court wanted to adopt a narrower rule and say, look, it's really at the point that you try to bring a separate implied covenant claim, that's preempted, I suppose, as a matter of adminstrability, you could do that. It might make some sense, because ­­ I mean, you do have to take a practical look at this. In the wake of Wolens, if you plead a routine breach of contract claim, you're going to avoid preemption. The only reason, practically, you run the risk of preemption by pleading a separate claim is when you're trying to really get outside of the terms of the contract.",
  "Well, here's my thought on that, which is I think even the Respondents admit that, in some States, the implied covenant is much more than simply a rule of construction for the explicit terms of the contract. And I suppose, if this Court wants to say that the only way the implied covenant is not preempted, is when it's just a rule of construction for the explicit terms of the contract, I suppose we could live with that rule, and I think we'd certainly win in this case. The reason I would suggest that the better rule for this Court to adopt is that the implied covenant should just be preempted, even in that circumstance, is because, in that circumstance, it doesn't add anything. If it really is just a rule of construction for the express terms of the contract, you could get in the same place with the citation to Cardozo and Lady Duff­Gordon.",
  "Well, I'm not ­­ it's ­­ it's in the Red Brief, and I think it's quite clear. I think they ­­ they say ­­ I'll try to find the ­­ the point where ­­ where I find this rebuttal. But I don't think the ­­ they do this. They basically say that some States do apply this rule. They say that our claim is different. And I'll get you the exact page.",
  "Well, I may have misspoke. What I meant is I think both parties agree, as they would have to, that, in some States, the Implied Covenant Doctrine is used to directly impose public policy. And so, in Alaska, that seems to be the case. In Montana, that seems to be the case.",
  "We don't believe so, Your Honor. I think ­­ I'm not going to try to tell you that Minnesota law is pellucidly clear on this. But Minnesota ­­ the Minnesota Supreme Court case ­­ the Hennepin case that adopts ­­ recognizes the implied covenant, cites the Restatement. The Restatement quite clearly embraces a view of the implied covenant that goes beyond merely constructing the express terms of the contract.",
  "I may have misspoke, Justice Kennedy. The breach of contract claim that you bring ­­ the routine breach of contract claim you bring is a State law claim, so we don't have any quarrel with Count 1 of this claim, which views Minnesota State contract law to interpret the express terms of the contract. Where we have a beef is with Count 2 of the complaint that says, even if the contract gives the parties absolute discretion, we are going to superimpose a duty of good faith and fair dealing. And, to complete the answer, since Minnesota has adopted the Restatement, the Restatement suggests that the way you find good faith is you exclude the possibility of bad faith, based on community standards of fairness and decency. And, at the point that you're applying community standards of fairness and decency, it seems to me, quite clear, that you are not applying the parties' self­imposed undertakings, but something else.",
  "You could try to wiggle there. And my point would be the way to try to wiggle there is interpreting the express terms of the contract. An implied covenant is different. And I think if you take a step back and think about this context: When an airline reserves to itself the sole discretion to make a judgment about frequent flyers or about taking an unruly passenger off a plane, do you really want State courts applying community standards of decency to judge that, or is that something that should be judged by a complaint to the Department of Transportation? If I could reserve the remainder of my time?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First, just a couple of loose ends. The concession that I was referring to before is on 15 and 16 of the Red Brief. I think it was reiterated at the podium. Also, this argument that, somehow, frequent flyer miles programs have changed or something and are different because there are partners, the same arguments were made by the plaintiffs in Wolens, in their brief to this Court, that, somehow, these don't relate to prices and routes and services because you have rental cars and hotels as partners, so I think this Court has already crossed that bridge. Three ­­",
  "I'm not sure it would be different in a ­­ in a claim brought against the airlines. I mean, maybe if you want to sue the credit card partner, the ADA has nothing to do with that. But I would say that, if you're suing an airline, the Airline Deregulation Act speaks to it. But, if the Court want to reserve that, I suppose it could. I do want to make ­­ underscore that the Implied Covenant Doctrine is very different from other interpretative tools. It is non­waivable, and, I think, in a world where you are trying to determine the difference between self­imposed undertakings and things imposed by State law, non­waivability is a huge strike against it being voluntary. It also just is ­­ you can bring in separate implied covenant claims ­­ you know, no one ­­ I've never heard of a contra proferentem claim, but an implied covenant claim is routinely brought as a separate claim. It just shows you really can enlarge the bargain in very real ways, and the States make policy decisions about whether to have it. Texas doesn't have implied covenants, as a general matter, at all. Some States have a valid public policy. They have different views about at­will employment contracts. And, when Congress wanted to impose a duty of good faith and fair dealing on the franchise agreements between car manufacturers and automobile dealers, they passed a statute. It's just statutory and policy oriented in a way that normal rules of construction are not. Now, Justice Breyer, I certainly agree with your four premises. If I had to state a standard, I would say the standard is that the implied covenant is only not preempted when it does no more than provide a rule of construction for the express terms of the contract. But, of course, if that's all it does, then there's nothing to be gained by saying those claims are not preempted because you can still just get to the same place by citing Cardozo and Lady Duff­Gordon. And there's a lot to be gained by adopting a more prophylactic rule because the claims that are brought in the real world are claims that I get a refund even though the ticket's nonrefundable. I get $1,000, even though the loss limit was 500. I get to sue you for redirecting my packages, even though it was in your sole discretion. So in the real world, the implied covenant claims are elastic and provide a basis for bringing the kind of claims that courts have almost uniformly correctly recognized are preempted. The last question I ask you to think about is: Why is it the airlines don't put these covenants in as express covenants? Why do they say sole discretion and not say sole discretion unless it violates reasonable norms of community standards and decency? Well, the reason is you can't run a national, let alone international airline, if every one of your judgments about taking an unruly passenger off or taking out an abusive customer is going to be second­guessed by a jury applying reasonable standards of ordinary decency and morality. So, for that reason, we think the judgment below should be reversed, and we would urge you to apply a more prophylactic rule. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a Federal Government agency compelled employers to provide something as religiously sensitive as contraception, it knew that free exercise in RFRA claims would soon follow. In particular, the agency itself provided exemptions and accommodations for the religious exercise of a subset ­­",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor, the first step in the analysis would be to ask whether or not there's a substantial burden on religious exercise. I do think this case is, in a sense, easier than most of the examples that you've brought up because here's one where it's so religiously sensitive, so fraught with religious controversy, that the agency itself provides a certain number of exemptions and accommodations. So that's one way, I think, that you'd address the first step of the question here.",
  "Well, if we assume we get past the substantial burden step of the analysis, then the next step of the analysis is the compelling interest and least restrictive alternatives analysis. And every case would have to be analyzed on its own. I do think in the context of vaccinations, the government may have a stronger compelling interest than it does in this context because there are notions of herd immunity and the like that give the government a particularly compelling interest in trying to maximize the number ­­",
  "Blood transfusions. Again, each one of these cases, I think would have to be evaluated on its own and apply the compelling interest­least restrictive alternative test and the substantial burdens part of the test.",

  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'm not sure that they were all unnecessary. And of course, in a variety of contexts, Congress may proceed on a belt and suspenders matters. So I think there's really two different questions. One is when Congress passed RFRA, was RFRA just done with creating other exemptions. And I think the answer to that is no. But I think the question that Justice Kagan's question brought up is, was Congress evident and did Congress specifically consider whether RFRA would apply across the board to all the provisions of 18 U.S.C., or rather all the provisions of the United States Code. And Congress could not have been clearer that it was passing a statute that it wanted to apply to all preexisting statutes and to all subsequent statutes unless Congress specifically provided otherwise.",
  "Obviously, one of my clients has before you right now a free exercise claim and my other client has a free exercise claim that's live in the lower courts. So those issues are preserved. But I, think, as your question points out, this Court really, first and foremost, can decide this on the basis of the Federal statute, and the Ashwander principles of constitutional avoidance seem like they would be sort of fully applicable to the Court's consideration of that question. And then, of course, the normal principles of statutory construction would certainly point you to the answer to the first objection the government raises, which is do persons include for­profit corporations because ­­",
  "Well, first, Justice Kagan, let me take a little bit of an issue with your premise and let me try to responsive to your question anyways after I do that. How I'd like to take issue with your premise is that when Congress first passed the statute RFRA, it talked about free exercise as defined in the Court's cases. And then at the time that it passed RLUIPA, which is a later statute, it actually confronted some lower court cases that had limited RFRA and tried to impose a centrality requirement. And Congress didn't want that. It didn't want to take all the baggage of the pre­Smith free exercise cases. So it actually amended the statute to broaden it so it now protects any exercise of religion. So I would take issue with your premise that RFRA simply picks up everything that ever happened pre­Smith.",
  "I think that's fair, Justice Scalia. One of the things that you run into if you try to sort of get at this statute the way that Justice Kagan is suggesting is that not everybody exactly agreed as to what the pre­Smith case law was. You described the pre­Smith case law in your opinion in a certain way. Justice O'Connor described the pre­Smith case law in another way. So it's a little bit difficult to try to say, as Justice Kagan's question would suggest, that rather than just apply the statute as written, we should really sort of just go back and apply pre­Smith laws if this were ­­",
  "Well, you're right, Justice Kagan, in the purpose part of the statute it says: What we mean to do here is basically restore the pre­Smith law. But it also accompanies that purpose statute with operative language. And the operative language, which I think this Court should apply, as Justice Scalia suggests, applies broadly to any exercise of religion by any person and then suggests that the relevant test is substantial burden with the burden on my client as to the substantial burden part of the test. And then it's ­­",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I would suggest to the contrary. The reason that there was such unanimity behind RFRA in the first place is that efforts to limit it to just certain subclasses, subsets of religious freedom claims, were rejected and sort of everybody in Congress got together and said, all right, you have some claims you actually want to be vindicated, you have some claims you want to be vindicated, we'll vindicate all of them. And if we're going to look at any legislative history as shedding light on this, then I would suggest you look at Professor Laycock's brief, which goes into great detail about the legislative debates involved in ­­ that led up ultimately to the passage of RLUIPA. And when Congress was trying to pass a broader statute, the RLPA, the Religious Liberty Protection Act, the issue of the statute's application and RFRA's application to for­profit corporations was squarely put at issue by the Nadler Amendment. And that amendment was rejected and the House report that demonstrates the rejection of that amendment could not be clearer that they understood that for­profit corporations would be covered. Now, in fairness, what they understood is that we were probably talking about in the real world a relatively small set of corporations like an incorporated kosher market or kosher deli of the kind that this Court had before it in the Crown Kosher case. And so I think it's ­­ you know, we can talk about the extent and how you'd apply these principles to Exxon, but I think that's just something that's not going to happen in the real world. It is no accident that the claims that you have before you in these cases are brought by small closely­held corporations that have firmly held religious beliefs.",
  "Well, I don't say that. I think Congress said that. But to be as responsive as I can to your question, the parade of horribles that the government offers you ought to sound familiar, because if you look at that parade of horribles ­­ Social Security, minimum wage, discrimination laws, compelled vaccination ­­ every item on that list was included in Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court in Smith. And Justice O'Connor responded to that in her separate opinion and she said, look, you've got to trust the courts; just because free exercise claims are being brought doesn't mean that the courts can't separate the sheep from the goats. Now, whatever ­­",
  "Well, what she said and whatever the merits of it as a matter of constitutional debate isn't relevant. What ­­ what I think is relevant is that Congress clearly preferred one side of that debate and thought courts could handle this. So then the question becomes: How do courts actually apply this test? And I don't think applying the test to recognize this case, where I think the government has an incredibly weak case on compelling interest and least restrictive alternatives, which they almost don't want to talk about at all, is going to endanger any other statutes. And if I could talk about specific ­­",
  "Justice Alito, very few of these claims have been brought. Very few of them have succeeded, and that's notwithstanding the fact that all of these statutes we're talking about apply to employers generally. And it ­­ and none of those claims have been brought or they haven't succeeded notwithstanding the fact that the government concedes that sole proprietorships and partnerships and nonprofit corporations are all protected by RFRA. Now, millions of Americans are employed by proprietorships, partnerships, and nonprofits. So if these statutes really were on a collision course, I think we would have seen the collision already.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, a couple of thoughts. First of all, I mean, it's not like this Court has never had a RFRA case that it applied the standard on the merits. And in the O Centro case, this Court applied something that very much felt to the government at the time as being strict scrutiny. But if this Court ­­",
  "It certainly was a religious organization and it's a separate question as ­­",
  "Well, if I may, Justice Ginsburg, there's two separate questions. There's a question about how to apply the test if it's applicable in a particular case, and I think O Centro is the starting place for guidance on that. Your question also brings up the separate question about the coverage of the statute. And as to that, I think the place to start is the statute itself, which broadly provides coverages to persons. That is not an incidental term. It's a term that picks up additional context through the Dictionary Act and specifically applies to all corporations, to joint partnerships, to societies.",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor, those ­­ those cases ­­ I mean, I'd start with cases like Lukumi or O Centro, which all involved corporations, and nobody thought it was particularly problematic there that the plaintiffs before the court were artificial entities. And I suppose you could take ­­",
  "Well, I'm not sure that you can so easily divide the two, and we can talk about how it is with corporations generally. You understand how the corporation has certain beliefs or certain intent, a scienter requirement. The courts every day deal with issues of trying to figure out what kind of intent or motivation a corporate entity has.",
  "Right. And, Justice Sotomayor, I think the way to approach those cases would be the same basic way you approach other questions of corporate intent or corporate motivation. You look to the governance doctrines, if any of this is put at issue. And I think that's really a critical question, which is ultimately, I think this line of questioning goes to a question of sincerity, and if some large corporation asserts some claim that's going to save them lots of money, I would think that the government in those kind of cases is really going to resist the sincerity piece of the analysis. In this kind of case ­­",
  "To be clear, this Court's cases have always distinguished between the sincerity inquiry, which the Court has allowed, and the centrality inquiry, which it suggested is inappropriate. But sincerity has always been a part of this Court's cases.",
  "Right. This Court has not questioned that. The Thomas case, I think, puts as common ground the idea that you don't really second­guess the person's ­­ the person's belief, but you can contest sincerity. It is ­­ there is case law in this. You know, you have people who are arrested in possession of large quantities of marijuana and they assert that they belong to the church of marijuana, and those cases do get litigated and they get rejected. And there's a lot of different ways to ­­",
  "Well, let me ­­ let me take on Lee first. And I mean, that's obviously the two lines of Lee that are the government's favorite two lines in Lee. But Lee starts with a substantial burden inquiry, which is where most of these sincerity questions go. And Lee definitely says that there is a sincere religious belief and a substantial burden on religious exercise. So the two sentences that you're quoting come in the compelling interest analysis of the case. And I think Lee does stand for the proposition that in the tax context, it's going to be very hard for somebody to bring a claim that satisfies even the demanding compelling interest, least restrictive alternative test.",
  "Well, just to put this in concrete terms, for Hobby Lobby, for example, the choice is between paying a 500 ­­ a $475 million per year penalty and paying a $26 million per year coverage.",
  "Well, just to be clear, we were talking about the same thing. So the option, the choice, is between paying a $475 million a year penalty and a $26 million a year penalty. That's what Hobby Lobby faces. So $2,000 per person ­­",
  "That's $26 million.",

  "And it has been treated for some purposes as a penalty. And I think for this purposes, it certainly feels punitive. And if I could finish the thought about why it's a false comparison, the 2,000 penalty to the cost of the health insurance, is that it's going to very much hurt Hobby Lobby if all of the sudden it doesn't provide health care to its employees. And in order to compensate for that, it would have to increase the wages. And I think it would be worse off as a result of this. But if I could also ­­",
  "No, I actually think what it's like, Your Honor, with all due respect, it's like the five dollar penalty enforcing the prohibition in Yoder. And what this Court says, it's one thing if you don't have a direct government prohibition on a religious exercise or a mandate that somebody do something that violates their religion. In those cases, which is like Sherbert and is like Braunfeld, then you have to look at the substantial pressure, and it becomes a little bit more of a loosey­goosey analysis. But when you have a government law that specifically says you must do something that violates your religion ­­ and it's enforced with a penalty, and with all due respect I think $2,000 per employee is a penalty.",
  "I don't think it would be the same price at the end of the day. I'd also like to point out how this ­­",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Absolutely, Your Honor. And by the way, this $2,000 penalty is very much a double­edged sword for the government, because you're trying to ­­",
  "Here's the problem with this way of looking at it, which is to say whatever it costs per employee to get this, this health care, that's something that right now Hobby Lobby is paying whatever it's paying them, plus it's ­­ it's ­­ you know, imputed into that is the idea that they're getting their wage and they're getting health care insurance. If they take away the health care insurance, they are going to have to increase the wages to make up for that. And they're going to have to pay the $2,000 penalty on top of it, plus they're going to have to violate their ­­ their own interest which is, we actually ­­ we believe it's important to provide our employees with qualified health care.",
  "I think my case would be that in that case the government might be able to sort of support itself on the compelling interest. I think there would still be a substantial burden on their exercise. But again, this all turns on issues that the government hasn't put in issue. This case hasn't been litigated on this particular theory, so I think ­­ I'd love to have the opportunity to show how by not providing health insurance it would have a huge burden on my client and their ability to attract workers, and that in fact would cost them much more out of pocket. But that's not been the nature of the government's theory.",
  "No, it actually is. Again, it hasn't been the principal theory on which this case has been litigated. But see, if you go back to the complaints and you go back to our briefs, you know, it's part of the religious beliefs that both the Hahns and the Greens have. They think it's actually important ­­",
  "I didn't have to make that claim in the course of this litigation. What I'm pointing out, though, is for purposes of the substantial burden analysis, it is perfectly appropriate to take into account that the 2,000 ­­ the $26 million in fines they would pay would not be the only thing that they would lose out if they are on that horn of the dilemma. They would also lose out all the additional wages they would have to pay, and they would be in this position of not offering health care, which is something they believe is important for their religion as well.",
  "Well, with respect, what Congress has said is that this kind of plan is not appropriate for a non­grandfathered plan. But if we're going to talk about the government's compelling interests here, which I think has got to be part of the analysis, then I think the grandfathered provisions of this statute really are devastating for the government's argument that it has a compelling interest. When the government pursues compelling interest, it demands immediate compliance. It doesn't say, \"Get around to it whenever it's convenient.\" I can't imagine Congress passing Title VII and saying, \"Stop discriminating on the basis of race, unless of course you have a preexisting policy that discriminates on the basis of race, and then you can keep it as long as you'd like.\" It is fundamentally inconsistent with a compelling interest ­­",
  "­­ analysis to have this kind of grandfathering.",
  "Here's, respectfully, why I don't think that that works, which is I think the question whenever there are exemptions in the statute is to ask yourself, do the exemptions undermine the compelling interest that the government asserts. There's nothing inconsistent with an interest in prohibiting employment discrimination to say we're going to focus on the people who actually employ the most people and therefore can engage in the most discrimination. It's quite a different matter, and I don't think anybody would think that Congress would pass a Title VII that said, \"Hey, as long as you have a preexisting discriminatory policy, you're allowed to keep it.\" That doesn't seem like it would be consistent.",
  "Well ­­",
  "With all due respect, it's not necessarily a very short transition period. And your ­­ your references to co­pays and premiums is precisely on point, because the government, through its regulations, has allowed grandfathered plans to make changes to the co­pays as long as they're indexed to medical inflation. Now, if you have a transition period that's just there for a nanosecond, you don't bother indexing it to medical inflation. So this is a grandfather provision that's going to be around for multiple years. And by the government's own numbers, tens of millions of employees are not getting this mandated coverage as a result of the grandfather provision. And even if we can project forward ten years to when maybe there would only be a handful of grandfathered plans, even at that point, you would still have the same problem that the government would have, which is it has to make an argument for a compelling interest.",
  "Well, no, it's not just the way it works, Justice Kennedy. And I actually have four things I'd like to say about that, if it's possible. One is, I think the first thing about third­party burdens is you have to ask where are they coming from. And if the third­party burdens are coming from an employer ­­ I mean, an employer right now can put some burden on their rights because they have to listen to religious music or whatever. That's not as serious as a burden that's coming directly from the government. So that's one principle to think about. Another principle, and this is more of a detail, but I think it's important, is that to the extent you take into account third­party burdens, you take those into account in the compelling interest part of the analysis. The government has an argument that somehow third­party interests go into the substantial burden part of the analysis, where we bear the burden. And we don't think that's right at all. The third­party ­­",
  "Right. But that actually brings me to my third point, which is those other significant interests that carry the most weight have to be independent of the very statute that's at issue in the case and that the party seeks an exemption from. So if you think about the Caldor case, there the Court was concerned with the third­party burdens on, say, an employee who had a seniority right to take the weekends off. So he or she had an independent right to take the weekend off, and the government policy was coming in and displacing this.",
  "There, too, I have to respectfully disagree, because if you remember the facts of Lee, Lee is brought not just by the employer, but by the employee. So the particular employees there don't have a beef with what he's doing at all. And I think when they're talking about third­party burdens there, what the Court is really talking about is the ­­ the burdens of everybody else who contributes into a system where uniformity, to use the Court's words, was indispensable. And so if I could, though, I think, just to illustrate why it's sort of double counting to count the mandated issue here as being what gives the burden to the third party or the benefit on the third party. Imagine two hypotheticals. One is Congress passes a statute and says I have to destroy all of my books, including my Bibles. Another statute, Congress comes in and says I have to give all of my books, including all of my Bibles, to you. Now, in the second case, I suppose you could say that a RFRA claim somehow gets rid of your statutory entitlement to my Bibles, but I don't think, since it's the very benefit that we're talking about that's at issue there, I don't think ­­ I think that really is double counting and I don't think those two hypothetical statutes should be analyzed any differently. The other thing, though, about burdens, and I think it should go ­­ this is the fourth point ­­ that should go into the compelling interest test ­­",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, I think you could say the same thing about my Bible hypothetical. But I do have one last thing to say about burdens. And I do think when you think about impacts on third parties, not all of these burdens are created equal. And that, too, I think is borne out in this Court's cases. And the most relevant factor is, is there some alternative way for the government to ameliorate the burden. And I think about two types of, kind of accommodations, if you will. You get sort of Title VII with a very narrow accommodation. And then you have conscience clauses that allow medical providers, including for­profit medical providers, not to provide abortions. Now, each of those has a burden on third parties, but I would respectfully suggest they're different. In the case of the employee who's been subject to racial discrimination, even if they can get another job, that racial discrimination is a unique injury to them that you can't remedy unless you tell the employer, don't discriminate on the basis of race. Now, in the context of the conscience clause, if a woman can't get an abortion from her preferred provider, that's surely a significant burden on her. But we don't view that as trumping the conscience clause, because she can get the abortion through another mechanism. Here, as your question rightfully highlights, all we're really talking about is who's going to pay for a subsidy that the government prefers. This is not about access to the contraception. It's about who's going to pay for the government's preferred subsidy. And I think in that context, there are ample alternative ways to address any burdens on third parties. And that goes right to the least ­­",
  "I think ­­",
  "Well, obviously, Justice Ginsburg, I didn't pick these out. I mean, my clients and their religious beliefs identified these as problematic. There are certainly ­­",
  "I think that's a fair point, Justice Ginsburg, and the government's own accommodations, where they offer them to religious groups and religious employers like nonprofit hospitals, also applies to whatever the religious beliefs of that provider are. So if they extend to all 20, then the exemption's applied to all 20. If they only extend to four, then the exemption applies to all four.",
  "There are ample less restrictive alternatives, Your Honor.",
  "And I think they all flow from this fact that this is ultimately about who's going to pay for a substitute ­­",
  "Well, it's ­­ it's ­­ it's funny about this particular mandate because the government's position is this is actually a cost­free mandate; that whatever you pay out in contraceptions, you're going to make up in not having to pay for other coverages. And so one alternative, one less restrictive alternative is what's done in the accommodation for nonprofit employers like hospitals, where basically they tell the insurance carrier or the plan administer that you pick up the cost for this and then essentially it'll be cost neutral from you. But I don't think there's anything sort of sacrosanct, if you will, about having the government pay for its preferred subsidy as a less restrictive alternative. And that's essentially what the government does for those employees who have employers ­­ under 50 employers. If those employees ­­ if the employer doesn't provide healthcare, those employees go on to the exchanges with a subsidy from the government. Now, they can do the same thing for objecting religious employers. They just have chosen not to. If I may reserve my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points in rebuttal. Let me start with the Abortion Conscious Clause. It's ­­ because it tells you something about where Congress has drawn the line and it tells you the consequences of the government's position. Historically, those conscious provisions have applied to all medical providers, including for­profit medical providers. But we learned today that as far as the government's concerned, that's just Congress' judgment. If Congress changes its judgment and says that a for­profit medical provider has to provide an abortion, RFRA doesn't apply. That, with all due respect, cannot be what Congress had in mind when it passed RFRA. They also suggested if a kosher market takes the trouble to incorporate itself, then it has no free exercise claims at all. Now, you can go back and read the Crown kosher case. I took it as common ground, that all nine justices thought that if the Massachusetts law there had forced Crown kosher to be open on Saturday, that that would be a free exercise claim notwithstanding the incorporation. The second point I want to talk about is the least restrictive alternatives. In a colloquy with Justice Scalia, the Solicitor General points out that yeah, well, it's a little bit different from the pre­Smith law because now you have the less restrictive alternatives analysis. That's not a small difference. That's a major difference. And it's really the easiest way to rule against the government in this case. Because you have a unique situation here where their policy is about a government ­­ a subsidy for a government­ preferred health care item, and the question is who pays? The government paying or a third­party insurer paying is a perfectly good least restrictive alternative.",
  "Not necessarily, Justice Sotomayor. It will depend on how you ­­",
  "No, not because they're more ­­",
  "­­ important. But the easiest way to distinguish them is if the government's already provided this accommodation for religious employers.",
  "And with all due respect ­­",
  "I think Lee says that taxes are different and not all exemptions are created equal, because some exemptions undermine the compelling interest. Now, the reason ­­",
  "There is, Justice Alito. Of course, there's also Title X, which provides for contraception coverage, which is another least restrictive alternative. But I do want to get on the table that it is not true, that we have not suggested that the accommodation provided to religious employers, like nonprofit hospitals, that's not something I invented at the podium. If you look at page 58 of our brief, the red brief, we specifically say that one of the least restrictive alternatives would be ­­ the most obvious least restrictive alternative is for the government to pay for their favorite contraception methods themselves. Later in that paragraph, the only full paragraph on the page, we say, \"And indeed, the government has attempted something like that with respect to certain objective employers ­­ objective employees ­­ employers,\" and we cite the Federal Register provision where there is the accommodation provision.",
  "We haven't been offered that accommodation, so we haven't had to decide what kind of objection, if any, we would make to that. But it's important to recognize that as I understand that litigation, the objection is not to the fact that the insurance or the provider pays for the contraception coverage. The whole debate is about how much complicity there has to be from the employer in order to trigger that coverage. And whatever the answer is for Little Sisters of the Poor, presumably you can extend the same thing to my clients and there wouldn't be a problem with that. If I could have just one second more to say that the agency point that Justice Kennedy has pointed to is tremendously important, because Congress spoke, it spoke in RFRA. Here the agency has decided that it's going to accommodate a subset of the persons protected by RFRA. In a choice between what Congress has provided and what the agency has done, the answer is clear. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Aereo's business model is to enable thousands of paying strangers to watch live TV online. Aereo's legal argument is that it can make all of that happen without publicly performing. But Congress passed a statute that squarely forecloses that rather counterintuitive submission. Because although the Internet and the thousands of mini antennas are new, the basic service that Aereo is providing is not materially different from the service provided by the cable company before this Court in 1969.",
  "They're not ­­",
  "They're taking the signals, right.",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor, a couple of things. First of all, I mean, I think if you're ­­ if you're already at that point, you've probably understood that just like a cable company, they're public ­­ they're publicly performing and maybe they qualify as a cable company and maybe they could qualify for the compulsory license that's available to cable companies under Section 111 of the statute.",
  "Well, no. There's lots of conditions on the compulsory license. And I think the first place ­­ the reason that we haven't been debating about whether they're a cable company is because they don't want to be a cable company. They have a footnote in the red brief that makes it clear. They are not a cable company in their view. They don't want to be a cable company. And I think that's because coming with a cable company, it might potentially get you into the compulsory license, but it brings with it a lot of obligations to come with being a cable company ­­",
  "Exactly.",
  "Well, here's the other thing is I think ­­",
  "I don't think they are. That's really ultimately a question under the Federal Communications Act. But here's why, if I could ­­ I think ­­ and Mr. Frederick will certainly speak to this if ­­ if you want him to. But I think the reason they don't want to be a cable company is because I think their basic business model would not allow them to qualify with compulsory license anyways.",
  "Well, I don't think they are ultimately a cable company, and we could debate that question, but it's not the question before you. So maybe I could give you some comfort about why you don't need to decide that question. what I said. And what you've read in their briefs is they, in their supporting amici, have thrown up a series of serious problems not involving them, like the cloud, which the government tells us to ignore, and many others, which make me nervous about taking your preferred route. So that's why I was interested in this question.",
  "But, Justice Breyer, I think it's very important to ­­ to understand that even if they're a cable company, it doesn't make all these problems go away. Because they would be a cable company that by very virtue of what they want to point to, which is their user specific copies, I don't think they would qualify for the compulsory license. I also think the better way to avoid your concerns is to maybe take them on directly. The reason that the record company is not involved in a public performance is it's not involved in any performance at all, but that's different, of course, from an online music store, which not only provides a download of something, but actually performs it and streams it and allows it live. And that is a basic distinction that's not only recognized by the Second Circuit in the ASCAP case, but it's also recognized in the real world by the way these ­­ these different services are structured. If you provide downloads of music, you get a distribution license or a reproduction license. If you provide streaming of music where you also have a contemporaneous live performance, then you also get a public performance license.",
  "Okay. But let me ­­",
  "Okay. Well, let me try to take ­­ those are actually two different examples, and I think the answer to both of them is somewhat different. I think the provider of coaxial cable is ­­ if it's just a simple sale of the cable ­­ is not performing at all. And so I think if you're somebody and all you do is take a piece of hardware and you sell it once and for all to a user, then the user may be performing with the equipment, but you're out of the picture. And that's different from an ongoing service, like a cable company or like Aereo, who still owns all these facilities and they're providing, through wire transmissions, these performances on an ongoing basis.",
  "I think the end user would be doing a performance, but it would be a purely private performance, and I don't think the person that sold them the hardware or really anybody else, if I understand your hypo, would be involved in a performance. And the answer to these hypos ­­ I mean, this isn't something that I'm making up on the fly. I mean, it's right there in the text of the statute.",
  "Well ­­ and, again, I think that goes to what I was about to say, which is let's just not because, you know, we like one better than the other. It's because of the text of the statute Congress wrote. One of the ways that you can public perform. I mean, they start with the classic public performance. Right? A singer in a concert hall. They’ve sold tickets. But then they say, wait, it's also a public performance if you take the singer's performance and you transmit it, and they're thinking over the airways and all sorts of other ways, if you transmit it to the public. And the definition of transmission, then, is to communicate it from one place to another. So there is a geographical aspect, if you will, built right into the statute so that if you sell somebody hardware and all they're doing is transmitting it to themselves at their home, there's not going to be a transmission that's chargeable to the person who sold you the hardware. But if you provide an ongoing service from a remote ­­",
  "It ­­ it becomes a public performance on behalf of the sender, but it still would be a private performance on behalf of the receiver. And that's one thing that's really important to get in mind, is that in this statute as to the public performance right, there's nothing particularly anomalous about a single transmission that from the sender's perspective is a public performance, but from the recipient's perspective only allows for a private performance. If you think about the classic cable context, which is what Congress was trying to address in 1976 with the Transmit Clause, you have the cable company and they're taking a performance off of the airways and they're transmitting it to all the end­users. Now, the cable company is clearly performing to the public, but that same transmission is allowing each end­user to turn on their television set and to make a performance proper, which is a private performance.",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "I don't know all the details of that particular piece of equipment. I'm not sure whether they're ­­ they're paying a license or not. But if there was really a transfer and there's nobody else providing a transmission, I don't think that just operating the hardware in the privacy of your own home is going to result in anything but a private performance.",
  "Sure. Now, there's, I think, it's a slightly different situation. Here, I think the ultimate statutory text that allows you to differentiate a cloud locker storage from something like what Aereo does is a language to the public. And I do think that in all sorts of places, including the real world, there's a fundamental difference between a service that allows ­­ that provides new content to all sorts of end­users, essentially any paying stranger, and a service that provides a locker, a storage service. And I think if you want a real world analogy off of the Internet, I think it's the basic decision ­­ the difference between a car dealer and a valet parking service. I mean, if you looked at it from 30,000 feet, you might think, hey, both of these things provide cars to the public. But if you looked at it more closely, you'd understand, well, if I show up at the car dealership without a car, I'm going to be able to get a car. If I show up at the valet parking service and I don't own a car, it's not going to end well for me. And so ­­",
  "Well, I was just going to ­­ so I think there is a very real way in which you would say, you know, at the end of the day, the car dealer's providing cars to the public, the valet parking service is not. It's providing a parking service.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, that's not an implausible way to look at this. That's exactly the way that this Court looked at it in Fortnightly decision. But Congress in 1976 decided it was going to look at it differently, and it said that if you are providing a service, even if you are providing a service that one could reconceptualize as just renting out antennas that somebody could put on their own house, the person that provides that service on an ongoing basis and in the process exploits the copyrighted works of others is engaged in a public performance. That is clearly what they were trying to do in the 1976 Act by adding the Transmit Clause.",
  "I think the potential difference, and it's both the CloudLocker storage and this example, I don't think this Court has to decide it today. I think it can just be confident they are different. Here is the ­­",
  "Okay. But, Justice Kennedy, I would like to answer both your questions by assuming that the result in CableVision is right, but I don't have to necessarily buy the reasoning, because I think the reasoning of CableVision is profoundly wrong, so let me circle back to that. But the reason there's a fundamental difference between the RS DVR at issue in CableVision and what Aereo provides is, as Justice Alito alluded to, the fact that there's a license in the CableVision context to get the initial performance to the public. And so then I think appropriately the focus in the CableVision context becomes just the playback feature and just the time­shifting that's enabled by that. And in that context, if you focus only on that, then the RS DVR looks a lot like a locker service where you have to come in with the content before you can get content out and you only get back the same content. And here is what really I think Aereo is like. Aereo is like if CableVision, having won in the Second Circuit, decides: Whew, we won, so guess what? Going forward, we're going to dispense with all these licenses, and we are just going to try to tell people we are just an RS DVR, that's all we are, and never mind that we don't have any licensed ability to get the broadcast in the first instance, and we're going to provide it to individual users, and it's all going to be because they push buttons and not because we push buttons. If that were the hypothetical, I don't know how that wouldn't be the clearest violation of the 1976 Act.",
  "Here is the way to get out of it, Justice Breyer. Ultimately the words you're going to have to interpret are \"to the public.\" Now I think ­­",
  "And if all they can do is, just like the valet car parking service, is get back what they put up there, I think you could easily say that that is not to the public. And that is not just me coming up with a clever distinction. That's the distinction that's really been drawn in the real world, because not all cloud computing is created equal, and there are some cloud computing services that use cloud computing technology to get new content to people that don't have it, and they get licenses. And there is other cloud computing that just has locker services and they don't think they need a license, and so I'm not saying that you have to bless what the market has done, but I think it's a profound indication ­­",
  "That, Justice Kagan, is precisely why I'm asking you not to decide the cloud computing question once and for all today, because not all cloud computing is created equal. The details of it might matter. If I can just take my valet parking service one more time. If the valet parking service starts renting them out and sort of has a little Zipcar service on the side and says, hey, while we have your car, if somebody else needs a car, we're going to rent it out to them, I think that's different from the pure valet parking service. If I could reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points in rebuttal: First, I just have to correct a fundamental difference. Mr. Frederick says, as he did in his red brief, that if you only ­­ if you are a cable company and you only retransmit locally, you don't have to pay a royalty. That is just wrong, as we point out in the reply brief. There is a minimum royalty that every cable company pays whether or not they transmit distance signals. So that is just wrong. Second, this is not a case, as Mr. Frederick would like to say, where the user pushes a button, and then after that point, Aereo is just a hapless bystander. And if you want insight into what actually happens behind the scenes, to use the phrase the District Court used, look at pages 64A to 67A of the petition appendix. Because Judge Nathan explains all of the things that Aereo does after the consumer presses the button and before it comes back to them on their home screen. They are not just a passive bystander. Also, this whole notion of what is volitional. Maybe in the reproduction concept, in context, just pushing a button and there is only one person who reproduces, but the concept of what is the requisite volitional conduct is answered by the Transmit Clause. Congress specifically looked at this and said there are going to be lots of situations where the sender, usually the cable company or Aereo, sends a transmission to the user, and the sender of that transmission, if it allows a contemporaneous performance, unlike the record company, they are a transmitter.",
  "Your consequences ­­",
  "The consequences really gets back to the Chief Justice's question, which is, if they actually provide something that is a net benefit technologically, there's no reason people won't license them content. But on the other hand, if all they have is a gimmick, then they probably will go out of business and nobody should cry a tear over that.",
  "It's not a problem that should worry you because, first of all, if they need a compulsory license, maybe Congress can revisit it as it has in technologically specific ways for cable and satellite, but there is other ways to get content. They can approach HBO ­­",
  "I did, Your Honor, and one of them really gets to this HBO point, which is they want to say that this whole case is about reproduction and there's no public performance going on at all. And to understand how crazy that is, with all due respect, if they approach HBO and say, we would like to carry your content and provide it as a premium service, they would be telling HBO, by the way, we don't need a public performance license. All we need is a reproduction license because we don't involve ourselves in any public performance at all, and that's why at the end of the day their argument simply blinks reality. They provide thousands of paying strangers with public performances over the TV, but they don't publicly perform at all. It's like magic. Thank you, Your Honors.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I don't usually start in this Court by telling you who I represent, but I think I better do it here, which is I represent not just EPSA, which is a group of power generators, but a number of other ­­ other organizations. So the vast majority of the people that I represent are load­serving entities who are not exclusively on the supply side. They're actually the regulated public utilities that actually could provide demand response in a wholesale, meaningful level by working, as they have since long before FERC got in this business, to work with retail customers and their State regulators to provide for reduced retail demand at peak time. So that's who I represent. Now what I'd like to start, beyond telling you who I represent, is with the notion of what FERC was trying to do here, which was to reduce retail demand by providing payments to retail customers on an otherwise wholesale market in an effort to change the effective price for retail sales. Now, that sure sounds like something that belongs to the States. So the answer you hear ­­",
  "­­ from the general ­­",
  "I don't think it's just a characterization battle ultimately. But even if you want to stipulate that they are trying to reduce retail demand for the best of wholesale reasons, it's still ­­",
  "What? I'm sorry?",
  "That's not correct, Justice Sotomayor. It's crystal clear, and I don't think the Solicitor General will contradict me in his rebuttal, that what FERC does uniquely in this context is invite retail customers, directly large retail customers ­­",
  "­­ directly on the wholesale exchange.",
  "And I certainly wouldn't be here suggesting that anything that happens in the wholesale market that affects retail price is somehow verboten to FERC. But I am here to say that when you regulate wholesale prices, essentially as Justice Scalia suggested, through the retail market, that that crosses a very important boundary in the Federal Power Act. And with all due respect to your question, your approach to this would make perfect sense if FERC were the only regulator on this scene, but ­­",
  "But ­­ but ­­",
  "The difference here is that the customers they're targeting are retail customers, and the very fact ­­ and this is what I ­­ where I really wanted to go, which is, I think the Solicitor General goes a long way to conceding that this really is going at retail ­­ the retail market and the retail level of demand matters, and he will concede that we're changing ­­ they're changing the effective price of retail electricity. The only ­­ the saving grace for them is, ah, but we're limiting ourselves to the wholesale market, and we're the wholesale regulator. So why shouldn't we do it? Here's the problem: These retail customers don't belong on the wholesale market. Whether you think they were lured in or you think they walked in the door, it doesn't matter. They are on a market where they don't belong. The fact that they are regulating in this context and this context alone, retail customers directly, is a profound signal that they've overstepped their jurisdictional bounds. And I think the way you can understand why the fact that they're on the wholesale market is not a complete answer is to consider the following scenario, which doesn't seem all that farfetched, which is to say a large retail consumer of electricity, let's call it Wal­Mart, decides, you know what, I like the prices on the wholesale market better, and I buy more electricity than a lot of load­serving entities in small jurisdictions. So I'm going to walk on to the wholesale market run by an ITO or an ITO, and I'm going to buy electricity for my own consumption at a better price. If they did that, I don't think there is any question that that would be a retail sale that could only be regulated by the States. And if that actually happened, then the RTOs and ISOs would have to make a choice. They would either open themselves up to regulation simultaneously by FERC and the States for that retail transaction, or they would do what I think they probably would do, which is, one regulator is plenty. We're just going to say that Wal­Mart can't come on to our market and buy retail gas directly from a generator. And that's the world we live in. Wal­Mart can't walk on that market and buy ­­",
  "Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure, ultimately, that my burden is to show that this is horrible as opposed to ultra vires. But let me try to explain to you why concurrent jurisdiction is an anomaly in the context of the Federal Power Act. I mean, this Court, on numerous occasions, has said that although you ­­ sometimes it's hard to divide the lines. Once you do, generally the Federal government operates in its exclusive sphere of the wholesale market, and the States regulate in ­­ exclusively in the retail market.",
  "But here's the problem ­­ yeah, normally they stay away from each other and each other's customers. Another thing that is a complete anomaly that FERC has created here that, as far as I'm aware, exists nowhere else in the energy world, is you actually have the Federal government and the Federal regulators and the State regulators bidding against each other for the same customers to reduce their same retail demand. And the other side has made a very big deal that none of the States raised a jurisdictional objection before FERC itself. But there were a number of States, Ohio, Illinois, and all of the States that are participants in the MISO, one of the ISOs. And what they told FERC is, by all means, do not set the compensation level at LMP, because that's too high. And by setting it so high, what you are going to do is you're going to crowd out our own efforts at dealing with demand response. Because we love demand response. We want demand response. But we don't want to pay twice as much as the market really should pay for demand response. And if you're out there offering our same retail customers the ability to get demand response paid at huge LMP levels, then we're going to be crowded out. Now, the only response that FERC can offer to that is, well, then just opt­out, come on, you know. First of all, that's the third anomaly here, because there's no other area of regulatory authority where FERC allows States to opt­out. And if you think about what they're opting out and compare it to their legal theory, it doesn't work. I mean, since when is FERC all of a sudden enthusiastic about State experimentations with practices that directly affect wholesale rates? In every other context where they actually have jurisdiction, wholesale rates, transmission, not only would they not allow State opt­outs, but they would say it's going to lead to discrimination in a way that would be unjust and unreasonable. So the opt­out option here, though, doesn't work for another reason, which is it's worse for the States that most want to provide for demand response. Because what they're being told is, all right, you have a subset of your customers who are actually interested in demand response. And if you want to opt­out, what you have to tell your customers who are interested in demand response is we're actually going to pass a regulation that restricts you, and you can't go into the Federal market and get a better rate ­­",
  "­­ you're going to have to take a lousier rate.",
  "Well, Your Honor, there is a lot in that question, but let me just respond ­­",
  "Well, with all due respect, a couple of them aren't that great because ­­",
  "­­ because you seem to suggest that if you can't do this, well, then FERC can't essentially tell generation resources that we don't want any more coal generation; we only want natural gas. And, of course, they can't do that because the Federal Power Act reserved the plenary authority of regeneration to the States. You also suggested if they can't do that, then they can't allow Wal­Mart to helpfully walk into the wholesale market and buy at retail.",
  "Well, here ­­ here's a way of ­­ of trying to harmonize that, which is I think that the line that the Federal Power Act divides ­­ draws is between retail sales and wholesale sales. And I believe that this is impermissibly on the retail side of the line. I think my friends on the other side ultimately think that the difference isn't between retail and wholesale but is between sales and nonsales, because they appear to concede my Wal­Mart example in the retail world. Which is to say, on page 39 of the SG's brief, I think they pretty much concede that Wal­Mart cannot walk on to a wholesale market and purchase gas at retail without coming into the scope of the State regulators. I think they also concede that, if the government's interest here was not to suppress retail demand but to increase it, they thought, you know, if we could just sort of boost retail demand a little bit, we'd get a whole bunch of these new green resources online and it would actually make, you know, everything better. So we want to increase retail demand. So here's what we're going to do: We're going to have either directly or through the wholesale operators ­­ we're going to pay a bonus to people who increase their retail purchases. That, I believe, my friends on the other side say, well, no FERC couldn't do that because that would affect a fully­consummated sale. So their position seems to be although we can pay ­­ we can't pay incentive payments to increase retail demand, we can pay incentive payments to reduce retail demand. Two observations about that: One is, why in the world would that make sense? I mean, why in the world would ­­ would Congress have divided the authority here in a way that allows the Federal government to suppress retail demand but not increase retail demand? The second thing that I want to say about that anomaly, though, is the line between sales and nonsales can't be the right line because it ­­ if it is, then not only can they do what Justice Scalia suggested, which is have FERC pay a direct bounty not to purchase. And I was actually quite surprised by the Solicitor General's answer to that. And he ­­ and he didn't fully complete the answer. He said that would be a harder case, but he didn't ultimately say how that would be answered. I think he has to say that, if FERC sort of cut out the wholesale operators and just said, we got a new appropriation, and every retail customer that reduces their retail consumption gets a $200 check from FERC, that has to be consistent with their position that FERC can do it because it doesn't interfere with a fully consummated sale. But we're still ­­ if they're right, then what FERC can do tomorrow is solve this problem much more directly. They can say, retail customers, you cannot buy at peak times. You simply can't. We're not going to allow it. Because that's going to reduce the ­­ the ­­ the wholesale demand. It's going to avoid brownouts. It's going to take all the pressure off our grid. So that's it. No more purchases on August 4th.",
  "They're not regulating the rate of sales. So, you know, never mind. Or ­­ or ­­ or the rate of sales is ­­ is either zero or infinity because you can't do it. But any way you think about it, that has to be the implication of their theory that there is a categorical difference between ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "And what is unreasonable is that, before you get to a Chevron question, certainly before you get to an arbitrary and capricious question, you have to have jurisdiction for FERC to do this. And the basic division of authority in 201(b) of the Federal Power Act is that the Federal government gets sales for resales and the States get all other sales. And I think it's important to recognize that you really have to wrestle upfront with the 201(b) question because the other side loves to talk about 205 and 206 in the practices affecting language. But the problem with that is that 201(b) specifically says that the provisions of this subchapter, which include 205 and 206, shall apply to sales for wholesales and shall not apply to all other sales. So you don't get to 205 and 206 if what is being regulated front and center is a retail sale of electricity.",
  "I ­­ I ­­ I will definitely do that, Your Honor. I don't know if you had a question that goes to jurisdiction that you want to talk ­­ I mean ­­",
  "No, that's not right. My position is that FERC can't do anything with demand response with retail customers. They can do demand response, true wholesale demand response, which they were actually doing before they went down this route and around, you know, the ­­ the two ­­ early 2000s. And the way that wholesale demand response works is the way you sort of naturally think it would work, which is through a participant in the wholesale market, namely through the load­serving entities who are mostly my clients. Because the way you can sort of do this is you work cooperatively with the States and the LSEs, and you encourage them, as Congress suggested in 1252(e) of the ­­ of the National Policy Act or the Energy Policy Act. You encourage them to do all sorts of things to reduce their demand, and then there's just less demand bid in to the auction in the first place. And so supply meets demand at a much lower level. Just for completeness sake, you can also have wholesale participants participate in a demand/response program in the forward­capacity markets, where, again, it would be the LSEs. And what they would do is say, we're going to ­­ we're going to ­­ three years hence, we're going to reduce our compensation ­­ or our ­­ our consumption by this level, and we're going to do it on the local level. And just to further complete that thought, you know, it's ­­ it's nice to talk that FERC has been doing this since 2000, but the States have been doing this long before that, at least since the 1980s. And there is a brief for other respondents that I don't represent, the Midwest load­serving entities. And it's worth a ­­ it's a short brief, but it's worth a quick read because what they say is, look, we've been doing this at the State level since 1984. We're a local utility. We work with our local regulator. Because we have plenary authority over the retail market, we can deal with demand response in all sorts of ways that FERC could never imagine. And we can do things like basically go in and get a local customer to agree with us to change the way ­­ their thermostat. We can go in, send somebody in, put different hardware in there, and then, based on a reduction in their retail rates, we can get them to agree that basically, on a hot day in the summer, we get to take over your thermostat. And we directly impose demand response through that. And that's the kind of thing that States have been doing since the '80s. And that's the kind of things that are going to be crowded out by this one­size­fits­all rule with the high LMP compensation recipe.",
  "Right.",
  "I ­­ there is not a ­­ a regulatory gap. I don't think FERC can do anything. And I would answer it by reference to my Wal­Mart hypo going in to buy. If Wal­Mart went in to buy ­­ so if a retail customer on the buy side sort of walks into a wholesale market ­­ it's not that lightning strikes and they can't do it. It's that it's a retail transaction. So if anybody can regulate it, it's the States. So there's not a regulatory gap. In theory, a State could regulate the transaction even though it takes place on an otherwise wholesale market. I think as a practical matter ­­ I don't want to ­­ as a practical matter, I don't think the ISOs and the RTOs want to be regulated by both FERC and the States. So I think what they would do is, ah, if the price of having a retail customer on our otherwise wholesale market is we get State regulation on top of Federal regulation, then we're going to bar the door to the retail customer.",
  "I ­­ I ­­ I would be delighted to. If I could say one last thing about jurisdiction, which is simply I ­­ I do think, though, that the premise of the other side's argument is that the sky will fall if you don't have this precise type of retail customer on wholesale market demand response. And there, I think, it's worth taking a look at the Southern company's brief, because they operate in a part of the country that doesn't have an RTO or an ISO.",
  "But the problem with that way of looking it, Justice Kagan, with all due respect, is I think it looks only at 1252(f), which is the one reference to what FERC's supposed to do, and it ignores 1252(e) where Congress recognized that the States are the primary actors here. And the point I was making about the Southern company brief is operating in an area without ISOs, without RTOs, so without FERC, they actually have a greater level of demand response than other parts of the country that have the Federal rule. So to bring us to the arbitrary and capriciousness question, I think, Justice Kennedy, the way I think about it is that we have both procedural objections and substantive objections. The procedural objections are essentially that there are all sorts of objections to using LMP as the price to provide compensation. That wasn't just my clients. That was also the States that I alluded to who were worried that this high level of compensation would crowd out their effort. It was a particularly poignant comment from the ­­ the ­­ some of the ITOs and RTOs who design these ­­ run these wholesale markets. And the ones that I thought were most persuasive in some respects was the operators of the MISO, the midwestern one, because at FERC's direction, they basically spent two years trying to come up with ­­ get all the stakeholders in a room and come up with a formulation ­­ a compensation formula that worked. And what they came up with was essentially LMP minus G. And after having spent two years with all the stakeholders coming up with LMP minus G, they were then told by the Federal government at a late breaking hour that there was a one­size­fits­all solution, and it was LMP.",
  "Well, I think ­­",
  "Surely it has. But the reason I started with the procedural way of coming at this is the D.C. Circuit has lots of arbitrary and capricious cases, and they are quite comfortable in saying that, in circumstances like this, you didn't respond adequately to the comments that were put before you.",
  "Well, there is certainly ­­",
  "Well, I can give you an example, Justice Sotomayor, if it will help, which is that Chairman Mueller in his dissent ­­ Commissioner Mueller in his dissent actually used a hypothetical that is very similar to the hypothetical discussed in our brief and the SG's brief about a factory and how if ­­ if you have full LMP, a factory will essentially reduce its production at time periods where it's economically inefficient for them to do so.",
  "They ­­ they had no ­­",
  "Well, the way I read the ­­ the way I read the record, Your Honor, is that there was no response to that hypothetical, just as there was no response in the SG's ­­",
  "I'm not even sure they ­­ they said that much, but I don't think they really grappled with it. And to whatever extent they ­­",
  "Sure. Well, I would ­­ I would ­­ I would encourage you to look at the FTC comments, the Joint Appendix page 281, the comments of the States. I mean, I would think that when you have another coordinate part of the federal government come in and say, you are picking the wrong compensation level and it will be affirmatively inefficient and will crowd out other uses for demand response, that you'd at least owe them something more of an explanation than grouping them in a footnote with every other commentator you got and say, we're not persuaded by that. There is, though, I think ­­ and I would ­­ actually, you know, I ­­ I didn't think I would come up here talking about net benefits test, but I actually would ­­",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "And ­­ and ­­ and what I would say beyond that about the net benefits test is here's another way in which the ­­ the compensation formula is what I would call substantively arbitrary and capricious. The whole formula is built on the idea that there is an ­­ an equivalence between less demand and more actual supply of energy. But of course, when you get to the nitty­gritty of it, it turns out that's not true, because the great thing about actual supply of energy is that other wholesale ­­ real wholesale customers buy it, and then the market clears naturally. But when you start getting a third­party in there, a retail customer who really doesn't belong there and start saying, we're going to pay you money, but that money doesn't actually result in load that ­­ a load­serving entity pays for, that creates a deficit in the wholesale account.",
  "Yes. And yet, it's ­­ the market really can't take care of it because the market's designed to simply get a bunch of wholesale sellers and a bunch of wholesale buyers together, and the price of the sales and the price of the purchases equal each other out, and everybody goes home happy. But when you invite retail customers on and say, guess what, we're going to pay you not to buy, that creates a market imbalance. The FERC euphemistically refers to this is the billing unit effect. And then they have to solve that by making adjustments to the market clearing price. And then to make sure they don't go too far down, they apply the net benefits test, which is not only mind­bogglingly complex, but FERC itself recognizes that it's imperfect. The last thing I want to say, though, about sort of the substantive unreasonableness about this is there is a more fundamental problem here, and it's ­­ I think the economist's brief on our side gets at this very well, which is at the end of the day, if FERC gets to do this on the wholesale markets, what is being purchased is not energy, actual energy that's been bought and then sold. What is being sold is an option to buy electricity at a subsidized retail rate. And in any other market ­­ I mean, think of a stock where I have an option to buy it at 20 and the market price is 40. Lots and lots of people are going to offer me 20, 19 for that option because I have a valuable right to buy something at a below­market price. But nobody is going to offer me 40 for the option to buy at 20 just because the market price is at 40. But that is exactly what FERC has done by setting the compensation rate at LMP. And they made mincemeat out of poor Dr. Kahn, because what Dr. Kahn really says is that the market signal that the customer ought to get is LMP. But the market signal they get is LMP if it accounts for avoided costs. If you take the avoided costs out of the question, then you get LMP plus the retail costs. And of course, another irony here is the distortion is greatest in those markets where the States have done exactly what FERC would like, which is adopt retail price ­­ real time pricing, because then the retail price is LMP. And so what is the compensation rate for demand response providers? It's twice LMP.",
  "Please read ­­ please read Dr. Hogan as well, because I really do think he has the better of this argument. Now, you would say, generally, well, couple of expert economists, just let FERC decide. But I do think in this case they have strayed beyond the bounds of arbitrary and capriciousness, Justice Kennedy.",
  "Yes. That ­­ that is the principal reason. But I ­­ but I don't want to suggest that it's just purely procedural because I don't think these are things they can fix. And of course, we hope that you don't even get to that question because you find they don't have jurisdiction. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The States entered the Union saddled with substantial war debts. As a result, critics of the Constitution were quick to point out any possibility that the States could be haled into court by individual citizens without their consent in order to secure potentially bankrupting judgments. When this Court opened up the possibility of just such a judgment by allowing Chisholm, a South Carolina citizen, to sue the sovereign State of Georgia in this Court, the nation quickly and emphatically reacted with the Eleventh Amendment that eliminated the possibility of such a suit even in this most neutral of Federal forums. Regardless of all that, Respondent's position is that, if Chisolm has turned around and sued Georgia in South Carolina State court, and South Carolina in its unreviewable discretion decided to exercise jurisdiction over the sovereign State of Georgia ­­",

So if South Carolina had ­­",

  "Well, that's the second point I was going to make, Justice Kennedy, which is it's an odd thing to think that the framers, who had just experienced the Articles of Confederation where they had unsatisfied judgments and the potential that, if the State of New York went after the State of Georgia because Georgia hadn't complied with the requisition for funds, that there would be civil war. The idea that the way they would want sovereign immunity, which no one doubted exists, enforced was that kind of race to the bottom. As opposed to ­­",
  "Well, there is that. It's something that's implicit in the Constitution. And I think ­­",
  "Absolutely. And I think that's the exact opposite of what the framers were trying to do. They weren't trying to adopt a union where there would be signs on State borders that say, if you come in here, you thereby waive any sovereign immunity and we will hale you into court and allow our citizens to do it. Instead, they were adopting a union where the States came in with substantial war debts and their sovereign immunity. And there is no way they would have sacrificed their sovereign immunity, which was the key protection for those war debts not being used against them to bankrupt them.",
  "Well, their ­­",
  "Two points, Justice Sotomayor. First of all, let's take a Nevada resident, and let's say California comes in. The Nevada resident can certainly sue the State of California in California court if there's a waiver of sovereign immunity. And the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV would protect the Nevada citizen from California saying, well, we're going to waive our sovereign immunity as to California citizens but not Nevada residents. So that's one protection that they have. The other point is what we're really talking about is, as to the starting point, is the default rule. Do you start with sovereign immunity? It's always possible ­­",

  "Well, for ­­",

  "Because it would be very burdensome to do that. And I think, with all due respect, they think there already was an agreement among the States through their people that solved this problem. And that's the Constitution. It preserved the sovereign immunity they would have. If I could ­­",
  "Two things ­­",
  "Two things principally, Your Honor. First is, I don't think they actually gave anything up. What my friend on the other side suggests they gave up is the right of one sovereign court system to hale another sovereign into that court system. And that is a right that didn't exist at the founding.",
  "You say \"comity.\" I would say, as a starting point, law of nations. But absolutely, it is true that whenever you're talking about sovereign immunity in any court other than the sovereign's own, you are talking about sovereign immunity as of comity.",
  "So ­­",
  "Upon the framing of the Constitution, just as it did with respect to every other sovereign immunity principle. The principle that emerges from this Court's cases is that if the ­­ the States had preexisting sovereign immunity from a suit and they did not sacrifice it in the plan of convention, then they continue to enjoy it as a matter of constitutional right.",
  "But two points are important, Justice Ginsburg. First of all, although the law of nations as the framing between independent nations was a matter of comity, that didn't mean that there weren't certain principles that were so well established that any nation that didn't respect them would be committing an act of war. And first on that list would be the idea that you could not have an in personam suit against a foreign sovereign. It was unheard of. And my friend doesn't disagree with that. I think his response to the possibility ­­",
  "Right, Justice Ginsburg, and I don't think that you want to resolve this case on the law of nations' immunity principles, either in 1789 or today. But if you were to do that, we would still win, because despite the relative laxity of waivers of sovereign immunity in the current age, you still don't have an in personam suit for something that's of course sovereign function, like tax collection. Even to this day, we couldn't sue France over the exact same situation today. But I don't think the way that this Court's cases apply the law of nations is the right way of thinking about this. Rather, the right way to think about it is that sovereign immunity at the framing becomes a constitutional principle. And I think ­­",
  "Well, I ­­ I think the FTB is asking you ­­ which is an arm of California ­­ is asking you to overrule Hall. So I think it is fair to say that there is some buyer's remorse on the principle of Nevada against Hall by the sovereign State of California. But we're not estopped from making ­­",
  "They didn't, but I think that's because they felt that an arm of State was ­­",
  "­­ already here, so I think, you know, that ­­ that that explains that. But I want to make one point very clear, which is this Court has a whole host of State sovereign immunity cases dealing with the Federal courts. Every one of those cases with the ­­ every one of the Federal court cases and indeed every State sovereign immunity case, with the exception of ­­ of ­­ of Alden against Maine is a case that's applying sovereign immunity as of comity. Because the new Federal court system is a foreign court system. The sovereigns did not have sovereign immunity as of right in any distinct court system of a superior sovereign or of an independent nation. So when this Court says, well, the States had sovereign immunity and they didn't sacrifice it in the Constitution, they're not talking in those cases about sovereign immunity as of right; they're talking about sovereign immunity as of comity. So, too, in the tribal immunity cases.",
  "Everybody on this Court ­­",
  "Oh, absolutely, and that's because Alden is the only case that involves sovereign immunity in the State sovereign immunity context. There are also Federal sovereign immunity cases, but in the State sovereign immunity context, Alden is the only one that's dealing with sovereign immunity in the sovereign's own court system. Every other one deals with sovereign immunity in a different court system, either the Federal court system or the tribal court system. That's ­­",
  "Well, I think that's because ­­ I assume that comes from the part of Alden where Alden is dealing with Hall as a given, and it's saying that the result in Alden does not require the overruling of Hall. I would take that. That's fine. That's true, they are different issues. I do think they create one anomaly after another. I mean, Chisholm can't sue Georgia in a perfectly neutral Federal court; Chisholm can't sue Georgia in Georgia court; but Chisholm can sue Georgia in the least neutral court available, the State of South Carolina. That doesn't make any sense. There is also the anomaly that apparently, Alden's mistake was suing Maine in Maine court. If Alden would have sued Maine in New Hampshire court, probably for Federal law or maybe for State law, then that suit could have gone forward. It is also anomalous that the tribes apparently have greater immunity than the States, even though they're inferior sovereigns, because you apply these same principles to recognize tribal sovereign immunity. And the dissenters in Footnote 1 of those cases, even they recognize, well, States are different because they are a superior sovereign.",
  "Well, I don't think so, Justice Breyer. Let me make two points, one of which may not be particularly responsive to you, which is to say that I think all of this Court's post­Hall decisions, some of which you have enjoined, actually suggest that the burden's not on me to show where in the Constitution it was taken away, but that the burden is on my friend to show where the Constitution specifically took away the States' sovereign immunity, where they surrendered it. But I still think, Justice Breyer, I'm not ­­ I'm not trying to not get your vote, because I think even if the burden is on me to show where the Constitution took it away, I think I can. I think it's implicit, but it is implicit in three places: Article III, the Eleventh Amendment, and all the provisions that took the diplomatic and war tools away from the States.",
  "I think, Justice Breyer ­­",
  "­­ and I'm going to give you my best answer on that, which is ultimately loop back to Hall. So my best answer on that is the way to think about this is Nevada has said, we're going to apply Nevada law, not California law, and Hyatt I says that they can do that. But then they ­­ when they start to apply Nevada's law of sovereign immunity, they get to the point where there's a 50,000 damage cap and they say ­­ unbelievably in my view ­­ but they say, oh, well, this statute only applies to Nevada's government agencies. And you're not a Nevada government agency, so you don't get the benefit of it.",
  "Now, if ­­ rather, if Nevada did the exact same thing to a citizen of California in a damage cap that applied not to sovereigns but to citizens, I read my friend on page 52 of his brief to say that that would violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, that you couldn't just say, well, no, that's a benefit only for Nevada residents. So his position ultimately is the sovereign is worse off than the citizen, which can't be right. Now, I think there are two ways to respond to that complete anomaly. One is to say that, although maybe it's not right there in the text of it, that the principles of Article IV's Full Faith and Credit Clause provide the same principle, the same protection that the Privileges and Immunities Clause applies to a citizen. But I think ultimately the better way to look at it is to say the reason the framers put the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV of the unamended Constitution is they realized States could be sued in other States' courts. So there was a vulnerability they needed to address. They simultaneously implicitly recognized that there was no way on earth that a sovereign could be sued in another State's court because of age­old sovereign immunity principles. So they didn't feel they needed to give express protection to the sovereign the way they did to the citizen.",
  "Not ­­ not of its own force. I mean, I think one way of thinking about this is I don't think ­­",
  "Well, they ­­ they might be able to agree to that mutually as a waiver of their sovereign ­­",
  "Right.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right. I think that's a power they yielded to the Federal government in the plan ­­",
  "No. No, I don't think it is strange, Your Honor. But, I mean, I think coming at it from a different angle ­­ and maybe you get to a different place. I don't know. But I think it would be plain as day that, the day after the plan of the Convention passes, the State of South Carolina can't entertain a suit against His Majesty, the King of England, in their ­­ in ­­ in South Carolina court because of law of nation principles first or the fact that they yielded the opportunity to do that to the Federal government. I think in the same way, the States yielded their ability to make determinations, make treaties with foreign governments over foreign sovereign immunity. They yielded that to the Federal government. But vis­à­vis each other, what they preserved as a constitutional matter is an immunity from being haled into each other's courts.",
  "Justice Kagan, I think there's two reasons that it is glaringly obvious that the States would have made exactly the choice I'm suggesting. One is they weren't giving up anything they actually thought existed. They did not think, because the law of nations categorically forbid it, that they had the power to assert in personam jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign. They absolutely ­­ yes, it was law of nations that laid down that principle.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, two points about that. First of all, here is what Chief Justice Marshall says about the amenability of the sovereign to sue. He says, quote, \"One sovereign being in no respect amenable to another.\" He lays it down that ­­ as the bedrock principle of international law. Now, it is true that, when you're talking about international law, every nation has the raw power to disregard international law. So the United States ­­",
  "I ­­ I ­­ I think if you read the whole opinion, that's exactly what he's saying. You would have had to have ­­ I mean, think about it. Schooner Exchange arises in 1812. We're already at war with Britain. So he did have ­­ the Federal courts would have the raw power to exercise jurisdiction over a ship of France, but there's a very good reason they didn't do it: Because they recognized that asserting that kind of authority would be equivalent to an act of war. And that's why I think it's so obvious that the ­­ that the States did give this up. Because the authority to bring in a foreign sovereign into your court was unthinkable to that generation as a flat violation of the law of nations. And if they did it, it would be committing an act of war. And that's exactly like the other things that they gave up. The second reason I think it's glaringly obvious, though, is that, on the one hand they give up something that's inchoate and a violation of the law of nations. Sovereign immunity, on the other hand, is the single most important issue they're dealing with because of those war debts. And that's why they're not going to ­­ if they had to make a ­­ a choice, a conscious choice, they would gladly give up some inchoate right they've never exercised in exchange for preserving themselves from the possibility of an individual citizen suing them and procuring a possibly bankrupting judgment. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Three basic points in rebuttal. First of all, my friend on the other side quite rightly points out that the States, burdened with their war debts, were very, very concerned that they would be haled in front of the new Federal courts, so they sought an assurance. And the clearest place to see the assurance that they got is Federalist No. 81, where Alexander Hamilton makes clear that there's nothing to worry about here because they have sovereign immunity. And they have sovereign immunity as an inherent aspect of their sovereignty. And that assurance then becomes the postulate that this Court applies in Hans against Louisiana, and applies in Monaco against Mississippi, and all of these other cases where the immunity that's provided by the Constitution is actually greater than the text of the Eleventh Amendment. The assurance and the postulate are one and the same. Now, it may be that in the world of international relations, we've wandered away from the Hamilton Federalist No. 81 understanding. But I don't think that matters. If it's constitutionalized, as it is in every other context, then the understanding in 1789 is what controls. Now, as to the all­important point of this balance that you referred to, Justice Kagan, I do want to be as emphatic as I can that the States were not giving up anything they thought they possessed. And I came upon a quote from Edmund Pendleton. It explained ­­ talking about sovereignty. And he said the following in 1792 ­­ and if you want to find this, this is Volume 5 of the Documentary History of the Supreme Court. He said: \"I have been taught by all writers on the subject that there is no earthly tribunal before whom sovereign and independent nations can be called and compelled to do justice.\" Now, I think that's pretty emphatic, and I think pretty emphatically suggests that on the one hand, they weren't giving up anything that they could really exercise. On the other hand, they were desperately afraid of these war debts, and they were desperately ­­ wanted to ensure that they would preserve their sovereign immunity. I don't think the balance is even close. And what I think is so problematic about Respondent's position is that he seems to say at the precise moment that the States were going to give up all of the tools that nations used to make comity a reality, that they unilaterally disarmed. They gave up all those tools, and all they got was sovereign immunity as of comity, and which my friend's position makes clear, is as voluntary as can be and is just a matter of grace. There's nothing that supports it.",
  "So I just wanted to finish with some anomalies here because we've talked about a couple of them. We've talked about this idea that the Privileges and Immunities Clause prevent Nevada from doing this to a citizen. Here's another anomaly. Now, my friend suggested briefly as a parenthetical that there's nothing that these ­­ these poor Nevada citizens are going to be able to do. One thing they can do is go to California and sue consistent with California's waiver of sovereign immunity. As we point out in the reply brief, there are some remedies there. But the other thing they can do, as Justice Kennedy pointed out for the Court in Alden, is there is still the possibility of an individual capacity suit against one of the California officers. Now, here's something anomalous: If you sued the California officer, who's presumably a California resident, they would have the protection of removal to Federal court, so they'd at least be given a neutral Federal forum. When my client tried to remove here, they were confronted with Mr. Hyatt's quite correct objection that the Eleventh Amendment prevented removal to Federal court. But, my goodness. You have now converted the Eleventh Amendment, clearly designed to enhance the sovereignty into the States ­­ of the States, into what Chief Justice Rehnquist called in Hall an albatross around their neck, that they are the one party that is least favored, even compared to an ordinary litigant. That can't be right. And of course, the granddaddy of all of the anomalies here is that the idea that Chisholm could have sued Georgia in South Carolina State Court. This Court doesn't lightly overrule its precedents, but when it's faced with an anomaly that dramatic and that inconsistent with the founders' understanding, it's time to overrule.",
  "Sure.",
  "My special justification is workability, consistency with precedent. Those are all of the same ­­ and lack of reliance interest. I mean, the special justification is there, but then this Court elaborates a variety of principles that govern when it overrules precedents and I think all of them point in our favor. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether an 1882 Act of Congress diminished the Omaha Reservation and redrew its boundaries. We think multiple considerations make clear that the Act of Congress did not diminish the reservation, but simply opened up a portion of the reservation for settlement within the existing boundaries. Now the first, and probably most significant, factor is that the text of the statute uses the classic language this Court has identified for opening up a reservation for settlement without creating a diminishment. But secondly, and I think very telling and specific to this statute, at the same time there is no language in the statute that supports a finding of diminishment. I think there is language in the statute. Specifically, the final proviso of Section 8 that is very inconsistent with the idea that what Congress did is draw a new western boundary to the reservation, because the ­­ that proviso gave Tribal members the right to take their allotments east or west of the right­of­way. And the record reflects that many ­­ that ­­ that a number of members of the Tribe took their allotments west of the right­of­way. And importantly, a number of them took their allotments that actually straddled the right­of­way.",
  "There are 15 ­­",
  "No, 15, I think ­­ well, the parties dispute ­­ between 10 and 15, about 850 to 900 acres. But I don't think ­­",
  "Out of how many Tribal members? I think there were roughly 300­plus allotments. So it was, you know, three percent. But I think the fact that they were allowed, even though they're small numbers ­­ I'm not trying to make a ­­ a volume argument here. I'm making an argument that if what Congress just did was draw a new western boundary to the reservation, it would have been very odd to allow Tribal members to take their allotments off the reservation, and maybe odder still to allow them to take an allotment that essentially was bisected by the new boundary.",
  "Anywhere ­­",
  "I don't think ­­",
  "I don't think that would have been a logical assumption, given the conception of the time, where I think Congress was thinking in the main that Tribal ownership or Indian ownership went with the reservation status. And I think, again, if you think of this as being a Surplus Land Act that simply opens the reservation up, a portion of it to settlement, then it makes perfect sense to say the Tribal members can take their allotments anywhere on the reservation. But if you think you've really drawn a new boundary to the reservation, then I think it's more than passing strange that you can take allotments to the west of it, or you can take an allotment and the new border is smack dab through the middle of it. That ­­",
  "No. My position is no, they couldn't. And they could take it west of the right­of­way, but I am saying that's how ­­",
  "No, no. Before any settlers, non­Indians, came in, the existing Tribal members were allowed to take their allotments.",
  "And they were allowed to take their allotments anywhere on the preexisting reservation.",
  "No. No.",
  "And ­­ and this is clear from the proviso in Section 8. It's the allotment only for members of the Tribe. And they can take, consistent with the historical understanding, an allotment anywhere on the reservation, including west of the right­of­way. And that seems to me to be very consistent with the idea that the right­of­way is an interesting thing that the Tribe granted through their reservation, but it's not some new boundary. And I think the subsequent history really supports that as well.",
  "I mean, my friend on the other side ­­",
  "Well, I take that language, Justice Ginsburg, as Justice Marshal writing for the Court saying that when you're in the third factor, when you witness de facto immunity ­­ I'm sorry ­­ de facto sort of diminishment, that that may ultimately support a conclusion that there was in fact diminishment as a matter of law. I don't take him to be opening up an entirely different route to finding immunity ­­ diminishment, rather, that doesn't go through an act of Congress. And I think that's the only way to read the opinion as a whole because when the Court starts the opinion, it says the very first principle in this area is that only Congress can diminish a reservation. And it's perfectly compatible with that to say that when we get to the third factor and we're looking at all sorts of things, we'll look at settlement patterns as part of that. But I don't think it's consistent with that world view to then say that, actually, the third factor is a standalone alternative route to find diminishment, not by congressional action, but by market reaction to a surplus land Act.",
  "I ­­ I ­­ I don't recall. I ­­",
  "Well, I ­­ I ­­ I think that ­­",
  "Well, I think ­­ I think ­­",
  "I'm not here to tell you it's not a big deal. I am telling ­­ I'm here to tell you two things, though. One is that Solem went out of its way to not decide the diminishment issue. So it is clearly an alternative way of thinking about the cases, and I don't think they're coextensive. Which is to say, I think there could be a particular assertion of Tribal authority that you might say violates City of Sherrill principles, even within an undiminished reservation. And I do think it's then critically important that ­­ my friend on the other side has not raised this argument below. I certainly did not understand it to be an independent argument in this Court. It's all well and good to cite the case, but that doesn't make it an independent argument. Even his amici, who thought that they wanted to bring before this Court the City of Sherrill argument, admitted that the Petitioners hadn't made a City of Sherrill argument.",
  "I understand, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think there's two ways to talk about de facto v. de jure. One way to talk about it is that they're two totally alternative routes. Another way is to say de facto diminishment means the settlement patterns, and that's something that can inform the ultimate conclusion of whether there's diminishment. And I really think the Court in Solem was using it in that passage in the latter respect. And I think that's the only way to make sense of the case as a whole, because ­­",
  "Exactly. That's right. It's part of the general principles of the Court ­­",
  "Well, I ­­ I ­­ I take, though, that it actually is, in my view, tied to the third factor. I think Justice Marshall was laying out all of the factors, starting with the first and governing principle, being that only Congress can diminish. And he winds up the sort of general principle section with this last thing about de facto/de jure ­­ de facto diminishment, and then that ties up exactly to his discussion of settlement patterns in the third factor of Solem. And I really think that's the right way to read that opinion. I would like to make one other very important point here, though, is I think the Court should understand that if you were to rule in favor of Petitioners in this case, the parties would essentially have to go back and reconstruct the right­of­way because the railroad is no longer there. There's no Rails­For­Trails program in Thurston County. So if you take a Google map and look at this area, you can't even tell where the right­of­way was. Now, I think that's significant, because if there really was a contemporaneous understanding in the 1950s and 1960s, when the railroad literally pulled up its tracks and left, that the right­of­way was the boundary of the reservation, then I think there would have been some effort to sort of preserve that jurisdictional boundary.",
  "Well, I ­­ I ­­ I ­­",
  "Well, I ­­ I think what there is is a practical understanding ­­ as Justice Sotomayor indicated, this is not a wealthy Tribe that's looking to assert jurisdictions in places that are impractical. So it's made a judgment that most of its efforts are directed at the eastern portion of the reservation. But what I'm saying is ­­",
  "I don't think it's dispositive. I think, yes, it's ­­",
  "Yes, relevant.",
  "It ­­ it ­­ I think it could be relevant to the third factor of Solem in a case where the situation was very cloudy. But one of the things also to keep in mind is that even before Montana, the authority that a Tribe would have over a principal non­Indian settlement on a reservation is fairly limited. And if you're ­­",
  "What's that?",
  "I think as a practical matter, Justice Ginsburg, there's two other things that are at stake here, and they both go to the equities of the Indians on the reservation, not the non­Indians, because the non­Indians on the reservation, the Tribal authority is very, very limited. So one thing that is at issue here is the potential to continue the revenue­sharing agreement with the State. And this is something that the State actually came to the Tribe about. And the theory of the revenue­sharing agreement for the fuel taxes is that there are going to be transactions in the western portion of the reservation where it's actually Tribal members that are buying gasoline over there, which does happen, because there are a lot of gas stations over there. And of course, the Tribe would have authority to tax the Tribal members on the reservations for those ­­ those transactions. So what ­­",
  "No, not at all. What they can do is they can make cooperative agreements with the State of Nebraska to tax Indians when they make purchases in Pender. And the other thing they can do is that, when two Tribal members get in a scuffle in the village of Pender, the Tribal authorities can be contacted, and that matter can be handled in the Tribal courts ­­",
  "­­ rather than the State court.",
  "Under ­­ under its authority ­­ first of all ­­ I ­­ I mean, you know, let me say two things: One is: I'm not even sure, because of the retrocession under ­­ after Public Law 280, it's not even clear to me that Nebraska ceded its civil jurisdiction that it enjoyed under 280. The ­­ the retrocession, as I understand it, was criminal retrocession with the exception of the motor vehicle laws. The second thing: As a practical matter, I think this is very important to understand. The next town east from Pender is the Town of Walthill. It is unambiguously in the reservation boundaries. It is an incorporated municipality of the ­­ of sort of civil government of Nebraska. In the Winnebago reservation ­­",
  "Yes. It can, and it does, and it's quite common. And what this Court ­­ in fact, this Court in ­­ in ­­ in the Seymour case, one of its earliest diminishment cases, confronted a Federal township, Omak, Washington, that had always been a township. There's civil authority there, but it's still on the reservation. And that is actually quite common.",
  "No. Because again, remember, the Tribal authority over the non­Indians is so small.",
  "I think they probably could. The only, really ­­ with an eye towards seeing if there were Indians there who were, you know, needing patrolling. And there's some evidence in the record ­­ this is at Joint Appendix 371 and 372 ­­ that there were occasional patrols of the Tribe into Pender. There's also a footnote in that same section that says that as a practical matter, when a Tribal member was apprehended in the Village of Pender, the police officer would call over to the Tribal authorities and have them take over the person.",
  "Yes.",
  "Within the city. And one other aspect ­­",
  "No. It really hasn't created significant conflict. And what eliminates the conflict is your Montana decision which substantially limits the Tribe's authority over the non­ ­­",
  "It ­­ it is, but that is the exception that proves the rule, because alcohol on reservations has been a unique Federal authority for as long as there's been Indian Reservations. In fact, this Court had a case in 1911 arising out of the Omaha reservation where it reaffirmed the Federal authority.",
  "I ­­ I don't think that's actually true on the ground in Nebraska, at least as to the highways. Because when they retroceded authority in",
  "I ­­ I don't think that it would within the Village of Pender. And I think that is a reflection of the very limited authority that the Tribe has over non­Indians ­­",
  "Well, ultimately, it might be ­­ it might turn on the scope of the Montana decision. And obviously, this Court has the Dollar General decision in front of it. I want to make one more point, if I could, about the overlapping authorities here, cause the other authority here is Thurston County, if I just finish this one point. Pender is the County seat of Thurston County. Thurston County has ­­ by State statute since 1922, its western boundary has been defined as coextensive with the reservation, and there are Tribal members who's ­­ one of the council members on the county is a Tribal member. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Maryland's effort to dictate what CPV receives in connection with its wholesale sales to the wholesale market operator is plainly preempted. Maryland's targeting of the Federal market was direct in this case. CPV gets nothing unless it bids and clears the PJM auction. Once it does, it must sell all of its output, all of its energy and capacity to PJM. If those things happen, then CPV receives, thanks to the State of Maryland and its State action, payment streams in conjunction ­­ in connection with those sales to PJM that are different from and far more stable than the prevailing price on the PJM auction. And ­­",
  "Well, I ­­",
  "Well, I guess I can see your problem, which is, I think, first, there's a factual premise there ­­",
  "­­ which is ­­ I think it's pretty much conceded that, at least in the first couple of years of this, the expectation is that CPV is going to be receiving an additional payment, a forced payment, from the LSC, the loading serving entity, to PJM. So that's just a factual premise for you.",
  "Well, they sure didn't start that way. And let me start here. I mean, they had, as I think Justice Alito alluded to, a completely different incentive in bidding their costs into PJM than would a private generator with new capacity. A private generator with new capacity is going to build its actual ­­ bid in its actual costs because they don't want to clear at the expense of having an unprofitable generator. It's a completely different dynamic for somebody like CPV, because the bidding clear requirement for them is just an obstacle to get to the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, which is all these guaranteed payments for 20 years. So they have every incentive to understate their cost. That incentive was realized here. They talked about bidding in their costs. When they first bid in their costs, they bid in their costs at less than $14 a megawatt­day. Okay? Now, when PJM took a look at that, they ended up upping the figure sevenfold to about $96. So that's a great measure of their incentive to distort their costs for FERC. Now, what they will say is, ah, but Mr. Clement, the $96 bid cleared, and that's all that matters. Well, with all due respect, that's wrong. FERC says it's wrong. A bid like this can still have a price effect ­­ suppressive effect. And you can see that in a couple of ways. I want to say one thing, though, is FERC is here on our side in part because they are on its record as saying this MOPR ­­ the minimum­offer price rule. The MOPR is not some sort of cure­all that is designed to ward off any price­suppressive bid. It is a default rule. It is a coarse screen to deal with the most egregious cost­reducing bids. It also depends on an estimate of cost. And here's why it doesn't really work for a bid like this. One of the most important costs is your cost of capital. Well, what was CPV's cost of capital without this program? They told you. They told Maryland, without the 20­year guarantee, we can't get any financing for this project. We can't do it. At the bench trial, they told the district court, our ability to bid this project depends entirely on the ­­",
  "What ­­",
  "Absolutely. And of course, another component of cost is going to be future fuel costs. And anybody who's been to the pump lately knows that we can all have a lot of variance as to what we think are going to be future fuel costs, but if I could return to the capital cost and just finish this point, it's even worse that it's misstated, because ultimately, because they are getting a 20­year guarantee and no one else is, everybody else is calculating their cost of a new generation financing based on the three­year price signal that the ­­ that the ­­ that the capacity market is settling, it destroys the ability to do an apples­to­apples comparison. And then the one thing we know for certain here is that this project ended up displacing a project that actually could be built based on the three­year forward price and without a 20­year contract.",
  "We would, Your Honor. I think it might be a harder case, but particularly if the subsidy was conditioned on a bid­and­clear requirement, I would be here making a preemption argument. You might not think it's as good of a preemption argument, and I think that the only difference is because the statutory text of the Federal Power Act, it seems to me to make our position clearly correct, is the provision that says that FERC has the authority to dictate what a seller receives in connection with a wholesale sale.",
  "Well, I think the field that is preempted is the ability of a government actor to set wholesale rates for wholesale sales. And so if you have State action that sets rates for wholesale sales ­­ and \"rates\" in this context is defined by the statute as including what a seller receives for wholesale sales ­­ we think that's preempted.",
  "We certainly think so, and more importantly, I think, for purposes of this case, so did the district court. I mean, it's kind of odd for me to hear my friends on the other side, as I heard them in the colloquy with Justice Kagan, they essentially conceded they lose if Maryland sets the rates, and that would be an odd concession in any case, but particularly where at footnote 48 at the district court's opinion, the district court finds ­­ as a matter of fact, I'll concede it's a mixed question of fact and law and all, but still there it is. The district court ­­",
  "Sure. And I think what Justice Kagan alluded to is if Maryland ­­",
  "Well, it's ­­ it's not, because I ­­ I think the point is, if Maryland is not setting the rates here, than FERC's not setting any wholesale rates, and that's not right. And so just because you use an auction mechanism to set the rate, that doesn't mean that it's not the State setting the rate. And if you look at footnote 48, it's ­­ it goes beyond that because, based on particular findings, based on the testimony of the chairman of the Maryland PSC, the district court said that actually because there was back and forth between Maryland and CPV, this was Maryland setting the rate.",
  "Well, if ­­ Mr. Chief Justice, suppose they decided to ­­ I mean, potentially they could. Not all subsidies are created equal. If they had a subsidy that was measured, a dollar­for­dollar subsidy based on sales to PJM, I would think that would actually be setting the rate. Again, you might disagree with me, but I would say that in that case, you would have a very similar situation. I think this case is that much clearer because these payments from the LSC is directly conditioned on selling to PJM.",
  "Okay.",
  "Sure.",
  "Oh, not with contracts with the States. That's not what my friends on the other side were saying. They enter into voluntary bilateral contracts off of the market.",
  "And that is not what's happened here.",
  "Right.",
  "Because the State told the load­serving entities that they had to make these payments to CPV.",
  "I think it's both, Your Honor. I think part of the reason this is difficult is because it's like an overdetermined equation. There is both field preemption here, but there's also conflict preemption, and there are multiple evidences of conflict preemption, because nobody's tried to do anything like this before ­­",
  "Sure ­­ right.",
  "This conflicts with FERC's determination that the PJM rates for the PJM auctions are just and reasonable. As you said, the starting premise here is the statute gives FERC the authority to determine whether wholesale rates are just and reasonable. FERC has done that effectively ex ante with respect to the PJM markets by its regulations of PJM. FERC has said that the auction clearing rate for sales to PJM is just and reasonable. Now, the authority of FERC extends not just to what the nominal rate is in the auction but to what the supplier receives in connection with that sale. So if a State, through State action, says, it's all very well CPV that you've sold that to PJM and PJM has given you a hundred, this is your lucky day, we're going to give you another 50, that is clearly preempted because a State is having the supplier receive something in connection with a wholesale sale to PJM that is different from the rate that FERC has determined is reasonable.",
  "Here's your response, Justice Breyer, and it comes in two parts, because there's at least two parts to that question. First, I take issue with the premise because it may be that some new generation will come in, in your hypothetical, but it won't necessarily be this one. And in fact here we know, as a matter of fact, that it wouldn't be this one, except for the 20­year guarantee, and so they displaced somebody. But please don't just shrug your shoulders ­­",
  "That is a huge ­­",
  "That is a huge difference, because this ­­ the message this all sends to my clients is don't take FERC's direction that you should be competing based on market forces and efficiency. We should stop competing efficiently on the PJM and try to put the best bid together based on the three­year advanced auction. We should start competing for subsidies, and we should start competing for guarantees. The second part of your question, what about FERC primary jurisdiction. This is all a bit rich coming from my friends on the other side because, as Justice Alito alluded to, when this all started, their position was this has nothing to do with FERC at all. This is a financial arrangement that FERC can't even look at. Then my friend talks about how, well, they eventually got market­based rate authority from FERC in a submission. Well, I ­­ I'd ask you to take a look at what they said on Joint Appendix page 142 of that submission. What they said about the contract is they said, quote, \"CPV Maryland also notes that it included the CFD in this application solely for informational purposes and is not requesting that the Commission address or discuss Commission jurisdiction over the CFD in its decision on CPV's Maryland's request for market­based rate.\" Don't look what's behind that curtain, Mr. FERC. We don't want you to do anything with that. We're just here to try to get market­based rate authority. For them now to come in, not having raised any objection to the Supremacy Clause cause of action ­­ and by the way, there was a Commerce Clause cause of action there as well, which is maybe why the parties overlooked it, and I do think that's not jurisdictional, so I think we're past that. So for them to come in now and say, oh, this has to go to FERC, I'm sorry; it's a bit rich. And I understood why they were making the MOPR argument at the early stages of this litigation before FERC filed the brief. But I am a little mystified why, at this late stage of the game, after FERC has filed three briefs saying that the MOPR is not sufficient to eliminate price­suppressive bids, that they're still saying we win because FERC's on our side. I mean, that is a bit mystifying. And I think FERC is absolutely right on this for the reasons that we've already talked about. I mean, you can't really even apply the MOPR in an apples­to­apples way if you have this kind of 20­year guarantee, because the cost of capitals are completely out of whack. And of course, they do have the problem that their own testimony is they wouldn't be on the market at all if they didn't have this 20­year guarantee. So in the first capacity auction that we had to deal with, the price was suppressed. In every energy auction since then, the price was suppressed. And that's why I think FERC ­­ you know, they never tried to design the MOPR as this perfect thing. You talked about the 90 percent and the 70 percent? Way back in one of those proceedings, my client said, FERC, why isn't it a hundred percent? If you think about the economics of this, it should be a hundred percent. And FERC's response was, eh, close counts, this isn't perfect, we don't pretend it's perfect so we think 90 perfect is a rough compromise. Fair enough. Probably not arbitrary and capricious, but it doesn't mean that this is something that the MOPR is some perfect solution. I also don't think there's anything terribly anomalous about the procedural posture of this case. I think it's exact procedural posture you had in front of you in the Schneidewind case. That was a district court action, declaratory judgment for preemption. What I think makes this a preemption case, and what completely distinguishes voluntary bilateral contracts, is State action. It's the State action forcing the LSCs to make these payments, and essentially conditioning CPV's participation on the PJM market on the bid­and­clear requirement. That's State action that's preempted. In the typical voluntary bilateral contract, you don't have State action. The parties make their agreement. They eventually submit it to FERC, or if it's a market­based rate, somebody can object. And the only time you really get State action at that point is at the very end of the process when the State's doing retail rate regulation, and that's the point where Mississippi Power & Light and Nantahala come in and say if at that late stage when there's finally State action that the State has to take FERC's wholesale rate determinations as a given; they can't second guess them at late stage. But here you got the State action right up front, and the State action is preempted.",
  "It would depend. I mean, the way you just described it, I would say ­­ especially because I think it's a helpful answer ­­ of course not, not preempted.",
  "But if they conditioned all of that money on a bid­and­clear requirement, I would be saying that that was preempted. I think it's a harder case, but I'd hate to lose that case here because there are cases like that that are being litigated in the lower court. Thank you, Your Honor.",

There is the fact that the government demands more than an objection, the fact that it enforces it with massive penalties, and the reality that if that happens, then they are going to hijack our health plans and provide the coverage against our will.",
  "Two things ­­",
  "Two things, Justice Sotomayor. The first is that I do think that what you're saying about the government not being able to function under the substantial burden and then the least restrictive alternative analysis, that's exactly what Justice Scalia said for the Court in the Smith decision. And Justice O'Connor took a different view. And they had a healthy debate. And you can question who had the better of the debate, but there is no question which side of the debate settled things.",
  "Justice Sotomayor, if the only action involved is a third­party action like in part of the Bowen against Roy case or in the Lyng case, you're right, that's not a substantial burden. But when the government says ­­ and it needs more. I want to be as clear as I can about this. The government admits at pages 87 through 89 of their brief that they need more, just then, to know that we raise our hand and opt out. They also need additional information about our insurer or our TPA. So they require more. So ­­ and ­­ if we don't ­­",
  "That's what they say they need.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, that's true if and only if we provide the form, because it's not just the information on the form. The government treats that form as an authorization. In the case of self­insured plans with TPA ­­",
  "It makes all the difference, Justice Ginsburg. If we don't provide the form, then the coverage doesn't flow. We haven't provided the form in these cases, and as a result, the coverage hasn't flowed. The government thinks ­­ and I think it's most obvious with respect to the self­insured plans, but it's true of all of them. The government thinks it needs something from us so it can take that something and make it a plan document.",
  "I agree, Justice Ginsburg, but just because they call it an accomodation doesn't mean it's immune from RFRA analysis. And if what they gave my clients is what they gave the 345,000 churches, their integrated auxiliaries and the purely religious activities of religious orders, if they gave that accomodation to my client, we'd fill out any form they wanted to. But the problem is we have to fill out a form, and the consequence of us filling out that form is we will be treated very differently from those other religious employers.",
  "In both cases, Your Honor, it becomes a plan instrument, and I think ­­ you know, the government thinks that our notification in this case is the functional equivalent of the EBSA 700 Form, and the reason they required a form ­­ and this shows you it's not really an opt out, because the way the regulations were originally designed, you didn't raise your hand and tell the government, I object. You sent a form directly to the insurer or directly to the TPA that they then treated as the permission slip to provide the coverage.",
  "Well, no, it's not out. That's actually still one of the ways that you can apply ­­",
  "Well, the alternative, thanks to this Court in its interim relief, is that we now can file an objection that the government treats exactly the same way. All they do that's different is they essentially ­­ it's a mailing rule. They take our objection and then they provide that objection to the third­party administrator, and at least with the self­insured plans, that becomes every bit as much a plan document as the EBSA Form 700. And with all due respect, it's a little rich for the government to say, This isn't your plan, don't worry about this, when their whole interest is put in terms of seamless coverage. If it's seamless to the enduser, then I don't think the Little Sisters perception that it's seamless to them, and they are, in fact, complicit is an irrational belief by any stretch.",
  "That's ­­ I think that's a fair description of it, Justice Kennedy. And I think the only problem the government is having understanding our position is that that health plan is somewhat intangible. And I think if you put this in more tangible terms, if the ­­ if the consequence of us filing the form was that they would come in to one of the Little Sisters homes and set up shop in a room, they could pay us rent, it wouldn't cost us a thing. And then they operated a Title X clinic out of our homes? I think everyone would understand that, of course, we are complicit in the coverage that's provided on our premises. And just because this is more intangible, I don't think the principle is any different, and certainly from the perspective ­­",
  "I think that's the role that your courts have had for the Court, because I think they don't want to get in the role of having the truth detector test, and that ­­ and that's not just the Hobby Lobby decision. That goes back to the Thomas decision. If you remember that decision, you had a religious adherent who had an objection to formulating cylindrical tanks ­­ cylindrical things that would go into tanks. Now, there was another Jehovah's Witness that was in the record that said, You don't need to object to that. That's not that big a deal. It's too attenuated. And this Court specifically said, We're not going to get in the business of refereeing those disputes, and we're not going to get in the business of trying to figure out and second­guessing whether Mr. Thomas is really correctly misunderstanding his faith. Now, here you have a ton of amicus briefs that reinforce that the religious beliefs that are at issue here for the Little Sisters and for my other clients are not at all idiosyncratic, are not at all, you know, wrong as a matter of faith. But that's not an area that you should get into. I think ­­",
  "Yeah, I am.",
  "I'm going to try, Justice Breyer, and then I'm going to try to reserve my time for rebuttal. So what I would say to you is you're exactly right, that Smith was a much more administrable world, but Congress ­­",
  "Absolutely. So here's the way that you work it and draw the line. You first ask, is there a substantial burden on religious exercise? That is going to weed out some claims. If I was trying to claim that a tax on wine, for example ­­",
  "No, no, no. I'm just trying to tell you that that's one step. It will weed out some claims. I do think then there's going to be work to be done on the second half of the test, and I think there are some fairly obvious differences between a regime where essentially the government itself by its own actions has showed that people can't opt out. It's too important. It's too universal. And then you come at a case like this, or like Sherbert itself. The thing that made Sherbert an easy case was the government of South Carolina had already taken care of the Sunday objectors. So at that point, their argument that the whole system would collapse if we take care of the Sabattarians, it was not a particularly persuasive argument. Here, they've taken care of the churches. They've taken care of a religious order just like the Little Sisters, if only the Little Sisters wouldn't go out and care for the elderly and poor. They've demonstrated that this is an easy case. I reserve my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. A few points in rebuttal. I'd like to start with the universities, Justice Kennedy, because I don't think it's the case that just because Congress exempts churches, that it has to exempt the universities. What it needs, though, is a rationale for drawing the line. Now, my friend on the other side says the line doesn't have to be perfect. Well, under compelling interest and least restrictive alternatives, it at least has to be pretty good. And the line that they have drawn here is absurd, and I would urge you to look at the amicus brief filed by the Dominican Sisters and authored by a former head of the tax division, because it explains the line they have picked, using 6033 of the tax code, makes no sense. That's an informative filing requirement, but there is no substantive difference. If my clients filed the form, they get the same tax exempt status as the churches. The only difference in that provision is whether you filed the form. The substantive treatment is exactly the same. To use that line to draw a distinction between churches and universities or the Little Sisters of the Poor is a terrible line to draw. And if you go back to thinking ­­",
  "No, I would say that that gets me to the next point. But if I could just finish this point for one second. Their original justification for the line they drew, Justice Kennedy, was that the exempted organizations would be more likely to hire co­religionists and, therefore, less likely to have employees who would use the products. My clients equally enjoy the Title VII exemption which gives them the right to hire co­religionists so their original rationale applies equally to my clients. You have to draw a sensible line. Now as to the exemptions, I mean, I will respectfully disagree with Professor Laycock.",
  "Let me answer both questions together. First of all, the exemption is not just limited to churches. It applies to religious orders. And if my clients would have just stuck to their knitting and not helped the elderly poor, they could qualify. But to answer both of these questions together, not all exemptions are created equal. And Professor Laycock is a great scholar, but even he admitted he didn't understand the details of this particular plan. He didn't get into that. He left it to the parties. And I think he subsequently said that if there really was a requirement for these entities to contract, and there is, then even he would recognize there is a substantial burden. But the important point is not all exemptions are created equal. If you create an exemption for small employers, that's a rationale exercise with enforcement discretion. If you create an exemption for ­­ take the O Centro case. If the exemption for peyote had been for a Schedule 5 substance that was less dangerous, maybe the government would have won. Their problem there was that the government had already exempted the sacramental use of peyote, a Schedule 1 substance. So of course, they had a hard time arguing why they couldn't provide an exemption for a different Schedule 1 substance. All of these exemptions have to be treated the same, Justice Breyer. There is no excuse. There is no other way than to do the hard work of looking at the exemptions and seeing whether they make sense. One of the cases that Congress clearly wanted to embrace in RFRA was Yoder. Now, Yoder was a relatively hard case because there basically were no exemptions. If the State of Wisconsin had already provided an exemption for the Mennonites and it already provided an exemption for the students upstate where the schools are farther apart, Yoder would have been an easy, easy case. You can't make an exemption for all these grandfathered plans. And please, it's not that this is a sunset provision. If you look at Joint Appendix page 956, they link the grandfather provision to the idea that if you like your plan, you can keep it. So that's not going away. Just in closing, my clients would love to be a conscientious objector, but the government insists that they be a conscientious collaborator. There is no such thing."
