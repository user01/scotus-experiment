  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: According to the National Institutes of Health, hepatitis C kills 8,000 to 10,000 people in this country every year, and it's the largest cause of liver transplants. This is a progressive disease, which in many cases goes without any symptoms for a period of time, but in a large percentage of cases, it results in cirrhosis and liver failure. The disease in this instance was chronic, active, and severe, according to the standards of the NIH. Now, NIOSH's Occupational Health Guidelines also confirm that the chemicals in this factory were liver toxins. The ordinary worker can withstand that exposure, which is consistent with OSHA standards. But the Government's guidelines say again and again that employees should receive medical tests before beginning work to look out for special vulnerability. NIOSH's statement about phenol, one of the 12 chemicals here, is typical, and I quote from the guideline. Liver damage may occur. Persons with a history of abnormalities of the liver would be expected to be at increased risk from exposure. Now, none of this matters according to the Ninth Circuit because injury to self is beyond the employer's legitimate concern. But we believe that the plain language of the statute and its structure tell a completely different story. The defense provision in the statute, which is section 12113(a), first speaks in general terms.",
  "That is found on page 59a of the petition appendix.",
  "59a, Your Honor, yes.",
  "It begins on 58a, but the pertinent provision, 12113(a), is right there on 59a.",
  "And the general provision says it is permissible to use qualification standards and tests that are job-related and consistent with business necessity. This is generic language and it does not exclude injury to self. After this general provision, the statute --",
  "The -- the first part is 12113(a), which states: in general. That's the general defense provision. And right after it comes a particular example in subpart (b), which refers to risks to other individuals. And that, of course, is just an example that fits within the general rule here, and we know it's just an example because Congress said that permissible standards may include such a test. This is obviously not an exhaustive description.",
  "We think the -- the phrase, may include, is illustrative of matters that might fit into the general description that comes just before and that injury to -- to other persons and injury to self are -- are both matters that fit within the general description of business necessity, public safety --",
  "We found several instances that we cite in our brief where Congress was talking about injury to -- to the individual himself. So, again, it's not an exclusive reference. And I think if you look at the structure of the statute, Justice O'Connor, it again helps to answer this question.",
  "That might be an inference from that language --",
  "-- that that would be inconsistent with the express language.",
  "We think it's -- it's particularly weak because the -- the provision that comes right before this provision that deals with discrimination makes it clear that the employer may use medical examinations and may make an offer of employment contingent on the results of those medical examinations. That's in the discrimination section.",
  "That is in section 12112(d), which is quoted in our reply brief at page 7.",
  "At reply brief page 7. It says the employer may require a medical examination and may condition an offer of employment on the results of that examination. Again, the focus is perfectly general in scope. The exam is lawful if it is job-related and consistent with business need. Now, we don't think it's necessary to resort to legislative history in this case, but there is a conference report here that stated that this act does not intend to override any -- any -- legitimate medical standards or requirements established by employers for safety-sensitive positions.",
  "We -- we deny that he was a qualified individual. We make two arguments: one, that -- that we have a business necessity not to hire somebody who would be killed in this particular job, but also that he's not qualified.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "I -- I would agree with that, and we --",
  "The qualification standard focuses on whether he can perform the job on an ongoing basis in the near term. And -- and if the person would become seriously ill or die in the near term, that person can't carry out the job functions.",
  "There is linguistic overlap and there is practical overlap. A person who is not qualified is a person --",
  "Our view is that there's overlap between qualification and business necessity.",
  "But they're not coextensive.",
  "That's the first question. The second question is, if he is qualified, because, as Justice O'Connor said, he can do the job in the short run, which we don't think he can, then the question is whether we have a business need to retain him.",
  "That's our principal submission. Our backup --",
  "We -- we -- it's one of our -- we have several arguments in the alternative, yes.",
  "We believe we -- we can win the case on that ground.",
  "Yes, and we think that that regulation is perfectly consistent with -- with the general defense provision, and we believe we can win the case under that regulation and, indeed, that it's entitled to Chevron deference because this agency had legislative rulemaking power to issue that standard.",
  "We --",
  "Well, I would note that the -- the agency in its cert stage amicus brief said that the qualification issue is whether the individual can perform the job in the near term. And we agree with that. But we say this person cannot do that because --",
  "But you'll -- you'll note --",
  "Absolutely. That's just a brief --",
  "Well, they say -- they say helpful things in the brief too. They note that firemen and -- and airline pilots and others that would succumb to an illness while they're conducting their jobs in the near term are disqualified. They're not qualified to do the job. And the reason is that safety considerations are paramount there, they say. Well, they're paramount in this refinery too. There were five physicians here who said this individual was at imminent risk of death --",
  "It's an old story, Your Honor. Some people do not listen to their doctors. I won't speculate on --",
  "Well, if you read the cases that we've cited, it's amazing how frequently people with --",
  "Yes.",
  "We -- we don't assume that.",
  "We say he -- he is like the steel worker with vertigo who can fall --",
  "-- off the beam at any moment --",
  "I hope not.",
  "This statute rejects that thesis in the medical examination provisions, recognizing that the employer has a stake in this issue. There are many legitimate interests that the employer has.",
  "Arguably it would, Your Honor, because this is a known hazard.",
  "It should -- it should factor into the business necessity evaluation because we do have a business necessity to avoid violating State law and Federal law. And here there --",
  "I would point to the general duty --",
  "Oh, I -- I see we -- we didn't put it in our appendix, but it's the general duty provision of the OSHA statute cited in our opening brief and our reply brief. And what it says is that if you've recognized a hazard, you cannot send the employee into the jaws of that hazard.",
  "It's the general duty clause --",
  "Yes. We'll supply it for you.",
  "Yes.",
  "There are several --",
  "-- several interests. There -- there is Federal law compliance. There is State law compliance. There is State tort law liability that we're concerned about.",
  "It -- it could. It certainly could.",
  "Well, we would hope that preemption would work that way, but preemption issues in the States court often do not.",
  "Oh, yes, there still is.",
  "That's -- that's preservation of employment relations, avoidance of adverse publicity, and -- and fear of criminal responsibility. There have been many criminal prosecutions, and courts never -- never hold that -- that general criminal laws are -- are preempted by Federal safety legislation. So, I don't think that's -- that's any defense in that situation. There are -- in all well-run businesses today, the model of the business is safety is our business. For 100 years in this country, the industrial policy has been safety comes first. So, this is per se a legitimate business interest in this context. Now, our -- our friend's argument to the contrary, interestingly, is an exact replay of the argument that was made to the EEOC back in 1991 when the agency adopted its rules. The argument was made then that if you refer to risk to self, it's going to encourage paternalism and encourage negative stereotypes. But the agency rejected that argument, explaining it was inconsistent with the purpose of the statute and was inconsistent with a long line of cases under the Rehabilitation Act. And the agency's judgment here, we believe, is entitled to Chevron deference.",
  "Yes.",
  "That was evaluated under a different legal standard, the BOFQ standard, which is much more stringent. This Court has said the business necessity standard is more flexible and -- and permissive. And that was a case where the Government said there was no serious risk, and all you had to do is take a simple precaution and the lead would not injure the -- the fetuses of -- of the woman. And there was discrimination between the sexes, which was the real thrust of the Court's decision, and there's nothing like that here.",
  "Yes.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Business necessity applies to any screening test or medical examination or qualification standard that the employer uses. And this was something that the business community fought hard for in Congress to get this flexible test. It's repeated three or four times in -- in title I of the statute, and -- and to disregard it here we think defeats the very basis of this legislation. I see I've used a great deal of my time. I wonder if I might reserve the balance of the time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Stewart's opinion for the Court in the Dothard case contained an excellent rebuttal to the argument we've just heard. He stated that safety is not romantic paternalism. Safety is a basic business necessity in this country. That's the culmination of 100 years of industrial policy.",
  "Oh, we think it does. The Court discussed both kinds of danger, danger to the individual and danger to other people. And this Court twice has said in Dothard -- in Beezer -- the Beezer case later -- that safety is a paradigm business necessity. And indeed, it -- it is the paradigm, safe and efficient operations of business. And this is not a statute that cut out risks to self. This is a statute that included risks to self in the business necessity defense. That's generic language that encompasses it. And there was a long line of cases that Congress meant to adopt under the Rehab Act. They didn't disapprove those cases. In fact, business necessity is repeated four different times in the statute, and it's applied specifically to medical examinations of the individual employee. Congress wasn't talking about general tests. It was talking about examinations like the one given to Mr. Echazabal. Now, this Court has held that under the business necessity defense, it will not substitute its judgment for the employer's judgment. All that is needed is a reasonable relationship to a legitimate business objective. There certainly is a legitimate business objective here in saving this individual's life and promoting safety in the plant. Was the judgment a reasonable one? We had four opinions from experienced physicians. We spoke with Mr. Echazabal's own physician. We told him, did you realize this man would be exposed to liver toxins, and he said, no, that should not be done. Someone with hepatitis C can't even have a drink of alcohol, much less liver toxins.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think a word of history here explains some of the mystery surrounding the statutory language. For over 90 years, Congress has specified the safety equipment that has to be installed on motorboats, and it was in 1937 that this Court ruled in Kelly v. Washington that the States may not impose their own requirements for safety equipment on boats that travel in interstate waters. And that was the background of this legislation. This act preempts State law creating any requirement for boat equipment that is not identical with the prescribed Coast Guard regulation. And this serves a critical fail-safe purpose. Risky devices like propeller guards may not be imposed on the public under State law unless and until they're approved by the expert regulatory agency under the criteria that Congress has laid down. Now, this preemption provision has three exceptions which are written right into the provision, but none of those exceptions fits this case. So my friends have to make the argument that this general savings clause, which says nothing about preemption, is another implicit exception, but that's inconsistent --",
  "And -- and --",
  "And the -- the wisdom of this statute is that until the Coast Guard makes a decision about a device like propeller guards, they may not be imposed on the public. Think of what happens under Justice Kennedy's example. If Illinois commands installation of these devices and backs up that judgment with millions of dollars in damages, people in 49 other States are exposed to the risks and burdens of propeller guards.",
  "Well, we agree with the statement in Garmon that the Court, for preemption purposes, should assume compliance and then ask what are the implications. The implications are that Illinois could coerce the installation of these devices. Another State may disagree.",
  "Or one or --",
  "Well, after the first jury verdict, then the -- in come the claims for punitive damages in the next case, and there is a powerful coercive effect from damage actions. This Court has said so.",
  "Well, what's --",
  "The -- what the safety council found, the Coast Guard's committee of 21 experts, was that for all boats that travel more than 10 miles an hour, these are infeasible devices. And the reason is you have to match the propeller guard with the particular engine and the particular hull combination. There are thousands and thousands of hulls out there.",
  "Well, the -- the Coast Guard said that the available accident data compiled by the 21 experts did not support a propeller guard requirement under the --",
  "And in April of 2001, they looked at this again, and the Coast Guard representative on the safety council said we realize we cannot mandate installation of propeller guards. They're not feasible, and the propeller guard subcommittee said again, these will increase blunt trauma injuries.",
  "Yes. Yes, Your Honor. It's -- I believe it's footnote 14 in plaintiff's reply brief. They -- they cite to the web site for these council minutes.",
  "Well, but under this statute, that isn't necessary, Your Honor. It -- they -- they did have --",
  "Well, because of the wording of this statute, which is so different from Geier -- it's the exact opposite of Geier -- under this statute, unless there's an identical Coast Guard regulation in place, State law is preempted.",
  "Well, as to equipment, associated equipment, for boats, unless there's a Coast Guard regulation in place, the States can't mandate that equipment.",
  "Well --",
  "Your Honor --",
  "Your Honor, we -- we think that overlooks the history that I began with because under this Court's decisions, the States could not impose requirements for equipment or -- or construction, design or structure for boats moving in interstate waters. That was Kelly v. Washington, a unanimous opinion by Chief Justice Hughes.",
  "Oh, yes, there -- there are three exceptions to the preemption provision. They're explicit exceptions, and we don't have to go looking to the savings clause for a fourth, implied exception. There -- there is an exception if the Coast Guard grants an exemption under APA procedures. They didn't do that here. There's another exemption for local hazardous conditions, but that exception doesn't fit here either.",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "That's the key point, Your Honor. That was done by formal exemption, and that shows that this statute has the exceptions built right into preemption provision.",
  "Yes.",
  "What -- what was happening, according to the legislative history, is the States were beginning to require battery covers, anchors, lines, and other pieces of associated equipment, including warning decals on the boats, and Congress says, this has to stop. There's nothing wrong with these requirements, but we can't have 50 sets of them. So this field is being preempted for associated equipment requirements until the Coast Guard adopts a regulation or the Coast Guard gives an exemption, which it did in 1971. And I think the structure is very important. This is so different from Geier. There was not a structure like this with three exceptions written right into the statute, and to treat the savings clause, which doesn't say a word about preemption and which the legislative history says is simply a matter of State law defenses, as a fourth, implied exception to preemption truly does violence to the structure of this law.",
  "It does not address preemption at all. It addresses an affirmative defense that it -- that could be available under State law. That's the defense of compliance with Coast Guard regulations or orders or any provision of this entire statute. Now, section 288C of the Restatement of Torts -- this is an echo of section 288C which was published just a few years before Congress passed the savings provision. It doesn't deal with preemption at all. It deals with -- with compliance.",
  "It has a huge scope of operation, unlike Geier. To start with the Coast Guard's example, the ordinary negligence case, negligent operation was very important to Congress because most of these propeller accidents occur because of negligent operation or reckless operation of the boat. That's what the Coast Guard says on its web site today. And so the defendant couldn't defend by saying, gee, my boat complies with all the Coast Guard regulations --",
  "The -- the next thing the Coast Guard referred to is express warranty. The defendant couldn't say simply because I've complied with this long list of Coast Guard requirements, I don't have to honor my contractual promises or --",
  "Negligent installation is certainly covered, and defective manufacture is also protected by the savings clause. That's when a particular unit comes off the assembly line and it's defective. Those were the original tort cases --",
  "It is possible and for this reason. The language of the statute for associated equipment only preempts requirements for associated equipment. And that could be construed to mean simply requirements to install propeller guards, which you've not installed. Now, if you took a different interpretation of requirements for, it might encompass that case, but this Court could give a narrow construction to requirements for. And this case is the paradigm case because manufacturers have decided not to use this kind of safety equipment because they know it's a hazard. It's a known hazard. Several courts have disapproved these devices. 21 safety experts of the Coast Guard have pointed out the dangers this creates. So manufacturers have consciously --",
  "Well, because the manufacturer doesn't know --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, the reason that's preempted and that that is a requirement for associated equipment, even in the case that you give, is because the manufacturer has no idea what hull is going to be put together with this motor. The motor can move from hull to hull to hull. And what the Coast Guard found -- the -- the committee found in its report was that you have to have an exact hydrodynamic fit between the particular engine and the particular hull and the particular propeller guard. So if juries, say, impose propeller guards on -- on designs we think are dangerous --",
  "Well, we -- we rely on the logic of this committee report which says that -- that for all planing boats that go 10 miles an hour or faster, these devices are counterproductive because they interfere with steering. They double the amount of fuel that's consumed. They increase air and water pollution and they create serious hazards of blunt trauma injury. So what the -- the committee found was that these devices for any category of planing boat -- and here we have a boat that goes 50 miles an hour. We've got an 18-foot ski boat with a 115 horsepower engine.",
  "Well, that's true in many of these preemption cases, but all it takes is an errant jury verdict or two or three to coerce a decision by the manufacturer to install devices that are very hazardous to the public.",
  "Justice Breyer, that's cold comfort. They would hand us this brief that they've just submitted saying that it's up to the jury to decide whatever the jury wants.",
  "Well, because Congress had a different vision. Congress was going with the rule of Kelly, Kelly against Washington.",
  "Well, the legislative history is very explicit on that. The boating associations and the manufacturers associations had all kinds of very elaborate standards of their own, and everybody said during these hearings that is to be encouraged. We want them to do more of that. The statute shouldn't stop that. But there was no suggestion that the States could intervene and impose their own standards and their own requirements. And in fact, in the Ray decision, this Court said minimum standards under another similar statute do not mean -- do not mean that the States can embroider on and supplement those -- those standards. And after all, the preemption provision here doesn't say anything about minimum standards or maximum standards. It says all requirements for boat safety equipment are preempted unless there is an identical Coast Guard regulation in place. This is the rule of Kelly against Washington which --",
  "We did not. Plaintiffs cited it in their brief. It's 302 U.S. And I'll give the Court the cite. I think it's critically important. 302 U.S. at 14 through 15.",
  "Well, it's quoted in the cases that we do cite. It's quoted in the Ray decision. It's a -- it's an early precursor of Ray and in Locke. I was explaining it as -- as the background of Congress's legislation here. And I'd like to suggest to the Court that it makes a huge difference here that this is a case that arises in the maritime context. At a minimum, the maritime context means there is no presumption against preemption, as the court below held. And because Congress wanted to achieve uniformity --",
  "Oh, yes, it is. We believe it is, Your Honor, because this Court --",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Since the '40s and the '50s, this Court, and later in Foremost and in Sisson, this Court has held that recreational boats fall squarely within the maritime jurisdiction.",
  "I -- there may be some carve-out for New Hampshire in this statute.",
  "And I've tried to figure out the reasons for that carve-out, and I've never -- I've never understood those. But this is maritime context, and this lake -- the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has held that is -- it's a navigable interstate body of water.",
  "Oh, absolutely not. It has to be an interstate body of water. But since the 1850s, this Court has held that interstate waterways are subject to the maritime jurisdiction. And this waterway, by the way, was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It's surrounded with marinas that rent pleasure boats, and this is big business, the pleasure boating business, on Dale Hollow Lake. And because this is a maritime context, that says a lot about the savings clause, because this Court has held that in maritime cases, savings clauses should be interpreted narrowly to avoid obstructing the carefully constructed preemption provision in the statute and to avoid making an end run around the Coast Guard's expert supervision, which is what Congress wanted. And we go further and say that because the court below was right in characterizing this as an admiralty case, any conflict between Illinois law and Federal law is just imaginary. That's because Federal common law follows Federal maritime jurisdiction, and there can't be --",
  "Well, the Illinois Supreme Court agreed with us on this point. They have two pages in their opinion --",
  "Well, we think this is an included question. It was certainly addressed by the court below. The court below cited this Court's Jensen decision, which is the leading maritime preemption decision. And it was using maritime analysis to support the preemption holding that the court ultimately made. Now, this was step number one in our preemption argument below, but we're entitled to elaborate it in this Court and cite additional cases.",
  "Well, we -- we proceeded to argue in the alternative that under express preemption and under a conflict preemption that -- that State law was preempted. But with a two-page discussion in this opinion on maritime, I think it is an addressed and included question. And if the Court doesn't consider --",
  "We made the first part of the argument. We said Federal law covers the waterfront because Congress conceived of this as a maritime question and was preempting State law broadly, exerting its traditional, under Kelly against Washington, the usual Federal Government role over equipment installed on motorboats. And we said that this is an enclave of Federal law. And we cited this Court's Yamaha decision and we cited the Foremost decision. We cited admiralty cases and we said it was an admiralty case.",
  "Right, but our -- my point is that we were citing this Court's admiralty decisions. And then the Illinois Supreme Court went further and cited a host of additional admiralty decisions. Now, when you have that kind of discussion in a State court opinion of a Federal law issue, this Court, I believe, can reach that as an included question and it's an intertwined question. And let me suggest it is the easiest way to resolve and the narrowest way to resolve this case because it is propeller guard-specific. It makes no aggressive law regarding tort claims on -- on the land, and --",
  "The Solicitor General hasn't briefed this point, the maritime law point.",
  "Well, I don't think --",
  "I think you'd have the same result, but you would have fewer reasons for reaching that same result.",
  "It would not apply. It would apply to -- to Lake Michigan but not to Lake Geneva. Now, I'd like -- like to return to Justice Kennedy's comment about the conflicting judgments among State courts. If -- if Illinois were to mandate propeller guards and back up the judgment with millions of dollars in damages, that would impose these devices on all the people in the United States, and at everybody's estimate, these are risky devices with serious problems. And in the next case in another State, we would be sued for installing these devices. The Walt Disney World was sued. They put a little propeller guard on a bumper boat and they were sued when a kid's arm got caught in the propeller guard. So sure as can be, if -- if one State mandates them, the next State is going to penalize them. And the legislatures of the State -- this is the worst and most shocking aspect of this theory. The legislatures of the States could not protect their citizens against --",
  "What it -- what it could not enact is a law that says no boats coming into the State of Illinois or California may be equipped with propeller guards. Why? Because that's not identical with the Coast Guard regulation. And yet, the juries in various States could be imposing these devices. People could be losing their lives and boats --",
  "Well --",
  "I think that that may well be a safety standard in disguise, but it -- the State could not do the thing that it really had to do which was to prohibit boats using propeller guards. If -- if juries in various parts of the United States put pressure on manufacturers to put propeller guards on their boats, the legislature needs the power to say no, this can't come into the -- can't come into the State. But that is clearly preempted under the SG's interpretation of the statute. And I think that is a true disservice to federalism, to have these kinds of conflicting judgments, and it shows the wisdom of Congress's architecture in this statute, that the States may not impose requirements for propeller guards unless and until the Coast Guard vets these proposals, finds that they're safe, finds that they satisfy Federal criteria of feasibility and safety, and adopts the rule and a regulation. It's like FDA legislation, protect the public against common law claims of this sort that could have such serious adverse effects on the public.",
  "Yes.",
  "The -- there's a good reason for refusing to act in this instance, and that is, these devices are very hazardous. You can't turn the boat safely. There's a danger of blunt trauma injury that is worse than the propeller slices. A surgeon can slice up propeller slices occasionally, but the blunt trauma injury from a propeller guard is lethal if it hits you in the chest or in the head. And it -- it -- the steering is interfered with. You have to double the horsepower of these engines once you put a big bird cage around or a big circle around the propeller guard. There -- there are thousands of pounds per square inch of pressure exerted on these propeller guards, and they create a serious navigation hazard. And it -- it isn't just the committee that in 1990 concluded that these were dangerous. These were 30 experts on safety appointed by the Secretary of Transportation that assigned all these dangers and feasibility problems. And this is exactly, by the way, what seven courts have held who've looked on -- at propeller guards on the merits. They've held that these devices are not feasible and that they're dangerous. There's not a single court in the United States that has said that these have to be installed. And so, this is the problem, the real world problem, of having individual juries listen to those who lost before the administrative forum on propeller guards. Okay, we're going to start all over again in the court system, and now we're going to get juries to start commanding installation of propeller guards. There's a real world hazard, a danger for the public, and Congress has wisely drafted this statute to protect us and our children against that risk. Now, these devices clearly raise policy concerns of nationwide significance and that's why the Coast Guard had to consider these issues in proceedings around the country that lasted for 18 months. Many sectors of society are affected by these devices, and Congress just did not intend that individual juries were going to make these decisions for the whole country. This would be extraterritorial regulation with a vengeance, just what this Court said in Locke should not be done under State law. Now, my friend also has argued in the brief that safety is the goal of the Boat Safety Act, and that uniformity is just a secondary concern. But Congress did pursue its safety agenda through a particular method, and that was uniform standards for marine equipment. Congress wanted the whole Nation to benefit from safe and efficient standards, and it wanted the whole Nation to be protected against standards and requirements that represent risky experiments. And that's just what propeller guards are. And that's why the Coast Guard said in 1991 that these standards have to meet stringent Federal criteria before they're imposed. And that does bring us back to congressional intent because when Congress passed this preemption provision, the States were starting to adopt requirements for battery covers and for warning placards on boats and for lines and anchors. And Congress said, that's fine, but we can't have 50 sets of these requirements. We've got to be uniform set of these requirements. And it is untenable to conclude that although the harbor master at Belmont Harbor cannot compel the installation of propeller guards, the Circuit Court of Cook County is perfectly free to do that with a big threat of damages. Both of these are exercises of Illinois law and they're both preempted. We accordingly urge this Court to affirm the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States, joined by seven other nations, has concluded that the decision in this case is an error and should be reversed. The reason is that the plaintiffs here are foreign claimants which allege that they paid too much for vitamins outside of U.S. commerce. Trying these claims in our courts would conflict with the principle that the Sherman Act does not regulate the competitive conditions of other nations' economies, and stretching the antitrust laws to include such claims is a recipe for international discord and for heavy new burdens on our Federal district courts. Now, when Congress passed the FTAIA in 1982, it did not expand the domain of the antitrust laws, but rather clarified limitations. It required both an effect on U.S. commerce and the claim arising from that same effect. As the Government explains, this is language that refers most naturally to a claim of the plaintiff before the court, and not a claim of some other person. The court of appeals, of course, believed that it was enough for somebody else to have a claim arising from a U.S. effect.",
  "It really had -- had no explanation of that, Your Honor, and it's quite an extraordinary assumption that you would inquire into the bona fides of some unknown person whether they have a claim or not, and indeed, there is a case pending before this Court, the Sniado case, where the litigants have no idea whether there's another person who has such a claim in the United States, and yet discovery has to take place on that -­ that issue.",
  "Well, in our opinion, the characterization of the market and the scope of the conspiracy is irrelevant to the reach of the antitrust laws. Their -- their domain is defined in terms of the commerce of the United States. Both the Sherman Act explicitly says commerce within the United States, among our states, and with foreign nations. The FTAIA refers to our commerce too. There was no indication that Congress was attempting to regulate commerce in other nations or between other nations with this extraordinary remedy of treble damages.",
  "Yes, Congress had in mind that -­ that this would be a bright line test whether or not our commerce was injured, defined as commerce that's domestic or import or export, and it distinguished that from wholly foreign transactions, wholly foreign commerce, and it wanted to draw that line so that these cases would be allocated to the correct judicial system in the world community and they would not all be -­",
  "It -- it makes out an injury to wholly foreign commerce. The overcharge took place in Australia, Ecuador, Panama, and the Ukraine, and it isn't enough to say there's some interrelationship among these prices. The Fifth Circuit correctly rejected that claim as a matter of law.",
  "Right.",
  "At all -­",
  "All of the people who were overcharged in the United States have been compensated in the settlement and our fines here have been geared to the overcharge -­",
  "Well, Your Honor, if -- if the FTAIA was interpreted to permit that argument, the consequences, all of the foreign claimants could come to our courts, our courts would be flooded, other nations would be antagonized, because they believe that they should be able to apply their law to those foreign transactions. It isn't enough to speculate about relationships among prices in these two systems, because the statute requires a line to be drawn between effect in the United States -­",
  "-- and effects, purely foreign commerce.",
  "Only for injury in the United States, and the House report talks about that, companies that are involved in jurisdictions -­",
  "Yes, I -- I do, because the -- the Clayton Act limits the private treble damage action to injuries stemming from a restraint on U.S. commerce, commerce among the states, and with foreign nations, not commerce that is wholly in foreign nations or between foreign nations. The injury has to flow from that which makes the conduct illegal, which is the U.S. restraint.",
  "That's correct, because if -- if the -- if the United States claimant has participated overseas in purely foreign commerce, Congress expected that that plaintiff would invoke the laws of the other nation. To the extent that it participated in U.S. commerce, Congress expected that the plaintiff would come to our courts. It was a division of judicial labors among the sovereign nations to try to encourage other nations to adopt their own antitrust laws and to avoid the kind of antagonism that we see with these amicus briefs from other countries.",
  "Well -- well, of course not, Your Honor, because the plaintiffs here -- we're talking about the Winddridge Pig Farm in -- in -- as one of the plaintiffs in Australia that's claiming it paid too much for vitamins in Australia, and the other countries wonder why -- why are they complaining about the price of vitamins in the United States court? It's a purely foreign transaction -­",
  "Well, Your Honor, first, the complaint does not allege any attempt to deal in the United States.",
  "There -- there is one case that I would refer Your Honor to. It's the Amex v. Montreal Trading case, 1981 decision from the Tenth Circuit that says it's not enough to say we might have done something different, we could have done something different, we wish we had done something different. There has to be a trading pattern.",
  "Well, the Tenth Circuit held that there had to be an interrupted course of trading before a plaintiff could make that allegation, and that's very similar to what this Court held in Holmes v. SIPC -­",
  "-- that you have to have an actual transaction that's been interrupted.",
  "Well, yes, we do rely on the second prong of the FTAIA, which requires that the particular claim derive from an anti-competitive effect in the U.S. And here it doesn't, it derives from an effect overseas, and of course, these plaintiffs don't allege that they purchased some export coming from the United States.",
  "It certainly would be, and it would be extremely speculative, and it's the sort of claim this Court has always rejected under Holmes against SIPC, under Blue Chip Stamps, in the securities context, which has been followed in the antitrust case law. It's not enough to say we might have done something different. That does not make them into participants in U.S. commerce, and Congress wanted the treble damage remedy to be available to protect our commerce. It expected other countries to adopt their own laws to deal with overcharges within their own territories, and other nations, of course, have done just that. They've passed over 100 different pieces of legislation all around the world, from Albania to Zambia, we see new antitrust laws that have been passed, and it would discourage that process if the U.S. courts attempted to subsume all of these foreign overcharge disputes into our court system.",
  "Well, there is a kind of comity that Justice Scalia referred to in the Hartford case that we think is raised here, and that is comity bearing -­ comity among nations, not judicial comity where the judges weigh various and sundry factors, but it's a rule of interpretation that -- that discourages interpretations of laws, where you have two interpretations that are available, you pick the interpretation that is most consistent with international law and which avoids antagonizing our allies and our trading partners. And that concept is very much before the Court here, and I think it argues very much in favor of the narrower interpretation, particularly because Congress was expecting that wholly foreign transactions, that's the term used in the House report, would be litigated in foreign nations, and -- and our -- our allies and trading partners -­",
  "Well, yes, we -- we think the literal language and the structure of the statute are sufficient to reverse here. But to the extent that the Court's endowed, it's very appropriate to use these traditional tools of interpretation that go all the way back to the Charming Betsy case that the Court, faced with a choice between two readings of a statute, picks the interpretation that is compatible with international law and which avoids antagonizing our allies.",
  "Well, on the latter, we have amicus briefs from seven of our -- our most significant trading partners, of allies -­",
  "That's true, but all of the foreign nations that have spoken up here agree with the United States that this is contrary to their ability to regulate commerce in their own nations. No nation -­",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Well, there are 100 nations now that do have aggressive antitrust enforcement programs, and Congress' view in 1982 was that we should draw back in our attempt to police the world because we want all these other nations to adopt these rules. That won't happen if the United States takes all of these cases into its jurisdiction. Other nations won't go the route that they -- that they were encouraged to do by Congress. And I think it's also important to consider the burden on our judicial system that the interpretation advocated by my friends would impose.",
  "Well, Your Honor, it -- these cases are difficult to administer under the best of circumstances, but consider global plaintiffs from 192 countries coming to the United States and asking a single district court judge to decide how much they've been overcharged, how much competition there was locally, what trade barriers there were that might have prevented competition, calculate the damages for every man, woman, and child on the face of the Earth that perhaps is -- has an antitrust claim.",
  "But that penalty is imposed on our district court judges. They would -- would be forced to untangle these incredibly difficult procedural problems, and how are they going to give notice to people around the globe in 192 languages with different dialects? How could we even accomplish that and how could we make sure people are actually protected in this global forum that's being advocated? U.S. courts are not world courts equipped to do this.",
  "Well, the plaintiffs here are -­ are alleging a class action of all the purchasers around the world outside of the United States, and every one of the cases that's been filed under this theory has been a class action, so that's -- that's what we're seeing. And of course, in -- in a broad array of future cases, not just price-fixing cases, but all Sherman Act cases are subject to this FTAIA regime -­",
  "I don't think the class issue has been reached in any of these cases, but they -- they are being filed. I -- I saw one just a month ago in the district court in Connecticut. It was a suit by an Indian dealership alleging it had been wrongfully terminated in India. He wanted to litigate in our courts over the propriety of that termination, claiming that dealers in the United States maybe were affected by the same thing. Well, there are lots of dealerships around the world in 192 countries, and the lure of treble damages is a powerful lure that's going to bring them to our country if these claims are accepted. With the Court's permission, we would reserve the balance of our time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The court of appeals and Mr. Goldstein have relied on the deterrence concept here, but it's important to remember that the Government, supported by seven of our allies and trading partners, has said that this position is going to undermine deterrence. Why? Because it's going to reduce the detection of international price-fixing cartels, and you get zero deterrence if you don't have actual detection of overseas cartel behavior. The key to getting the detection is the amnesty program and international cooperation with our allies, and right now, our allies are shrinking away from the United States, information-sharing agreements that are needed here to investigate and prosecute cartels. The Justice Department officials have been giving speeches about that bad effect, so there's a very serious danger of undermining deterrence here if this position is accepted. Now, on comity of nations, that is not a judicial balancing of one factor and another equitable factor. That's a rule of statutory interpretation that this Court has applied ever since the Charming Betsy case 200 years ago, and what it means is that if a particular alternative is presented that broadly construes our laws to intrude into the affairs of other nations and cause friction, that interpretation is going to be rejected, and that was certainly not rejected in the Hartford case. Professor Areta, in his treatise, pointed out that our antitrust laws do not rule the entire commercial world, and that's a concept that's written right into Section 1 of the Sherman Act. It applies to -- its domain is commerce among the states and commerce with foreign nations, not commerce within foreign nations, not commerce between foreign nations. And the reason the FTAIA drew the sharp lines that it did is the reason that Justice Breyer was driving at. Other nations have their own policies. They disapproved treble damages. They have their own procedures for dealing with antitrust issues instead of per se rules and rules of reason, they have prohibitions and then a series of exemptions applied by expert administrators. So if our courts take these issues over and apply treble damage remedies, they override procedure, they override the -- the substance of these laws, and -­ and they are certainly going to override policies against treble damages, which have provoked huge international discord in the form of claw-back statutes, blocking statutes. Our closest allies have responded to overreaching that way, and Congress wanted to minimize that problem with passage of the statute. Now, the Timken case that counsel referred to was a case where the Government was going after contracts overseas that injured our commerce. The Government was not going after practices overseas that had effects overseas and not here. Counsel referred to the weight of scholarship. I read all those articles. There's only one of them that suggests that everybody in the world can come trooping into our courts if some person here has an antitrust claim from two private practitioners who had no background in the Government. They simply asserted that without any analysis. I don't think that constitutes weighty scholarship. Now, the National Bank of Canada case that counsel referred to, if in fact that's the case that Congress meant to approve, that means they're out of court, because that's a case where the complaint was dismissed because the injury was felt in Canada and was not felt in the United States, and the Second Circuit dismissed that claim as a matter of law. Now, on this worldwide market point, the -- the statutes here hinge jurisdiction on commerce. Lawyers can always draw a global conspiracy. Economists can always say there's a global market, and these issues would be enormous quagmires for the district courts if that's what our courts' jurisdiction turned on. Congress did not intend that. It intended a clear jurisdictional benchmark by focusing on our commerce. There has to be an injury to our commerce and the plaintiff before the court has to be alleging treble damages based on that particular injury. In -- in light of these considerations, the Justice Department's position, the position of our allies, who have submitted amicus briefs, we submit that this decision is an error and it should be reversed and I thank the Court.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Judge Cudahy stated in his dissent in the Seventh Circuit that disclosure of the rule 183 report in this case should be required on both statutory and constitutional grounds. As Judge Cudahy put it, there is no item of more significance in evaluating a Tax Court's decision on fraud than the unfiltered findings of the STJ.",
  "Oh, yes, Your Honor. We believe it can.",
  "The readiest ground for decision is the statutory basis, and we believe that the statute is a good means to avoid a complex due process question. There are two statutes that are key here. One is the appellate review statute. The other is the public record statute. The public record statute says all reports of the Tax Court are public records, and we're talking about a report of the Tax Court in this case. The legislative history of that provision shows Congress had the broadest possible intent to make all practices in the Tax Court completely transparent. All steps in the adjudication were supposed to be - -",
  "We -- we don't take that position. It refers to reports of judges, and this is a report of a trial judge who heard the witnesses. The report is presumed correct under rule 183. It's the only independent evaluation of witness credibility - -",
  "-- and the only judge - -",
  "Yes.",
  "There is only one rule 183 report. Under the rule, it's the report the trial judge prepares and submits to the chief judge at the completion of the trial, which contains his independent credibility findings.",
  "Under rule 183(b) there is a report denominated as such. There's no question here it was submitted to the court. If you look at page 114a of the Kanter appendix, it says that the special trial judge submitted a report, as required by rule 183(b). And this case was then referred to Judge Dawson. He had no involvement with the case until this report was given to him.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Oh. It's the petition for cert. The Kanter petition.",
  "114a, 114a. And throughout - -",
  "Yes.",
  "That's correct, Your Honor. And it's - -",
  "-- it is presumed correct.",
  "Absolutely. This is a report that must be submitted. It is presumed correct under this rule. It's an independent evaluation of credibility from the only judge who heard the witnesses, and of course, it's part of the record. And it doesn't - -",
  "And it doesn't make the slightest difference that the superior judge caused the subordinate judge to say, I have changed my mind at a later stage in the proceeding, because it is the original report that is presumed correct under the rules.",
  "That's -- that's appendix 4a.",
  "Yes, it's the rule itself, 183(b). And it makes it clear that there must be a report filed with the chief judge. The docket here says that that was done.",
  "The first -- there is only one - -",
  "The rules are silent on that, but Judge Dawson has no involvement in the case until the report is submitted. Then the case is assigned to Judge Dawson, and then he is supposed to review it under a presumptive correctness standard. So it would be surprising if there were consultation of that sort. But what we contend is if there is consultation behind the scenes about credibility determinations, then it is critically important that the report be submitted and made part of the record and not concealed, and that the deferential standard of review be - -",
  "I suppose that's a possibility, but in Anderson, the Court said absent some procedure like that, the trial judge is uniquely situated to evaluate demeanor and tone of voice, and because of that, great deference has to be given to the independent evaluation of the trial judge. Maybe in a -- in the future the Tax Court would want to use a procedure like that to mitigate the Raddatz problem that they now have.",
  "Yes, they -- they might, and - -",
  "That's correct, and after all, we should remember that the Government was supposed to present clear and convincing evidence of fraud in this case, and if there was a flip-flop of this sort going on behind the scenes, leaving no trace in the record, what could be more important to the reviewing court than to know what had occurred at the first stage and the second stage here? If the trial judge found no underpayment and no fraud, which we have reason to believe he did -- three Tax Court judges stated that to us -- if that was -- that was his finding and he found our witnesses to be credible, then an unexplained overturning of that credibility determination with no trace in the record would surely be a candidate for reversal on appeal.",
  "Well, we haven't challenged the conversations as such. We think it is -- it is suspect, however. Under Raddatz, if somebody who has not heard the witnesses is telling somebody who has heard the witnesses, I don't agree or I think you may be wrong in your credibility determination, I'd like you to reconsider that, that's a serious Raddatz problem. And the only cure for that is to make the first report part of the record.",
  "The - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, I think the rule is silent on that, but the spirit of the rule, frankly, is that the STJ does his job. He completes his report. He submits it, and the reviewing judge examines it under a presumed- correct standard in -- in the same orderly fashion that ordinarily occurs when there is an initial judgment from a -- from a trial judge about credibility with deferential review that comes later. But the rule doesn't tell us much about these consultations, and we do submit that if -- if they do take place, as the Government suggests, there's importuning and changing of minds going on through consultations, do this on record. Turn square corners because it would be quite important to the appellate court to know if there was a good reason for the overturning of these credibility determinations. And we -- we've seen that kind of review in the Stone case in the D.C. Circuit, which is very similar to this case. Factually the cases are quite similar. And the reviewing court, Judge Williams, found clear error based on what the rule 183 report stated about witness credibility. There was an elaborate explanation why particular witnesses were credible and incredible, and the court could use that to evaluate the judgment of the Tax Court.",
  "Well, that's true. They could cease using the STJ's, but - -",
  "I -- I suppose that could happen. If there is -- if there is no report written, we couldn't contend it has to be disclosed under these statutes, and that -- that might be. But it -- there could be a Raddatz issue in that scenario that you present, Justice Scalia. If one judge heard the witnesses and the other judge didn't hear the witnesses and -- and the -- the superior judge - -",
  "But it -- it would be -- it would be quite strange to have credibility determinations made by a judge who had never heard from any of the witnesses.",
  "Oh, yes.",
  "The -- the closest analogy in this Court's decisions is the Morgan II decision.",
  "Now, Morgan II is really on point because there, a subordinate official drafted up findings, proposed findings, didn't serve them on the parties, but did give them to the decision-maker, the agency. And this Court held that was a violation of due process.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "And -- and every administrative body that we know of in the Federal courts and in the State system too -- Chief Judge Vanderbilt pointed that out in the Mazza case. Every State in the Union requires disclosure of these administrative law decisions to the parties.",
  "Yes. Well, we -- we've avoided suggesting that any depositions should be taken of -- of judicial personnel here. That's not our view. Our view is simply that the report that was prepared -- it was prepared -- should be made part of the record by virtue of two statutes. There is an appellate review statute, Justice O'Connor, that states quite expressly that Congress expected review to take place here just as it does in the district court, to the same degree, to the same extent, and in the same manner. And in the district court, if an adjunct judge makes a finding of fact, whether it's a master or a magistrate or bankruptcy judge, that is always disclosed to the parties.",
  "We don't know what is contained in that first report. We have heard from three of the judges, including the chief judge of the STJ's, that - - that what happened was that Judge Dawson rewrote the credibility findings. Now, we won't know until we see this. That could be wrong. But -- but it should be part of the record for the court of appeals.",
  "Well, you'll see in perhaps a dozen situations, he says, I simply don't believe that witness, none of whom he heard. And this is a case where credibility was key. Was there a bribery scheme of the kind that the IRS claimed? Every witness who testified said no, it didn't exist. These are simple investments with the proceeds being paid to the corporations, and yet, the Government's theory was there is some nefarious bribery scheme that every witness denied. And there is no documentary evidence of that. The evidence of the proceeds flowing to these corporations was simply the result of their investing money in real estate deals. And so credibility was the key to this whole case. And the -- the Government, I don't think, can be serious when it tells this Court that this first report is some confidential document, that it's privileged internal deliberative material. For 40 years, the -- the Tax Court made these reports available to the public. It -- they were routinely served on the parties. For 40 years there was no suggestion - -",
  "Oh, yes. That's a post hoc rationale. There was no such explanation when this rule was changed, and there's not a bit of work or a bit of expense resulting from our position. We simply ask for a copy of a report that exists. They can serve it on us electronically. It won't cost them a cent. We're making a very modest request under these statutes and under the Due Process Clause. And there was no explanation - -",
  "Well, we defer to - -",
  "It -- it really is not. We're asking - -",
  "To give -- and make it part of the appellate record. We're not asking for any remand to the Tax Court. If the Tax Court doesn't - -",
  "Well, we -- we just rely on that as an example of the need to disclose this at an appropriate juncture.",
  "Well, in Morgan II, the -- the point was that any -- any proposed findings that are drafted up have to be shared with the parties. Now, there they had to be shared with the parties at the administrative level. We're not going that far. If the Tax Court tells us that they don't want to have that layer of review within the Tax Court, they don't want to receive our comments on the initial report, that's fine with us. We want it to be made part of the appellate record so that the judges who are interested in this and believe it will shed a strong light on the issue of clear and convincing evidence can have this be part of the record. And already the Fifth Circuit has overturned the finding of fraud in this very same case.",
  "Yes. We'd be satisfied because that is a sufficient basis to say the record has to include the rule 183 report. And it is not up to the trial court to tell the appellate court what's in the record on appeal. It's up to the appellate court to -- to determine what goes into that -- that record. This -- the case in the Second Circuit on that is IBM v. United States where the Second Circuit analyzed rule 10(a) and said it is not the province of the trial court to dictate to the reviewing court what is in that record. And this Court in - -",
  "Oh, yes. It's rule 10(a) and it's -- it's very general. It says that all the original papers in the trial court come before the appellate court, and an original report is an original document submitted in the trial court. And this Court confronted that question in Universal Camera 50 years ago, and the Government made the same arguments then that it's making now and it lost 7 to 2 in that case. It -- it said that the report - -",
  "It goes back.",
  "The same argument was made that the report is an irrelevance. It's just an aid to the decision-maker, and the decision-maker can do what it wants and has ultimate judgmental power. So there's no need to include that report in the record, and no weight should be given to it. This Court said, we will not adopt an exclusionary rule for the administrative law judge's report. And this is an a fortiori case because this report is presumed correct. In Universal Camera, there was no presumption of correctness at all. So that -- that case, you know, goes further than -- than what the Court has to do here. And the Government's argument that -- that somehow this is - -",
  "Well, yes, that's true. But, you know, the Court reached out to the APA for guidance in construing the labor laws. The labor laws were silent on this issue, but under the APA, the Court said the general policy is to disclose these reports and we are going to say that that is applicable to the NLRB. Now, the Government says all of this changes the course because the judge changed his mind, but you know, there are so many opinions and orders and reports in the Federal judicial system where a mind is changed and an opinion is suppressed or -- or vacated or replaced and that first opinion is still part of the record. It's a fallacy to say it's not part of the record just because it's been abandoned. For example, if I seek summary judgment in the district court and it's denied and then I ask for reconsideration and it's granted, the opinion has been abandoned, but it's still part of the record. And if I - - if an appeal is taken, it's going to be exhibit A in any appeal, and it may result in a reversal. Same thing when a case goes en banc. The panel opinion is vacated, but then when -- when cert is granted, the argument before this Court may convince this Court that the panel was right. Even though it's been abandoned, it's still very important. Or if a jury verdict is set aside -- the -- the district court says, judgment as a matter of law -- on appeal, the jury -- jury verdict may get sustained. So it's just a logical fallacy to say that because somebody has changed his mind, if that's what happened here, that -- that the first report drops out of the record.",
  "Oh, yes, and -- and the remarkable thing is that every time it does that, it recites, we hereby adopt the findings and opinions of the trial judge. Now, in the old days, that was not a problem.",
  "Oh, no. They -- they do modify and reject. It's just it's hard to determine, when they are doing that. In the old days --",
  "They don't --",
  "Yes. That's entirely correct. And now, in the old days, before they amended the rule, you could compare the two and see what was changed, but now you can't. You can't tell what has been changed. And in this instance, we believe there's been a complete rewrite of that first report, and the appellate courts can't tell what's going on. Was there a reason for doing this? Was deference given? Was some other agenda at work in this decision? No one can tell because it is all off the record.",
  "Well, I -- I haven't either. But the judge here certainly was subordinate and - -",
  "Yes, he was.",
  "He -- he is a subordinate because as the Government keeps telling us, the Tax Court judge is the only official spokesman for the court. They get to make the final judgment. And the Tax Court judge reviews what the STJ has done.",
  "Oh - -",
  "Yes, and this a court. This is an Article I court, this Court has held. And Congress has created very specific appellate review procedures for this court.",
  "That's correct. He -- those judges could be terminated at will, including because there is not sufficient work for the judge. They can be terminated on that basis. And that, we think, colors the analysis here for the reasons Judge Cudahy gave. This is not an independent judge. When he is persuaded by his superior to change his mind, it's obvious that he -- in our view, that he's going to be heavily influenced by that. It's a serious Raddatz problem. The only cure is to make this part of the record and to enforce the rule 183 presumption of correctness, which creates a clear error standard of review. I see my time has run out. May I reserve the rest for - -",
  "The question came up whether rule 183 forbids disclosure of this report. The answer is it does not forbid disclosure of the report. It is silent on the point. But the press release the Tax Court issued in 1983, coming from the chief judge of the court, said that this simply meant that it would not automatically be disclosed.",
  "Well --",
  "Our view is that of -- of the Tax Court means any report emanating from the Tax Court. That's the literal meaning of that language. It doesn't mean final.",
  "There's an exception for the en banc situation because legal issues are addressed en banc, not the factual issues. And there's an opportunity to dissent.",
  "Oh, we say there's a special statute dealing with the en banc situation that -- that governs in that situation. And that the publicity - -",
  "That -- that's the en banc provision that counsel referred to that said that when the case is heard en banc, the trial -- the -- the single judge's report is not made part of the record. Congress' assumption there was that there would be a new -- new report issued. People would be able to dissent if they disagreed. And this process focuses on legal issues. There is no presumption of correctness.",
  "Yes, but it addresses legal issues. It's not a device to second guess factual determinations, and there's a special statute that deals with that, which does not apply to this STJ situation, where there's a presumption of correctness applicable to what the trial judge does. And there is the general disclosure statute that applies there.",
  "I think you're right, and --",
  "Well, I -- I think that the intent of this provision -- and I know Your Honor consults the legislative history. The intent was to make all of the steps in the adjudicative process transparent, including the evidence, including the -- the stenographer's report, and all reports from the Tax Court.",
  "Well, we believe that the word all is a broad, generic inclusive term that should be applied, as Judge Cudahy stated, to an STJ report that actually has to be submitted to the chief judge and that has legal effect. It's not just a casual document like a law clerk memorandum. It has legally operative effect. Congress' purpose here was very broad, to have transparency, applicable to all the steps along the way in the Tax Court. It was quite clear on that, that there are arbitrary actions at each step of the way. If you look at the Senate report and Congressman LaGuardia's statements, they said secrecy is a vicious practice in this context, and it -- it should be avoided.",
  "Absolutely, Your Honor. There - - there are three separate bases for ruling in our favor. One is the appellate review statute. The other is the disclosure statute. The third is due process. And due process should inform the construction of these statutes. This Court tries to avoid serious due process issues through its interpretation of legislation. Judge Cudahy suggested that was the right way to decide this case and we agree that it is. We thank the Court.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The pivotal question in this case is whether this Court's decisions in Gordon and NASD require implied antitrust immunity as the district court believed. And we submit that the answer is yes. The '33 and '34 acts were of course passed for the very purpose of regulating IPOs and alleged market manipulation. And this Court has referred to these laws as the anchor of Federal economic policy in the securities field. And under these laws the SEC has laid down detailed regulations applicable to the very practices that are at issue in this case with active supervision by the SEC and the NASD. And it has done this with full understanding that syndicated underwriting is inherently concerted action. An underwriting requires joint action in accumulating information and setting the price of the offering along with allotting shares to customers. Now the Gordon and NASD cases apply directly here because of the danger of inconsistency and conflict which the SEC cited. As in cases of this Court in the past, like NASD and Gordon and later Trinko, Congress required this expert administrative agency to take competition into account when issuing its standards. And review in antitrust courts across the country would once again raise the danger of false positives and conflicts and wasteful redundancy.",
  "Oh, no, Your Honor, it is very express in 75 and then again in the 96. Capital formation, investor protection and competition have to be weighed against each other by the SEC, and in Gordon this Court attached great importance to that standard, which differs from the competition first standard of, the antitrust laws impose.",
  "The SEC regulates the -- the alleged tie-ins and it regulates the alleged excessive compensation claims.",
  "Laddering, tying, and excessive compensation. And it's had a number of enforcement actions. Its regulation M is focused exactly on those practices. It's issued very detailed guidance in a document that we attach to our petition appendix on what constitutes - -",
  "Well the SEC has said it depends on the circumstances. And they draw very fine lines in this area, Your Honor. And if, in fact, the SEC concludes it is a tie-in under its finely calibrated standards, then yes. But that's the critical issue here. It is very easy to term these things excessive compensation or tie-ins, but when the NASD looked at a real complaint of this sort in the Invemed case it found that there was no excessive compensation and no commercial bribery. And - -",
  "In this case it took no position on the merit of the underlying claims, but it said that there would be serious problems if antitrust law were applied to these allegations. It would interfere with the agency's ability to define what is manipulation and to amend its definitions. It has ongoing rulemaking proceedings right now addressed to this issue; and it said further that it would discourage underwriters from going up to the line of prohibition, which is very important in this area. Because if they don't step over the line and they engage in book building conversations, that's critical to setting the right price for the IPO. And so --",
  "We think part of the repugnance analysis here should focus on the fact that these securities claims have simply been repleaded as antitrust claims. Congress wasn't aware of any problem of this sort; nobody had attempted to replead securities violations like tie-ins and excessive compensation as antitrust claims. And Congress of course relied - -",
  "It doesn't refer to antitrust cases. Those were references to state law remedies that Congress later contracted with the - -",
  "No. They referred to other claims, Your Honor, but they don't refer to antitrust. So we don't believe - -",
  "We don't believe - -",
  "Pardon me?",
  "I don't believe the Court did.",
  "They -- well, they -- they don't pertain to antitrust. If you look at the history of those provisions they are talking about state causes of action and there's no reference to antitrust as such in them. That's quite different from Trinko where there was an antitrust savings clause that went on in detail about saving the antitrust cause of action. The danger of conflict that the SEC is talking about here is an acute danger to its ability to --",
  "Well, Your Honor, the reason it doesn't get mentioned is in that Gordon the Court held primary jurisdiction was not a fix for this kind of conflict. And here the SEC has expressed its opinion in its amicus briefs already. The Court is aware of those positions laid out in our cert petition - -",
  "Well, Your Honor, the conflict is different, but it's really quite a more serious conflict than it was in Gordon. In Gordon the only concern was the SEC might reinstitute fixed rates in the future, and it never did that in 30 years. Here the SEC says the conflict goes to our ability to define manipulation and to amend our rules which we're in the process of doing and we can't have conduct deterred.",
  "Well, the SEC in the lower courts advocated dismissal of the complaints; and in the Supreme Court, of course, they've -- they've urged for a vacator of the lower court decision. And the brief of the SG echoes many of the concerns that the SEC expressed in the lower courts.",
  "Well, I think Gordon is very informative on that point. It rejected primary jurisdiction because the agency's views were already known to the Court. Here the SEC has filed a 40-page submission in the district court explaining that the suit has to be dismissed because of conflict with the administrative scheme.",
  "Absolutely. The particular conduct at issue - -",
  "Well, what this Court said in Gordon was that it's a legal question whether there is potential interference with the administrative scheme for us to decide the SEC's views are entitled to considerable deference, the Court said. But if they've been submitted in the form of amicus briefs, that is sufficient to demonstrate the repugnance.",
  "That's absolutely right. In that case, where the Court did refer an antitrust issue, the agency declined to take the reference. And here there there was a factual issue the agency was supposed to opine on. Here we have a pure legal question, the Court has held, of potential repugnance with the SEC scheme. That's for the Court to decide.",
  "Well, what the SEC says is that if the conduct is ordinary book building, communications about future transactions, at future prices, there's no misconduct to be disclosed. It is perfectly permissible.",
  "The complaint alleges an antitrust violation. Just that there was agreement to engage in tie-ins, and an agreement not to - -",
  "That certainly highlights why this is an SEC case and not an antitrust case, it seems to me, because that -- disclosure is for this administrative agency to wrestle with, and it has made clear that investor welfare will be harmed and issuer welfare will be harmed if these sensitive questions are taken from it and are frozen by antitrust judgments. That was the problem the Court faced in NASD and it was the problem the Court faced in Gordon.",
  "Well, in part, I would say yes, there was an agreement in restraint of trade - -",
  "Yeah, that's their theory.",
  "Really what they are alleging is a conspiracy to violate the securities laws here, that had some -- what they claim, a market effect. And it is the agreement that they contend is an unreasonable restraint of trade or they refer to the compensation payments as excessive commercial bribes. They say that violates the Robinson-Patman Act. The trouble is no matter how you phrase this, no matter how they could amend their pleading, inherent in the case are challenges to tie-ins and alleged excessive compensation payments that under the securities laws have to be regulated by the SEC. The Government has to speak with one voice on this issue under one set of standards, or administrative law gets frozen. And there's a huge deterrent effect on underwriters.",
  "Oh, yes. Under these two decisions of the Court, NASD and Gordon, there has to be active supervision or pervasive regulation by the agency, and then a direct conflict with what the SEC is trying to accomplish. There are a number of things that can be regulated even under the antitrust laws under those standards. NASD and Gordon didn't stop all antitrust litigation in its tracks. Only things that were within the agency's supervisory jurisdiction to present - -",
  "I think that's right, Your Honor. The '33 Act, if you look at the Act, every provision in it is focused on IPOs. It is state of the art comprehensive legislation. The '34 Act in three separate provisions gives the SEC power to define manipulation. Then it has rulemaking power and then it has exemption power. This is comprehensive. It is far more pervasive than the kind of regulation that was before the Court in NASD. In that case, there was just unexercised rulemaking power. Here we have got voluminous regulations, we have interpretations, we have many enforcement actions aimed at this very same conduct.",
  "Well, the Government says - -",
  "We think immunity extends beyond what is expressly permitted by the SEC. The way the Court phrased it in NASD was things that are connected to the agency's regulatory responsibility have to be immunized to allow the agency to do its task. And that extends a little bit further than the permission standard that the Government has given. And there - -",
  "I would think it does. I would think the NASD case would come out the other way under the standard the SG is using today. But we think we win under the inextricably intertwined standard, because all of this conduct is closely connected to what is permissible. There's a very fine line between what is forbidden and what is permitted. They can ask about future market prices. They can give the IPOs to their best customers, but they can't solicit a transaction in the immediate aftermarket while the IPO is still - -",
  "We would win under either of these standards. But what we advocate is dismissal with prejudice, which is the relief the Court gave in the NASD case, and not a shapeless remand of the case for further pleading. And the reason for that is that the interference would overhang the market. The interference would affect the SEC's ability to lay down the standards and encourage conduct going up to the line of prohibition. And the remedy that the Court approved in NASD is exactly appropriate here, dismissal with prejudice. These plaintiffs did not even seek to amend their complaints in the lower courts. Under Second Circuit law, they've waived their right to seek an amendment. So we, in sum, urge the Court to stick with its own standards in NASD and Gordon. The standards are not broken. They don't need to be fixed. Nobody has pointed to any changed circumstances that would warrant a change in this Court's decisions, and those decisions require dismissal with prejudice. If there are no further questions, we'd reserve the balance of our time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The key question in this litigation is who's going to design what a tie-in is and who's going to decide what constitutes unreasonable compensation. The plaintiffs say quite overtly in their briefs these issues can't be left in the hands of the SEC. Well, Congress put these issues in the hands of the SEC. There are three separate provisions that give the SEC power to define what is forbidden manipulation, what is a forbidden tie-in, and what is excessive compensation. The SEC this Court has said is an agency that Congress had considerable confidence in in the Gordon case and that confidence is well justified here.",
  "Our test is the one the Court laid down in those two cases: Is there active supervision or is there pervasive regulation? If the answer is yes to either of those, you ask, is there a potential conflict, and if so immunity applies and the complaint has to be dismissed. And this is true whether you're talking about one IPO or an agreement that cuts across several IPOs, because even in the multiple IPO situation the jury would still have to decide, was that a tie-in or was it something innocent; was it unreasonable compensation or was it something that was proper?",
  "Well - -",
  "The same circumstances were presented very similar to the NASD in the Invemed case. They had a Three-week trial, 17 experts, and they concluded that those charges were quite permissible considering the whole range of services that were given. Now, if this occurred with concerted action the SEC has power to deal with concerted action. Congress said that they could deal with multiple party manipulations. They have many cases where they proceeded against multiple parties. In the NASD case the claim was that there was a horizontal conspiracy involving many brokers and many underwriters, it was industrywide, it went on for years and years. And the Government argued there it was improper, it was contrary to the SEC's policies this. This Court held squarely that that is within the SEC's power to regulate and if something of that sort is occurring the SEC can deal with it. The test there wasn't whether it was connected to something that was permissible. The test was whether it was connected to the SEC's regulatory responsibilities and the SEC could deal with that sort of concerted action on an industrywide basis. Now, Mr. Lovell has argued that the conduct has always been forbidden. He labels it that way. There are many case from this Court that we cite in our reply brief holding that that labeling does not defeat immunity because it's always possible to characterize conduct in that fashion. But the agency has to apply its expertise to decide what is forbidden and to change its rules over time, which the SEC is now doing. And it has to be able to prevent, deterring conduct that comes up to the line of prohibition. Here that conduct is essential to protect investors and to protect issuers. The markets couldn't function efficiently if underwriters could not engage freely in the kinds of conversations that get twisted in this litigation into something characterized as tie-ins. Now, there are 310 private suits now pending under the securities laws brought by many of these same lawyers, making the same claims of concerted action to manipulate the stock market. Those suits are subject to a panoply of safeguards that Congress has prescribed, including single damages, restrictions on class action abuse, serious loss causation requirements. The only purpose for stretching the antitrust laws here is to evade all of the safeguards that Congress has passed, each and every one of them. We think NASD and Gordon are very important in preventing that kind of a pleading tactic. And of course, when counsel talks about concerted action and manipulating the stock market, what did Congress pass the '34 Act for if it wasn't that? There were extensive hearings about concerted manipulation involving pools and groups that were manipulating the market. That's why there are several anti-manipulation provisions in the '34 Act that give Power to define the misconduct and to deal with it effectively. And this is the toughest cop in Washington, the SEC. They're perfectly capable of dealing with this.",
  "We thank the Court.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: My friend has just asked the Court to expand an implied cause of action by diluting traditional requirements such as the reliance requirement and by eroding this Court's precedent in the Central Bank case. The Court has said in the past that it must be very cautious about expanding implied causes of action, but here there are special reasons for caution. Expanding the implied cause of action would give plaintiff the very thing that Congress said it should not get in section 20(e) of the Exchange Act. handled by an expert and disinterested administrative agency.",
  "The Central Bank case, I believe, answers that by saying to be a primary violator you have to satisfy all the prerequisites of 10(b) liability, including reliance, loss causation, the \"in-connection-with\" standard. And here plaintiffs fail to meet these tests. And Congress in 20(e) --",
  "Yes. That's one of the arguments we make. It is this case is governed by Central Bank because the defendant did not use or employ deception in connection with a securities transaction. That exactly describes what Charter did. Now, what exactly describes what the vendors are alleged to do is what is said in 20(e) -- to that is misleading an investor. That fits this case like a glove --",
  "We don't make these arguments without reference to each other. We think all of these statutory terms have to be viewed together. You have to use deception in connection with securities trading, which these vendors did not do. That's what Charter did. And --",
  "Well, we have -- we have suggested that that is not true when you're speaking with somebody that knows the facts such as Charter. Charter understood all these facts. Charter could have vendors did that. They didn't recognize any revenues here. It was up to Charter to account for these transactions properly. Congress required it to do that, so it is the speaker here.",
  "Well, we believe even placing that most pejorative characterization on these facts, which we don't agree are the true facts, that still --",
  "Assuming that they are, that this is a 20(e) situation where it is alleged that the vendors gave substantial, knowing assistance to somebody who was committing a fraud. And Congress said that an expert and disinterested administrative agency should decide whether to proceed, because it is so slippery to apply these characterizations.",
  "Well, you know that's an exact description of Central Bank because there it was alleged that the trustee entered --",
  "-- into a secret agreement.",
  "Well, the --",
  "What was conceded was that the bank made no statement to investors, but what was alleged in the complaint and argued in the briefs was that the bank entered into a secret side agreement that enabled the use of a fraudulent prospectus that unleashed securities that were worthless on investors, and investors said, we were depending on our trustee to prevent that from happening.",
  "Well, we -- we think that for reliance purposes, there --",
  "-- the defendant has to communicate with investors.",
  "It has to be communicated to the investors and it has to be attributed under the case law to the speaker.",
  "That -- that kind of but-for causation is not sufficient. That is not reliance. That kind of --",
  "That is one of our submissions, but we also say that the substance of these statements was never communicated to investors. Only Charter --",
  "-- spoke to the investors and never summarized these.",
  "Yes?",
  "But the -- the communication, Your Honor, has to be to the market and to investors. There was no duty to disclose to investors here. The only communications the vendors made were \"we're raising 31st, for the simple reason that it started the very next day” --",
  "-- on September 1st.\"",
  "Oh, of course. There was economic substance from the vendors' perspective. They were selling their products at exactly the price that they wanted to receive for those products and they were getting some free cooperative advertising thrown in at the same time.",
  "Well, it's true because they weren't concerned with that because they weren't paying for it. Charter was paying for this cooperative -- cooperative advertising, the reason being --",
  "-- that Charter had a big interest.",
  "Well, Your Honor, from the vendors' perspective, this was a transaction that appeared to be a way to increase cooperative advertising. It cost the vendors no money. They were told by Charter that Arthur Andersen had approved the transaction. That's alleged in the Barford indictment. Then they went home and talked to their own auditors -- how do you account for this unusual transaction? The auditors said, you cannot record any revenues from the transaction. They didn't record any revenues. They expected Charter to do the same thing, to not record revenues --",
  "-- if that's what the rules required.",
  "Yes, they -- they do allege. I'm merely pointing out that in the Barford -- your answer doesn't seem to be -- get us very far on a legal point.",
  "Well, we say that if you take the complaint at face value and you don't even consider the Barford indictment that they cite, that it still is a classic example of knowingly giving substantial assistance to someone else that is making misstatements to investors, because these vendors didn't make any misstatement to investors. Nobody relied on their sales correspondence. It sat in a file drawer until long after the stock had gone all the way up and come all the way down.",
  "But Congress's policy judgment here is that the SEC, an expert agency that is impartial, should evaluate a claim of that sort and decide whether to proceed.",
  "Well --",
  "You are only a primary violator under -- under Central Bank if each and every element of 10b-5 liability is satisfied, including reliance on your statement, including the \"in-connection-with\" test, and including loss causation. None of those tests are satisfied here, but what is satisfied is section 20(e), which says, did they knowingly give substantial assistance to somebody who is committing a fraud? And that -- that fits this case like a glove --",
  "-- if Congress wanted the SEC to address --",
  "It really depends on --",
  "-- on the circumstances.",
  "Some attorneys are control persons within corporations, and in-house counsel that drafts the disclosure statement which contains a falsehood may be liable as in the McConville case, which the Court recently considered. Individuals may be liable --",
  "It -- it's possible. Your Honor, at the end of your --",
  "Absolutely --",
  "Yes, sir. The reason --",
  "The reason is they issued opinions that were circulated to investors, that were attributed to them and which were authorized by them, and if a lawyer does the same thing, if Steve Shapiro writes an opinion letter and circulates it to investors and it's full of falsehoods --",
  "-- I can be held liable for that --",
  "-- as a speaker.",
  "Only people who speak to the market --",
  "-- and induce investor reliance.",
  "Well --",
  "That is just aiding and abetting, and in fact Congress dealt with that squarely in section 303 --",
  "Yes.",
  "That is not sufficient. Congress addressed that in section 303 of Sarbanes-Oxley, and it held that any person -- said any person including a vendor that misleads an auditor can be held liable in an SEC proceeding only, not in a private suit. It excluded private actions.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "The word \"exclusively\" is in there --",
  "-- and my --",
  "We rely on 20(e) and 303 of",
  "It's talking about an aider and abettor that misleads an auditor and then --",
  "-- the auditor issues a false certification.",
  "Well -- oh, no --",
  "Your Honor, there are other persons that are control persons within a company who are liable.",
  "Independent actors that don't speak to the markets and cause direct reliance on their own statements are aiders and abettors. And they are supposed to be dealt with by the SEC, an expert agency. Now, my -- you know, my friend made the clause in that provision that preserves other remedies. But if you look at the legislative history, it says explicitly we are preserving SEC remedies. We want the SEC to pursue these suits. And Congress refused in 2002 in Sarbanes-Oxley to reinstate the aiding-and-abetting private liability cause of action.",
  "I don't know the answer. Although in these statutes themselves there are such provisions not included in section 10(b). For example in section 18(a), if you cause some other person to make a false statement in a financial statement, you can be held liable, but they are not invoking it in section 18. Same thing under section 17. If you engage in a scheme to cause some falsehood, you can be prosecuted by the government. But nowhere has Congress said that an individual litigant can bring a claim like that without regard for reliance and \"in connection with\" and the loss causation test. reliance and loss causation. Let me ask a question very similar to what Justice Ginsburg has posed a couple of times. She has said is there a third category. My question is, is there an overlap? Can there be an overlap?",
  "No, I don't think there can be.",
  "Because Congress intended in section 20(e) to have an expert agency address these cases and not to have the trial --",
  "We believe they are separate categories and that Central Bank tells us exactly who the primary violator is. He is somebody who makes a statement that investors rely on in connection with securities transactions, and that is not these vendors. That is exactly what section 20(e) addresses and commits --",
  "Absolutely. Absolutely. We don't quarrel over that, Justice Scalia.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Well, it's primary because there is the communication to the market that's missing here.",
  "You can call it -- both of those things. isn't there the kind of overlap which raises the question that Justice Ginsburg has raised?",
  "You can't have primary liability, which they are asserting here, without the statement to the market. And it can be a statement by conduct, and it can be by nodding of the head.",
  "Oh, yes. Nodding the head is the same thing as saying yes. But it has to be made directly to an investor and cause reliance by that investor. That's what's missing here. So there is nothing wrong with the Eighth Circuit's decision. It didn't address that refinement, because it has no bearing on this case. So there is no point in reversing the decision. It has to be affirmed in our view for want of reliance, for want of loss causation, for lack of \"in connection with\", and because most importantly, Congress intended to remove this category of case and commit it to an expert agency as part of its very important reform effort to deal with excessive litigation that was harming our economy. This was an important concept for Congress. in 2002, in the Sarbanes-Oxley law. And it removed even claims that you mislead an auditor under section 303 of Sarbanes-Oxley. And there is no savings clause there for private actions. Congress refused to permit the private actions. Instead, it permitted the SEC to bring intentional misconduct cases under section 20(e) or negligent misconduct cases under section 303 or under section 13. And the SEC has a broad panoply of remedies. It doesn't have to just allege intentional --",
  "Well, the SEC's view is the one rejected by the Solicitor General, and that's this purpose-and-effect standard that's been advocated, which we think is hopelessly vague. And it overrides the reliance requirement. It overrides the \"in connection with\" requirement. And it overrides loss causation, not to mention Central Bank.",
  "Because the Court there said that even though the bank did something that was a secret agreement that facilitated the issuer's distribution of a false prospectus and caused all the harm to the shareholders, it was a direct sine qua non cause of all of that harm, that that was merely aiding and abetting, because there was no reliance on anything that the bank stated or anything that the bank had a duty to state because of a fiduciary relationship. Now, the vendors here are even far more removed from investors than the bank was in Central Bank. The investors knew about the bank in Central Bank, and they were relying on it to do its job. But that was not sufficient because it made no statement that the investors relied on. There is no communication here between these vendors and investors. There is no way you could --",
  "It's the private cause of action. An important point, Justice Stevens, because the SEC is not burdened with any of these elusive of indirect reliance; none of that burdens the SEC. And the SEC also has power to distribute funds to investors. This is the better mousetrap that Congress prescribed for these kinds of cases. It didn't want the trial lawyers to bring class actions that always result in settlements.",
  "We thank the Court.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We are here today because the Oregon court failed to follow this Court's directions on remand and because the ground it gave is not adequate to show a forfeiture of due process rights. This -- this Court vacated after finding that the Oregon Supreme Court applied the wrong constitutional standard, and it remanded with directions to apply the standard that the Court laid out. But the Oregon court didn't do that. It never even addressed the constitutional issue. The Oregon court, of course, refused to follow this Court's direction because it believed there were mistakes in another paragraph in our instruction request dealing with what the court referred to as \"unrelated issues.\" But that isn't what this Court mandated. And the specific forfeiture theory adopted here for the first time after nine years of appellate litigation is completely inadequate to avoid this mandate.",
  "Yes, Your Honor. We believe that this disposition is quite inconsistent with what the Court mandated. The Court heard arguments in this case about the \"correct in all respects\" rule, but it still mandated an application of the constitutional standard, including the prohibition on punishment for harm to non-parties, and that standard simply was never applied. We say that is inconsistent with this Court's opinion.",
  "Well, we don't say that the court can never adopt a State law standard after remand from this Court, but we say that this disposition is inconsistent - -",
  "Well, because the preservation issue was debated before this Court and it adopted a specific order here saying on remand now consider the constitutional standard, which is the prohibition on - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, Your Honor, this is very similar to what occurred in the Sullivan case in this Court, where the issue of preservation was debated before this Court at the cert stage in the cert papers, and the Court said: We sub silentio passed on the adequacy of the State ground when we CDRed the case.",
  "Well, that takes us to our second and principal argument, which is that that ground would not be adequate under this Court's criteria for adequacy. And we say that there are really three reasons why that would not be an adequate ground for forfeiting this constitutional right. It's an ambush. It was a surprise ruling that we couldn't anticipate. It is an exercise in futility because, even if we submitted a perfect instruction that complied with that rule, we would have been rejected anyway by the trial court that simply believed that this instruction wasn't required by the - -",
  "Well, no. The Oregon Supreme --",
  "Your Honor, this Court has said repeatedly that adequacy is a Federal law question for this Court to decide.",
  "Well, there are two reasons. First under the adequacy decisions of this Court, including Lee v. Kemna, if it takes years and years after the trial to articulate a forfeiture rule like this that counts heavily against the adequacy of the State ground. This Court held that in Lee v. Kemna very recently. And then secondly, this is a point that was argued to this Court four separate times now and when the Court remanded with explicit directions to apply the constitutional standard that's something that had to be done on remand. The Court did not invite the lower court to get into the question of whether this request was made. The Court found that the request was made.",
  "Yes, there is a good reason, because this is -- adequacy is ultimately a Federal question for this Court to decide. The issue was debated here four separate times at great length. The Court remanded for a specific decision by the lower court. That wasn't done. And if we turn to the adequacy doctrine - -",
  "Whether or not there was an adequate State ground because of the \"correct in all respects\" rule. That was debated in the merits brief, in the cert oppositions twice. It was debated again in the cert opposition this time around. But the Court has never accepted it.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Well, because, Your Honor, the Court considered, just as it did in Sullivan, it considered these issues in the cert papers and then remanded the case for a different issue to be decided by the lower court. But we don't hesitate from debating the adequacy issue.",
  "No. What the Court said in Sullivan was that it was a sub silentio determination.",
  "Because the parties debated this extensively in their briefs.",
  "Yes. That's true. This -- this, as the Court expressed it, was a slight extension of the previous decisions. But Your Honor, if the Court feel that this adequacy issue hasn't been dealt with previously by this Court, it's presented squarely here. It is a Federal question, which this Court says has to be decided by this Court. And we don't hesitate from - -",
  "Well, Your Honor, if -- if we're not right about the decision resolving the adequacy issue already, we're happy to turn to it now and address it as we do in our briefs. This is not an adequate State ground under this Court's decisions. The first reason for that is that this is a futile gesture that the State court requires of us.",
  "Well, the trial judge asked, is there any authority that requires me to give this instruction on harm to non-parties? And we said, in our view it's the BMW case. And she said, well, if there is not an authority right on point I'm not going to give this instruction. She said that very clearly. So if we submitted a separate piece of paper, it would have made no difference; and if we had taken out the two mistakes --",
  "Let's see. It's the instruction conference. This begins on page 17a, where Mr. Beaty starts discussing the second prong of this paragraph. He says -- he quotes the language, and the judge -- the judge says: \"Well, I think that that's covered by giving an instruction that punitive damages are not compensatory.\" And he says: No, no, that is not -- \"That is not the point of this instruction.\" This is pages 17 and 18a.",
  "Well, she said she just disagreed with the idea that there should be protection against punishment for harm to non-parties. And she said unless there's a case requiring that, I'm not going to give that instruction. And she said - -",
  "What he was saying when he said okay was: I understand your ruling and I'm not going to continue to argue a point that I've already lost. But he pressed that point - -",
  "Well, the -- the State courts both held -- both of the appellate courts held our instruction was rejected. And this Court said it was rejected, too, in its opinion. And that's exactly right. You can't antagonize the trial judge by arguing and arguing after your position has been rejected.",
  "The -- the reason we say that those 28 cases did not give us reasonable notice that we had to submit a separate piece of paper or change another paragraph in the instruction request is that none of them dealt with a situation where you have separately numbered requests - -",
  "Well, I -- I think so, because the pattern instruction here told both parties to include all their paragraphs pertaining to punitive damages in one numbered instruction, 34.",
  "Yes.",
  "But that handbook came out in 2006. And after all, that was a practice tip. It was not a State court ruling saying you had to organize your instruction this way. We had separate paragraphs, separately numbered. They dealt with different issues. One was the Constitution and the other was the State statute. And there's no Oregon case that said that in that situation you have to break it out into a separate piece of paper.",
  "Well, the pattern instructions told us to put every point pertaining to punitive damages in Instruction No. 34. Both sides did that. And the Court was working with plaintiff's instruction, taking their - -",
  "Well, you see, the -- the pattern -- the pattern instruction didn't include the due process point.",
  "That's what we tried to do, and the -- the judge invited us while dealing with the other side's instruction to go through this one by one. She -- she was asking us: Now, what's your next addition? And we -- we got to the due process point, and she said: What is your authority? And we told her, and she said: I don't think that instruction is necessary. It was separately argued. It was separately decided by the State courts in the prior decisions, decided by this Court as -- as a separate matter, and that is exactly how the trial court approached this. Her request was to go through this item by item. She wasn't taking an all-or-nothing approach to this instruction. She started with plaintiff's document and asked what from our menu of additions was necessary.",
  "Well - -",
  "Yes.",
  "You know, Justice Breyer, this is very similar to what was at issue in the Flowers case which reached this Court. The Alabama Supreme Court had said if you intermix different appeal points in your brief, we are not going to consider any of them if there are any errors to be found in any of the paragraphs in their brief.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, what -- what the State argued there was that for 60 years the \"correct in all respects\" rule was in effect in Alabama, and they cited dozens of cases applying it. But this Court unanimously held that that approach was pointless severity. Even though the State supreme court there said, we can't disentangle these arguments, it's too complicated, it's too much of a burden on the State supreme court, this Court unanimously found that was pointless severity. And at that point - -",
  "Well - -",
  "I -- I -- we don't question the good faith of the court, but we say that this is pointless severity, a rule that this Court has applied more recently in Lee v. Kemna where there was no issue of bad faith. The Court thought that it was pointlessly severe and unnecessarily severe to insist on a perfect proposal in that case.",
  "Well, there is an earlier case that is interesting, State v. Brown, which comes several years before, and it's cited in our brief. In that case an imperfect instructional request was made, and the Court still found that there was a duty to give the instruction based on due process. And the reason was that the parties during the charge conference had debated the issue. It was a fair-enough exposition for the trial court to understand the need for the charge. And here this really is much like the Osborne case. You know, in the Osborne case the defendant didn't make any instructional proposal, and this Court still reversed and required a new trial with the correct instruction. It said due process required that. And the Court said that we -- that the party had sufficiently brought this to the attention of the trial judge for Federal adequacy purposes even though no instruction was -- was proposed. The lawyer there merely moved to dismiss the proceeding, never proposed an instruction, but this Court required a retrial with a correct set of instructions to the jury. That's an a fortiori case, I think; and also the Flowers case, I believe, is a fortiori. There really was a strong and compelling State interest there in having the lawyers break their arguments up into separate headings and subheadings so the appellate court could follow the argument. But here there wasn't any burden placed on the trial judge at all by our request. She was going through these one by one, and she asked us: What's your next point that you want added? We proposed it. It was on a silver platter. She didn't have to retype it. She could have simply read it to the jury in that form. It didn't have to be edited or amended. There literally was no burden on the trial judge at all. And so we - -",
  "She did look at the illicit profits point. And she said: I'm not going to give that; that's unnecessary. She did -- she didn't address the \"may versus shall\" issue because she was working with plaintiffs' proposal. So all -- really she just had before her our request for this due process instruction. She analyzed it separately, it was debated before her. And this is much more specific than what the lawyers did in the Osborne case. They didn't even propose an instruction. We served it up on a silver platter. She could have used it, and indeed there was no work for the trial judge at all because she was simply telling the lawyers, make this change, make that change that we've discussed, so there is zero burden on the court. And you have to ask in this situation, what is the legitimate State interest that would support this massive forfeiture of a very important due process right? The plaintiff says the State interest here is that it promotes affirmance of jury verdicts whether or not there has been a due process violation. But think about that. That's hardly a State interest.",
  "Oh, yes.",
  "Well, please recall that in both Osborne and in the Lee case, there was a general State purpose of that kind that supported the rule, but the Court said it was an exorbitant or unnecessarily severe application of the rule. And that's what we contend here, that this is exorbitant, it serves no legitimate purpose. It is truly a game of gotcha that just nullifies the defendant's due process rights. And that precedent I think would be of great concern in various fields of law. This is a rule of law that will apply in civil rights cases in the future, criminal cases, all sorts of cases. So I -- I think if this Court does apply its own criteria here, it will see that this is an exercise in futility, it was an ambush as a practical matter. We didn't have any reason to think we had to submit this again on a separate piece of paper.",
  "Oh, because the judge had ruled as a matter of substantive law that she wasn't going to give this instruction. It wouldn't matter if we separated it.",
  "Well, she -- she said that was all she was going to say about the point. And we said, well, that doesn't cover our point, because we want protection against punishment for harm to non-parties. And she said: I'm not going to give that instruction; I deny the rest of your request, No. 34.",
  "Well, I -- I think if -- if you look at the whole colloquy, that's the gist of it. I -- I have paraphrased it, but - -",
  "Perhaps - -",
  "-- perhaps I did. But I -- I would just point out that in Osborne the lawyer didn't make it clear at all. The lawyer didn't even propose an instruction. We proposed a good instruction that this Court has quoted from emphasizing our language, saying -- saying it correctly captures the due process principle. So that is enough to satisfy Federal criteria of -- of adequacy, and that is sufficient to preserve the point. There is no dispute that this is preserved for appellate purposes in Oregon. Unless the Court has further questions, I -- I would reserve the balance of our time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Breyer asked about these various cases from Oregon, whether they provided guidance and a warning here. And counsel referred to three cases, Reeve, Owings and then Sorenson. If you look at those cases, you will see there were simple instructions proposed on a single topic that were infected with an error throughout. And the court said if there is any valid proportion of this instruction, it was covered by something that was said to the jury already. So there was no harm in not giving that instruction. That is certainly not our case. We have a separately numbered paragraph dealing with the Constitution, which is quite apart from the statutory factors. Now, counsel referred to the charge actually given by the court as if it provided some protection against punishment for harm to nonparties. If you read that instruction, far from providing the protection that the -- this Court said was obligatory, it invited global punishment. It told the jury they could return any punitive-damage award up to one hundred million dollars. Lo and behold, they come up with eighty million dollars, right within the suggested range of this charge. And there was no - -",
  "This is page 37a of our joint appendix. The -- the court concludes the amount of punitive damages you assess may not exceed the sum of one hundred million dollars. And that, of course, was the zone of reasonableness that the jury inferred from this, suggesting a global punishment to the jury with no protection. Now this Court said that that protection has to be provided. The Court said the State must insist, that the State must give assurance, and it's an important constitutional right, as Justice Kennedy said. I don't think the State court - -",
  "We wouldn't oppose that because this is clearly excessive under what the Court said in State Farm: Where there is substantial compensatory damages, one to one is something of a norm.",
  "Oh, that -- that -- yes, certainly, that -- that -- that is true. I -- I would comment, too, on Justice Breyer's question about what is the ultimate test here. The Court has stated various criteria and opinions over the last century, but the -- the key ideas are? Was it an ambush, something that couldn't be anticipated?",
  "Oh, yes, but this is the first time the Court has ever taken this \"correct in all respects\" rule and extended it to a completely different topic, U.S. constitutional law in a separately numbered paragraph. And we had no notice that this had to be broken out on a separate piece of paper. If we did, we would have broken it out on a separate piece of paper. It's just like Lee against Kemna where the Court said - -",
  "Well, no, that instruction was not harm to nonparties. That was harm for out-of-State injuries. It was a different issue. And it's true the lawyers there did break up their instructions differently, but the pattern instruction - -",
  "No. That's not true. That case did not accept our instruction. It did not. It accepted the State Farm instruction, which said that there can't be punishment for out-of-State harm.",
  "Yes. This -- this State Farm instruction was broken out. That's an option for lawyers. But under the pattern instruction, it's quite proper to put them all in one instructional basket. That's what the form instructions said, and that's what both parties here did.",
  "We thank the Court.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We're here today to urge the Court to reinstate the district court's decision, which faithfully applied this Court's precedents under section 101 of the Patent Act. The problem with the Prometheus patent is its broad pre-emption of a physical phenomenon, which prevents others like Mayo Clinic from offering a better metabolite test with more accurate numbers. And this is a huge practical problem for patients. These thiopurine drugs are strong medicine. Too much of this can be fatal; too little can leave a chronic lingering disease in the patient.",
  "Well, it -- what it can't do is use any number from 400 up until infinity, and it believes that's the wrong number. And it can't have a -- a different standard for a legion of autoimmune diseases, and there are dozens and dozens of them. That's a broad field to pre-empt the natural phenomenon.",
  "Well, you -- you see, Your Honor, we believe the correct number is 450 to 700. And that's necessary to cure various autoimmune diseases. And Prometheus took the position that its patent pre-empts everything above 400, all the way up to infinity, it said, for all autoimmune diseases, dozens and dozens of them.",
  "Well, you know, actually it didn't, Your Honor. You'll see in that opinion, there are two rulings. One is the 15 percent ruling, which lowers the number; but it said 400 and above all the way to infinity. There's no upper limit on this. So, as a practical matter, there's no room for anybody else to offer a metabolite test. And what this means for patients is one opinion in the United States. If you have one of these life-threatening diseases --",
  "-- you get one opinion. Pardon me?",
  "Well, it can't have a test that has a different therapeutic range, because that's a pre-emption. They take the position --",
  "Yes.",
  "And -- and what -- what Prometheus submitted and the court agreed is if you are notified, if you are aware of their range when you're drawing blood, that's an infringement right then and there, if -- if you're aware or warned by their number. So, any doctor in the United States that draws blood and is aware of this range of theirs is pre-empting. And the practical result is we haven't been able to offer this competing test now for 7 years.",
  "Well, you'll see, Justice Kennedy, in the district court, they argued for any number above 400. That's -- it's 400 and above, is what it says. And they said there's no upper limit on that. The district court found that. That was their position. It was accepted.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, it may be patentable.",
  "The key is the specificity.",
  "If it leaves room for others to have their own tests with different numbers and different procedures so that it isn't just one test for the whole country, then yes, if it's specific enough. The specificity is the key. What -- what the Court said in Bilski, of course, is that you can't pre-empt a whole field, a broad field with -- with your -- your patent, which this one does. And if you look at the diseases that are covered --",
  "Yes. If you -- if you pre-empt all the numbers up to infinity and all autoimmune diseases, that's a vast field. It's much bigger than the field in Flook.",
  "Well, no. I -- I think --",
  "No. I -- I think --",
  "No.",
  "Well, I think doctors have to have freedom to make their own judgments about these natural phenomena.",
  "Well, I -- no. I think --",
  "Well, it's the rule I believe adopted in Bilski and in Flook, that you can't wipe out a whole field so no one else can have a competing test. The result for the public is that these numbers would be frozen for 20 years, and a very serious person couldn't get a second opinion from Mayo Clinic, which uses different numbers. That's why we think --",
  "Oh, yes.",
  "Oh, yes.",
  "No, it's not. And, in fact, this drug was patented.",
  "The difference is the specificity. If you invent a drug which has a particular chemical formula, others can invent other drugs. There's room for competing drugs in the medical world. And you'll -- many, many patented drugs --",
  "Yes, it is a patent on a measurement --",
  "Well --",
  "No, I --",
  "I think that's -- that's one -- one part of it.",
  "You can't patent nature.",
  "That's correct.",
  "But --",
  "Because -- because of the law of nature doctrine that has existed for 150 years in this Court. Congress has never disagreed with that. Pieces of nature can't be monopolized. Neither can formulas.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Yes. So, all doctors -- that's part of the storehouse of information. All doctors can look at that reaction. They can calibrate it the way they see fit. They have different opinions. And it's important for all of us that they have those different opinions. We found that the numbers that they were using were way off for skin disorders, dangerously high. 400 is the wrong number. The correct number is 150 to 300. Now, it's very important for patients to be -- with life-threatening conditions, to be able to get that information.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes.",
  "For us, the real oddity is that this numerical calibration that they've given extends up to infinity, and it precludes every other blood test.",
  "Yes.",
  "Sure.",
  "No, it's -- it's not.",
  "It's not a good patent because --",
  "Well, because you've -- you've added to a law of nature just -- just a simple observation of the man's little finger.",
  "Yes.",
  "There are several things that it can't be. After Bilski, which reaffirmed what was said in Flook, a conventional step isn't sufficient, because that's just adding a law of nature to prior art, and prior art plus prior art equals nothing that is patentable under the Flook decision. And also, the step that you add has to narrow your pre-emption --",
  "Well --",
  "No, we're really not. What the Court -- what the Court said in Bilski is that a conventional step plus a law of nature isn't sufficient, and what the Court explained in Flook is that the law of nature is part of the common domain; it's part of prior art. So, if you're adding prior art to prior art, it's nothing under section 101.",
  "That's a very important question for the medical community. They need a robust section 101 standard because under 102 and 103 you could patent E equals MC squared. That's new. It's nonobvious. But you can't patent it under 101 because it's a law of nature. And it's important to keep this -- this common domain, the storehouse of information that medical researchers need to have access to --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, no, I think -- we have two arguments on this point. The first is both Flook and Bilski peeked, and -- and they looked at the conventional nature of the additional step, and that's --",
  "Well --",
  "This -- this is the Court's 101 analysis in both Flook and in Bilski. So, we rely on the latest decision, Bilski, which took exactly that peek. But the other part of our answer is you don't even have to peek. If the step doesn't narrow the pre-emption of the natural phenomenon, if it's just an incidental step that you need to use to observe the natural phenomenon, which this blood test is, you can't see the natural phenomenon.",
  "Oh, yes.",
  "Oh, sure.",
  "Yes.",
  "Our view --",
  "In our view, the rest of it has to add up to some step that limits the natural phenomenon, so that you have a concrete, specific --",
  "Well, in the Diehr -- in the Diehr --",
  "In the Diehr case --",
  "In the Diehr case, the natural phenomenon was limited with steps that confined the invention to a specific machine with doors opening and closing, temperature being monitored so a product was cured. It was a very specific, concrete invention.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Well, here's what --",
  "Here's what they say, joint appendix pages 13 through 14, the second volume. This is their patent. This is what it covers. It covers hepatitis, lupus, Hashimoto's disease, Graves' disease, Addison's disease, diabetes, arthritis. And they say it even covers organ transplants. It covers heart, kidney, and liver transplants. So, it covers every autoimmune disease, and there are dozens and dozens of them --",
  "-- and they do have different numbers. That's the key point.",
  "Well, this --",
  "Well --",
  "I -- I think what the Court did in Flook and what it did in Bilski is ask if a broad field is being pre-empted. This is broad numerically. It goes up to infinity. It covers dozens and dozens of autoimmune diseases.",
  "Well --",
  "No, it wouldn't. That would be LabCorp, where there was just one malady in the patent; it was a vitamin deficiency with a natural correlation. And Justice Breyer's opinion explained that -- that is too pre-emptive of the natural phenomenon.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, if -- if observe the -- that's another area of the breadth of this patent, because there's no specific action the doctor has to take. If the doctor has been informed of their range and draws blood and thinks about it, that's -- that is -- that is infringement. And a doctor here was accused of infringement, treble damages sought against this hospital in an injunction, because she thought about this correlation, and she had completely different numbers.",
  "Certainly. They could have said when you reach 400, a real number, a specific number, you adjust the dosage by 20 percent. That's a treatment patent.",
  "Yes, and --",
  "What makes it different is that leaves room for Mayo Clinic to come up with different numbers that it believes are more accurate and more helpful for patients that are suffering from these life-threatening diseases. We shouldn't require Americans to get one opinion from Prometheus when they want an opinion from Mayo Clinic.",
  "Well, that could be specific enough, again, then others could have a rival test that -- that used a different treatment protocol. You'd have to look at that.",
  "Oh, I think --",
  "I think it would be patentable.",
  "Well, I don't think they can -- they can wipe out the entire field so that others can't have rival tests that use different numbers. They tried to do that, by the way. They have a total of eight patents here which use different numbers. But you can't pre-empt the whole field so others can't make any use of the natural phenomenon.",
  "I think you'd need both. You'd have to look at it in practical terms. Is there room for somebody else to make use of this natural correlation, so that they could come up with different numbers, different ranges, and different treatments? And if there's room left, then there is no pre-emption of the natural phenomenon. That's a vastly different case, and that's what is missing here. I -- I do see my time -- yes?",
  "My view is there are only a couple of them. LabCorp is like this. This one is like this. The others that are referred to in this -- these amicus briefs are vastly different. They're specific patents with specific treatment protocols. And by the way, the Government admits this particular patent is invalid because it just attaches a mental step to prior art. And there are only a couple of them to our knowledge that would be affected by a decision in our favor. But a decision in our favor would protect the storehouse of information that doctors really need. They have to be able to look at the body's reaction to injections, pills, chemotherapy, radiation; and different hospitals have to have different opinions to safeguard the health of our people. So, we urge the Court to reverse, and I would reserve the balance of our time.",
  "Justice Scalia asked the critical question here: What if you think these numbers are wrong? What happens with patients around the country? Well, that's just what we concluded: These numbers were wrong. They say you go up to 400, and above 400, it's bad, it's harmful. We found that the right range was 450 up to 700, and sometimes even above 700, to cure some of these very serious diseases. And that different opinion was blockaded by this treble damages lawsuit and request for an injunction. So, the -- the wrong information is --",
  "That it's not useful --",
  "It's important that 101 be the robust test here. This is the only provision under which this Court has issued decision after decision for 150 years protecting the public domain. It's not some rough gauge; it is the critical test defining what's in the storehouse of information for medical researchers to use. And to reduce it to a dead letter here would be just contrary to this Court's precedents and very harmful to the medical community. This is very important to -- to doctors around the country. Now, is this a natural process? The question was raised. Of course, it's a natural process. These metabolites come from the liver. They don't come from a test tube. They don't come from a syringe. It's just like cholesterol. If I eat in a French restaurant, there's some human intervention there that gives me high cholesterol. And if I eat wild strawberries, there's no human intervention. But either way, the doctors get to look at my cholesterol and hypothesize ranges that they think are sensible. It's the very same phenomenon. Entirely natural. Now, this is a clean legal issue. Under section 101, it's always been a legal issue. They say section 102 and 103 are the most elusive questions in the field of patent law. This is a 7-year-old lawsuit against a hospital; it's cost millions of dollars to defend. Two trips to this Court, two trips to the Federal Circuit. We're still litigating this treble damages case. It should be terminated under this Court's precedents, as the district court did giving summary judgment.",
  "Well, because --",
  "Yes. Well, I think that's right. That's -- that is a second issue. But the first issue here is the breadth of the pre-emption, which precludes anyone else in the country from saying, as Justice Scalia did, those numbers are wrong. And patients can't use those numbers safely or they won't get cured of this disease. For 20 years, the public is stuck with the erroneous information. Now, counsel suggests that it's narrow pre-emption because it doesn't cover host-versus-graft or leukemia. Those are not autoimmune diseases. Every autoimmune disease is swept in here. And there are dozens and dozens of them. They have different characteristics. You don't take a \"one size fits all\" approach to autoimmune disease. There are different numbers for different diseases. That's what Mayo is trying to do, to have some personalized medicine for skin disorders. And they said that -- that is an infringement and we're entitled to treble damages and an injunction. Now, is this like the Morse case? Yes, it is like the Morse case. Prometheus is trying to pre-empt diseases it never researched, and it's trying to pre-empt numbers that differ from its numbers fundamentally. They have the number 7000 in their patented number. We thought the number should be 5700. This is a very dangerous toxic drug. If you get the -- the wrong number set in concrete for 20 years, that is a huge problem for patients, and there are millions and millions of patients suffering from autoimmune disease. So, we urge the Court to protect the research process here that's so fundamental to American health and to economy and the health care industry. We thank the Court.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether the State may stick a needle in the arm of everyone arrested on suspicion of drunk driving without a warrant and without consent. Missouri's answer to that question is yes, even in routine DWI cases like this and regardless of how quickly and easily a warrant could be obtained.",
  "The question is -- it's not clear to me. Number one, Your Honor, there's nothing in the record to suggest that the driver is always first offered the opportunity, the choice of choosing a breathalyzer as opposed to --",
  "This client was offered the breathalyzer, Your Honor.",
  "And declined it twice, that's correct, Your Honor. But under Missouri's proposed rule, there is no role at all for a neutral and detached magistrate. The decision whether an individual can be required to submit to a nonconsensual blood draw, often while handcuffed and physically restrained as my client was -­",
  "Right.",
  "I'd be happy to answer that question right now, Your Honor. I think there are two responses. One is Missouri specific and case specific and one is more generic because I think it's important to remember they are not asking simply to reverse the suppression motion in this case on the grounds that the facts of this case made it reasonable to do a warrantless blood draw. What Missouri and the United States are urging is a categorical exemption to the warrant requirement in all DWI cases nationwide. So we have to think not only about --",
  "Your Honor, I do not know the answer to that.",
  "But I think it's also true, Your Honor, that warrants in general are rarely turned down, that the overwhelming percentage of warrant requests in all criminal cases are granted -- are granted by magistrates.",
  "This Court's entire Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, Your Honor, rests on the proposition that the privacy safeguards of the Fourth Amendment benefit by having a neutral and detached magistrate review the evidence before the State does something as intrusive as putting a needle in somebody's arm. And I could imagine a situation --",
  "Well, it's something very close to what Missouri already has, Your Honor. In Cape Girardeau County the prosecutor has prepared standardized forms which the police officer then fills out, presents to the prosecutor, the prosecutors sends on to the magistrate and the magistrate decides whether to grant the warrant. But I think that cuts in exactly the opposite direction, which it shows that the process of obtaining a warrant is not very elaborate and it need it not be very timely. And I can imagine, in answer to Justice Scalia's questions, I can imagine circumstances in which an officer might apply for a warrant in a situation where they have not asked the driver, for example, to go through the field sobriety test; said as they -- as we stopped the driver on the road, he was going 10 miles over the speed limit, I questioned him, his speech was slurred, his eyes seemed bloodshot, I want to do a blood test. And the magistrate in that circumstance might say, did you at least perform the field sobriety test? Did you at least offer --",
  "Do you mean do you need a warrant to have the field sobriety test?",
  "Is that the question, Justice Ginsburg? I don't think you need a warrant to require somebody to put his finger to his nose or to walk a straight line or to stand on one foot. I would not say that that is a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment that triggers the warrant requirement. But there is no doubt that putting a needle in somebody's arm triggers a warrant requirement. And I think there are really two --",
  "I think you probably do need a warrant for a breathalyzer, Your Honor. But -- Missouri's position is you not only don't need a warrant for a breathalyzer, you don't need a warrant for a blood test. And we don't -- this is not a breathalyzer case.",
  "I think -- I think, Your Honor, it -- I would say that requiring somebody to produce, to breathe into a machine for -- in order to gather evidence for the State's prosecution is a state -- is a search that should probably trigger the warrant requirement, but it is certainly a less -- it is certainly less intrusive, Your Honor, it is certainly less intrusive than -- than the blood test --",
  "Well, I certainly don't want to bite -- I want to bite off --",
  "Your Honor, I certainly want to bite off as little as I have to chew in this case, but -- but there are two salient facts because I think it is important to focus on what is before the Court in this case. And what is before the Court in this case is a warrantless blood draw, and the two salient facts in my mind are, one, as I said, case specific. You have a State trooper here who has been doing this for 17 and a half years. He testifies at the suppression hearing that he has only been required to seek a warrant fewer than ten times. Why is that? That is because the overwhelming number of drivers, in fact, give their consent. And in the ten cases over those 17 years where he had to seek a warrant, he testifies that he never had any difficulty obtaining a warrant, and there is certainly no indication that those warrants in any way interfered with the State's ability to prosecute those cases.",
  "Yes, so that's exactly correct, Your Honor. I think the Court got it right in Schmerber. I think the question is: Are there special facts that are extrinsic to the warrant process itself and that are beyond the control of the police that significantly impede the ability of the police even to initiate the warrant process.",
  "Well, Your Honor, Cape Girardeau County is a rural county in southeastern Missouri --",
  "I would say no, Your Honor. I don't think the State ought to be able to take advantage of its own failure to modernize an expedited --",
  "Then I think that's a different situation, Your Honor. I think that -­",
  "I think it might well if the magistrate were unavailable and there were no alternative magistrate. But the second salient fact, Your Honor --",
  "That is correct, Justice Kagan.",
  "That is correct, Justice Kagan. And the second fact though I just wanted to come back to, and this came up briefly during my opponent's argument, is we know that there are half the States in the country by our count, 26 States in the country that by statute have prohibited warrantless blood draws in routine DWI cases. They are listed on page 31 of the red brief in Footnote 9. Given that fact, in the face of that reality, I don't think Missouri can plausibly claim that a categorical rule that would then apply nationwide if this Court were to announce it in the context of this case, that warrants are never required in routine DWI cases, could satisfy the standard that this Court has established, namely that the exception to the warrant requirement that is being proposed serves law enforcement needs so compelling that a warrantless search is objectively reasonable in every case. There is no evidence that I am aware of, in response to Justice Kennedy's question, and there is certainly no evidence in the record in this case or in the briefs in this case that those 25 States that prohibit warrantless blood draws in the circumstances that my client confronted here have a lower conviction rate, are less concerned about drunk drivers --",
  "Well, I would say several things. First of all, Your Honor, I really do have no reason to believe that there's any jurisdiction in the country at this point that is not deeply concerned about drunk driving, or recognizes that drunk driving is a serious problem. That is certainly not our position. Secondly, the reason I think that there is no evidence that in the States that prohibit warrantless blood draws in routine DWI cases like this have lower conviction rates is, number one, in most cases, they can obtain consent; number two, in cases where they can't obtain consent, they have been able to obtain warrants in a timely -- in a timely fashion; and number three, even in the absence of warrants, all the facts that lead to probable cause often create a very compelling case for conviction in the absence of the blood alcohol --",
  "I have enormous confidence in you, Justice Breyer.",
  "Well, well -- well, our -- our position, and I'm not sure whether you're classifying this as our first position or -- or something else -- our position is that within the context of Schmerber, if there are special facts external to the warrant requirement, then you have to apply a totality of the circumstances test, and you ought to apply a reasonableness standard. In the context of the delays that are intrinsic to the warrant requirement, absent and if any evidence that those intrinsic delays have interfered with the ability of 25 States in the country to enforce their drunk driving laws, this Court ought not to adopt a categorical exception to the -- to the warrant requirement. And the risk of doing it, as you pointed out, Justice Breyer, is then you create this odd disincentive, which is the States that have the most -- have the slowest and most cumbersome warrant procedures are the States that get a free pass and are able to override the Fourth Amendment. That seems to me -­",
  "Well, there is some advantage to having -- certainly, a search that is conducted pursuant to a warrant is much less subject to suppression than a search that is subject not pursuant to a warrant. But -- but there is generally speaking in these cases a probable cause that is derived from the officer's observations on the scene and the defendant's performance in the field sobriety test, that -- that -- you know, can support the warrant -- support -- support the search. But I think --",
  "I don't -- excuse me -- I don't think the Fourth Amendment rule turns on the I amount of blood that you take out of somebody's body. think the Fourth -- an important, maybe not the important dividing line, an important dividing line for Fourth Amendment purposes is puncturing the skin, and the Court has recognized this in other circumstances. And I think --",
  "This Court has said that, Your Honor --",
  "-- in a variety of circumstances with drug testing cases, where they weren't even law enforcement cases, they were special needs cases. The Court --",
  "I think that -- I think that's probably -- I think that's probably correct, Your Honor. You presumably do not need a search warrant, a search warrant for that. And this Court held, first in Schmerber and then reaffirmed in South Dakota v. Neville, that there is no Fifth Amendment issue in requiring the defendant to produce the evidence that can then be used against you. So we know we're not talking about a self-incrimination problem; we're talking about a search and seizure problem. And if the government were able to obtain the evidence in a way that did not rise to the level of a search, then the warrant requirement wouldn't apply. But we are not there. We're not there. And -- and the -- the warrant process that -- that Missouri has described is -- is not as complicated. There are many places now that, number one, permit not only telephonic warrants but electronic warrants, where officers are equipped in their patrol cars with laptop computers. They can fill out these pre-prepared forms in a matter of minutes -- e-mail them to the --",
  "But I don't think it's unreasonable, Your Honor, and it's because we all recognize that the evidence in these cases is relatively routinized, and the procedures are relatively standardized. But that does not mean there is not a value to the warrant process, and to the second look by a mutual and detached magistrate. And the value of --",
  "I'd be happy to answer that question, Justice Sotomayor, if I could just complete my answer to the Chief Justice for one second.",
  "And my answer would be that even if there are boxes on a standardized form, there is value to making sure that the prosecutor and the police have checked off all the right boxes before they engage in a process as intrusive as putting a needle in somebody's arm. Now, in answer to Justice Sotomayor's question, I think -- I think there are multiple answers, Your Honor. First, this Court has on two occasions considered and rejected the notion that the mere fact that alcohol dissipates over time is itself sufficient to proceed without a warrant. As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, in Schmerber, the Court's discussion of what the Court itself called special facts would have been unnecessary if all the Court needed to say was that this natural dissipation of alcohol in the blood automatically would lead to --",
  "I think the special facts, Your Honor, were the accident and the injuries at the scene, which delayed the police for two hours before they could even get to the hospital and initiate the process of applying for a warrant, at a time when there were no cell phones, there were no faxes, there were no internets, and all warrant applications had to be presented in person. That's a very, very different situation.",
  "Excuse me?",
  "Perhaps.",
  "Well, I think that practical limitation, whether or not there were other officers on the scene, right, or that could have been sent to the scene, we're not asking for a rule in which this Court would direct police officers how they -- they ought to deploy their resources. If there are multiple police officers on the scene, I don't think it's unreasonable to say one can attend to the accident and the other one can search -- can search for a warrant, and that becomes part of the totality of the circumstances. But Schmerber is not the only case, Your Honor. In -- in Welsh v. Wisconsin, the Court expressly said that the mere dissipation of alcohol in the blood was not sufficient to justify a warrantless entry into a defendant's home in order to arrest the defendant on DWI charges. It's explicit holding, it's not simply an inference that one has to draw from Schmerber. The second thing I would say in response to your question, Justice Sotomayor, is -- is -- is biology. And that it is true that alcohol dissipates over time through natural body processes. But that's only after the blood alcohol level has reached its peak, and that is generally about half an hour after somebody has had his last drink. So there is a period of time in which the blood -- the body is continuing to absorb alcohol and then -- and the blood alcohol level is continuing to rise. Only at peak does it then start to dissipate.",
  "The relevance of that is that it is not true that in every -- it won't be true in every case, Mr. Chief Justice, that the State is losing evidence with each passing moment.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, you may or may not know, depending upon what the -- the person is willing to tell you. All I'm saying is that in every case, in every case, it's not the situation that from the moment you stop the driver, his blood alcohol level is going down. There will be some cases where it is going up.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Because the process is a very different process. In the typical drug case, which is what this Court has considered when it has examined the question of whether the destruction of evidence qualifies as an exigent circumstance, that question has almost always arisen in what I'll call a typical drug case, Richards v. Wisconsin, Kentucky v. King. And in those situations, what the Court is worried about is that the suspect inside the house is going to flush the drugs down the toilet.",
  "It is now or --",
  "It is now or never and not only is it now or never, that -- but in most of those cases, probably not all, but in most of the cases, the State's case is going to disappear down the drain along with the drugs and the ability to destroy the drugs lies entirely within the control of the defendant. The defendant gets to decide whether he's going to put the drugs down the toilet or not and when he does, the destruction is immediate and total. In this situation, the process is gradual. It takes hours. It can take hours, depending upon how much alcohol is -- is in the system and it is outside the control of the suspect. There is nothing that the suspect can do to expedite the process of the destruction of evidence.",
  "That may be -- that may --",
  "There is -- there is -- there is no doubt, Justice Kennedy, first of all, the retrograde extrapolation evidence, which is now being considered in various courts around the country is controversial. It's subject to cross-examination. You know -- the -- we haven't resolved whether -- whether the state of that -- the state of that -- the state of that evidence yet. But having said that --",
  "Well, I think that that is certainly -- that is certainly true -- that is certainly true as well, Your Honor.",
  "Right. And there -- and there is no doubt, I will not deny, the State's case will be easier if it does not have to obtain a warrant, but this case -- Court has recognized that many times in the past. Criminal investigations are always easier if the State does not have to comply with the warrant process.",
  "Mm-hmm.",
  "Well, I would say three things, Your Honor. I don't think it is as intrusive, although even in Cupp v. Murphy, which is that case, the Court described it as a serious, but brief intrusion on the cherished value of personal security. The Court recognized that even the -- the fingernail scrape was -- was a serious Fourth Amendment issue. Secondly, that evidence, unlike the blood alcohol evidence, was under the control of the defendant and in that case, on the facts of that case, much like many of the Court's other exigent circumstances cases, there was evidence that suggests that the defendant was actively engaged in the process of degrading the evidence at the time that the police stepped in and said we're going to preserve what is left rather than allow you to be the agent of your own destruction. And as the Court said in Kentucky v. King, it is a very different situation when you have the defendant himself destroying evidence. Under those circumstances, it may be reasonable for the Court to say you can't simultaneously destroy evidence and then protest that the destruction of the evidence -- evidence has created the exigency that requires the State to act without a warrant. But there is no agency in this case on behalf of the defendant. The defendant has no capacity. And I come back to what I said before. It is true, I think this question came -- came up earlier, when Mr. Koester was being -- was being questioned. Fourth Amendment standards are not determined by State law. The Court has said that in Virginia v. Moore. We all understand that. But in the determination of what is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, this Court has often looked to State practices in response to Justice Kennedy's question. In Tennessee v. Garner, you have the Court say half the States have abrogated the Common Law Rule that would have allowed the police to shoot any felon -- fleeing felon. In Richards v. Wisconsin, you have half the States that did not support an exception to the No Knock Rule. Here we have half the States in the country that would not have permitted what went on in this case. Thank you very much.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Seventh Circuit in this case violated AEDPA when it granted habeas relief to Respondent in the absence of precedent from this Court, clearly establishing that Respondent's allegations rise to the level of a constitutional violation.",
  "It would violate due process if the judge did not find the element, the ­­ the ­­ that the evidence provided by the State proved the elements beyond a reasonable doubt.

If the State appellate court interpreted what the judge had said so that the judge was saying he did not believe that the evidence produced by the State proved the elements beyond a reasonable doubt, that would be a Winship error or a Jackson error, which is not Respondent's claim here. If the State appellate court read the record, interpreted the ­­ what the trial court said differently and thought that the trial court did think that the ­­ that the evidence was sufficient but was tying it together by trying to tell a story that made sense to himself, then it would not violate ­­",

  "If the judge said that he found the evidence insufficient, that would ­­",
  "Again, it would depend on how the ­­ the ­­ the State court, State appellate courts interpreted the record. I think that is ambiguous, as you've described it, whether the judge is saying that he finds that the elements have not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt or if the judge is saying that he needs to find some way of telling a story about this case that makes sense to him. The first would be a due process violation. The second, it's not clearly established.",
  "It ­­ it ­­ yes, I ­­ but it has to be quite clear that that's what's happening, both because we have a presumption that judges know and follow the law and especially on habeas review that presumption applies with special force. Because on habeas review, we ­­ we assume not only that the original trial judge knows and follows the law but that the State courts that are reviewing his decision know and follow the law.",
  "So, first, if that were what the judge said, that interpretation, it's not clearly established that ­­ that that would violate due process, for the reasons I've already said, that a finder of fact can develop a theory of the case to tie it together that is consistent with the evidence.",
  "On ­­ when we ­­ and when we discussed that in our reply brief, we talked about the possibility that a judge would say, I ­­ I ­­ I don't ­­ the evidence isn't sufficient so ­­ but I know that this defendant's brother committed a similar crime, and for that reason only I'm finding him guilty.",
  "Correct.",
  "Yes.",
  "The ­­ the precedent can be read ­­ that ­­ that language can be read at a very high level of generality, which is not appropriate for AEDPA review.

So jury ­­ so factfinders are free to consider what they know ­­ background information that they know about the world, and they bring that into the factfinding process.",
  "No. We ­­ we argued in our brief, that ­­ that the ­­ that the judge is free, like any factfinder, to make inferences based on his common sense and experience.

  "The ­­ that interpretation of what the judge said and did was rejected by the Illinois Appellate Court.",
  "Correct.",
  "Well, there ­­",
  "I think that's an extremely fair interpretation of what the judge was saying. And I think it is consistent also with what the Illinois Appellate Court said when the Illinois Appellate Court said that the speculation about motive was not a material factor in ­­ in the verdict.",
  "The ­­ this Court has to give deference to the Illinois Appellate Court's conclusion that defendant's due process rights were not violated.",
  "I disagree. When the Illinois Appellate Court said the ­­ the ­­ it said ­­ the language that Justice Breyer quoted, it was just after they are analyzing the State's argument. On page 119a, the ­­ the appellate court explains that the State further argues that even if this Court determines that the trial judge's comments were improper, they should be deemed harmless since there's no indication that the comments constituted a material factor in defendant's conviction. They then go on to discuss the evidence and conclude that this speculation would be construed as harmless error. So what they are saying is error ­­ the best reading of this opinion ­­ they're saying is error was the speculation. It wasn't necessarily appropriate for the judge to be doing that. But they're not saying that there was constitutional error here. Indeed, it would not be coherent for them to say that it was not a material factor in the verdict and ­­ and then not discuss whether that was constitutional error. The second, in terms of whether or not ­­ even if you believe that the Illinois Appellate Court didn't directly address the merits, 2254(d) still requires deference to its conclusions. It unquestionably concluded that the defendant's due process rights were not violated because if ­­ because it affirmed the conviction.",
  "It is not clear that this ­­ the ­­ perhaps on harmlessness grounds. But even if on harmlessness grounds, under cases like Harrington and Davis v.

  "The Illinois Appellate Court's.",

  "The ­­ the ­­ ultimately, the question that the Court has to answer under 2254(d) is whether the State's adjudication results in a decision that is in violation of an unreasonable application of clearly established law of this Court.

  "Yes, and for that reason, we believe the best reading of the ­­ of the opinion is that they did not find constitutional error. Because if it was not a material factor in the verdict, it could not have been a violation of his due process rights. I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I ­­ I'd like to start by talking briefly about the harmless­error analysis that the Illinois Appellate Court undertook. Even assuming ­­ which we do not concede ­­ that they found constitutional error and then went ahead and did a harmless­error analysis, at best, the Respondent here can argue ­­ is trying to argue that it ­­ that it engaged in an unreasonable application of Chapman, that's only one thing that Respondent here would have to establish to overcome ­­ to ­­ to establish that the error was not harmless.

  "Certainly. The Illinois Appellate Court talks about the evidence at trial.

And motive is not ­­ as ­­ as it's been pointed out, motive is not an element of murder in Illinois.

It has nothing whatsoever to do with whether motive is a necessary part of establishing identity in a case where you have two unrebutted eyewitnesses.

On AEDPA, those conclusions cannot be reached and the Seventh Circuit should be reversed. Thank you."
