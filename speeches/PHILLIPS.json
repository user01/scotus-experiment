  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The central flaw in the jurisdictional and the enforceability of holdings in the court of appeals in this case is the manifest hostility that court demonstrated towards arbitration. The view reflected in those holdings is, to use a phrase that this court used in similar circumstances, quote, far out of step with this Court's endorsement over the past 15 years of arbitration as an effective and an efficient method of dispute resolution of Federal statutory claims.",
  "I do, Mr. Chief Justice, largely because it's reasonably clear that had the Court treated that order as an interlocutory order, then this matter would have gone immediately to arbitration, and the arbitration process would have been allowed to go forward. By treating it as a final judgment, as the Court did, it then undertook to review the merits of arbitrability --",
  "There is no question, Justice O'Connor, that this case would have and probably should have been dealt with as a stay order.",
  "Section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act quite plainly states that the Court shall enter a stay. In this context I think he did this to clear his docket, although that was not specifically our request. That was his decision.",
  "Well, I think at the end of the day this is still an embedded proceeding, and even though he ultimately dismisses everything, it is certainly available to come back to him at the end of the arbitration and have these issues reviewed, and it would certainly be much easier --",
  "-- as a matter of judicial --",
  "Right.",
  "Well, if you take it to the flip side, though, Justice Ginsburg, what happens in the situation where you deny summary judgment but style it as formally a final judgment, even though it in fact isn't a final --",
  "Well, I --",
  "Clearly that's not what the judge did here, and the question is, what should an appellate court do when it's presented with this particular problem, and my answer to you is to recognize that the dismissal in this context was an inappropriate way to proceed, treat it as a stay, and therefore conclude that it was not appropriate to go beyond that, and entertain the question of arbitrability, because to do that is to create a new class of problems under section 16 that otherwise wouldn't exist. We know that if it's a true independent action and you order something to arbitration, then there's an appeal on that --",
  "-- but that's the only case like that.",
  "Well, the ultimate question, it seems to me, Justice Ginsburg, is going to be whether you treat form or substance in this context as the most important, because it's pretty clear to me that while the judge did, in fact, formally dismiss the action, what was both required under section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act and what we asked for him to do was to stay this. This is the plaintiff's choice of forum. There's no reason the case couldn't have stayed there. We can respond directly to the Chief Justice's and Justice O'Connor's concerns about judicial administration by retaining the case under those circumstances, and we can fulfill the overall purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act appellate review standards by insisting that matters, when all doubts are -- you know, when you can resolve all doubts in favor of making sure they go to arbitration, rather than go through what we are today, which is having adjudicated this issue at three different levels of the Federal court system over 5 years, tens of thousands of dollars, and we're no closer today to resolving the merits of this dispute over the $15 charge and whether that's a finance charge or not --",
  "Well, there's no question --",
  "There's no question about that, Justice Souter.",
  "What we need is an answer.",
  "I think where we ought to look for the appropriate legal standard is the statutory scheme, and I think Congress clearly incorporated embedded versus independent into the subcomponents of section 16. They clearly recognize there are independent proceedings and there are embedded proceedings, and it has specific rules about how appeals ought to be followed in that course. So to be sure, there may be some potential for manipulation by the parties, but I don't know of much evidence to reflect that that's any kind of a problem, and Congress essentially bought into that distinction in 1988 when it adopted the statute in the form that it did.",
  "To be sure, Congress could have been clearer here, and I think what the Court said in Cortez-Byrd last term applies equally here, that enlightenment is not going to come from parsing the language of this particular statute. At the end of the day what we know is that the final decision language in section 16(a)(3) covers the classic situation involving an independent proceeding. Whether it should be extended beyond that to a new class of claims that will interfere with the implementation of the goals of arbitration is the issue before this Court. I find it difficult to get passionate about this because I believe Justice Souter is right, at the end of the day what really matters is that we have a rule. Once we have a rule, the rest of us will presumably --",
  "-- be able to line up behind that rule.",
  "I think that last statement could be read directly to apply to this case. Whether or not it was meant, and whether Congress adopted that, I've no idea.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Oh, I think it's quite obvious you would not want --",
  "-- to appeal in this -- no, Justice Breyer -- that's wrong. It is clear to me that you would not want to go through the delay and forestalling, allowing these matters to go to arbitration. That's what the parties voluntarily agree to.",
  "An independent action you're talking about.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "That's correct.",
  "No question.",
  "Right.",
  "Right, because --",
  "Right.",
  "Well --",
  "It's not consistent in the sense that if you look at the way 16(a) and 16(b) are set up, they really are designed basically to say if you have an ultimate order that says arbitrate you don't want to go to appeal, and if you don't --",
  "There is -- there is a --",
  "-- there's a single exception, that's true, Justice Breyer.",
  "And all I'm saying is, the question is, do you want to drag in another exception under these circumstances where it's a perfectly sensible to say, what should have been entered in here in this context was a stay that's not appealable, and in the future, go on forward in other cases.",
  "I'd love to talk about question 2. Thank you, Justice O'Connor.",
  "Obviously, if the Court finds that there is jurisdiction, the hostility that I mentioned at the outset of my argument applies with particular force with respect to the presumption that the court of appeals employed in deciding --",
  "There may well be. My -- let me answer the first part which is that we know -- is that -- is the particular imbalance in this clause sufficient to render this unenforceable. I don't -- I don't understand the other side to have argued that. If they did argue it below, they -- clearly that was rejected because the district court analyzed and dealt with all of the unconscionability issues, so I don't think that issue's on the table. With respect -- I mean, is it possible to have an arbitration clause that says in order to get entry into arbitration you -- you know, the plaintiff would have to file a million dollars, I think obviously a clause like that would be unenforceable under those circumstances because it would interfere with the ultimate enforcement of the statutory right, and that is one of the conditions of allowing arbitration of general statutory claims, and I don't have any problem with that. The problem is that if you have a clause like the one we have in this case, which is silent on these issues, the clear presumption, then, must be that you would favor arbitration. You would not assume all of the costs are going to be extreme or excessive.",
  "That --",
  "That is exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice. The Eleventh Circuit said we will presume all of the potential costs, large filing fees, pay for the costs of the arbitrator and pay for everything else, without any showing being made by the plaintiff under the circumstances of this case, and therefore we're going to say that there is an inherent conflict. What I suggest to you is that the language, inherent conflict, doesn't remotely entertain that kind of an analysis.",
  "No. The plaintiff had the opportunity to make that showing. She had a full and fair opportunity to engage in all of the discovery she wanted to. She chose, on a motion to reconsider, to throw some materials from the American Arbitration Association over the transom to try to make some kind of a showing. The answer is, she should go to arbitration, ascertain whether the arbitrator -- whether the fees for arbitration would be waived, what the costs of the arbitrator will be, and then, if it turns out at the end of the day that either those costs are unconscionable as a matter of state law --",
  "I think that the decision of the court in Cole is completely premature for this Court to entertain at this point in time, because we don't know what kinds of costs we're talking about. In the record before the D.C. Circuit in Cole, they had some evidence about what they thought the costs would be, given the nature of those claims. Here, we have no evidence like that. Is it possible in a particular case that the court could declare something unenforceable because the costs are too great?",
  "As I say, yes, I think you could but --",
  "I don't disagree with that, Mr. Chief Justice. I think that you have either of two ways to try to prove up your case, either through discovery, which she had a full and fair opportunity to do, and didn't present any evidence with respect to that, or, assuming that there's going to be doubts -- and I think all doubts, again, ought to be resolved in favor of pushing toward arbitration in order to ascertain this. Remember, if you read the American Arbitration Association's amicus brief it says that they consistently waive their filing fees, they often reduce arbitrator's fees, and we know -- and it's the reason why I think it makes much more sense for the court to entertain these issues after an arbitration rather than before an arbitration -- is that we may find out at the end of the day, if the plaintiff prevails, that all of those costs go back to her, and so she's really out of pocket nothing except for the marginal costs during the pendency of the proceedings.",
  "Well, hopefully that wouldn't happen, obviously, and you wouldn't expect it to happen very often, but again I don't disagree with you, Mr. Chief Justice. If what you're saying is, should the plaintiff have an opportunity to prove unconscionability at the outset of the process, I don't have any problem with that, assuming she does more than what she did here, which was to say, I'm not going to arbitration, I'm not going to do anything, I'm simply going to put in a study from the AAA which may or may not apply to the circumstances of this case. I'm not even going to ask Green Tree whether or not they're willing to pay for the fees in the circumstances a la what the D.C. Circuit required in the Cole case.",
  "They make that argument, and they ask the Court in this case to affirm on that alternative ground, and our position here is that there is no distinction between this case and Gilmer with respect to the treatment of class action. There is no greater right to a class action --",
  "As a matter, I'm sorry, of what?",
  "Oh, first view.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, you know as well as I do that it's largely a matter of the court's discretion what alternative grounds which are asserted by a party in litigation to defend a judgment the court will entertain. They have raised a class action issue. We have responded to the class action issue. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in a recent decision in Johnson, which we filed a supplemental brief on, has exhaustively analyzed the class action issue, and the bottom line is there is nothing in TILA that is any more pro-class action than there was in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which this Court held in Gilmer did not prevent enforceability of the arbitration clause in that context and, indeed, TILA has provisions that clearly envision providing significant opportunities for plaintiffs to recover in these kinds of cases. There are statutory damages provisions that give significant moneys even without showing of injury --",
  "-- and there are attorney's fees and reasonable costs.",
  "But the problem with the situation is that you don't presume, in the face of silence, that there's going to be a problem with going to arbitration. This Court has said consistently for 15 years, in interpreting the relationship between the Federal Arbitration Act and Federal statutes, that we presume they should go to arbitration and, if there are gaps, we assume that the arbitrator will provide for them and we know, as this case comes to the Court at this point based on both what was in the record below and what the amici briefs have shown, is that this does not need to be an expensive enterprise. It may not cost her anything with respect to either filing fees or arbitrator's fees.",
  "No.",
  "I am troubled, Justice Ginsburg, by the idea that you would adopt a rule judicially that, as a matter of law, one party must always front the costs regardless of the circumstances of the particular case, and I agree with you, to that extent I think the D.C. Circuit's opinion is overbroad. I don't know whether it would necessarily be applied as broadly as the language seems to suggest, but what I do know is that the problems inherent in that kind of a rule, which has not been tested particularly, are such that it's completely premature for this Court to go down that path. Where this Court ought to focus is, what was before the district judge when that court decided to send it to arbitration, and what was before that judge at that time was, silence, which you construe favorably to arbitration and therefore send the matter to arbitration with no further judicial review.",
  "We said -- we were never asked specifically our views with respect to this.",
  "Well, the issue came up in a motion to reconsider, Justice Stevens. That was the first time they suggested that these costs were excessive. They did raise the class action earlier in the process, but they didn't raise the question of costs specifically and, frankly, even in the Eleventh Circuit the cost question was more of a second thought than it was a primary portion or focus of the attention of the court. If you're asking me, would we pay those costs in most cases, I can tell you that I know that Green Tree does pay those costs in a lot of instances, but that's the whole point. The plaintiff has the obligation --",
  "-- at least to ask that question.",
  "Even if we didn't lose. We front the costs at a minimum, and oftentimes we can't get those costs back. If there are no questions, further questions, I'd reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Unless you have further questions on the jurisdictional issue, I'm going to focus on the question of enforceability. It was only at the very tail end of Mr. Sellers' remarks that he identifies the fact that there is a national policy favoring arbitration, and I don't think we should lose sight of the fact that in this context there was a voluntarily entered into arbitration clause that ought to be enforced under these circumstances, and there are no guarantees, when you go down arbitration as opposed to litigation. We are in a situation now where we have litigated this issue in three different jurisdictions and levels of this court. I don't think anybody going in anticipated any of those costs, and certainly no one is in a position to give a guarantee that any process of dispute resolution is going to be cost-free or have cost constraints and, indeed, the plaintiff never asked the district court for any of the specifics that counsel has identified in the context of this particular case. What she said is, plaintiff does not have the resources to arbitrate, notwithstanding her agreement. Therefore, plaintiff's only option is to forego any claims against this company. That is the sum and substance of her position with respect to costs, not some kind of more restrained action, and that's why the district court rejected the notion --",
  "-- that those costs were unconscionable.",
  "There's no problem with seeking discovery. The question is, did she --",
  "It's not in the record in this case. She sought some discovery. She didn't seek additional discovery. Those are reasonable choices litigants make every day, and the point is, it's certainly not appropriate for this Court in a case in which the Eleventh Circuit quite clearly handled all of this as a matter of law. The Chief Justice is absolutely right. You read 17(a) and 18(a) and it says, presume everything adverse to the lender in this case, and only then can you come to the conclusion that this arbitration clause should be enforced. That's clearly wrong, as an approach to this particular case, and that's the judgment that ought to be reversed. The rest of these issues I think legitimately ought to be considered somewhere down the line.",
  "But Cole and reasonableness and unconscionability are questions that need to be resolved in a framework that is fundamentally different from a litigant who throws up her hands and says, I'm not going to participate in this particular process.",
  "It may be wrong, if we have the right facts. I think it is a mistake to say categorically that the lender will always pay the fees, regardless of the circumstances in a particular case. Now, you know, if the case came up in the right context, I could well imagine the court might adopt a view like that. I could also imagine it might adopt the dissenting opinion in Cole and say, no, it still requires more of a case-by-case analysis in order to properly balance the interests of both sides, but the clear thing you shouldn't do is reject sending this case to arbitration on a record where the plaintiff had a full and fair opportunity and chose simply to say she's not going to play in that particular ball park. If there are no other questions, thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to essentially focus on three basic points, what the Court held in Nierotko, the importance of the 1946 amendments to the Social Security Act on both the benefits and the tax side, and then finally try to discuss and balance the relative positions with respect to the administrative convenience or inconvenience of the various positions taken here today. With respect to Nierotko, I think I understand the United States to have finally conceded that the pivotal language in the Nierotko decision is the wages-paid language, and that there is no meaningful distinction between the wages-paid language that was the basis for the interpretation in that case and the wages-paid language that we have inherited now that is the subject of the provisions that are at issue in this particular case. But to the extent that there is any question on that, I would ask the Court to recognize first of all it's clear that the Court was interpreting the 1939 amendments, which contains that language. The first paragraph of the opinion refers to quarters of coverage, which was a concept that did not exist prior to 1939, so it clearly had '39 in mind at that point. And then if you look at the penultimate and the ultimate paragraph of the Supreme Court -- of this Court's opinions, it also discusses quite specifically that -- the provision that's at stake here and it says, you know, the petitioner argues, to put it into context, the amendments of 1939 use quarters as the basis for eligibility as well as the measure of benefits, and require wages to be paid in certain quarters, and this Court then, in rejecting essentially that argument said, we have no doubt that it, referring to back pay, should be allocated to the periods when the regular wages were not paid as usual. I think there's no other way to interpret Nierotko except for saying that language of wages paid in the benefits context, certainly, means that you allocate it back to when those wages should have been paid under the -- under that particular scheme. It's a special rule for back pay. Obviously, it doesn't deal with the general accrual problems. It doesn't resurrect any of the accrual problems. It doesn't ask you to try to make those kinds of decisions. It asks you to say, when would they have been paid if the employer --",
  "That's correct.",
  "Right, it was a benefits case, Mr. Chief Justice, which is why it then becomes pivotal to turn to 1946.",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "Yes, I think that's correct. I mean, it might turn out if the employer --",
  "-- is late and there's some fault attributed to it, that might be a different issue, but if he just paid at a different time and there's no issue about it, it's not back pay within the meaning of the Federal scheme, so you know --",
  "-- and obviously, a dispute as to whether this was back pay for purposes of this rule.",
  "Well, there is --",
  "Right. There are regulations that define back pay, and do it in terms of payments that would have been made by the employer, you know, but for the employer's wrongdoing, but I don't -- and I don't understand the Government to either, at any point in this litigation to have raised any question as to whether this is fairly describable as back pay. As I understand the question they've asked the Court to decide is, assuming it's back pay, what's the appropriate allocation rule for that kind of an approach.",
  "It may well be back pay, depending on the circumstances. If the reason I didn't pay is because I've breached the contract, and I have an obligation to pay it under those circumstances, it might well be back pay under those circumstances.",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Right. I mean -- but I mean, I don't think you're entitled to hold off paying because you don't have the money.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right. Well, the back-pay definition in the regulations is, pay received in one period of time which would have been paid in a prior period of time except for a wrongful or improper action taken by an employer, under that circumstance I suspect that would fall within back pay, as the Federal Government itself deals with it, but --",
  "It is in the year received, as it turns out today, but recall, Justice O'Connor, back when this was all enacted in both 1939 and 1946 it would not have been paid under those circumstances. There was a whole different regime with respect to income taxes that existed at that time, and against which Congress was acting with respect to the taxing part and the benefits part of the Social Security Act.",
  "Well, it might be. I don't have a view on that actually, Justice Kennedy. All I'm doing is reading the reg and saying that they attribute to -- you know, the question is whether it's wrongful. There may be issues --",
  "Right, and --",
  "And my guess is there would be a basis for which you could make a claim of back pay, but that's obviously not what Congress was concerned about when it modified the rule to make it simpler.",
  "It was dealing with the traditional accrual problem of payments that you expect in the ordinary course to be paid at times that are different from when the services arise, and then what do you do in that situation, which is a pretty common problem. It's one I face every year.",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Absolutely, Justice Breyer.",
  "Well --",
  "You know, the Court addressed exactly the same quote, mess, in Nierotko itself.",
  "But it addressed --",
  "Right, but --",
  "But Justice Breyer, the point is, is that there are still the same accounting questions that will arise under that scheme, that will arise under our interpretation today, and this Court -- and the Government argued, don't go that route, because there will be accounting problems.",
  "Well, they are very, very similar, Justice Breyer.",
  "And the Court dismissed those as not insuperable.",
  "Right.",
  "There are two answers to that. One is, in the 1946 amendments, Congress was very clear when it said, what we want here is conformity on the benefits side and on the tax side, and therefore the ultimate question about administrative convenience isn't the answer. What Congress wanted was for the two schemes to be the same, so to the extent that the benefits tends to take you back in time, as I think the Government has conceded today it continues to do, in order to comply or to further the overall objective of Congress in 1946, you have to do the same thing on the tax side, otherwise conformity is completely impossible to achieve, and that's the overriding congressional purpose, it seems to me.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, I mean, there are two answers to that. One is the overall purpose of the Court's mission here is presumably to implement Congress' intent, and if Congress says to you, by adopting exactly the same words for two separate provisions that deal with two different schemes --",
  "-- then it seems to me the answer is, adopt Congress' -- and tells you we want conformity between the two --",
  "-- then the only -- I'm sorry, Justice --",
  "Yes. For the last 50 years the Social Security Administration --",
  "Yes, on both sides, though. Remember, Social Security Administration --",
  "-- has had an equally uniform rule that it has applied since the very day Nierotko was decided, and when the 1946 amendments went into place, and if you look at the lodging that we filed that identifies --",
  "-- a description of this analysis by the Social Security Administration, from day one they said, the Court said in Nierotko, for back pay you have to allocate it back, and that's the way we're going to apply it, and that sort of makes the --",
  "Right, but that's clearly wrong, because when you're dealing -- I mean, it may be one thing for quarters of coverage, which is what he identified, but when you're talking about the maximum benefits of $50,000, and you're talking about incomes that well exceed that, how you treat that money is a big, big difference in terms of how it applies out in a particular situation.",
  "But that's an asymmetry that has existed for all time. There's never been consistency between income taxes and Social Security taxes. What I'm trying to do is say, when you talk about, quote, Social Security taxes, which defines what kinds of benefits you're going to get and whether you're entitled to benefits in any event, as opposed to Social Security taxes as to how much has to be contributed by the employer, that it ought to be the same. It should not be that John Butcher, for instance --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, I don't know that they'll always be helped. There are certainly certain circumstances where -- it depends on how much income they had, under what -- at what point in time.",
  "Well, I don't read Nierotko as having given them that option. I read Nierotko as saying that, you know, you must allocate back. That's the answer for back pay, in order to do it. But you know, if there's some mechanism in there for waiving their rights, I suppose that may be true, but I don't think you can analyze the same language in the same statute adopted at the same time with a command the two ought to be in conformity to each other, and then interpret them as allowing fundamentally different approaches, and that goes to the core of the question of administrative ease. Let's be clear about this, there is an entire set of accounting rules for Social Security that exist today, and a complete set of accounting rules that apply under the IRS, and as I understand the Government's position, Social Security is absolutely right in its interpretation of what's required here, so if you're going to have consistency in this approach, the only way you can have consistency is by moving the IRS over to the Social Security side.",
  "The Senate report that we --",
  "Oh, well, the language in the Act itself is wages paid. It's exactly identical in both the Social Security benefits language and the Social Security -- excuse me, under the tax provision itself. Wages paid is the operative language and, as I understand the Government today, they concede that's the key term that we're focusing on, and that language was used, you know, with the express statement in the legislative history, that it was done for conformity, which just reinforces what I think common sense would tell us.",
  "Yes, Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "It's on page 21 of our brief.",
  "It seems to me that --",
  "Well, I hesitate to speculate about what the Internal Revenue Service's motive was here, other than -- I do think it's important to put in context, remember, the Internal Revenue -- the Government's position here is, this doesn't promote fairness, this doesn't promote revenue enhancement. The sole purpose that they try to promote is some notion of administrative simplicity, and so they have a somewhat simpler method of dealing with it. It just happens to do violence to core notions of statutory interpretation, creates two different schemes of accounting that every employer and employee has to deal with, and creates the kinds of disruptions in the scheme that we spent some time talking about under the exceptions under the Social Security --",
  "And that would -- and that might be a colorable argument but for the fact that Congress, before the ink was dried on Nierotko, looked at exactly that language, adopted exactly that language, and engrafted it into the statute on a going-forward basis, and so the notion that the Court might revisit Nierotko, you know, today -- I mean, 1) the Government doesn't ask you to, and 2) it doesn't make sense to do that, and second, I don't even understand the Government to be asking you to reconsider it on the benefits side. What it says is, you can have a tax rule that goes in one direction, a benefits rule that goes in another direction, when the language is exactly identical.",
  "Well, you know, it's an interesting question, because both sides of the -- you know, the Federal Government is obviously of two minds on this score. I'm not sure who would have generated enough momentum in order to try to get it changed under those circumstances, so as far as I know there haven't been any legislative efforts.",
  "Well, I would hope that the Court would rigorously enforce the ruling in Nierotko and -- but beyond that, I think you get more mileage in this particular context, because Congress in 1946 ratified Nierotko and implemented it on a going-forward basis, so, I mean, I don't think there's a -- I don't understand the Government to be arguing that we ought to revisit Nierotko at this particular --",
  "I don't think I appreciated that till today.",
  "Right.",
  "Predated Chevron, too.",
  "Sure.",
  "Because of the 1946 amendments, and for exactly the reason you identified. Nierotko is a famous case. Congress, seven months after the 1946 famous Nierotko decision --",
  "-- comes back to this same tax- benefits position, uses exactly that language. What could Congress have meant? It clearly didn't mean to overrule Nierotko on the benefits side, and it says it wants the tax side to conform to it. So in 1946, Congress told us the right answer, and hopefully, 55 years, this Court will tell the IRS that's the right answer, get in line with the Social Security Administration, and affirm the judgment below. If they need a change, let them take it to Congress. If there are no other questions, I'll --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether an action for damages under Bivens should be applied to a private corporation acting under color of Federal law. Like many cases, where you come out on a case like this, I think in many ways depends on where you begin, and the parties have put forward to this Court fundamentally conflicting paradigms with respect to the best way to analyze Bivens based on this Court's prior decisions. The respondent and the court below essentially concluded that Bivens is a ubiquitous remedy that ought, generally, to be available in order to maximize recoveries and to maximize, or at least optimize, deterrent values, and that it is our burden essentially to try to ascertain whether there might be some conflicting or some exception to the Bivens doctrine that would get us out from under liability in the -- in this particular case. The --",
  "That's correct, Justice O'Connor.",
  "We have always assumed, from the first day of this litigation, that a Bivens action would lie against the individual employees.",
  "Well, for purposes of this litigation and for purposes of my client, there's no question we would concede that an action would have legitimately been -- been raised against them. To say in a future case whether or not a private employee might raise an argument as to whether Bivens should be extended is a separate question.",
  "You mean under a theory of respondeat superior.",
  "As a matter of State law, it's going to depend on the State. Most States I think do recognize respondeat superior liability.",
  "Well, obviously, there's going to be at least the potential argument raised with respect to Boyle and whether or not the -- the decision to hold the individual liable under those circumstances is preempted under Boyle. But I think the argument here is slightly weaker than it was in Boyle, and it probably depends to a certain extent on -- on the -- on whether or not the Federal Government in fact is dictating what both the -- what the employer and the employee are doing with respect to --",
  "Well, I think you're doing an extraordinary amount, Justice Kennedy. And the Government's brief, I think quite rightly, points out at page 20 in footnote 10, that the availability of a corporate defendant significantly changes the mix with respect to any kind of litigation. And actually, if you look at the three cases that postdate this Court's decision in FDIC v. Meyer, all of those are cases in which the only defendant who was named happened to be the corporation. The individuals were not named under any of those circumstances.",
  "The -- the premise of your question, Justice Ginsburg, I think is where the -- where the mistake lies in the final outcome of the decision. This Court made quite clear in FDIC v. Meyer that it's not a principal agency relationship because there's no question that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was the agent of the United States Government for purposes of what it did in that particular context. The Court said that's not the right analysis. The right analysis is to go back and look at the Bivens action and make a judgment with respect to whether or not the litigation, as it comes to this Court, adequately serves the two primary purposes of Bivens; that is, that there is relief available and that there is an effective deterrent in place. If those -- if those are satisfied, then the issue of whether you should extend Bivens to a new category of defendants, this Court said, should be answered in the negative, saying that there is no reason to add additional defendants under those circumstances.",
  "No, Justice --",
  "Well, the question ultimately comes down to this, Your Honor, is that does it make any more sense in this context to resolve this issue at this point in time than it did to decide the FDIC v. Meyer case at that point in time. Because, again, we didn't have the employee involved in the litigation as it came to this Court. He had fallen out in that litigation, just as the employee had fallen out in this litigation. And what the Court said was, we should analyze and, indeed, have to resolve the conflict as to whether a private corporate defendant ought to be liable under these circumstances. So, that issue needs to be resolved. And, what's more, if the Court puts off for another day deciding the liability of the employee, it doesn't affect whether my client ought to be held not responsible in a Bivens action because either one of two things will happen. Either you will conclude that private employees are, in fact, susceptible to an action under Bivens, in which case the adequacy of the remedy and the adequacy of the deterrent by having that direct lawsuit means that there's no reason to extend Bivens to my client. Or you'll conclude that the distinction is between public and private actors and that we have special reasons giving us hesitation and caution into extending the Bivens action, since it's an implied cause of action and not a congressionally adopted one, into the sphere where the private actors are acting under color of Federal right.",
  "I was only --",
  "I was simply answering Justice Kennedy and Justice O'Connor's question. They phrased it in the form of a concession, to be sure.",
  "I'm not giving up much in that regard. But as I say, the important element here, at least in my judgment, about how all this plays out is that if the Court decides that employees are amenable to suit, there's no reason to sue the corporation. If they decide they are not amenable to suit, it's going to be because of the public/private distinction. And again, under that theory, we're not amenable to suit.",
  "That would be an argument, but in order to do that, Justice Scalia, you would then have to abandon what was one of the principal legs of Bivens in the first instance, which is that the litigation against the private individual and the deterrent value of litigation against the private individual is the most significant way to achieve the overall objectives --",
  "I think the flaw in your analysis of the deterrence theory, Justice Souter, is that you're looking to figure out what is sort of the optimal answer for deterrence. And the way I read this Court's decision in FDIC v. Meyer is that what we satisfy ourselves about is, is there an effective deterrent and an effective damages remedy in place and available to the individual plaintiff in a particular instance. And that -- it seems to me that's the gap-filler role that Bivens calls on the Court to -- to provide. When you go beyond -- I'm sorry.",
  "But when you go beyond that, it seems to me you then assume much more of a legislative role. Then you're trying to balance the relative optimal deterrence values. Then you have to take into account the effect on the Federal fisc or the relationship between the -- the Federal contractor and the Federal Government. And that's a series of questions, I submit to Your Honors, you ought to leave to Congress. And that's exactly what the Court said in Meyer. It analyzed and said, questions of optimal deterrence, questions of effect on the Federal treasury, those are issues that we think are better dealt with by Congress as long as we have an adequate --",
  "Well -- obviously, we don't ask the Court to overrule Bivens. At least, we make that argument in the brief. But the -- I think the answer to that is there are two components of Bivens. One is, is there in place the gap-filler adequate remedy? Is there a damages remedy and a deterrent effect from that damages remedy? Is that in place? Then sometimes, even though that's in place, there will be a serious question as to whether or not, nevertheless, special circumstances suggest that there ought to be caution. And it's frankly the -- the respondents burden to satisfy both elements of that. What I'm suggesting to you in this context is you don't have to look at what the impact would be on the Federal Government at the end of the day. What you have to look at is whether there is an adequate remedy in place, and if you didn't have that, I think there would be a serious --",
  "Right.",
  "Correct.",
  "Well, you made two -- you made two points, Justice Breyer.",
  "Indeed, I may be making the argument --",
  "Well, now you've made three points, Justice Breyer. And let me try to take them up in -- in turn. First of all, with -- with respect to Richardson, I mean, that's an immunity case, and the Court is in a world where it has to resolve optimization in the immunity context. That's a judge-made set of rules, and this Court is obliged to resolve it in the best way that it can under those circumstances. It's a fundamentally different question about whether you hold the defendant liable in the first instance in a private -- privately implied cause of action derived directly under the Constitution. We could differ and disagree about what's the right method of -- of achieving optimization, but I don't think you can read Richardson as saying categorically that you will -- you will lose all your deterrent effect. To say that is I think to both abandon what you said in Bivens and clearly abandon what you said in Meyer. With respect to the ability of the private person to come in and argue the next time around, his argument I think, frankly, is going to be a tough one because what he's got to say is even though you have now held the corporation not to be liable -- I'm assuming for purposes of the moment that I win here -- that -- that we, nevertheless, also ought not to be liable. And, again, as I said earlier, I think the distinction there is between the -- having a remedy in place that is in any meaningful way effect or not, and therefore it is a tougher argument for the private employee under those circumstances to make that particular argument. And then your last point with respect to section 1983 simply disregards what I perceive to be the fundamental difference between having a congressional enactment that comprehensively regulates a particular area provide liability against any person and sets up a set of rules in -- in order to effectuate that particular remedy and the situation we face in Bivens where, heretofore, we have never imposed -- this Court has never --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "That's absolutely correct, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Well, there are two answers to that, Justice Ginsburg. First of all, no policy gets set by a corporation as such. All -- all policies, just like all actions of corporations, have to be undertaken by individuals. Somebody had to have adopted that policy. But second of all, I don't read the respondent's complaint here to have alleged any policy of the corporation was at fault here. The -- the complaint itself specifically says there was an exception made for the respondent so that he could take the elevator. A specific employee who was named as a defendant --",
  "Well, I -- you can construe it most favorably to the plaintiff, but not necessarily to embrace a complete different theory of the case that is far from clear. And this is -- and remember, this was written by counsel. This is not a pro se complaint we're talking about. This was counsel's complaint. I think if they had meant for this to be a policy or practice case, they would have said so. But I think the more fundamental point here is -- is that -- is that there has to be a policy maker. If that policy was unconstitutional, then it's still available to the plaintiff in a Bivens action to sue that policy maker directly for having adopted the unconstitutional policy and to sue the employee for having implemented the policy in an unconstitutional fashion. So, there are adequate remedies, which means that the remedy against us is inappropriate. If there are no further questions, I'd reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to address what I think are sort of two pivotal points here. One, derive -- I derive from Justice Kennedy's question asking Mr. Pasternak about the effect of the Richardson decision because it seems to me the Court, obviously, should be concerned about what its prior precedents tell us about the appropriate way to proceed. He concedes, too, that Richardson, a case on which he relied very heavily in his brief, frankly does not provide him with much comfort. I would have asked him, in -- in turn, the extent to which he derives comfort from the FDIC v. Meyer decision in which this Court, it seems to me, essentially addressed the same issue we have here and told litigants going forward look to the private employee, look to the employees as the primary source to obtain remedies and to obtain maximum deterrence. And once you satisfy that, then you're done with the inquiry because the Court specifically addressed in Meyer the -- the question of do you -- do you extend Bivens to a new category of defendants. And that takes me to the second point I think is worth keeping in mind, and that was the question that Justice Scalia asked, which is why don't we simply leave this to Congress to resolve at the end of the day. And it seems to me a -- an intricate debate about questions of indemnification, where we don't know what the final answer is about who has what rights of indemnification, questions of respondeat superior where we don't even know specifics about what -- what causes of action may or may not be available, questions of the availability of punitive damages, all of these questions are left on the table completely unknown at this point. It seems to me, in the context of that kind of a circumstance, the Court was correct in Meyer in saying that we should leave these questions to Congress, and if Congress acts, then you can seek out the kind of parallelism between 1983 and a Federal cause of action, or if you don't, presumably Congress will have explained to you why there are disparities between the various approaches. It seems to me that the best solution for this Court is to recognize that a hands-off approach is the final answer.",
  "For purposes of where the case is right at the moment, yes.",
  "I think on remand, obviously we would fight -- if -- if the case were to go forward, we would continue to fight that issue.",
  "It's immediately removable.",
  "Well, there will be a preemption issue that's going to immediately arise as to whether or not he's immune -- whether he's immune. And -- you know, if it's within the scope of his responsibilities, then he'll have -- he'll have an immunity --",
  "That's correct.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1997, this Court recognized that there is an asbestos litigation crisis confronting the Nation, and nothing in the last five years has -- done anything other than to show that that crisis is more acute now than at any other time in our history. The Rand Corporation in a report just two months ago concluded that there are now 6,000 defendants confronted with asbestos litigation claims, that the estimated value of those claims in litigation costs exceeds $200 billion. The six plaintiffs who are involved in this case, the respondents here today, are emblematic of at least a fundamental element of the problem that confronts asbestos litigation. Each of them received close to, and in some instances more than a million dollars in compensatory damages for claims of asbestosis. The basis for their claim, the primary basis for their claim was that they confronted a fear of cancer. Asbestosis does not convert into cancer --",
  "Well, there is a legal answer and there is a factual answer. The legal answer is that you have to assume it because the jury was instructed to include it as an element, and under West Virginia law, it is absolutely settled and respondents don't contest it.",
  "They all suffered asbestosis, and they all suffered some physical elements of it.",
  "I don't know that it's not the primary ingredient, Justice Stevens. What I do know is that as a matter of law, you can't ignore the fact that the -- that fear of cancer was put before the jury as a significant component of the plaintiff's case in chief, that the jury was instructed to include that, and that --",
  "Well, I think the record supports it in the sense that we know that these are asbestosis claims that even the respondents' expert testified were mild, for the most part. One or two differences about that, but these are still relatively mild asbestosis claims, and mild asbestosis claims do not typically generate million-dollar damages awards --",
  "-- particularly where there's no cost of medical care as part of the component.",
  "No, the defendants didn't -- the defendant did not ask for that.",
  "What the defendant did ask for, Justice Ginsburg, was to have fear-of damages eliminated as a component of the case in a case like this --",
  "Oh, and that's because it's the plaintiff's burden. If they didn't want to have -- if they didn't want to take the risk of a general verdict being set aside because there's an element of damages that's included that the court ultimately decides should be excluded as a matter of law, they then bear the risk and the burden of having the case sent back for a new trial.",
  "Well, the problem's easy to identify, that is that if the instruction is that everyone who suffers a diagnosed case of asbestosis is entitled to go to the jury on fear of cancer claims, then the amount of damages that will be generated as a consequence of that will run completely out of sync --",
  "-- with the damages that --",
  "But this Court --",
  "Justice Breyer, you said, or the Court said in Buckley that you don't analyze these issues case by case. What you have to do is make a judgment about the category of cases that's based on the policies of the Federal Employers Liability Act, and the policy --",
  "It's in the discretion of the trial court, and it is also clear under West Virginia law that if two theories are put before the jury with respect to damages and one of them is impermissible, the answer is you strike down and you get a new trial on damages, so that's -- that's clear. And I don't -- I don't hear the respondents as arguing anything to the contrary.",
  "No. This Court said in Gottshall that pain and suffering damages are describable as sensations stemming directly from a physical injury or condition. The physical injury that -- that's identified here is asbestosis, and to be sure, the pain and suffering that an asbestotic would be allowed to recover for might be a fear of shortness of breath or other symptoms that arise out of asbestosis, but the notion that cancer that doesn't exist currently, may never take place, stems from the existence of asbestosis is not a fair application of that rule of law, particularly when there is no evidence, and again, I don't think respondents challenge this, that asbestosis does not cause cancer, it does not lead to cancer.",
  "All -- Not --",
  "Well, I think it's the respondents who are asking you to do something different with a pain and suffering case, and actually I'm not even sure that's a fair way to characterize the respondents' argument. I don't understand them to be arguing that this is a classic pain and suffering --",
  "Right, and my argument is, this is not under any circumstances the kind of pain and suffering that we traditionally think of. It's not something that emanates directly out of the existing injury. Second, it's not negligent infliction of emotional distress, and it's not emotional injury as a component of a negligence claim.",
  "No. It was --",
  "Well, it wasn't clear exactly what it was until the jury -- until we got to the jury instructions. At that point, the trial judge did say, I view these as pain and suffering.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, except that the traditional standard for pain and suffering doesn't permit the kind of disconnect between the fear of cancer that you're talking about here and asbestosis. You normally associate pain and suffering as sensations that emanate directly from the injury itself, and fear of cancer doesn't emanate at all from asbestosis.",
  "Fright from asbestosis --",
  "-- to be sure.",
  "Well, it's interesting, you know, the testimony itself was simply, do you have a fear because of exposure to asbestos now that you have asbestosis. They didn't even ask the question whether the fear arises out of the asbestosis.",
  "No. Our argument, Justice Souter, was that fear of cancer is too unrelated, as a matter of law, to be an element of pain and suffering.",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "I think --",
  "Buckley, frankly, is as close to anything on that score, because Buckley says even if you accept as an article of faith, as I think the Court did, that each of those individuals who'd been exposed to asbestos felt that he or she would be more seriously at risk --",
  "No, none of the --",
  "No.",
  "There are two answers to that, Justice Souter. In the first place, the -- there is no strong common law doctrine that says that those -- that that kind of a disconnect between the damages is a core element of what the common law routinely grants for --",
  "Right.",
  "Well, the core of the pain and suffering -- the pain and suffering theory is that it is a fright that emanates directly out of the particular condition you have, which is asbestosis.",
  "No. Even if you accept that premise, Justice Souter, you still have to confront the overall policies of the Federal Employers Liability Act, and the question of whether not allowing a recovery that might otherwise be legitimate -- and that is precisely what the Court said --",
  "Well, I don't think the common law clearly allows it.",
  "No, because --",
  "There are lower court -- we cite the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decisions, the Eleventh Circuit decisions -- there are decisions out there that have said we're not going to allow fear of cancer in cases involving asbestosis, but I --",
  "Well, I'm not asking you to -- I don't think the answer to this case resides in the common law, because I think the common law is essentially a muddle. There are cases on both sides.",
  "Absolutely, Justice O'Connor, and the reason to do that --",
  "I -- I -- I'll concede that it is a minority view in the sense that there are maybe five cases on one side --",
  "-- and three or four on the other.",
  "This is not an area that's been litigated sufficiently to be able to say where the trends are.",
  "Right. Well, I've only got two or three cases that identify it in the context -- the way you just did, Justice O'Connor, and my colleague on the other side will identify four or five cases that don't impose that requirement, but what remains absolutely critical in the analysis of this case, I think, is the core policy that this Court identified in Gottshall and in Buckley that says if you don't have a clear answer from the common law, you have to look to see whether or not this particular damages remedy creates the possibility of unpredictable and unlimited damages, and that's the reason why the Court needs to adopt a more restrictive view of the standard to be applied under the Federal Employers Liability Act. That may not be the rule that would be required as a matter of common law in any particular State, but under FELA, the notion that you're going to create unlimited liability in circumstances in which the plaintiffs are allowed significantly reduced requirements in order to prove the basis for their claim suggests that this Court has consistently taken the position that it must cut back and not allow on a category basis -- on a categorical basis -- not allow damages to extend to --",
  "No, I don't think so --",
  "-- Justice Scalia.",
  "I think that would be a different case. I think once you get past more likely than not --",
  "I think when you get past more likely than not that you will incur cancer, there is a risk, then at that point -- but remember, the flip side of this is the two-disease rule, and that's an important element in how the Court ought to analyze this problem, because not only -- by allowing fear of cancer damages now, you essentially say to the world, the sky is the limit, inconsistent with what the Court said in Gottshall and Buckley. The flip side is, if you don't allow the fear of cancer damages now, but allow fear of -- but allow the plaintiff to come back after he or she contracts cancer and allows as a part of that recovery for fear of cancer, then the people who are most seriously injured are made whole at the appropriate time in the appropriate circumstances.",
  "The apportionment.",
  "Thank you, Justice O'Connor.",
  "Well, the quick answer on apportionment is that in 1908, it was absolutely clear there was several liability. You're only liable for the injuries you cause. That's embodied, I think, in the statutory language that says that the railroad is responsible for the injuries while employed. That language has been interpreted as recognizing we only pay for the things that we cause. The Third Restatement --",
  "But that goes to the question of what you need to show a jury in order to get a negligence claim to the jury in the first instance. It doesn't say you're -- you're liable for the entirety of the damages in whole or in part.",
  "It could, but I don't think that's the most natural reading of that particular language, and I don't think it's an appropriate one where the policies in 1908, and the policies of the law under the Third Restatement quite clearly say that you should apportion, because that is the fair way in order to ensure that a defendant is not -- does not -- is not forced to overcompensate.",
  "Right, and I think the statute and the existing common law clearly suggest that the right answer is that because you've reduced the burden of the plaintiff in order to get into court and to be able to make a case, the quid pro quo for that ought to be that you only hold the railroad liable for the amount of the injury it caused, and here it is not contested that -- and Mr. Butler's case is the prototype example of it -- he had three months of exposure when he was with Norfolk & Western, he had 30 years of exposure with others. That is a reasonable basis on which to apportion for cause, and that -- and no one has contested that. I'd reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to be absolutely clear about the apportionment in this case. We put in an instruction on apportionment based on a reasonable basis following Justice Kennedy's analysis of the law, which says if there's a reasonable basis to apportion, you do that. The trial judge did not reject that on the basis of insufficient evidence. What he said at page 179, volume 9 of the transcript is, if you've got a joint tort­ feasor, that tort-feasor is liable for all of the injuries. He said it as a matter of law. It's joint and several liability. There is no apportionment. That's the ruling we challenged. That's the legal issue before this Court. The second question, then, with your leave, is to --",
  "Well, Dean Prosser said from day one it's always going to be difficult to apportion, but that's no reason not to have the jury undertake to apportion. There are lots of decisions that juries make that are very hard to make, but the better rule is to apportion, because that's the fair outcome that will arise in these cases. With respect to the fear of cancer damages, the key to this case, it seems to me, is just how big a gatekeeper function the fact of asbestosis can be, and my -- the argument is, asbestosis is extraordinarily easy to diagnose. There are currently 5,500 cases under FELA in West Virginia. Every single one of them involves a claim of asbestosis. Every single one of them will be supported by an expert. What you get is, that's not a gatekeeper. Those cases are going to come in, and then you're going to have exactly the kinds of evidence you had in this case, I'm afraid of cancer, give me whatever you think is the right number. That is the essence of unpredictable and unlimited damages. This Court declined to allow that under FELA in Buckley. It should decline to allow that under FELA in this case as well. If there are no questions, I'll reserve --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under 42 U.S.C. section 1396a, in subsection (a)(19), which is found on page 244 of the joint appendix, Congress made absolutely clear, as a singular precondition of all Medicaid plans, that they must assure that care and services will be provided in a manner consistent with simplicity of administration and the best interests of the recipients. This statute does not allow Maine to use Medicaid recipients as pawns in its effort to reduce health care costs for those individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid.",
  "The Medicaid statute?",
  "Oh, absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "That's true, Justice Scalia.",
  "Well, the way this operates is that this is not adopted as a part of the State's plan that's subjected to review by the Secretary of HHS. What this is, is a completely separate program that's been adopted independently, and all it does is reach out and hold the recipients of Medicaid as hostages in order to extract money from out-of-state manufacturers --",
  "-- but it's not a part of the plan.",
  "I believe the Secretary might have that power, although I would ask you to ask Mr. Kneedler when -- when he's arguing.",
  "But over and above that, that doesn't -- but that's not an exclusive remedy, that's all.",
  "Well, I mean --",
  "-- there's a -- there's a formalistic way of looking at it, which is that they have a State plan, and this is not incorporated as part of the State plan. What this has been -- what has been done here is to adopt a completely separate program which simply reaches out, as I said before, and seeks to hold hostage certain elements of it.",
  "Well, no, there has to be a State plan. The question is whether or not (a)(19) reflects congressional intent that the State has to act in a particular way. If it acts contrary to that way, the only question then is, are there multiple remedies available to respond to it? I think, Justice O'Connor, the answer to your question is yes. I think the Secretary does have that authority to go forward, although I would ask Mr. Kneedler --",
  "I -- there's an open question as to whether they could do that. Certainly, if you take the most expansive reading of 1396r-8(d) you could make that argument. The alternative argument would be to what extent that that violates or interferes with the formulary formulations that are embedded in the statute.",
  "No, it doesn't follow a fortiori, because what they're doing here is imposing the prior authorization with respect to, you know, to serve purposes that are completely unrelated to the Medicaid program.",
  "Well, I think you'd have to read that provision in the context of the entirety of the provision providing for coverage of drugs, and I think you have to do it in that context, and I think there are broader issues there, but the singular problem here, obviously, is that if you interpret the statute as broadly as the State of Maine does to say that we can impose prior authorization requirements, then what they can say is, we want to extract money from manufacturers solely for the purpose of building schools or roads or anything else that we want to, and there's no restriction on that, and it seems to me that if what you're saying is you want to have prior authorization as a mechanism to deal within Medicaid, to provide generally for a balance of interest between Medicaid recipients, that's one thing. But what -- what -- what Maine is doing is using Medicaid recipients to further completely unrelated purposes of the State, then it seems to me what you've done is essentially ask the Federal Government to subsidize a program that -- that's not an appropriate one to subsidize.",
  "I think it is. I think the better way to read the statute is to recognize that this is designed to benefit Medicaid recipients, and the problem is, once you get past programs that are designed to benefit recipients themselves, it's very difficult to see where you draw the line after that in terms of where it goes.",
  "Justice O'Connor, that is correct. They have approved those programs.",
  "Those programs are in litigation as we stand here --",
  "-- as I stand here today, and --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, I don't have any particular problem with sending it back to the district court enjoined subject to approval by the Secretary of HHS, I mean, if that's the way the Court wanted to resolve this case.",
  "I don't know, Justice Scalia, that you need to be dismissing it from Federal court. I think it's quite possible for the --",
  "Right, stay your hand pending --",
  "Well, I don't disagree with that, Justice Scalia.",
  "Well, I'm not sure that there isn't a mechanism for asking the -- to petition the Secretary for review. I think if Maine wanted to get approval of this particular program, it certainly had it available to do that. It didn't seek that particular course. And Justice Breyer, I think it's important, in the context of trying to figure out primary jurisdiction, we know the views of the United States with respect to this particular program. There may be other programs, as Justice O'Connor identified, that come close to the line where the Secretary would have a different view, and I think it's appropriate in --",
  "I believe it is the Secretary's view, but --",
  "That is not my position. My basic position is that the Court doesn't need to figure out precisely what prior authorizations are permissible in order to decide this case, because the one thing that should be absolutely clear is, you cannot use this mechanism in a Federal program in order to disadvantage the primary recipients of that program without serving any Medicaid, sort of, related purpose.",
  "That -- that's absolutely correct, Justice Scalia. We'd -- we -- I mean, I think we would take that position, and that we -- that you cannot read (d)(1) completely in isolation, and -- and to the fullest extent of the language of that, without regard to the rest of the provisions of (d)(1) through (d)(6), and you -- and for sure, you cannot read them without regard to the more fundamental requirement in subsection (a) and (a)(19), that the primary consideration must be the beneficiaries of this program. They are the most needy people in our country, and the notion that you use them as a mechanism for trying to simply lower health care costs for the Steven Kings of the world strikes me as -- as an outrageous position for the State of Maine to take.",
  "Justice Breyer, that would be a persuasive argument if this statute had any kind of a tailoring mechanism to it whatsoever. It is open to all residents who are otherwise not covered by --",
  "I don't know of any statutory mechanism for a third party to come in and ask the Secretary to review a State plan. I don't know that -- I don't know that there's anything that prevents anyone from sending a letter to the Secretary to ask him to take, to undertake that. That said, the Secretary obviously knows about this particular scheme.",
  "But the one thing that we absolutely know about the Maine scheme, and it -- Justice Breyer described it, is that every Medicaid recipient is placed at risk by the prior authorization scheme.",
  "Well, because there was a joinder --",
  "Well, if --",
  "The -- I don't have to go to the United States. The State of Maine concedes in its brief at page 25, Maine Rx can be expected to trigger prior authorization more often than previously.",
  "Well, but --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, but there'd be no way to enjoin the program before going into effect, which means that you essentially have to wait until actual Medicaid recipients are deprived of drugs in order to be able to implement -- to stop a program that on its face does nothing to benefit Medicaid beneficiaries, and clearly poses a serious threat to them. I -- if we go back to Hines v. Davidowitz language, it talks about the full achievement of Congress' objectives.",
  "Well, but it only authorizes --",
  "Sure. It -- to serve Medicaid- related purposes.",
  "I -- I understand that, Justice Stevens, but the point is that if you read the statute, and it's essentially six, those six words, to say that the State has unlimited authority to do that, it strikes me as inconceivable that Congress would have allowed this entire mechanism to be available for the State to come in and simply to raise revenue from out-of-State manufacturers. There is no rational basis for that kind of a conclusion. The much more sensible way to narrow the statute is to say, if it serves other Medicaid purposes, then that's an appropriate way to proceed. If it doesn't, then it seems to me the -- the Court has to conclude that the best interests of the beneficiaries ultimately has to trump here under these circumstances.",
  "Well, Justice O'Connor, we have three components to that argument. The thing that is -- I concede at the outset that there is no case at this Court that directly controls in either direction. This is a unique scheme that's been adopted here, and -- and --",
  "Well, when the entire burden of the program falls out of State, it seems to us that this creates at least a serious question about what's going on here. The --",
  "Well, I --",
  "Yes. There's no question that States are free to create certain types of regulations that are different from other States, and that's -- and that's not the full sweep of the argument that we're making here. What -- what --",
  "No, that's --",
  "I wouldn't presume to try to teach you about the Commerce Clause, Justice O'Connor, but the reality of what's happening here is much more like the West Lynn Creamery case, where what you're talking about is the payment of a subsidy, all by out-of-state entities, in order to benefit -- in that case it was to benefit in- state competitors. There are no in-state competitors in this case.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "I didn't hear --",
  "Under Pike v. Bruce Church.",
  "Yeah. The reason we didn't raise that argument is that we thought that we would require -- in order to make that argument we would require more factual findings by the district court --",
  "-- in order to get into it, because there's a balancing component to that --",
  "Well, I do think one of the real problems with this program is that some States will adopt this kind of a scheme and other States won't adopt this kind of a scheme, which means that you're going to have inherent discrimination with respect to consumers. Some consumers will benefit to the detriment of other consumers, and it does seem to me that -- that the theory of West Lynn Creamery was designed to say that you don't just look at the competitors and the relationships between them, you have to look more broadly at the manufacturers, the wholesalers, all the retailers, and all the way down to the consumers, and if you have the kind of discriminatory effects here where Maine seizes for itself all the economic benefits and imposes on -- on everyone else the economic burdens, that in that circumstance this runs afoul of the core --",
  "-- command of the Commerce Clause.",
  "Well, that was part -- yes, to be sure, Mr. Chief Justice, that's part of what they said. On the other hand, if you accept our basic theory about the clear discriminatory implication of the way the scheme operates, that kind of an operation is per se invalid. That's what the Court held in -- in West Lynn Creamery.",
  "No, it doesn't directly cover that, and I conceded that at the outset. On the other hand, the point here is that there are entities out there in the stream that are within Maine, and on whom this burden is not imposed. It was chosen to impose the burden strictly on the manufacturers, and it is done in a way that will create disparate impacts with respect to consumers in Maine versus consumers in other -- in other States, but --",
  "Well, and -- and if it operates within Medicaid, it seems to me that there's no -- there's no significant argument to be made there, because Congress has basically taken it over.",
  "But otherwise -- and one last point I'd like to make, which is simply that the Commerce Clause issue does not need to be addressed in the event the Court holds that the, that the Maine statute is preempted. If -- I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Stevens, I want to focus on the narrowest basis on which this case can be decided, which is, we have a preliminary injunction that was issued by the district court. A preliminary injunction was issued on the basis of two bases, 1) the State has not put forward any Medicaid-related purpose to be served by Maine Rx, and 2) that no matter how you want to define it, there is an obstacle to the full achievement of the recipient's primary interest of receiving medicine. As I said, there's a clear debate as to exactly the extent of the obstacle, but that there could be no question that there is an obstacle, and it seems to me that what this Court can do is simply say, those two findings are not an abuse of discretion on the record in this particular case, therefore there is a basis for affirming. If the Court wants to go further from that and say, on remand, some guidance might be useful from the Secretary of HHS and propose some mechanism by which to have primary jurisdiction or some other mechanism devised by which to obtain the review by the Secretary, I think there's probably no problem with that and, as I said before, I can't imagine that we would have any complaint about that, but the importance of this is to -- is to retain the injunction in place so that the unquestioned harms that are going to happen are not allowed to take place, and then try to undo them after the fact, which was the reason for issuing the injunction.",
  "Well, I think when you get past the preliminary injunction and you move on to the permanent injunction, if they think that they can show no burden whatsoever, or if they think they can show that there are greater purposes to be served, that's certainly available to them. But on an abuse of discretion standard this Court ought to affirm that, and nothing that the First Circuit said justifies taking any action in this particular case. If there are no other questions --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: First in Volt and then again last term in Waffle House this Court made clear that, quote, arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act is a matter of consent, not coercion. It is that core Federal principle that was violated by the South Carolina Supreme Court in this case.",
  "Oh, to be sure, Justice O'Connor, but this contract was not interpreted in accordance with the understanding of the parties, with -- with respect to the parties. Ultimately, you have to look for the parties' consent to this kind of an agreement, and what the South Carolina Supreme Court was quite clear about --",
  "To be sure, there was no express provision to that effect, but if you look at the South Carolina Supreme Court's decision in this case what it says is, first, the parties were absolutely silent with respect to class arbitration. That's not surprising. I've never read a class arbitration clause in any contract, and I'm told that no one's ever even attempted to draft a class arbitration clause. But second of all, the -- the court went further than that and said what was going to inform its judgment about how to interpret or how to apply this particular situation, it wasn't anything with respect to the language or understanding of the parties. What it was was, without any contractual directive whatsoever, stated twice, the court simply coerced Green Tree to defend a class arbitration proceeding.",
  "In -- the difference between this case and Volt, Mr. Chief Justice, is there the parties agreed that the arbitration itself would be controlled solely by California law. That was the consent of the parties.",
  "Right, and that was understood by this Court, and by the lower courts as a matter of State law, to embrace California law.",
  "The -- the underlying contract is governed by South Carolina law, but the arbitration provision itself is governed exclusively by the Federal Arbitration Act.",
  "It seems to me there are two ways you can get to this question. In this case, there was no effort by South Carolina Supreme Court to apply South Carolina law. What they did -- they're not looking for the consent of the parties. They're looking to coerce a result based on their view of efficiency and equity which involves the interests of completely third parties to this -- to this situation, not the parties to this particular agreement. If --",
  "If, in fact, South Carolina had purported -- if the South Carolina Supreme Court had purported to try to interpret this agreement as in some sense reflecting a -- a consent by the parties to a class-based arbitration it would be a much, much closer case.",
  "That's not the standard that the court applied here.",
  "No, that's not bad at all, Mr. Chief Justice. The difference between that, of course, is that is what you expect when you -- when you consent to a bilateral arbitration arrangement. When you say, we're going to proceed to resolve this dispute in an efficient and economical fashion, you understand that that means arbitration, however the -- however that gets played out and, indeed, generally speaking, you would expect that to be a question for the arbitrator, more than you might as a matter of State law. The difference here, of course, is we're talking about making a decision that's binding, or at least purports to be binding on literally thousands of other individuals who are not parties to this agreement, and this goes --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, we don't know whether they objected or not. All we know is that they received notice and took no action as a consequence of it, but --",
  "If you -- if you flip this case around, in this situation, where the -- where the unnamed members potentially are going to receive $5,000 to $7,500 of windfall recoveries, my guess is they're not going to object, but what if the case had gone the other way. What if the arbitrator had issued a $1 nominal damage award for each member of this class. Does anyone seriously doubt that the next day any of those unnamed class members could show up and say, excuse me, I have a right under my contract to choose my arbitrator in an agreement between myself --",
  "Can I -- can I respond to that, Justice Ginsburg, because you see, it seems to me that that simply reflects the manifest hostility to the arbitration agreement as it's been -- as it's been written by the parties here. I mean, basically what we're talking about is, we have a dispute. It involves what will largely be a few thousand dollars, potentially. I mean, the entire contract here involved $15,000 of -- in one case and $7,500. You expect the disputes are going to be relatively small, and you expect that the parties are going to choose an efficient method of trying to resolve those cases and move on, and -- and they waive their right to a public, or judicial review, because the theory is, win or lose, it's worth taking the risk. When you take that kind of a situation and you convert it into a $27 million fine, nobody would agree to that ab initio.",
  "It seems to me that the linchpin theory of the case ought to be the -- the point I started with, Justice Breyer, which is, you look to determine whether there is the consent of the parties or whether --",
  "Well, what South Carolina did --",
  "-- they imputed an intent.",
  "Well, it also doesn't reflect the consent of both of the parties.",
  "Both parties have to consent, Justice Breyer. That's the nature of consent.",
  "You simply can't have unilateral consent.",
  "Well --",
  "-- South Carolina Supreme Court drew that line. The South Carolina Supreme Court specifically held that the parties agreed that the arbitration clause would be governed exclusively by the Federal Arbitration Act, and the --",
  "Well, there are two ways to get there. First of all, as a matter of just South Carolina law we know that South Carolina's arbitration provisions completely go by the wayside as a matter of State law. Munoz held that several years ago. If the FAA applies, there is no State law that is residual to it. It is determined by the Federal Arbitration Act, which means that the arbitrator is going to make certain kinds of decisions. But the -- I think the key line here is that arbitrators are absolutely free to fashion whatever rules they think are appropriate for resolving disputes in a bilateral situation. The question is, where does the arbitrator get the authority to reach out to literally thousands of other parties in order to resolve their rights?",
  "Yes, although, Justice Ginsburg, there is not a single example that I could identify of any parties ever agreeing to go into a class action through arbitration.",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Other than this one?",
  "There are in California, but that's -- that's it. California and South Carolina are the only places, and the reason is, is that what you create is this extraordinarily hideous hybrid kind of a proceeding.",
  "No.",
  "Not as far as I know. I mean, they didn't file a brief in this case, but as far as I know AAA doesn't have rules specifically dealing with it. They find it to be, as I understand it, quite burdensome to try to figure out how to deal with it. If you think about it, this -- you're -- you're taking a dispute that by its nature is supposed to involve a few thousand dollars, converting it into $27 million. The costs in this case alone --",
  "-- were $36,000.",
  "Well, that's part of it.",
  "Well, I mean, the difficulty with that is that there's -- there's no State law in general -- I mean, there are no statutes out there that provide for class actions with respect to arbitrations. That's why this is a hostile --",
  "Oh, absolutely. The Federal Arbitration Act creates a substantive law of arbitrability. To be sure, it incorporates and embraces decisionmaking by the arbitrator. It recognizes some limited role in some circumstances for State law, although again South Carolina doesn't do that, but there -- there is nothing that provides a mechanism for converting your ordinary bilateral --",
  "I -- I think if the parties all agreed to have it resolved by the same arbitrator --",
  "No. I think in that situation what you're then doing is depriving us of our right under those agreements to choose our own arbitrator.",
  "Well --",
  "This in a vengeance, I will say, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "I -- I have a substantial -- substantially less of an objection to that kind of a procedure because it doesn't adjudicate unnamed parties' rights, or purport to adjudicate those rights. At least you have a real dispute that already exists --",
  "-- which can justify in some sense consolidation. I still think you have to respect Green Tree's right --",
  "No, because the -- the arbitration process requires the filing of claims and going through it.",
  "Because we don't know whether there is, in fact, a dispute between the parties in the absence of some effort by the plaintiffs to come forward.",
  "But -- but it -- just because you may have a right doesn't mean you necessarily care to assert your right. Again, it's -- it's easy to look at this case and say, well, gee, there's an opportunity to pick up $5,000 in windfall, or $7,500 in windfall, but you know, an arbitrator could just as easily have rendered a decision here that said, this is a pure technicality, it's entitled to $1 in nominal damages, and the class-wide relief ought to be $1,900, and attorney's fees ought to be a third of that, which is $600 --",
  "-- and I guarantee you they would not be willing or prepared to -- I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.",
  "They would not be prepared to abide by that. Every one of the unnamed members would say, I never had an opportunity to -- to participate in the selection of the arbitrator who has resolved my substantial rights. There's no basis at all to bind me under these circumstances, and I'm going to show up and make a claim.",
  "But see, Justice Breyer, we -- we keep making up more and more and more, and none of this is -- is at all linked to any kind of consent among any of these parties.",
  "Yes.",
  "We do not consent to that.",
  "We raised that as --",
  "-- as early and often --",
  "Yes, and the South Carolina Supreme Court specifically addressed the question of waiver and found that we never waived our right with respect to that.",
  "It was our arbitrator with respect to the dispute with the Bazzles and the Lackeys and the Buggses, to be sure, but we did not agree to an arbitrator to resolve any disputes involving unnamed third parties --",
  "See, I don't think it is disputed what the parties -- what the parties intended, Justice Breyer.",
  "Except that --",
  "Because the question of whether the arbitrator has the authority to resolve the rights of unnamed third parties is not a question for the arbitrator to decide. That's a question for the court to decide.",
  "Because it goes --",
  "It goes to the core of the arbitrator's jurisdiction and authority to decide.",
  "Justice Breyer, I think on the question of whether the arbitrator has jurisdiction --",
  "-- and authority to decide the rights of a party, that is a question for the court to decide --",
  "-- not for the arbitrator.",
  "But Howsam dealt with the specific problem of the procedures to be followed with respect to a bilateral --",
  "No, we're not talking about the procedures to be followed in a bilateral agreement. We're talking about what you have to do --",
  "-- to resolve the rights of third parties who are not signatories --",
  "Yes.",
  "That -- that's my point, Justice Scalia.",
  "And anything the arbitrator did to us --",
  "Right, but --",
  "Right.",
  "Because, Justice Breyer, the -- the contract says that -- that it binds us and you, and us and you are defined as Green Tree and the -- and the specific named participants in this proceeding. It doesn't say word one about the rights of all of the other individuals in this --",
  "-- and the South Carolina -- I'm sorry.",
  "Oh, they're not here complaining today, but Mr. Chief Justice, you're going to have to resolve the question of whether or not you can interpret an arbitration agreement in a way that allows these kinds of proceedings for the -- for the generality of cases, and what do we --",
  "Well, if you were going to allow a class action in an arbitral forum you would certainly want those -- those protections to be built in. My point is, is that the way you get those kinds of protections to exist in the ordinary class action is because the State coerces the litigation. The ordinary rule is that you cannot represent third parties, and the court has identified as a matter of its power situations in which it's going to embrace that approach, but that doesn't get you past the contract problem.",
  "Yes.",
  "But --",
  "The -- the difference there, Justice Ginsburg, is that here we're talking about a situation where the full authority of the arbitrator is defined by the consent of the specific parties to the agreement, and these parties don't have the authority to bind nonparties. The Court said just last term in Waffle House --",
  "I -- I'm sorry, Your Honor?",
  "That's correct, Justice Scalia.",
  "That's correct, Your Honor, and -- and --",
  "Well, I apologize --",
  "Well, there are two answers to that. The premise of it, which is that the FAA doesn't have anything to say about this, but the core principle of the FAA is that there is supposed to be consent of the parties, so we ought to be looking to the expectations of the parties to determine what rights you're going to adjudicate as a matter of arbitration.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's -- that is exactly right, Justice Souter, and if you look at the South Carolina Supreme Court's opinion it doesn't talk about anything that has to do with consent. It talks about equity and fairness and judicial economy, all factors that influence the rights of third parties who have nothing to do with the arbitration agreement that's before the arbitrator.",
  "The -- but what the South Carolina Supreme Court said was, we're going to promote judicial economy and we're going to do it without a contractual directive to do so. To be sure, the court said we -- we do not find language so clear here -- because you know, what they're basically worried about is, does this absolutely prohibit the possibility of class arbitration. Is there language in there that says, under no circumstances will we ever have class arbitration. I would have read the -- this agreement to have actually said that, but they didn't say that. What they said is, well, we think it's -- we think it's ambiguous, and therefore we'll construe it against you, but all that gets you to the point is that the contract says nothing about this, and the problem with trying to square that with the FAA is that the animus for, or the -- the motivation for acting under the Federal Arbitration Act is the consent of the parties, not simply can you manipulate the contract in a way that gets you to --",
  "No. No.",
  "Well, has -- well, has consented -- yes, has signed an arbitration agreement --",
  "But not with this arbitrator, that's correct.",
  "We had --",
  "And we have a right in it, and it's worth pointing out we still have a right, with respect to each one of those third party claims, to have our choice of arbitrators. We picked this guy for these three or four claims. As Justice Kennedy observed, we went --",
  "Sure.",
  "Sure. Why not?",
  "Well, the -- the point is that --",
  "Of a single arbitrator --",
  "-- with no right to judicial review --",
  "-- Justice Stevens. The problem is, why would we make a judgment at the outset of this process that says, we are going to enter into the most informal decisionmaking process with no right to judicial review and with $27 million at stake.",
  "No one would. It would be madness.",
  "Justice Kennedy, I'm going to have to answer that on -- in the rebuttal.",
  "I'll give you the specific citation when I step up here. If there are no other questions, I'll reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Kennedy, in response to your question, I don't know precisely the first time that we raised this issue, but I know that if you look at the record on decision at pages 152 and again at 1539, in both Bazzle and in Lackey, we say point blank the arbitrator exceeded his authority to proceed as a class action, and that neither Green Tree nor any of the unnamed class members consented to have the arbitrator arbitrate their claims, so we said it as plainly as we could with respect to the -- with respect to the notion of consent. The specific -- aside from that, the South Carolina Supreme Court said we didn't waive our rights, and it's quite clear that if we fight over these issues in front of the arbitrator, we don't waive our rights. That was the holding of this Court in First Chicago. Justice Breyer, with respect to whether or not the arbitrator thought he exercised independent authority, I think it's pretty clear that both parties in this case have taken inconsistent positions. If you read the respondent's briefs below, they say that the arbitrator had no authority to go beyond the class certification of the decision that had already been made by the State court. Whether he did or not I say at the end of the day doesn't matter, because I don't think it's a question for the arbitrator, but if it is, he exceeded his authority, because he clearly doesn't have the authority under this contract to make a decision with respect to the third parties. That takes us to the question Justice Scalia raised, which is, you know, what -- what do you do with the fact that the South Carolina Supreme Court has said not word one about arbitrator selected by me? There's nothing that interprets that language of this agreement, and if the Federal Arbitration Act doesn't have at least some component here to say, look, the terms of the contract cannot be categorically ignored or disregarded by the State court, those are rights that are there. We said as plainly as we could we would not consent to this, and the court rejected it. And the final point I would make with respect to hostility, while it is true that this Court has consistently struck down efforts to be hostile to arbitration, it has never said that that's the only basis on which preemption will arise. Preemption in this context exists in the same way it does in every other context, does it interfere with the full achievement of Congress' objections. That's Hines v. Davidowitz, and the answer to that here, and it's the same answer that would arise if they were to -- if we had an agreement that said class action has, that of course this is manifest hostility to this arbitration agreement as written. It's a bilateral agreement, and all the South Carolina Supreme Court had to say about that bilateral agreement is, it would be judicially inefficient for us to have to go through each one of these individually. Well, that's all well and good, but that's coercion, that's not consent, and if the Federal Arbitration Act has any meaning, it means that you apply the consent of the parties here, and if you do that, the South Carolina Supreme Court has to be overturned. Thank you, Your Honors.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner, like thousands of other employers throughout this country, has a policy that if an employee is discharged for violating a workplace rule -- usually that involves serious misconduct in the -- in the workplace -- then he becomes permanently ineligible to be rehired by that particular employer. The court of appeals in this case correctly held at Fed.App. 12a, note 17, that there is no question that petitioner applied this policy in rejecting respondent's application. And the court of appeals also held that there's no question that this policy on its face is not unlawful. Nonetheless, the Ninth Circuit declared that even in a case alleging only disparate treatment, the, quote, policy violates the ADA as applied to former drug addicts whose only work-related offense was testing positive because of their addiction.",
  "It's pretty clear that the rest of the opinion is not dicta, Justice O'Connor. The -- that portion of the analysis is -- is directed solely at the question of whether or not the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case, and what the court said was, you know, is there any evidence from which anyone could draw the inference that there was discrimination because of a disability. And it recognized frankly that that was a very close question, that if you read even the -- the statement made to the EEOC, you can read that in different ways. Maybe you should look at Bockmiller. But the truth is in making the prima facie showing, all that you really needed to look at was the policy statement -- or the -- the response to the EEOC, and that would be enough, I think, to get you past the prima facie showing. It -- it is at page 10a where the court then turns its complete attention, and it says, you know, so in sum we hold that -- that Hernandez's prima facie case of discrimination has been made out, and now we turn to the next stage in the process, which is to look and see whether or not there is a -- a non-pretextual justification.",
  "Well, if there were a genuine issue of fact, you -- you would -- you know, you'd remand to allow the case to go forward. There's clearly not a genuine issue of fact because if you -- once you get past just looking at the EEOC statement that was made by the employer and -- and you're in the district court and you're looking at summary judgment and the question is whether or not the action of the employer is pretextual, we only have the burden to come forward and say we had a -- a perfectly lawful reason for doing what we did.",
  "Well, I -- yes, they are two different questions, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the answer is that I think we probably would have been entitled to summary judgment even on the prima facie showing. The only way the court of appeals got to its analysis -- the only way it could have gotten there under Hazen Paper -- is to say that the pretextual basis -- the pretextual argument that was put forward by the employer -- we have to take that off the table because if that -- if that policy is in this case, there is not a shred of evidence that that policy was not applied in this particular case. And that's exactly what the court of appeals said in -- in the footnote in its opinion. It said that's unquestioned.",
  "I mean, there's no question that respondent has asserted arguments that the -- that -- that there's a question as to whether the policy exists. The Ninth Circuit expressly held that the policy exists and was applied in this particular case --",
  "I don't take footnotes seriously in all court's opinions, Your Honor.",
  "Well, but I mean, it could not have been more explicit in terms of dealing with this particular issue. Was the policy presented and was it -- was -- did the policy exist and was it applied in this particular case? There's no question about that. And there's no testimony that raises any doubt. It may be that it's an unwritten policy, but the testimony in the joint appendix at 22a, 57a, 59a, 71a, 72a, and 73a, which is the affidavit and deposition testimony of Bockmiller who was the decision maker in this case and Medina who signed the -- the statement, is consistent, that -- that there is an absolute policy and practice that this employer uniformly uses.",
  "But Justice Ginsburg, the respondent had a full opportunity for discovery in this case. He was an employee for 25 years. If he had known of any instances in which this rule hadn't been applied, he could presumably have brought that forward. If he could have discovered any instance in which this rule had not been applied consistently --",
  "Actually he's not specific in -- in regard to that. I mean, he's made that argument at this stage in the proceedings, but there's nothing in the record, certainly nothing during the deposition testimony, in which he says -- there's nothing in his affidavit. But -- but, Justice O'Connor, it's worth reading the joint appendix -- I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg. I apologize.",
  "But, Justice Ginsburg, it's worth reading on joint appendix 70a. You know, this -- his application would have been rejected had he been fired for stealing or fighting or anything like that. It's unequivocal, absolutely uncontradicted testimony in this record. There is no question --",
  "Well, you could -- you could continue to assert that the -- that our policy is our policy and we're entitled to assert that policy. Now, you know, there are alternative theories that could be brought forward. One -- one could be that the policy has a disparate impact, which wasn't litigated in this case --",
  "-- and also --",
  "Well, there are sort of three answers to that in terms of the reasonable accommodation rationale. First of all, remember that this is not an employee any longer who is in fact disabled. This is one who's merely regarded as or has a record of. And the statute specifically talks about accommodating the limitations of the employee. So there -- there are no limitations here. So I think (b)(5) by its terms doesn't apply.",
  "No, I don't -- I don't know that that doesn't require any -- anything with respect to applicants or any accommodation with respect to applicants. I don't -- I -- I think what it doesn't do is allow you to look beyond whether there are limitations that need to be accommodated. And I don't think it -- and I don't think it is a reasonable accommodation within the meaning of (b)(5) to say that you're entitled to a second bite of the apple. If you have violated a misconduct rule and been discharged for that reason, whether it's drug- related or not, it seems to me clear under the statute -- certainly it's clear under -- under 114(c)(4) -- that that is precisely the situation in which the employer is allowed to discharge you and to impose on you a permanent ban.",
  "Well, because I think the reason is is that in order to allow this employee to come back under these circumstances, you have to -- you have to discriminate in his favor because if -- if this were a person who --",
  "Right.",
  "Right, but that's why you have to look at 114(c)(4), which says specifically that you are entitled to treat former drug addicts precisely the way you would treat any other employee. So then the question I think is if this employee had been discharged originally because he was a sex offender or a sexual harasser and -- and had a psychological reason for it, and he came back in and he said, I'm -- I'm cured, I'm fixed, I want to come back to work now, the answer there might be one thing. I don't know the -- you know, there may be a reasonable accommodation issue there. But with respect to 114(c)(4), which very specifically says that you're allowed to impose qualification standards that are the same where you're not going to allow that other employee to come in -- that's the way your policy operates -- applying that rule fairly to this situation means that this employee is not entitled to come in. I don't think it's a flat rule against applicants versus non-applicants. I think it's a (c)(4) -- 114(c)(4) rule that says that you are always entitled to treat the rehabilitated drug addict exactly the same way you would treat anyone else who engaged in misconduct.",
  "I don't think it did address the reasonable accommodation issue.",
  "Any more than it --",
  "Well, it might be and -- and I don't think it would be in this case. As I say, I think 114(c)(4) is a complete answer to the reasonable accommodation argument, and I think frankly 114(c)(4) is a complete answer to the disparate impact argument, which the court of appeals also not only didn't get into, but found had been expressly waived. That's why I think, Justice O'Connor, at the end of the day, what this case is about is Hazen Paper. We have a rule here that was unquestionably applied. There is not a shred of evidence that it wasn't applied.",
  "Well, because any employers who's in the middle of litigation would be irrational not to try to find some kind of a non-litigated solution to the problem. And so we were looking for a non-litigated solution to the problem. Since he wasn't qualified in 1999, it wasn't available to us to bring him back or to try to come up with some other kind of a settlement. I think it completely inappropriate to hold it against us to try to come up with a solution to this case that wouldn't have required us to take the time of the court at that point.",
  "Right.",
  "But -- but, of course, Mr. Hernandez was an employee in 1991.",
  "And we discharged him and then we imposed on him the same qualification standards that we would impose to anyone that we discharged under those exact same circumstances. He is dismissed.",
  "And he is permanently barred on -- on a going-forward basis.",
  "That language clearly covers this.",
  "Well, I think the answer to that is (c)(4) would -- would trump the reasonable accommodation argument, if -- if it had been properly raised and it were before the court. I think at the end of the day, we'd win that, but Justice O'Connor -- I got the name right there -- is clearly right that that issue wasn't resolved by the Ninth Circuit, and therefore remains open. I mean, it is not an issue for this Court at this point. I just want to make it absolutely clear that the rule was applied -- I don't think there is any way that you can question that there is an issue of fact to be resolved as to how this rule was applied in this circumstance. In order to discount the applicability of the rule as the basis for Mr. Hernandez's rejection, you have to declare that Ms. Bockmiller flat-out lied, and she didn't. Everything in the record in this case is consistent with the idea that she looked at the summary separation, she concluded that there was no basis to go forward with this case, and she acted accordingly. An employee -- obviously, employers are allowed to use their own employee's testimony. It cannot be that that's an interested witness whose testimony is not entitled to credit when it is absolutely uncontradicted. So we are not only entitled to have this rule set aside, we're also entitled to judgment at the end of the day. Thank you, Your Honors. I'd reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. It seems to me that there are two ways to look at this case. One is you can simply take the court of appeals at its word, which is to say we think there's a question for -- that -- that defeats summary judgment on a prima facie case, but when we get to the question of what the policy is of the -- of the employer in this case, there's no dispute about that, the employer's policy was applied, and then address the question of whether or not that policy is valid under the ADA. I have not heard Mr. Montoya yet attempt to defend that -- that holding in the face of a disparate treatment theory in this case. He puts in disparate impact under 12(b)(6). He puts in reasonable accommodation, 112(b)(6) and 112(b)(5). Those are not issues that were decided below. They were not the theory of the court of appeals. This is a decision that has extraordinary implications because thousands of employers have precisely this rule. It is important for this Court to declare that that rule is valid. On the secondary question -- and that is, can the Court get to that question? I think there's no doubt that the Court ought to just follow the court of appeals' logic on that. But if the Court wanted to look at whether or not there is a question of fact as to whether or not this person was discriminated against because of his disability, I submit to you that the record does not permit a jury to make that finding under this Court's decision in Reeves. Bockmiller was the decision maker. She testified, without contradiction, that she never looked past the summary sheet that said he was discharged because of conduct, and that was it. And she didn't have to look beyond that. Medina testified, without contradiction, that that is the policy that applies. She applied it in the right way. We do it consistently. It would have made no difference whether he was a thief or whether he was somebody who used drugs. We applied it that way. Mr. Montoya and his client had 2 years to discover whether that policy existed, whether it had exceptions, whether it was applied in any other particular way, and there is not one shred of evidence -- he didn't even ask those witnesses if there were flaws in the way they applied it. That is absolutely across the board. The only -- and -- and then, you know, this is a policy that exists. Thousands of employers use precisely this policy, which is why frankly it probably isn't written down. And so at the end of the day, there is nothing on the other side of this except the one statement that was sufficient to justify getting beyond the prima facie stage of this case, but that is not sufficient to justify taking this to a conclusion or to raise an issue of fact as to whether or not he was discriminated against because of his disability. He was acted against because he violated the company policy. That policy is valid under the ADA, at least as it's been litigated at this point, and for that reason the Court should reverse and enter judgment in our favor. If there are no other questions, thank you, Your Honors.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1967, Congress enacted section 209(a) of the Clean Air Act, which is reproduced in the petitioners' brief at page 1. That statute prohibits States and their localities from adopting or attempting even to enforce, quote, any standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines. In this case, a political subdivision of the State of California has adopted fleet rules that prohibit the purchase by certain fleets of various classes of -- of vehicles that are otherwise certified for purchase in the State of California and, indeed, have essentially precluded the purchase by those organizations of diesel- fueled vehicles in toto.",
  "Yes, Justice O'Connor, it is a facial challenge.",
  "Yes, claiming total preemption.",
  "Well, the -- there are two answers to that. One, the district doesn't need a statute in order to purchase its own vehicles. There is no basis for adopting a standard that controls that particular situation.",
  "Well, if it goes beyond --",
  "Well, if it goes beyond what it wants to purchase itself and imposes requirements on others, then it seems to me that's a standard that falls within the ambit of the preemption.",
  "I think that -- that there is a serious question as to whether or not that would be preempted. I -- I don't think it's presented, obviously, by the particulars of this case. I mean, it still look -- sounds like a --",
  "Well, I think the answer to the question at the end of the day, Justice Kennedy, would be that you would require a clearer statement from Congress than what you have in section 209(a) to interfere with the kind of purchasing decisions that localities are -- are making in contrast to this.",
  "Well, I understand that, Justice Scalia. Well, there are two answers to that, one that I was trying to answer before which is I don't think that this provision actually covers that particular situation because you don't need this provision in order to have authority as a local jurisdiction to make purchases on your own as to what you're going to buy. That's not, I don't think, a standard within the meaning of the statute. But second of all, I also don't think that the -- it must be unconstitutional in all respects as the controlling standard of law in this particular context either. It is clear that there is a significant component of this -- of these fleet rules that is preempted, and perhaps all of them are preempted. But we were dismissed out at the earliest stages of these proceedings without an opportunity to demonstrate the metes and bounds of the regulations as they would particularly apply at this -- at -- at this particular juncture.",
  "Well, our -- our challenge is not intended, frankly, to interfere with the local jurisdiction's ability to purchase their own vehicles on their own behalf.",
  "Yes. That's what we're saying.",
  "We don't -- we don't have any challenge to that.",
  "Well, it's difficult to know precisely what the metes and bounds of it is, but the portion of this that offends us and the portion that we think does not require a clearer statement, which is that which goes directly to non-governmental entities. If -- if you're talking about regulating the purchasing choices of pure governmental entities, then you expect Congress to speak with a -- with a clearer voice. But the purpose of these fleet rules is not simply to restrict the purchases by governmental entities. It is quite clear that the purpose of these fleet rules is to regulate the purchasing choices that are made with respect to a much broader scope of purchasing entities, including private entities, and it is that portion of the regulation, frankly, that we are challenging and challenging on its face.",
  "Assuming, Justice Ginsburg, that you -- that California took -- complied with all of the requirements of section 246, and there are specific requirements in order to get a -- in the -- in the State action plan that -- State implementation plan that need to be satisfied. But to be sure, the Congress clearly envisioned that for States with nonattainment problems, that they would be able to use fleet restrictions as a mechanism for promoting their overall emissions quality.",
  "Yes, providing you comply with the standards of section 246.",
  "Well, I don't know if the precise terms of this -- of these rules would qualify under section 246 or not. Nobody has actually analyzed that point, but the truth is it's clear that you could have certain fleet rules implemented that are consistent with section 246. But realize, Justice Ginsburg, that what -- by saying all our concern is is that every -- every one of thousands of jurisdictions can impose purchase and sale requirements on vehicles --",
  "Well, under the respondents' theory of this case which limits the term standards to production mandates imposed on manufacturers, then it seems to me that it clearly extends to all purchases and sales and whether it extends to fleets, it wouldn't -- it's not limited to fleets at all. Under the respondents' theory of this case, the field that has been preempted here really is limited to the manufacturers. And to allow every local jurisdiction to come in and bring forth additional requirements is to make a hash out of a scheme that was clearly designed to create a unitary market for the manufacture, sale, purchase, and licensing of new motor vehicles.",
  "Well, this Court has long recognized that you can't analyze a preemption case solely on the basis of the single action by a single actor, that in fact you have to consider the possibility that all 50 States or, in this case, every local jurisdiction could follow suit. And remember, it's not just follow suit with respect to this kind of fleet rules under the respondents' theory of this case, which is that all purchase and sale restrictions --",
  "Well, the State of California would have certain prerogatives, obviously, under the entire scheme that are different, but even if California had simply done what the district did here, which is to just announce a set of fleet rules, not made any effort to comply with 246, not made any effort to comply with section 209(b) --",
  "Section 246 provides that in certain nonattainment States, one of the options they have available in order to eliminate the overall -- or to -- to improve the overall ambient air quality is to adopt certain types of fleet rules. And the provision is very lengthy. It's very detailed about -- and you have to include that in your State implementation plan. What California did was it used the substitute route and adopted its LEV rules saying that those would be equally effective.",
  "Oh, it clearly didn't comply. I don't think there's any question that California has made no effort to satisfy the Clean Air Act with respect to this. But this Court --",
  "Yes, that's absolutely clear.",
  "And that's -- and that's part of the way this entire scheme operates.",
  "Well, I -- I think the answer is that there are various components of the fleet rules, and I think unlike if you're -- if you're seeking pre- enforcement of a statute, where you'd have to find every application of it, the question is are there subcomponents of these rules that are properly challengeable and therefore properly enjoinable rather than being allowed to go in. I don't -- I don't understand --",
  "Well, no, Justice Scalia, I think it's a little more complicated than that because what you're really talking about is a -- is a host of rules. And if you look at the appendix to the respondents' brief with all of the rules that are laid out there, there are literally dozens of rules. And in order to challenge the, quote, fleet rules in the sense of recognizing that there are clearly areas of those rules that intrude into preempted Federal activities, it doesn't seem to me that you have to challenge the entirety of the rules. You should be entitled to pick those rules that you're going after and a complaint and go forward. And that's --",
  "-- that's what we've done. I understand if you have a simple unitary statute that you're challenging, the Salerno rule may suggest that the statute has to be unconstitutional in all its respects, but if you adopted a rule that if part A is good and part B is not good, you should be allowed to -- to challenge part B facially without worrying about part A.",
  "And my answer to you is I don't think that's the proper application of Salerno and I don't -- I mean, I recognize --",
  "Well, except for the fact that if -- if we don't get past the ruling of the court below at this stage, which is that none of this is preempted, that -- whether it's a facial challenge or a non-facial challenge, we're going to have rules that are out there that are being implemented at this stage and will be upheld as constitutional under the Ninth Circuit's ruling as the -- as the controlling rule of law, and we won't be in a position even to get at any portion of those rules that are clearly unconstitutional because they --",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "I think that --",
  "That -- that is our -- I mean, our primary concern. The -- the problem here is --",
  "Right. Well, I mean, the question is whether or not -- I mean, I'm not sure that is precisely what we're challenging. It seems to me there is a difference between a public entity deciding on its own --",
  "-- that it will make a certain purchasing decision as a purchasing decision. There is a fundamentally different proposition when another entity demands that it must make a purchasing decision based on emissions control.",
  "A public entity.",
  "What I was saying is -- what -- what I meant to answer your question earlier, Justice Breyer, was to say if you're asking me can public entities make purchasing decisions free of the restrictions of the Clean Air Act, I think the answer is yes because I don't think Congress spoke to that. But if what you're saying is can a -- can one governmental entity demand that another governmental entity make a decision for purely environmental reasons and not as a -- as a contracting matter, no. That seems to me is still a standard --",
  "-- that controls emissions and is unconstitutional.",
  "No, but the -- the problem is much simpler than that, Justice Breyer, because there's a scheme in place where if you don't like the way the regulatory arrangements are worked out, you can take the issue to California and California can take it to the EPA. I mean, the whole purpose of this enterprise was to devise a unitary market and make it very simple. And there's nothing in the -- in the suggestion that --",
  "Well, we're challenging the effort by the district to impose these kinds of requirements, these standards which control emissions.",
  "On everyone.",
  "Well, because that's what the Clean Air Act is all about. California is free to do that if it complies with section 209(b) which says you can obtain a waiver. You can make these the Federal standards. I mean, there's no question that these fleet rules could have been adopted by the State of California and be approved by the EPA and be operating completely tomorrow if they want to go through that process. That's the specific process Congress had in mind, a process that the district has abandoned. And all we're suggesting is that's what they ought to do.",
  "Mr. Phillips, I don't want to intrude into your time, but I -- I hope you have time to comment on your adversary's argument that the word standards just refers to numerical figures and so forth and that you -- you have a -- it means the same thing when the government is -- Federal Government is implementing its own standards and it is in this provision. Do you -- do you have a response to that basic argument?",
  "So there -- there are two answers to that. One, section 202 is not limited to production mandates, those kinds of numerical standards, even -- even within 202. And second, the language that -- that Congress used about standards relating to the control of emissions is inherently broader than 202 in any event, and if you expected 209 and 202 to be read in para materia, you would have expected Congress to cross reference.",
  "They were enacted at different times.",
  "Well, the use of requirement in the second sentence is simply a recognition that there could be standardless requirements imposed by States requiring a certification or some other kind of documentation that don't have standards. So the first sentence deals with standards and the second one deals with standardless obstacles to implementation. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me start with Justice O'Connor's hypothetical. We are told in language that I think a 6- year-old would have a hard time understanding that a flat ban on all gasoline-fueled engines in the State of California is not a standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines. Justice Kennedy is absolutely right. It has rendered the scope of preemption. There is no field of preemption. There is not even a divot of dirt of preemption that is created under that interpretation. It's not consistent with the language of the word standard. Standard means more than what manufacturers do. It's not simply how it gets enforced. It's broader, and Justice Stevens is clearly correct in that regard. The one provision that seems to have gotten lost in the -- in all of this, which I think is terribly important, is section 177 which states that State -- and this is at the -- the respondents' brief's appendix at 4a -- 4a. The States are not authorized to prohibit or limit directly or indirectly the manufacture or sale of a new motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine that is certified in California. That is precisely what is being done here, is that vehicles that are certified in California are prohibited by a subagency. The State can't even do this, which is why I submit the answer to your question, Justice Scalia, is the State wouldn't have the authority to place the kind of restriction on its own subentities without running afoul of section 177. And the only way California could get approval for that would be to go to the EPA in the way that Justice Breyer has already described.",
  "Oh, I believe EPA is very much with us this morning because the Solicitor General speaks for the United States, and EPA is clearly a part of the United States Government. And -- and the EPA has made it absolutely clear, Justice Ginsburg --",
  "Oh, absolutely that's just wrong. There is no -- there is no way -- I have seen nothing to justify departing from what the Government's brief says.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It seems to me that there are two propositions that arise out of the conversation of the past 25 minutes. First of all, there is no single uniform meaning of the -- of the expression, arising under. It is not a term of art. It is a term of chaos. It is a -- it is a phrase that is used repeatedly in different contexts, routinely used with a very pragmatic -- in a very pragmatic fashion and does not answer the question whether or not Congress, when it adopted 1658, or Congress, when it amended section 1981, really envisioned this kind of expansive interpretation that would allow an argument to be made that State laws are suddenly subject to statutes of limitations. As Justice Scalia asked, when you make other kinds of adjustments in these schemes, are you going to have to resolve every -- every one of these issues? I mean, the question with respect to the split in the circuits. There is currently pending a proposed change to the Air Carriers Access Act that specifically resolves the conflict in the circuits between the Eleventh Circuit which says there is no cause of action and other circuits that says there is a cause of action. These aren't hypotheticals. These are real issues and if this Court is not careful in how it tries to confine the interpretation of section 1658, it's going to be interpreting the statute for the better part of the next 10 years, which may be good news for me as a practitioner before the Court. But I'm quite certain that it's not good news either for my clients, for the lower courts that are going to have to adjudicate these problems or for -­",
  "Well, it might be an adequate solution, Justice Scalia, except that it's not self- evident from the language, arising under. The question is what -- what is the use of arising under that you're going to try to apply in a more or less uniform fashion.",
  "And there -- and I don't think there's support for that objective in -- in this particular statute because if Congress really meant -­",
  "Well, no. It's a question of -­ I mean, they -- they obviously made a -- a compromise, but the question is why isn't it as reasonable a compromise to say, look, we're going to deal with this in the truly classic sense of the word prospective. Every new self- contained statute that goes into effect is now subject to this rule. And -- and literally, as Justice Kennedy said -­",
  "-- they do that every day.",
  "Well, Justice Souter, the -- the reality is that this is far more common than you think. The anti-terrorism statute has specific standalone causes of action. The Muhammad Ali Reform -- Boxing Reform Act has a standalone cause of action. I mean, there are, in fact a host of statutes in which Congress does precisely what the other side claims it rarely does. I mean, this -- if -- if the Court would like us to provide a list, we'd be happy to do it.",
  "Well, no, I understand that, but the problem you still have, Justice Breyer, is that you've got to figure out how do you try to reconcile -­",
  "That's -- that's pretty simple, Justice Breyer, but it doesn't answer Justice Kennedy's question which is if you look at this particular act of Congress, which is codified in subsection (b), it doesn't give you any basis for a right of action. The infrastructure -­",
  "That definitional provision doesn't remotely -­",
  "But, Justice Breyer, that's -­",
  "But I still -- but that still doesn't answer what -- what strikes me as the fundamental question which is when Congress approached section 1981, did it think that it was, in fact, creating a whole new infrastructure cause of action or was it basically simply engrafting it back onto what section 1981 has been since 1866.",
  "But -- but you -- but, Justice Breyer, you only have this cause of action because four -­ three of the four elements arise and existed long before 1991, and those -- and that -- and it clearly has to arise under that portion of it as well. So the question is, if it arises under both, what's the right resolution of the question? And the point that, it seems to me, that the petitioner and the United States have never responded to is why is it you would adopt a rule that carries with it as much complication and complexity as the rule that they propose when you don't have to come out that --",
  "There is no evidence that Congress wanted it to have maximum effect.",
  "The statute applies on a regular basis to almost everyday acts that Congress adopts in which they provide a cause of action and do not provide a statute of limitations. And that spares this Court and every other court the burden of having to borrow from State law, trying to figure out what analogous State law claims would be used as the basis for a statute of limitations.",
  "Except that I think, for the most part, the courts have pretty well resolved what they were going to do with respect to section 1981. I would have thought the problem -­",
  "Right.",
  "Well, it's difficult to know whether Congress meant to change that. I -- I don't disagree with that. But I -- but it still seems to me the more fundamental problem in trying to sort out what Congress did with respect to section 1981 is that it never intended to make this into a brand new infrastructure. It took the existing four elements. It didn't change a single word in section 1981 when it implemented this cause of action. So the notion that this is a cause of action that arises only under the 1990 act is clearly -- under the 1991 act is clearly --",
  "I -- I think every court that has adopted that test -- certainly the Seventh Circuit in this case and other courts of appeals have recognized that it is an infinitely simpler test than trying to figure out what arising under will mean in all of its various permutations and new statutes. All you have to look at is to see whether or not the cause -- the elements -- all the elements of the cause of action are newly created. That may be embodied in a -- in an amendment to an existing statute. It may be on a stand alone basis. But I -- I submit to you that is a significantly simpler course to follow. And, indeed, I don't -­",
  "On a prospective basis, there's no question about that, that the Congress had passed the Anti-terrorism Act that created a new cause of action, did not want the kind of inherent inequalities that arise under borrowing to go forward.",
  "It says nothing about what the Congress did retroactively.",
  "Well, I -- Justice Ginsburg, your own hypotheticals suppose exactly how many complexities are going to arise, and I -- I can assure you that as -­ as much imagination as we've put into this, plaintiffs' counsels and defense counsel going forward will try even harder to end up fighting these issues in terms of the -­ in terms of how complex this is. All you have to do is look at the second certified class in this case. The district judge in this case thought this was an easy statute to interpret and applied it to classes 1 and 3. When he got to class 2, what did he say? He said, with respect to those claims with regard to part-time employment, the parties are going to have to sort that out themselves. He made no attempt -- to sort to resolve that issue because it is a completely imponderable question under their interpretation of section 1658.",
  "Of course.",
  "Of course, that's a new, new, new cause of action.",
  "But -­",
  "But, of course, that doesn't change -­",
  "But that doesn't change anything, Justice Breyer. Of course, you can refer back to it. The question is are all of the elements of the cause of action independently provided for in the New, New, New statute, and the answer is yes.",
  "No, I don't think it's that simple, Justice Breyer. If it's done where Congress means to create a new infrastructure and a new cause of action, it's new, new, new. When Congress does nothing more than engraft and doesn't even remotely modify the existing infrastructure, it doesn't even so much as change the words of a statute that's been here from 1866, to suggest that this is a -- a suit that arises solely under -- under a 1991 amendment seems to me wrong. The -- the other point I think it's important to make in this connection -- and -- and it's the rule of construction that seems to get lost sight of -- is -- and -- and it's the one this Court adopted in Wilson v. Garcia -- is that there is no reason to assume that Congress would mean for the -- to have two causes -- two statutes of limitation apply to the same cause of action when it was interpreting section 1983. And here we have a situation where you will have two -- two statutes of limitation applying to the same words in the same subsection of a statute. And we raised the issue in our -- in our brief for the respondent saying, find us a statute where Congress has ever allowed that kind of morass to exist, and -- and the reply brief is utterly silent on that. And for good cause, because there is no reason to assume that Congress would have adopted that interpretation. And therefore, if you follow the rule of construction from Wilson v. Garcia and if you accept what I think you cannot help but except, which is that arising under is not an unambiguous line -­",
  "Well -­",
  "Is it irrational? Yes. Is it unconstitutional? Probably not under the standards that loosely govern these kinds of issues unless somebody can attach it to some kind of -­",
  "I think if there were a 1981(d) that was -- that was separately contained and that expressed a clear indication from Congress that it really meant to create a new cause of action, that it would make sense under those circumstances for 1658 to apply to that particular situation. But I think what we're talking about here is simply trying to ascertain Congress' intent, and I think whether you look at it under section 1981's lens or if you look at it under section 1658's lens, you end up at exactly the same point.",
  "That's -- to be sure. And it goes back, I suppose, to the argument that was made by the other side which is that there's a default rule and Congress can always change it. The core of this is Congress can always make its intent more explicit in terms of how it deals with the problem. The question is, do you want to create a regime in which this Court is going to have to be resolving questions involving the meaning of section 1658 for the foreseeable future? Or doesn't it make sense to recognize that there is, in fact, a -- a complete set of causes of action to which 1658 will routinely apply and that it will be spared -- the courts will be spared and the litigants will be spared the burden of having to sort out these kinds of issues on a going-forward basis and recognize that we're not going to pick up everything in the interim? But as Congress wants to go forward and create new causes of action, the opportunity will arise, and it can do so. But if it chooses to engraft it on an existing infrastructure, then it seems to me under those circumstances, what the Court should do is say these cause of action arises at this point in time. It doesn't arise because of the new statute. It's a much simpler, much cleaner way of dealing with the issue. And -- and that's the one point I did want to make. I don't -- I have not heard the other side remotely complain that our approach has any of the kinds of complications. I'm not saying it's without issues, but it's nowhere near the complications -­",
  "But -- but Congress clearly recognized that it was not prepared to eliminate that regime because -- because it would --",
  "-- would have created all kinds of problems on a retroactive basis. It didn't want to -­ it didn't want to unsettle expectations.",
  "Well you bring one form of -- of complication and one form of -- of clarity to it. But at least the -- it's the clarity you know rather than the clarity you don't know -- or the confusion that you don't know at this point. Courts have been dealing with the question of how to borrow for a long time. The question of how you're going to deal with section 1658 and what conflicts in the circuits you're going to have to resolve and what happens when Congress makes minor modifications -- Congress makes lots of minor modifications in every -­",
  "No, I don't -- I don't think so, Justice Breyer, because -­",
  "It will -- whatever the New, New, New statute is, that will be subject to the -- to the statute of -- the 4-year statute of limitations.",
  "There's no retroactivity issue you need to worry about in that -­",
  "But -- but if --",
  "I think you are wrong about that. I think all -- if Congress has created a new statute, it -- it has told you that this is one that's subject to -­ to the 4-year statute of limitations period on a going- forward basis, and I think it's eliminated any of the confusion. And certainly Congress knows -- would know how to do that if the Court were very clear in saying what we're going to apply 1658 to is to new causes of action that are specifically stated with an entire infrastructure created to provide for them. I don't think they have to do it in a new title 79 or whatever, but they clearly have to do it by doing more than simply changing the definition of a single set of terms in a statute that is otherwise left utterly unchanged under these circumstances. If there are no other questions, Your Honors, I'd urge you to affirm.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I guess I'd like to begin, Justice O'Connor, with your question about whether or not this is an issue that the Court ought to -- the -- the underlying question of the meaning of the section 1350 is an issue the Court ought to resolve as opposed to the narrower -­",
  "Well, you clearly don't have to, and -- and certainly Jose Francisco Sosa would be perfectly content to have the judgment of the court of appeals reversed on the ground that the arrest here was neither arbitrary nor the detention prolonged in a way that would no -- under no circumstances violate the law of nations. But the truth is, as one of the amicus briefs for the respondents points out, there are at least 35 cases that they cite in their briefs that have been filed under section 1350. Those causes of action involve, each one, numerous individual defendants. There is a significant reason I think for this Court to try to provide some additional guidance to the lower courts with respect to the meaning of section 1350, particularly when the rules of construction, as Justice Stevens quite rightly pointed out, so clearly point in a particular direction. This is a purely jurisdictional statute. It says it in so many terms. The only language that the respondent embraces as suggesting that it's not purely jurisdictional is the word violation, a word this Court specifically recognized in Touche Ross is not a rights-creating term, but instead again merely provides jurisdiction. This Court has repeatedly held that when you have merely jurisdiction, you do not imply a cause of action. That's the -- the Montana-Dakota Utilities decision of the Court. Obviously that's embedded in Sandoval.",
  "But -- but, Justice O'Connor -­",

  "But -- but, Justice O'Connor, your -- your point brings to mind, frankly, Justice Frankfurter's observations in the Romero case about comparing the historical efforts here to archaeology and the -- and as one who has now spent the better part of the last 6 months on what struck me as a historical dig that accumulated a whole lot of information, virtually none of which remotely provides me with any insights as to which the Congress of 1789 really had in mind at the end of the day, I think the Court would do extremely well here to go back to the first principles of statutory interpretation. I'm sorry, Justice O'Connor.",
  "Well, it clearly had in mind problems of piracy, but as even Blackstone made clear, problems of piracy are matters of public concern. They are not matters of private concern. And while it may well be that Congress did have in mind down the road that there may be subsequent enactments that would, in fact, invoke section 1350 as an exercise of jurisdiction -­",
  "Well, first of all, there's an interesting gap in that history because you go up till about 1807 and then nothing happens until 1982. So it's a little difficult to think that there are a whole lot of historians out there thinking that there was a clear basis for a cause of action tapping in to the law of nations and to those kinds of rights.",
  "I certainly hope we didn't.",
  "To be sure, absolutely. And that -- that's why --",
  "No.",
  "It's not -- well, it's not 100 percent clear to me because the -- the problem you have there is that it would clearly have been a public right and it was -- and, you know, the Congress in 1790 immediately passes a statute that -- that imposes criminal sanction for this. And indeed, Justice O'Connor, even in the -- even in the Pennsylvania case where it arose out of common law, it was a -- it was criminal action that was brought against the attacker on the -- on the ambassador. It was not a civil action. No one sought damages.",
  "This is a very unknown enterprise.",
  "Well, I don't -- I don't -- I don't disagree with it. I think that's absolutely true. On the other hand, I don't think a whole lot of those judges gave quite as much thought or attention to this issue as the litigants before this Court have in this particular case. And the briefing here is obviously extraordinary both in its breadth and depth. And at the end of the day -- and -- and I don't think anybody tried to mine the historical materials in quite the same intensity as we have coming here. And as I said -­",

  "They were. They were.",
  "Well -­",
  "Well, let -- let me answer the first question because the difference between incorporating the law of nations from the -- into admiralty jurisdiction, it had a tradition of 1,000 years. The idea of interpreting the law of nations or incorporating the law of nations into section 1350 or its precursor back then where it only benefits aliens seems to me a quite improbable undertaking by Congress in 1789.",
  "But I -- I -- the difficulty I have with that, Justice Breyer, is I think this Court has rebelled from the idea that it's going to incorporate a massive brooding omnipresence -­",
  "But, see, I don't think -­",
  "But, see, that's my problem with that -- with that argument because it doesn't -- I don't see what the limitation is, Justice Breyer. What we're dealing with is if you're saying the law of nations, customary international law, whatever that means -- and we know from the Ninth Circuit it doesn't have to be anything that the United States itself embraces. These are rules that are imposed upon us under these -- under these circumstances. It would seem to me that if you're going to bring it into the modern era, you ought to bring it in with the recognition that there are core separation of powers concerns in this context that ought to -- ought to caution hesitation in exactly the same way -­",

  "But that brief assumes that 1350 does more than provide jurisdiction.",
  "It assumes that there is a cause of action.",
  "Well, to be sure. There -- I mean, that would take you back to, I think, Justice O'Connor's question which is, could you resolve this particular case by reference to an understanding of the law of nations that -- that rejects any notion that this was an arbitrary act or that the detention here was prolonged within the meaning of the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations? And -- and to be sure, that's a narrower basis for deciding and that is the focus of the commission's brief.",
  "We don't have any quarrel with that on -­",
  "Well, to be sure, it's correct.",
  "No, no. Absolutely not. And if you're in that world and you're looking at those -- at those circumstances, you obviously would have to take a very narrow approach in -- in terms of trying to -­",
  "Well, I think that you raise an important point there which is the parallelism between the treaty prong and the law of nations prong of the statute because if, as -- as Judge Bork explained in his separate opinion, the thing that disturbed him the most about this was the suggestion that somehow on behalf of aliens, you would create a right under the treaty that you would -­ that -- that citizens would never have had the right to because it wouldn't be self-executing. It seemed quite improbable that Congress would have intended that. So by parity of reasoning, why would Congress have wanted to create this kind of access into a brooding omnipresence of law that is essentially very difficult to confine? And I -- and I go back to Justice Breyer's point which is, to be sure, there are ways to try to narrow those rules. My position is you do better not to try to go down that path in the first place. You would do better to recognize that this is a purely jurisdictional statute and thereby force Congress to look in the future at statutes like the Torture Victim Protection Act.",

  "Well, no. Then that's my answer to your question.",
  "Because I think in that world -­",
  "No. I -- I don't know that it's the only way, but it is the simplest way to get to that kind of consistency if you accept the premise that Congress necessarily believed in 1789 that there would be a cause of action created from language discussing merely jurisdiction.",
  "Can -- can I challenge that assumption -­",
  "-- Justice Souter? Because if you look at the historical record and go back to the 1781 Continental Congress saying to the States, there is no brooding omnipresence, we need you, States, to go out, take action to deal with ambassadors to protect them -­",
  "But -- but -- the -- the -- I -­ I think there are no causes of action because the -- if you take seriously -- why -- why would the Continental Congress say to the States, enact a statute to protect ambassadors if ambassadors are otherwise being protected? Why does Connecticut then go forward and enact a law that not only provides criminal protection for the ambassadors but goes -- goes beyond that and provides civil remedies, liability and damages for attacks on ambassadors, if there is this brooding omnipresence? The point is -- my -- my basic point is I don't think the historical record will demonstrate to you at all that these causes of action existed. And therefore, this is not a simple instance of the courts -- of the Congress trying to tap in to a body of law. What it was doing was creating a jurisdictional basis to be filled in in the future. In that sense, I don't think the Congress of 1789 came to the table to deal with this issue dramatically differently than the Congress today would -- would deal with it. They enact jurisdictional provisions all the time. To be sure, 1331 has eliminated the need for a lot of this. But the reality is you -- you create the jurisdiction and then you fill the vessel. And this Court has got a -- you know, an obviously long line of -- of opinions in which it's recognized jurisdiction doesn't create Federal common law rules, jurisdiction doesn't create a right of action. It simply creates jurisdiction. And if this Court goes back to that core principle as the method for trying to interpret section 1350, it will avoid all of the problems and then force Congress to take the action that I think is important here. The -- the Torture Victim Protection Act has a statute of limitations, has an exhaustion requirement, has a definition of torture. Congress wasn't implementing section 1350 there. It was implementing its obligations under international agreements dealing with the question of torture. My guess is we have similar kinds of provisions that are out there that we probably ought to be trying to find causes of action for, and Congress should take those up. But what shouldn't happen is to allow the courts exercising what I submit is an extraordinary Federal common law power to go out, find causes of action, and then proceed to define all of their elements, all of their defenses without the benefit of any guidance, which is precisely how you end up in a situation today where the Ninth Circuit has said that in a situation where a Mexican national assists the United States to -- to enforce an arrest warrant, and the circumstances presented in this case that he's not only engaged in an arbitrary act, but that the detention is -- is wrongful in its own right, not -- even though there's not a shred of evidence that the United States would have embraced that view with respect to its own obligations as a matter of international law. Once you open this door -­",
  "And you should deal with that issue, but -- but, Justice O'Connor, I think you should try to deal with the broader issue because there are just too many of these cases out there creating too much havoc for no good reason, if I'm right, that the Congress in 1789 did not have in mind something anywhere -- anything like what we've seen since 1982. And if it's just as easy for this Court then to go back to first principles of statutory interpretation based on the language of the statute and say enough is enough. If there are no -­",
  "They did use the word tort. It's unfortunately, obviously having spent, as I said, a long time in my historical dig, I haven't been able to figure out why they pulled out the word tort under those circumstances. It doesn't really have an analog. It would have been more sensible if they had -- had used -- I mean, they didn't actually need the term limit. I -- I'm sure it's a term of limitation. I think what they were concerned about were -- were debts. I think that's what they were worried about. They didn't want aliens to be coming in and trying to -- trying to deal with debts. They were -- they were trying to stay away from that. They were worried, obviously, at the end of the day with injuries. But -- but I agree with you, Justice Kennedy, it's an odd choice of words, given how little law was developed on torts generally and how no law was developed under the law of nations involving torts specifically. I've already taken up enough of your time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Kennedy, the answer to your question is that the court of first instance does not have the authority to order discovery. But Justice Ginsburg, the answer to your question is that the court of first instance does have the authority to say, in response to an argument made by AMD, that we have not adequately explained why we didn't take that information into account. And we know from the briefs that AMD has a pretty good idea what that information entails and therefore would be in a perfectly adequate position to go first, obviously, to the commission and say this is why we want you to consider this information. And then second, in the event that we were to issue a refusal to go forward with the proceeding, which we have to explain, frankly, in quite excruciating detail, that's then subject to very much plenary review by the court of first instance and ultimately the Court of Justice.",
  "No. The court of first instance does not expand the record. It, like our Federal courts reviewing agency decision-making, has the authority to send the matter back to the agency to review the question a second time.",
  "The commission has not made a preliminary determination. I think it's important to put it in context. This is a -- an abuse of monopoly power claim based on a large number of contracting arrangements between Intel and a lot of its customers. And the question -- and so there's a serious question of having to review a lot of market data in order to determine whether or not there appears to be a pattern of abuse or a problem that's worthy of going forward with. So the commission has for some time been taking a very hard look at the nature of the market, has obviously talked to AMD, has talked to Intel. I think that's an important aspect of this case that the Court ought to have in mind, is that -- and -- and it's part of the comity concerns that I think ought to animate the Court's analysis of this problem. The commission has an orderly process and that process may, at some day, require it to ask Intel to provide these particular documents or other documents. We don't know. But what we don't want frankly is for a private entity to run to a United States court and use essentially the commission as a pawn in an effort to obtain pre­ complaint discovery.

  "Well -­",

  "To be sure, Justice Breyer. But the Ninth Circuit's decision was based on an assessment that the preliminary actions taken by the commission in this particular case are such that render us a tribunal within the meaning of the statute, which was the explicit basis on which the court of appeals ordered this information to be evaluated at least on remand by the district court. And -- and our position is, at least to the extent that this Court is going to adopt an -- an approach akin to that by Judge Friendly in the Second Circuit opinion involving the Indian tax collectors, which looks to see whether or not the adjudicative function is distinct from the investigative functions, our answer would be that we are not that kind of a tribunal.

  "They make that argument, but that would be an alternative theory.",

  "No, it would not regard itself as a tribunal under those circumstances. If we wanted these documents, we -- we would seek them either directly from the parties or through some other mechanism. This is not a mechanism that the -- that the commission itself views as available to it to seek documents. We would go through government officials. We would go to the FTC. We would go to the Department of Justice to seek information. We information, or we would go to parties over whom we have direct jurisdiction to seek information. But 1782 is not a provision that the commission views itself as -- views as available to it, nor does it want to be used as a pawn by -- by private entities seeking to employ its processes discovery that's available under no other circumstances. commission would like the -- the Court to take away from this is -- is a question of if you have to decide on a contextual basis, because the language of the statute is not unambiguous and therefore you have to come up with some limiting principles, the commission urges the Court to recognize that the use of discovery in this -- the use of this statute in this particular way is a direct interference. It risks the release of confidential information. It increases the burden on the commission and the workload that it has, and it allows us to unseemingly -- unseemingly being used -- unseemly being used as a pawn in this kind of -- in this kind of an effort at discovery. And we would ask -­",
  "Well, it -- it --",
  "In that sense and it also provides an incentive.",
  "It -- it provides an incentive for more filings with the commission in order to use this device in order to obtain discovery that you otherwise could not get. And I think there's good reason to suspect that it may be used. Certainly if this Court were to uphold what AMD attempted to accomplish here, I would be quite worried about other plaintiffs in future cases using this particular device. And remember, there are no rule 11 sanctions that are available for a filing with the European Commission. You don't have to be a lawyer to file a complaint with the European Commission. It requires a relatively minimal amount of effort. It's a letter that identifies a particular problem and asks the commission then to go forward and take a look at it. Therefore, it's a -- it's essentially a costless exercise by plaintiffs using the commission, I submit, in a way that I would hope the Court would find inappropriate and therefore ought to resolve the ambiguities, whether you do it on the basis of tribunal or for use of or proceeding -- and the commission would not presume to tell this Court how to interpret the language of its statute, but whatever choice you make, whichever statutory hook you look for, the commission would ask that this Court interpret the statute narrowly.",
  "Yes, well, the commission is certainly supportive of that notion because the commission information, it will be able to obtain it directly from the party. That is the easiest undertaking in order to obtain information that the commission has available to it. So to the extent the Court wants to draw that line, certainly the commission would be quite comfortable with that line. Again, of course, the commission is uncomfortable telling you how to decide the case -- the statutory -- the specific statutory language. Let me just -- one last point. The last thing in the world the commission really wants is to have 800 district courts deciding this issue on a case-by-case basis exercising their discretion. It seems to us that that is an intolerable burden to impose on the commission. It cannot monitor all litigation in the United States in order to make its interests and concerns known. And, therefore, it is terribly important that this Court announce a rule, either as a supervisory matter or as a matter of statutory construction, that will limit the ability of the commission to be used, as I say, as a pawn in this discovery effort. announce a supervisory rule?

It also -- under first degree, there has to be specific intent to defraud someone, and here the only thing he did, he gave them a flashlight and helped them jack up their car. On the issue of the wig-wag headlights, the transcript shows that the officer spent a minute or 2, by his own estimation, on the scene behind Mr. Alford's car, saw no wig-wag headlights. And as for the scanner, the -- the transcript, page 246 -- he admitted at trial it was actually a ham radio, not a portable police scanner.",

However, there's obviously no obstruction in fact if -- one of them actually said at trial that he didn't ask him to push the button because he wanted to see whether he would push it or not. So there's no -- again, there's no facts to support a finding of probable cause even on the obstruction because the officers were essentially just letting him hang himself.",
  "Your Honor, we raised the issue at the Ninth Circuit that there had been no evidence put forward on the other crimes. And we pointed out that even the deputy prosecuting attorney -- and in fact, even in closing argument, when they addressed the -- the wig-wag headlights, et cetera, they stated specifically that that information went to what they called his intent to unlawfully record.",
  "Correct, Your Honor.",
  "That's exactly right, Your Honor. And in -- in looking at this -- this probable cause determination and the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment, the qualified immunity, of course, was a doctrine that was advanced by the Court to address specific problems. None of those problems are impacted in any way by the closely related offense, this subset of qualified immunity cases.",
  "Yes, sir.",
  "Yes, sir.",
  "That was denied, yes.",
  "Yes. Yes, Justice Stevens. And the -- in reviewing the transcript and in reviewing the -­ the instructions and the ruling on the summary judgment motion, the reason that Senior Judge Bryan did not rule on the qualified immunity was twofold. One, at the time of the summary judgment motion, one of the officers was -- well, was lying about having contacted the prosecutor prior to making the arrest, and he noted in his order that there was a factual dispute. So summary judgment wasn't appropriate. And second, Judge Bryan indicated that essentially there was a problem created by the Saucier opinion because he felt that it was somehow possible that there could have been an arrest effectuated without probable cause, but that there was a reasonable mistake on the part of the officers. So this did not proceed to the jury on the -- on this closely related offense doctrine. It didn't proceed on there were these other crimes for which probable cause existed, but on this broad standard of good faith and reasonable mistake.",
  "I almost hate to say it, Your Honor, but I believe it was a lack of sympathy. That -­ that is my -- much like with Justice Scalia, I believe they -- they looked at the -- the circumstances and even though there was not probable cause to have arrested him, they came to the conclusion we don't like Mr. Alford. We're not going to find for him.",
  "In our brief, Your Honor, I often used the phrase same conduct test because in amalgamating the six different circuits, that appeared to be the most consistent test and the one that's most consistent with the objective standard and with the reasonableness standard, that if -- and I, again, go to the no harm/no foul. If you're engaging in conduct that would have and should have led to your arrest, if it's the same conduct for which you were arrested and it's simply misnamed, then there essentially is no harm of constitutional magnitude. But otherwise --",
  "They did describe the entire episode to him, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "Well, I'm not urging something as narrow as -- as a semi-Blockburger test. But here you have essentially two discrete conducts that were being examined by the officers: number one, the actions surrounding the headlights; and number two, the actions surrounding the taping. And the trial -- I mean, it was very clear that the two were treated as discrete incidents by the police. At the moment Devenpeck saw the tape recorder -- and he testified at trial. When I saw the recorder in the record mode and saw that it was moving, that's what he stated to him constituted probable cause for the arrest. The moment he saw that tape recorder and saw the play and record buttons were pushed, he informed Mr. Alford, you're under arrest for making an illegal tape recording. So when looking at whether something is -- is sufficiently related or not, obviously there's going to have to be more than a modicum of logic that's used, but objectively this separates rather nicely into two discrete incidents for the analysis.",
  "Well, Your Honor, we're not concerned so much -- this doctrine is not concerned so much with what to label the crime.",
  "Well, Your Honor, the distinction in -- in this particular case and the distinctions in the -- in the cases that run the gamut around the circuits generally show one thing that we --",
  "Your Honor, if we start with first principles, and the first principle that underlies this case is there is, from the framing area -- era, a general mistrust of warrantless arrests. From that, we step to the reasonableness clause. From the reasonableness clause, we then step to this judicially created qualified immunity, which subsumed the good faith analysis. So what we find is we're stepping further and further away from the original principle. And the -- on the original principles, he was arrested without a warrant. Wrong. Under the Constitution we have reasonableness. Okay. He's arrested. Was it a reasonable arrest? The court has said we generally say that if an arrest has probable cause, then it's reasonable unless there are these exigent circumstances, excessive force, et cetera. Then under qualified immunity, it's even a step more attenuated, that even though there might not have been probable cause, if there was arguable probable cause, then there would be a violation, but no one is going to be liable for it.",

So what we have posited and what the Ninth Circuit -- what they did in the Gasho case, for example, is after the fact you can look at the actions that were taken by the officers, the booking sheet, et cetera, to give you some objectively verifiable evidence of the cause for the arrest.

To be sure, there are lots of elements of it, but what my position would be -- and obviously the officers' position in this case -- is that in exercising unquestioned command, you can accept all of the facts as you've just described them and none of that is excessive because it doesn't expose anyone to anything other than what is necessary in order to achieve complete control under the circumstances in order to ensure the protection of the individual officers and -- and candidly of the other individuals who were being -- being detained, all four of them, under these circumstances.",
  "No, Justice O'Connor. My -- my basic answer to that is that this Court already addressed that issue in Procunier. It considered that the qualified immunity issue was part and parcel of the issue, even though it hadn't been presented in the question presented, and indeed, I think in this case it's actually a -- a stronger argument that qualified immunity is in this case because that is the way that the Ninth Circuit specifically addressed the issue. It looked at under Saucier. It evaluated whether or not qualified immunity was appropriate and -- and did the two-part test, the first part being whether it was a constitutional violation and the second part whether or not it was reasonable under these particular circumstances. So if I -- if I cannot persuade you that this is constitutional, which obviously I -- I hope I can do, it seems to me absolutely unquestioned that there -- that what the officers did here under these circumstances were perfectly reasonable.",
  "I -- I'm not saying that that would be true in all cases. I do think in this particular case you did not need to have a jury verdict. We would have been prepared to stipulate to the facts as they were found ultimately and -- and giving the benefit of all of the inferences to the -­",
  "But that's just a conclusion of law, Justice Ginsburg. So the -- the facts that you know are the facts as they're described -­",
  "-- by the respondent's brief.",
  "Well, we know precisely what they did. They kept her in handcuffs throughout the duration of the -- of the search. We know that. There's no -­ there are no additional claims as to having mistreated her physically.",
  "I don't think there is a factual question like that because I don't think that question was presented to the jury, and it was certainly not the basis on which the Ninth Circuit affirmed the jury's verdict in this case. There -- there was never an argument made to the jury that this -- that this extended beyond the -- the period of the end of the search. The argument that was made to the jury was that the search should have -- should have been limited to the room where the suspect was -- was a resident or that the police should have made a decision somewhere in the -- before the end of the 2-hour search that she was no longer a threat to them. And then they were arguing that -- that it even went a little further in terms of the timing of it. But they never asked the jury to find that that 15 minutes was the basis for a Fourth Amendment violation in its own right.",
  "I think if the jury had been asked to make that finding, that you -- and -- and the jury determined that there -- that it was unreasonable, then I think you'd have to conclude that the 15 minutes were, in fact -- that it did, in fact, go beyond 15 minutes. I do think there is still a legal issue as to whether that's de minimis under the circumstances. But -- but I agree. I mean, obviously there is a role for the jury's findings, and you have to give them a certain amount of respect. But on the core questions of reasonableness and suspicion and whether or not the police exercised unquestioned command and what those terms mean, this Court has already decided that in the Fourth Amendment context it has to decide those issues as a matter of law to regulate the conduct of all police officers and not simply do it on the basis of whatever a particular jury would say in a particular circumstance.",
  "Well, the -- all of the grounds actually.",
  "Yes.",
  "I think if this Court could determine that, as a matter of course, the -- the standard operating procedures in a particular way, that might certainly inform the Court's Fourth Amendment analysis. That -- I think what's important to keep in mind in this context, though, Justice Souter, is we're talking about four individuals who are being detained under these circumstances, and each of them poses a distinct issue for the police officers under the -- under -- when trying to decide how best to proceed. One of them had been found with marijuana in his possession. One of them had been determined to be an illegal alien, and the other two were individuals about whom the police knew virtually nothing. So, you know, is it possible that police procedure, generally speaking, when you're talking about a single occupant of the residence, oftentimes concludes that he can take away -- you can remove the handcuffs? That may be, although I don't think there's much in the record here to -- to reflect that. But what the police said here -- and I think it's extraordinarily important. Officer Muehler testified that if something had gone wrong, if either a police officer had been injured or one of the occupants of that house had been shot or otherwise harmed as a -- in the context of executing the search warrant, the first question that would have been asked is what was the least that could have been done to prevent those injuries from occurring. And he said to himself and he said it quite rightly -- and it's a rule this Court ought to embrace under the unquestioned command theory of -- of law -- is that if we keep them in handcuffs through the duration of a reasonable search, we will make our way through the search much more rapidly, much more efficiently in order to minimize the detention and we will eliminate -- and I mean, literally eliminate -- the entirety of the risk either to the individuals themselves, the occupants, the detainees, or to the police under these circumstances.",
  "I'm -- I'm quite comfortable with the way the Court analyzed it in Michigan v. Summers, that the officer is not required to evaluate the extent of the intrusion to be imposed by the seizure. That is, you -­ you have a categorical rule that allows you, in the ordinary course, to do whatever is reasonably necessary in order to -­",
  "I understand that, and -- but my -- my position is that handcuffs don't materially affect the detention under these circumstances other than to assure what the Court said, which is unquestioned command of the situation.",
  "Yes, but it's important to put that in context because Summers is a narrow exception to the -- not an exception. It's a narrow circumstance under the Fourth Amendment. You have to have a search warrant. It has to be a validly issued search warrant so that we know that there has either been a crime that's likely to be taking place in the premises. It only -- it only extends to the residents, occupants of the house, and it's only when the search is for contraband, not just for any evidence. So, for instance, when the police go the 60th time to Michael Jackson's estate to go try to find evidence of whatever is going on there, I don't think it's reasonable to go in and handcuff Michael Jackson and anybody else who happens to be on site.",
  "Justice Scalia -­",
  "-- absolutely.",
  "I think the important point here is that we're talking about guns. These are gangs. These are guns. This is a circumstance that is inherently more dangerous than any other circumstance the police are likely to confront.",
  "Well, it -- it could have been a basis for the jury's verdict if they had, in fact, put the issue of whether or not they were detained -­",
  "Right. That -- I understand that, Justice Stevens, but the point we made in our reply brief is there's not a shred of evidence in this record and it was never argued to the jury that this search -­ that -- that her detention lasted beyond the period of the search in this case. Indeed, counsel for the police officers specifically said in his closing argument, there is no issue but that she was released at the time of the -- that when -- as soon as the search was -- was ended, the -- the warrant was executed.",
  "Because -- because what he's -­ well, you know, it's a reasonable instruction.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, Justice Ginsburg. We didn't. And -- and -­",
  "Right. Justice Ginsburg, you have to put that in context. The argument of the plaintiff in this case was that the detention should have ended at either of two points: after they had completely cleared the area and made it safe, or alternatively, at some point after that when they had asked her questions and determined that she had no particular involvement with Mr. Romero. Their argument was anything after that was unreasonable, and that's what the jury certainly found, was that that was the reasonable break point. Our argument is that's not consistent with the notion of unquestioned command and -- and is wrong as a matter of law. And there is no evidence -- no evidence. There was no testimony that she was kept for a period beyond the execution of that search warrant. It's very important to understand that.",
  "Right. If it's wrong as a matter of law, that's -- then that's absolutely right. But there was no evidence in this case that they kept going. The only thing he said was, he -- he didn't remember. That was -- the question was put to the police officer. Was she kept beyond there? He said he didn't remember. He wasn't even the police officer who was involved in it. There's not a shred of evidence of that. It's totally made up. It wasn't their theory of the case in front of the jury. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens. I want to start with essentially the question that Justices Breyer and Kennedy raised, which is what do you do when you know that the Ninth Circuit is wrong, that the questioning here violated the Fourth Amendment, and what do you do when you know that the Ninth Circuit was wrong in saying that the officers have an affirmative duty in the middle of a Summers detention to make an assessment on an individualized basis as to the risks posed by any individual detainee. Those are rulings that I submit to you are plainly erroneous and warrant reversal on that basis alone. At that stage, if the respondent wants to argue to the Ninth Circuit that that 15 minutes is, in fact, proved by the facts of this case, that's fine, but understand, those issues were put to the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit did not affirm on the alternative ground that there were 15 minutes here. The Ninth Circuit expressly never -- or didn't expressly but never said one word about a period of time after the search ended in this particular case, and that's not an accident because there is no testimony. The officer said he didn't remember and when asked, well, would 10 to 15 minutes be consistent with your memory, well, of course, it would. He didn't remember anything. So there's nothing in that evidence, and there's no way -- I have looked at that tape. I ask you to look at that tape. I guarantee you there's no way you can draw any inference as to at what point in this process she was released vis-a-vis the end of this particular -- this particular search being executed.",
  "I assume you have the tape. It's part of the record. It should be in the clerk's office. If you don't have it, I'd be more than happy to send you a copy. The --",
  "Of course not, Justice Ginsburg, because the issue before the jury was whether or not the -- we had an affirmative duty to make an evaluation in the middle of the search as to whether or not she posed a -- a threat. That was -­",
  "-- their theory of the case, and that's what the Ninth Circuit said, is yes, we do have that affirmative obligation.",
  "Not of the search. Of her detention.",
  "Yes, of her detention. And that was based on the jury's determination that we had detained her beyond the period we had done the sweep.",
  "Well, the -- the court of appeals' obligation here was to evaluate our argument that we should -- we were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court of appeals put forth what it regarded as the most legitimate bases on which to affirm the judgment in this case. The fact that neither of those withstand serious scrutiny, Justice Ginsburg, seems to me to be a basis for reversing the Ninth Circuit and allowing the matter to go back at this point. And -- and that is exactly what this Court does in -- you know, said it will do in Ornelas, that it is a de novo review. Punitive damages, exactly like a punitive damages cases. Juries make punitive damages determinations every day and every day courts of appeals and trial judges review those damages awards de novo because they -- because the question is not just what are the historical facts -- that you give deference to the jury on -- but on the fundamental question of what is the rule of law that will govern the police officers in the execution of search warrants in circumstances like this. They need protection, Your Honor. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This Court 32 years ago in Zahn v. International Paper affirmed that a class action could not proceed under 28 U.S.C., section 1332, the diversity statute, if it was clear that some of the unnamed members of that class do not satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement. The question in this case is whether Congress in 1990 overturned this Court's ruling in Zahn and its interpretation of section 1332 not by amending section 1332 but, instead, by enacting a supplemental jurisdiction statute, section 1367. The answer to that question, Your Honors, is no. Plaintiffs in the lower courts that have felt constrained to conclude that the language of section 1367 requires the conclusion that Zahn and, candidly, also this Court's decision in Strawbridge were overruled by 1367 do so by gliding past the express language in 1367(a) that is the primary basis upon which our argument stands. In the appendix 246a to the petition, there's -­ the central language is in (a). It says, in any civil action, of which the district courts have original jurisdiction. That language by its terms and -- clearly indicates that Congress did not mean to make any adjustments in the background law that exists that defined diversity jurisdiction or Federal court jurisdiction, Federal question jurisdiction as a condition to going forward. So what the Congress says is, look at the law as it exists in 1990, as it's been interpreted by this Court, and then determine whether or not there's Federal jurisdiction, either for diversity or Federal question, and if there is, then you proceed forth from that point. And what we know is that there are two situations that will not satisfy original jurisdiction under those circumstances. The first one is in the Zahn situation. Where you have both satisfying and unsatisfying plaintiffs in the unnamed -- who are in the unnamed members of the class, this Court said you cannot proceed forth under the diversity jurisdiction. The second one is the classic sort of joinder situation, and what the Court held in Strawbridge is that simply because you have a plaintiff who satisfies the amount-in-controversy requirement and satisfies the complete diversity requirement does not mean that you're allowed to join under rule 20 an additional plaintiff who does not satisfy both of those requirements. And if you bring someone in under those circumstances, that defeats jurisdiction at the beginning before you ever took to trying to decide what the scope of section 1367(a) and (b) mean from that point forward. So then the question is, if that's the correct interpretation of 1367(a)'s predicate language, then what work does 1367(a) and 1367(b) do, and does our interpretation do any violence to the structure of the statute? And the answer to that is clearly no. Here we start by looking at what was Congress' clear intent, manifested primarily in the last language of 1367(a), where it says supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties. Here --",
  "I -- I don't think that's the right conclusion to draw from those cases, Justice Ginsburg, because what happened is by the time that -­ those cases got to this Court, the jurisdictional problems had been solved and the Court was faced with a question -­ with what I perceive to be purely a remedial question, is what do you do in terms of trying to put the omelette back into the egg at that point when the litigation has gone forward.

Here, by contrast, this jurisdictional problem existed on day one, and the complaint was filed -­",

  "Well, it -- it's curable in the sense that you can eventually excise out portions of the case, but what you cannot do is -- is allow the case to go -- it remains still jurisdictionally barred to proceed forth with parties who are not properly before the court. That's -- that's what this Court said specifically in -­ in Zahn itself. It said the problem is that you cannot simply go forward with the Federal claim and with the State claims in that -- in that format. You surely can excise portions of them, but then you start over again. Once you excise them, that's a new complaint. It's a new case. That's the fundamental difference.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "No, I understand that the Court's ultimate remedy in both of those cases was not to do a do­ over, but you also have to remember -- I mean, I think there are two questions here. One is do you ignore the jurisdictional problem. And what I'm proposing to you is this Court has never ignored the jurisdictional problem. It always solves the jurisdictional problem somehow, whether it dismisses the case, as it did in -- in Grupo Dataflux, whether it dismisses the case, as it -- as it proposed would have to happen in Zahn if they didn't excise one of the parties, or whether it makes an adjustment. The Court always takes account of the jurisdictional problem and finds a method of fixing it. So that's the -­",

  "And that takes you back to what the district court ruled in Zahn and -- and, in effect, what this Court affirmed in Zahn, which is that there's a fundamental difference between sort of finding a single, individual plaintiff and saying, you know, this person, if you could just excise that claim, drop it under rule -­ that person under rule 21, that fixes it. There's a fundamental difference. I mean, the question here is what's the civil action because there are res judicata, collateral estoppel -­",
  "Well, that would -- one of the alternatives on the table -- I think it is appropriate -­ is for the Court to excise the class action allegations -­",
  "-- and dismiss the entirety of the class and proceed forth solely in the name of the four individual plaintiffs.",
  "I think the Court has the authority to do that. I think the practical implications of that are overwhelming and should be -- and should be rejected for that reason because in order to be able to have res judicata/collateral estoppel effects, you have to know what the civil action is. And with a class of unnamed members, who are, in many instances, unknowable in -- in some respects, we don't know what the res judicata or collateral estoppel effects are if your solution is to try to excise those who do not satisfy the amount-in- controversy requirement.",
  "Well, I -- I think the case should never have been allowed to go forward except with the named plaintiffs. Okay.",
  "Well, not -- but -- but it's a much more complicated issue preclusion problem because the question is, is there jurisdiction? This is a judgment that's been entered without jurisdiction. The court doesn't have proper jurisdiction here --",
  "I -- I would -­",
  "Well, it doesn't eliminate it completely, Justice O'Connor. The Class Action Fairness Act only applies to claims where there are plaintiffs who exceed the number of 100, plaintiffs over 100, and -- and the $5 million amount-in-controversy -­",
  "But it's not retroactive. But even prospectively, there will be situations where this precise issue will arise in the future. So there is reason for the Court to go ahead and resolve this question that has so badly divided the courts. But, Justice O'Connor, to answer your first question, I would have -- I would have thought the conclusion was exactly the opposite, that what -- what -­ the statute says you don't have jurisdiction over civil actions over which you didn't have jurisdiction prior to 1990, but you do have jurisdiction over claims that then can be appended to those for which you have jurisdiction in 1990. So I would have thought the more sensible way, at least from my perspective, to read this case -- to read this statute is to say, is this a claim that could have been brought in 1990? And the answer from Zahn is absolutely no, it couldn't. And similarly with the -­ with the joinder cases. They could not have been brought -­",
  "And --",
  "It clearly was enacted later, but my point here is that I think the language -- when the Congress both in (a) and (b) harkens back to in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, it's clearly not trying to amend 1331 or 1332.",
  "I hope that's not a criticism of the writing.",
  "No.",
  "No, that's not right, Justice Breyer.",
  "The -- the -- you know, the traditional case. You're from one State, I'm from another State, I have a claim against you for at least $50,000, I sue you in diversity jurisdiction.",
  "That is a civil action of which district courts have original jurisdiction. So I've sued you. You have an insurer who's going -- who -- who lives in the same State I live.",
  "You bring in the insurer in a third party -- in a third party claim under rule 14. Okay? That claim doesn't satisfy the $75,000, whatever the amount-in-controversy requirement is that applies, because you've got a -- a retention. Okay? Then -- and so your -- your claim against them is only for $50,000. That wouldn't satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement but it does satisfy the supplemental jurisdiction over claims brought separately.",
  "Yes. That would be one easy -­",

  "There's another one that fits -­",
  "Well, my guess is if they did, you probably wouldn't want to rely on it as the authoritative source for interpreting the language of the statute in any event.",
  "Pendent party jurisdiction.",
  "Well, no. Actually what I'm saying is that 1367(a), in effect, codifies both aspects of the Kroger -- of this Court's decision in Kroger. In Kroger, the Court said you would have ancillary jurisdiction over the third party claim that I identified for Justice Breyer, and that that would fall within 1367(a) under my interpretation of it, but that 1367(b) would not allow the plaintiff then to bring a subsequent action against the third party defendant.",
  "The only way I would just -- you know, the only point I would make with respect to that is that I do think that in Finley this Court's opinion cast some doubt on the entire pendent and ancillary jurisdiction doctrines, and I think that 1367(a) is clearly designed to -- to eliminate that issue going forward because it says there is a role. There is now a -- an express provision from Congress to the courts of supplemental jurisdiction. And then the question is under what circumstances does it apply. So to go back to the Owen case, you know, we all assumed that there was ancillary jurisdiction over the third party claim. This statute makes it absolutely clear that there is jurisdiction over the third party claim because it -- it extends to that claim. And we know that by the express language of the provision. It wouldn't have changed anything if you accept the idea that the Court had inherent authority to do that. If you question that, then this is the basis on which that jurisdictional grant is provided. And so that is an important part of 1367(a) that affects -­",
  "Well, I -- I would go back -­",
  "Well, it just depends on whether you accept as a given that the third party claim and other multi-party litigation was clearly going to fall within the Court's ancillary jurisdiction without the benefit of an express statutory provision granting that authority. If you accept that, then this makes a fundamental change. If I could -­",
  "Right.",
  "Right, but the -- the question is what was the statutory authority for that part of -- for the first part of ancillary jurisdiction, which is the bringing in of the third party defendant. And that's what 1367(a) does in the diversity context. If I could reserve the balance of my time, Justice Stevens.",
  "Thank -- thank you, Justice Stevens, and I'd just like to make a few points. First of all, Justice Kennedy, you asked about the City of Chicago case, and Justice Ginsburg said this sort of feels like a Finley type case in the -- in -- in how it applies in the diversity context. But the fundamental point here is that there is a very different approach and there has always been a very different approach to Federal question jurisdiction and to diversity jurisdiction. Federal question jurisdiction has always been claims-driven. Diversity jurisdiction has always been party-driven. And the Congress that enacted 1367 in 1990 had to have understood that. It's been the law for as long as -- as we've had -- for the 200 years that Strawbridge has been around, that distinction has -- has existed. And so we're not asking the Court to interpret civil action differently in this particular statute. We're asking the Court to focus on civil actions of which the district court has jurisdiction. That incorporates all of the requirements of 1331 and 1332. Second, Justice Breyer, I'm a little reluctant to get into this rule 19, rule 24 to try -- but I think I can help at least clarify at least some aspects of it. Rule 19 by its terms excludes situations that defeat jurisdiction. So it says in the rule that if you're bringing in a necessary party -- remember, this is the defendant who is bringing in a necessary party -- if it would defeat jurisdiction, you can't do it, and if it still is indispensable, you have to dismiss the entirety of the case, which is precedent for the notion that sometimes you have to dismiss the entirety of the case in situations where you don't have jurisdiction over a particular party. But the -- the second question, rule 24. I think the standard is that you could bring in a rule 24 party within supplemental jurisdiction that doesn't defeat anything with respect to the original civil action. I think that was the rule prior to 1367. But to the extent it was or wasn't, I think 1367(a) and (b) combine to allow that to happen. (b) then says that if someone intervenes as a party, the plaintiff cannot bring a claim against that -- that intervening party. Justice Souter, you asked about the different treatment between the amount-in-controversy requirement and the geography requirement. If there is a distinction -- and I don't think this provision allows any kind of meaningful distinction between the two as it applies in the 1367 context -- it is that the amount-in-controversy requirement is more important. That's what Zahn held. You can dispense with the geography requirement in Ben Hur, but you cannot dispense with the amount-in- controversy requirement. And the reason -­",
  "Well, except it does because the -- the amount-in-controversy requirement keeps a lot of smaller cases out of Federal court that otherwise would be in there. It is a protection of this Court's docket and all the Federal courts' dockets, and that's important. And that's also a distinction between the Federal question cases and the diversity cases. If you resolve diversity in favor of driving cases to State court, you are promoting federalism interests because State courts should decide law. If you drive more cases into Federal courts under Federal question, that's right because you think Federal courts are, in general, better suited to resolve Federal courts -- Federal questions. And then finally, with respect to the remedy, Justice Ginsburg, Newman-Green says you can simply excise some parties if there is no prejudice. And what I submit to you is we have a case that has been litigated from day one without jurisdiction involving more than 1,000 plaintiffs.",
  "Well, except that this Court in Dataflux didn't send it back. This Court in Dataflux decided that the right -- in Grupo Dataflux that the right answer is that the remedy for this mistake is the dismissal certainly of the class, but I think frankly the dismissal of the entirety of the case.",
  "Well, that's -- and that's what the district court held in Zahn, which is the reason the district court didn't allow this case to come -- didn't allow this to go forward as a class action. And that's important to remember. This Court didn't say you dismiss out anything in Zahn. Zahn came up without it being a class action. The district court dismissed the class action. It came up trying to reinstate it. This Court said you can't reinstate it. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are two issues in this case. One concerns walking time, and the other concerns waiting time. And unless the Court has a different order, I'd propose to start with the walking time. Section 4(a)(1)'s language, which comes from the Portal-to-Portal Act, which was enacted in 1947, by its plain terms clearly covers the walking that's involved in these two cases. The statute, which is reproduced at the appendix of the petition, at 88(a), says that there is no mandatory compensation for, quote, \"walking to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform.\" It's difficult for me to imagine language that could more directly cover what we're dealing with in this particular case, because the Plaintiffs here are -- for IBP -- are employed to slaughter and to process beef. The employees at Barber Foods are employed to process chicken. And thus, the actual place where they perform those services are obviously on the lines where the processing takes place.",
  "Well, I don't know that we've -­ I don't know of any case where this Court has held otherwise.",
  "Well, this Court said that donning and doffing was a principal activity in contradistinction to a preliminary or postliminary activity for purposes of section 4(a)(2), but the Court specifically said, in Steiner, that that holding does not apply to matters that are specifically excluded under section 4(a)(1), which deals with walking time, Justice Scalia.",
  "For -- no, I don't think it's irrelevant to the workplace. I think it is irrelevant to the proper disposition of this case, yes.",
  "Well, we don't have any quarrel with the continuous workday rule. The question is, When does the workday begin? And our assessment of the workday, as defined in section 4(a)(1), which controls, specifically, the walking time in this particular case, begins when you arrive at the actual place where you're going to perform the services -­",
  "-- or primary activities.",
  "No, I don't think so. I think it is perfectly sensible and a clear bright-line rule, Justice Souter, to say that when you arrive at the actual place where you perform, not just any activities, and not just the activities that are integral and indispensable to your working activities, but to the principal activities for which you're hired -- and, admittedly, there can be more than one of those, but that doesn't -- you know, donning and doffing is not a principal activity -­",
  "-- of anyone who's cutting beef.",
  "Right. They don't have to principal activities. They're better understood as -­",
  "Right.",
  "It -­",
  "The problem with that analysis is that the court was only analyzing section 4(a)(2) for these purposes. And what it was saying is, \"We are prepared to accept that there are certain activities that are either preliminary or postliminary, and then there are others that are primary activities. And if you are integral and indispensable to a primary activity, it is a compensable event.\" Recognizing that Steiner is probably the most extraordinarily extreme facts that you could imagine, because we're talking about clothings that had -- clothing that had to be changed in order to protect the public -­",
  "-- health and safety.",
  "Because you have to read the language \"principal activity or activities\" in (a)(1) within the context of what Congress was trying to achieve by the Portal-to-Portal Act, which was to absolutely and categorically exclude walking time from being part of mandatorily compensated activities of a particular employee.",
  "Right. But that -­",
  "But, Justice Ginsburg, if you step back and think about this language in the context of the words that are written here, it says, \"walking to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity.\" No one would think that that -­",
  "Or activities. But, again, Justice Souter, all that suggests is that there are times when somebody who's working in a clothing operation may -­ you know, may spend time distributing the cloth or may spend time actually sewing the cloth. Those are two separate activities. They're different activities. But it doesn't mean -- and it certainly doesn't convert anything that had -- can be described as \"integral and indispensable\" into a primary activity which such employee is employed to perform. No employee, in these cases, was employed to perform the act of putting on clothes or the act of picking up equipment.",
  "Well, there are two parts about that that are worth focusing on. One is, I don't think you can lump the two cases together, because the clothing or the equipment that has to be put on with respect to the Barber Foods company is barely -- is quite minimal and, indeed, was deemed to be diminimus. So, I'm not -- I'm not sure you can lump the two cases together in that way. But also, in terms of where the Secretary comes out on this, let's not forget 79.7(g), footnote 49, which is, candidly, the clearest statement from the Secretary with respect to, What do you do when you have donning and doffing that is followed by walking time? And what does the -- and what does the regulation specifically say? And that's on, I think, 92 and 93 of the appendix to our petition. It specifically says that that walking time is not excluded, not necessarily --",
  "Well, except that, under their theory of this case, it is always excluded. Always. So that whatever else you can say about the meaning of that particular language, the interpretation the Secretary offers to you today flatly rejects -­",
  "-- that language.",
  "Right.",
  "No, but -- and if we were talking about that in the context of other kinds of activities -­ if you're back in the (a)(2) world of looking at whether something's preliminary or postliminary, I have less of a problem with dealing with that. The problem is, here we're talking about (a)(1) activities, the core of what Congress enacted the Portal-to-Portal Act to protect employers for. The Portal-to-Portal Act is not a statute that remotely provides protections for the employees. This is a statute that was designed to protect employers from billions of dollars of liability. And so, when you're talking about, \"Under what circumstances can you ignore the flat prohibition on requiring walking time to be regarded as a mandatory subject of compensation?\" then it seems to me the distinction you're proposing doesn't work. And it's also, Justice Breyer, again, flatly inconsistent. Their -- that's not their theory of the case. Their theory of the case is, \"If we can describe it as in any way integral and indispensable to some other activity, that makes it a primary activity, that starts the workday, and everything after that then becomes compensable.\"",
  "Yes.",
  "Now you skipped over \"actual place,\" there -­",

  "Right. But that -­",
  "Because when the court was interpreting (a)(2) in Steiner, it wasn't interpreting (a)(2) to determine whether something was a postliminary activity in connection with \"said preliminary -- primary activities.\" What it was saying is, these are not preliminary and postliminary activities, that they are excluded from that. And so, the court's really coming up with what is a third category of cases, which deals with integral and indispensable activities to a primary activity. They didn't have to analyze it as a primary activity. All they had to say was, it's not -- that the preliminary and postliminary activities are not simply temporal, that there is a substantive component to it. And that is essentially the holding of the court in Steiner. It says there's a substantive component; and, therefore, we're not going to just simply look in -- time- wise, whether it comes before or after principal activities. We're going to decide that there are some -­ there are some situations that are so important that they need to be compensated under (a)(2), because they don't fall within preliminary or postliminary language.",
  "It's work -­",
  "-- that's mandatorily compensable under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Remember, the Fair Labor Standards Act, under this Court's interpretations from Mt. Clemens Pottery and the cases that preceded it, I mean, it -- you know, it had a very sweeping definition of what is work within the meaning -- within the meaning of what is compensable as minimum wages and as overtime. And that's in place. And now Congress has stepped in and said, \"Well, wait a second. When we did it -- when that got interpreted that broadly, we're talking about $6 billion in liability.\" So, it's very important, given that we're talking about fairly minimal activities on the -- on the -- that are involved here, triggering potentially massive liabilities. And so, what we've done is, we've excluded from those massive liabilities the walking, riding, and traveling time, because that's the basis on which you end up with big numbers.",
  "Right. Well, I mean, that -- but that's -- this Court's decision in Steiner was the one that reached out to decide that \"integral and indispensable\" was a category of activities that were going to be compensable, even though, on the face of them, they may have appeared to be -­",

That's the definition of what starts the workday, which is why I -- to our mind, this is a much clearer and brighter-line rule. We can tell you precisely when you start the workday. It's when you get to the place where you got hired to work, and start to do that work.",
  "Yes, you do have compensated -­ and that's true for lots of different situations, Justice Kennedy.

But I don't -- I don't -- I -- for exactly the reason you identify, Mr. Chief Justice, that does create a problem. I mean, part of this problem is a bit contrived.

  "But I still don't think that, even if you accept that that is compensable conduct within the meaning of Steiner, which I -- that's what it's talking about -- but Steiner, Justice O'Connor, doesn't say anything about the fact that there was going to have to be walking or traveling, or the workday. The court, in Steiner, clearly had in mind the workplace, where you're producing batteries. There's a lot of language in that opinion that says, \"This is where you really do the work. That's your battery, and here's where you're going to get -- engage in activities that we think you need to be compensated.\" But the court never remotely suggested that you were entitled to the walking time between those two. And, if you go back to 790.7(g), that language specifically told every employer that simply because you have to pay for certain kinds of activities at the outset, because they're integral and indispensable, as decided by a court, that doesn't necessarily mean you have to pay for all the walking time. And so, you've got to come up with --",
  "-- a theory that supports that.",
  "Well, sharpening tools is the easiest one, because you do that right on your workplace. I mean, that's exactly what Congress had in mind in its legislative history -­",
  "Well, again, if the Court decided that sharpening the tools, even though it's done not at the same time, which is what Congress had in mind when it -- when it identified that hypothetical -- but, even if you assume that, that that's integral and indispensable, it still isn't what triggers the time for starting the actual employment.",
  "No, I can accept that identity for purposes of distinguishing between what's preliminary and postliminary activity. What I cannot do is to -- is embrace that for purposes of deciding when walking time/traveling time ought to be included. Congress was as plain as it could humanly be in saying that, \"We're not going to allow walking and traveling time to be included in an unexpected fashion.\" And that is precisely -- as the Chamber of Commerce brief says, that is precisely what we're talking about here. And, candidly, as Judge Boudin said in his concurring opinion, the circumstances arising in this context bear a very eery resemblance to the situation that gave rise to the Portal-to-Portal Act in the first place. And so -- and I think it's important to put this into context. You know, the language of the statute, as I read it, clearly is in our favor. The purpose of the statute is clearly in our favor. And then the question is, Did this Court, in a decision that dealt solely with 4(a)(2), mean to vastly change the scope of 4(a)(1) in a way that would dramatically expose employers to liability -­",

  "Well -­",
  "But the -- well, in part, because plants are not -- have never been designed -- remember, we've got 79.6 -- the Secretary of Labor told employers for 50 years, \"You can set up your plant without fearing that you're going to suddenly be hit with walking time after somebody engages in donning and doffing, even if it turns out to be integral and indispensable.\" For 50 years, they followed that advice. They set up all of their plants with that expectation. And now this Court, if it follows the ninth circuit's lead, will suddenly say, \"Okay, what you need to go out and find is all of the integral and indispensable activities\" -- not just donning and doffing -- any integral and indispensable activity that you can get a court to buy into, that will start this ever-expanding workday, such that any walking that goes on after that and before you get done with all of these ever- expanding post-doffing activities. Then you have the -- that's -- you know, so you have this broad -- and that's why you're going to have these -- substantially greater and totally unexpected liabilities on the workplace.",

What I'm suggesting to you is that once you go down this path and you say, \"Okay, we're going to define the workday by reference to whatever somebody determines is integral and indispensable,\" you are going to have an expandable workday, and that if you are really looking for a fairly clear rule, you sit -- you stick with what the language of the statute says, which is, the actual place of the performance of the activity for which you were hired.

  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I just have a couple of points I'd like to make. First, Justice Breyer, I want to start with the waiting times. I didn't actually have an opportunity to spend much time talking about them. But I think the answer that the Solicitor General's Office has offered with respect to the waiting time simply illustrates the expandable nature of the workday. Their position -­ Justice Ginsburg -- or, no Justice O'Connor specifically asked that question, \"You're not saying that waiting time prior to engaging in a primary activity, in fact, starts the workday.\" And the answer is, absolutely, it does, because they find that everything that is integral and indispensable triggers the start of the workday. So, to put it into fairly graphic terms. If you have to show up in order to put on a coat in order to go onto the floor in order to do your services, then the waiting time for that coat counts. If, however, you also have to put in earplugs in order to get to the place where you have to get the coat, not only do putting in the earplugs count, under that theory, but, if you have to wait, you have that, and that extends the workday, and all of the walking in between there. So, if you're asking, \"Is this going to become a significant liability?\" the answer is clearly yes. For very significant compensable acts -- and, indeed, in this context, some of those compensable acts were found by the jury to be utterly diminimus -- you're going to end up with significant waiting time, and you're going to end up with significant walking time.",
  "Yes, Justice O'Connor, they specifically held that all of the waiting time is not -­ it is to be excluded. And they did that on the basis of 790.7(g), before you get to the footnote -- because that's the tag to the footnote -- as to what is -- what is the ordinary meaning of wait -- of preliminary and postliminary for waiting time? And the expectation is that if you're waiting to get your check, and if you're waiting to check in, the recognition is that those -­ those are completely fortuitous, just as it is here. There's nobody who structured this arrangement so that you will end up spending time waiting. Indeed, the scheme is designed to get people in as efficiently -­",
  "-- as possible.",
  "Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, if they specifically decide that there is no waiting time that's covered here, and the plaintiffs have sought compensation for both pre- and post-waiting time, then the issue is squarely posed, and they've certainly posed it in their petition, and the Court granted it. So, again, obviously, you're free to decline to decide issues, but it seems to me that one is posed. I want to -­",
  "Right, but that just goes to the question -- I think it disposes of the issue of, if you have waiting time that otherwise looks to be fairly ordinary preliminary/postliminary activity, it, nevertheless, can be converted into primary activity under their interpretation of the statute. And they clearly suggest that the answer is yes. Our suggestion is, that's inconsistent with the way waiting time is handled under the regulations; and, therefore, the answer clearly should be no. And, at a minimum, the Court ought to affirm that part of the Tum decision. With respect to the holding of Steiner -- I mean, it's important to put in mind, Steiner -- one of the things -- two things that Steiner focused on -- it focused on section 3.0, and it recognized that there are going to be situations where you're going to be able to bargain away clothes changing. And so, now you're in a situation where, for some -- for -- in some circumstances, because you've bargained away compensation for clothes changing, walking that takes place before or after that will never be compensable; in other situations, it will be compensable. That's an absurd outcome in a situation where Congress clearly had one thing in mind that it absolutely wanted to accomplish, and that was to ensure that walking, riding, traveling to the place where you actually perform the services for which you've been hired, has been -- has -- is excluded from being mandatorily compensated -- Steiner doesn't deal with 4(a)(1); the language is as plain as it can be -- are not -- you know, unless specifically excluded by section 4(a)(1). Thank you, Your Honors.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It seems to me there are three issues that have been posed by the way both this case has been argued by the parties on the other side and as the questions have arisen. And the first one is whether or not there is competition in this particular case. And Justice Stevens' question, it seems to me, posed the issue about as starkly as it can be: Is it not the case that under traditional standards of Tampa Electric, this Court's decision there, and a host of other cases, that we define \"competition\" by reference to whether or not entities compete for the same -- with respect to the same product in the same market, same region, and if they're -- if that's what you have by way of competition, then you look to the next level, which is to see: Is there price discrimination, and is there injury to that competition?",

And our witness meticulously -- I'd commend the record to you if you want to read it -- but he meticulously examined each of those trucks and showed that, systematically, for 102 sales, they sold the exact same truck to a dealer down the road, with a significantly better price than the truck they sold to us, in order to implement the \"Volvo Vision\" and drive my client -­",

  "-- of course not.",
  "No, there are -- there are two elements to this, Justice Scalia. You first have to demonstrate that there's discrimination. And the way you demonstrate anticompetitive discrimination is to show that there is a consistent pattern. It has to be substantial discrimination over a substantial period of time. If we're trying to cut deals on a daily basis, presumably today you got a deal with a customer, and I'll give you a 10 percent, and then the Chief Justice got a deal tomorrow, and I may give him 12 percent, but, 2 weeks down the line, the situations will likely be flipped out. You're not going to find, where you have 55 percent of your sales, 102 sales involving $250,000-plus of sales differentials to be the basis for the claim that there is price discrimination in the first instance, Justice Scalia.",
  "Oh, sure. We had thousands of those examples.",

  "Sure.",

  "That happened literally more than a thousand times. The testimony on that is rampant. And the reason we don't make more of that, Justice Scalia, in this particular case, is because the jury verdict is based on actual sales. There is as very clear fidelity to the two-purchaser rule in the way the jury verdict was rendered and the way the Court of Appeals affirmed it.

  "I realize you may disagree with me on that, but -­",
  "-- we'll start there. But I just want to be clear that that's a completely separate analysis. Then, it seems to me, what you -- what you have to go back to is the kind of analysis that Justice Stevens was saying, which is that when you're talking about different purchasers of commodities, there is no reason to be so focused on the -- on the identical transaction, rather than recognizing, particularly in the context of a dealership arrangement where you're -- have continuous relationships between the -- between the seller -­ the manufacturer and the dealer, where you have this enormous disadvantage to the dealer, who has already sunk, you know, huge amounts of money into this and is in -- essentially at the whim of what is now a monopoly seller -- a monopsony -- a monopoly seller. And, under those circumstances, it makes perfect sense to say, \"Look, if I'm going to systematically keep getting 20 -­ 10 percent discounts, where my competitor, a hundred miles away, is always getting 20 percent discounts,\" that's a situation that this statute seems clearly aimed at dealing with.",
  "I have a 5-year contract that's already in place, so, at least for the 5 years, I'm pretty much at the whim of my -- unless I want to breach the contract, which --",
  "Well, unfortunately -­",
  "-- I didn't write that contract, Justice Scalia.",
  "I think to make that argument you essentially have to make mush out of the last half of the Robinson-Patman Act, because it's not injury in any line of commerce, which is where I think you would be talking about interbrand problems. It's problems with respect to customers of either of them. And it's quite clear, and it's been clear since 1948 in Justice Black's opinion for the Court in Morton Salt, that this is designed to recognize that when you harm an intrabrand competitor, that that's the kind of injury to competition that this statute was aimed at. And this Court reaffirmed that both in the 1980s, reaffirmed it again in 1990, in Texaco. And it's -- and notwithstanding some effort to ask the Court to revisit Morton Salt at this point, it seems to me that that principle ought to be completely settled at this stage. If there's to be any fix there, it ought to be a fix that's offered up by Congress. To go back to, then, your point, Justice Scalia, I told you, first, you have this discrimination in price, you have to show that it's substantial, lasts for a substantial period of time, you get the Morton Salt inference. You -- then we still have to show, under section 4 of the Clayton Act, that we have actual injury to our business and property. And in this context, it seems to me, the evidence is absolutely overwhelming, because you have a situation where, in 1995, we are next-to-none dealer for Volvo. In 1995, we're selling 66 cars, we're making $165,000. Volvo implements its \"Volvo Vision,\" the purpose of which is to drive my client out of this dealership. It engages in systematic discrimination, both with respect to unquestionable purchases on both sides and, candidly, more broadly than that. And the effect of that, at the end of the day, is that our sales go from 65 to 34 to 18 to 8. Our gross profits dropped to $26,327. You compare that to the kind of evidence this Court looked at in the -- in the J. Truett Payne case, where it wasn't clear that there was really any discrimination involved there, there was no drop in the market, there was no evidence of any diversion of any sales. And, even in that context, this Court was unwilling to say that the Fifth Circuit's decision holding that the evidence was flat-out inconsistent -- or inadequate to sustain the verdict, was overturned, had to be sent back.

  "Well, I think, at the end of the day, what we're talking about is essentially a jury question: Were we entitled to say these were lost profits, the margins were reduced, we didn't have as much money? That interfered with our ability to make sales in the future period, because you have the complete before-and-after documented history in this particular case.",
  "It seems to me that's a jury question. And the jury found in our favor.",
  "I hope not.",
  "Right.",
  "That, by itself, wouldn't count as an injury.",

  "Right.",
  "Well, I'm not here to -­",
  "-- I'm not here, necessarily, as an advocate for overturning Morton Salt, for obvious reasons. I think the answer to your question is, under Morton Salt we clearly win, because we -- we probably didn't need to show as much as we did, in terms of the impact of this particular discrimination on our ability to compete in the future. I think we were entitled to a straight inference of that, in terms of the substantial -- or reasonable possibility of injury in the first instance. But, beyond that, I -- you know, you could certainly hold, in this case, that Reeder-Simco has made more than enough of a case in order to recover under the Robinson-Patman Act. But -­",

  "One -­",
  "Well, we -- I mean, we don't rely on it. And part of this -- part of the problem is that it's not -­ that head-to-head item wasn't part of the jury instruction. So, that -- we -- I can't rely on it, in terms of supporting it. If you ask me, outside of the context of this case, would I defend that argument? I probably would try to defend the argument. But it's obviously much tougher when you only have one head-to-head. It's completely different when you're talking about 102 sales-to-sales comparisons over years, with significant differentials, that clearly caused the kind of injury we have here. If there are no further questions, Your Honors, I'd give you back the rest of my time. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It's somewhat startling to me that in a case involving the fundamental question of what notice is due under the Due Process Clause, that the phrase, reasonably calculated to provide notice to the affected property owner, was never used in the petitioner's submission because at least, as I remember Mullane I suppose from my law school days and -- and since then, that is the fundamental test. The question is has the State undertaken to -- to make a reasonable calculation to, in fact, provide notice under these circumstances. It's sort of startling to me in the -- in the face of a decision like this Court wrote in Mennonite Board, where it says explicitly, you know, the minor inconvenience and administrative burden of using the regular mails is a complete answer to claims that something less than that should be provided. And again, petitioner's counsel's first answer to the question, would ordinary mail have been sufficient under these circumstances, is no. For property like this, that's not sufficient. It seems to me that -- that the Dusenbery case answers that because while it was true that the mails that were sent originally to the prison itself were certified, there's no certification process to get the mails --",
  "Well, I mean, that's a pretty remarkable due process constitutional --",
  "I may -- I may let Mr. Feldman defend the -- the Postal Service because he is the Solicitor General's lawyer.",
  "But the reality is that for the vast majority of the mails, the mails do get through. And -- and it is a reasonable calculation that if you mail something to someone --",
  "-- that it will get there and it will be properly delivered. That's the -- the purpose of the certification.",
  "Well, the -- the purpose of using certified mail is to make sure that it actually got to the person --",
  "Well, now it works both ways, though, Mr. Chief Justice, because if -- if it goes to my neighbor -- let's assume numbers are transposed -- it goes to my neighbor and the neighbor is there and sees the information, they'll say that the -- that that's -- that goes to across the street. And then you take it across the street and you get it signed. That's because you talked to a specific individual. So it is, in fact, designed to enhance the likelihood that it will actually get there. But I don't think the issue here is --",
  "And as a matter of policy, I wouldn't necessarily disagree with that.",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "That's exactly what it is. And as I say, as a matter of policy, Justice Breyer, I wouldn't necessarily disagree with it. But as a matter of what the Constitution strait-jackets States to provide, it strikes me as a -- as a pretty extraordinary rule.",
  "Well, if it is, it's probably only at a -- at a marginal number. My guess is --",
  "-- the percentages are very small.",
  "Well, except for this problem -- I mean, the other problem you have is that we don't -- all we know is that it wasn't -- it -- it came back unclaimed. So we don't even know that it didn't get delivered. All we know is that no one was prepared to sign for it and accept it. We don't know, as Justice Breyer's hypothetical --",
  "Well, you could look at the -- you could look at the outside and say, I'm not going to sign for this, and it's unclaimed.",
  "Well, to be sure, I know that it wasn't opened and read, but all I'm saying is that what we don't -- we don't even know --",
  "-- that Justice Breyer is correct.",
  "They didn't receive actual notice. And, of course, this Court has routinely said that there's no constitutional requirement that they receive actual notice.",
  "I -- I think in their reply brief at least, they make an effort, and we didn't go and -- and do a 50-State survey between a week ago and now to find out. But, you know, a fair number of States do. I -- I would say 15, 20.",
  "If it's their homestead, not -- not for every property that is -- for which taxes are not paid, but for --",
  "-- for property -- I'm sorry?",
  "No, Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe that is true because this is not this taxpayer's homestead. He no longer lives at this address. He, as his -- as his argument, spends a great deal of time explaining --",
  "-- he lives elsewhere.",
  "Well, he lives in Arkansas, but that doesn't make this his homestead.",
  "Yes.",
  "So he wouldn't -- he wouldn't qualify for the --",
  "-- for the additional law. But again -- and it seems to me that just demonstrates the wisdom of Justice Brandeis' reference to the small laboratories because what we -- what we have here are a raft of different approaches that the States take to give either more or less notice so long as you satisfy the constitutional minimum. The problem --",
  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Well, in part because we -- we're putting out a notice to the public that we're selling the property. So it serves two purposes. It notifies that there's a sale to take place. It also identifies the landowner, giving -- or the property owner one more opportunity --",
  "On its own, it clearly wouldn't suffice. The Court has decided that a long time -- I mean, that is Mullane. But I think as an -- as an additional component, if you -- if you really want to get into the totality of the circumstances rather than what I think is the better rule, which is to say, as you evaluate what we did, was it reasonably calculated to provide notice, and conclude, yes, it was reasonably calculated to provide notice under this Court's rulings that mailing is an appropriate way to proceed, I think we would win there. If you go beyond that and say, well, no, you have to do something-plus, if you go down the reasonably diligent efforts kind of an approach, I would say then don't go any further than say that you're required to publish the fact of the sale itself because to go beyond that is -- is to open this. And -- and we've already seen this --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "I think if the Court were to say the -- the additional step you must take is to send ordinary mail, we could probably live with that kind of a rule. The problem is, one, that's not the standard that's been proposed here. Their standard is going to be and if it turns out that you find out after that that that didn't get delivered, then you have to go through this litany. You have to -- you have to engage in posting. You have to contact the occupant and contact the relatives, contact their employers, retain a skip tracing service, use the telephone directory, run a credit check, although we don't have Social Security numbers, do an Internet search. And each time when it comes back that there's some indication that you didn't -- that they didn't receive notice, which they'll always say is because -- otherwise for -- for a property that is valuable, if I had received notice, I would have shown up. You have an ongoing, continuing obligation to find --",
  "It sounds like you're legislating, Justice Breyer.",
  "Well, it seems to me, Justice Breyer, you're adopting a rule that's designed to protect a very, very tiny minority and to impose a burden, a significant burden, on every State.",
  "And -- and the flip side of that is there's nothing that indicates why even -- even the person -- if somebody is unwilling to go -- to take the time to find out what the Commissioner of Lands in the State has sent a certified letter for, why is it -- why would you assume that whenever the letter comes in when it's addressed to Mr. Jones, that Mrs. Jones isn't going to toss it aside just as quickly?",
  "There's no -- there's nothing that indicates one way or the other what -- what is a preferable system to operate. And that's why I think this is intensely a legislative judgement.",
  "They do. That -- that's --",
  "Right. That -- that's always --",
  "Yes. That --",
  "Well, I mean, I don't want -- I don't want to fight the hypothetical, but you have to put a little in context in a case like this because the process here is one that's fairly protracted. You get the first notice and then there's not -- there's no actual sale for 2 years. And in this case, the sale didn't take place, so there was -- you know, the auction didn't lead to anything, and then there was another -- another sale. So we're talking about essentially a 3-year period of time when the person has to be incapacitated, during which presumably -- and there have been multiple, six different efforts to try to send notice to her. So it's, you know, one, not a particularly likely hypothetical. I realize I shouldn't fight it. But two, I think at the end of the day, the answer is you can't put the burden on the State to understand the -- the precise situation of each of the individual homeowners, that they have some duties because they know, one, they do owe taxes; two, in Arkansas they should know that they owe us a duty to keep us up-to-date with respect to their situation, and where -- and where it is that we can reach them. And so it's reasonable to impose those duties --",
  "-- because in the vast majority of cases -- I'm sorry -- due process will be satisfied because notice will, in fact, be received.",
  "That's correct, because -- because the difficulty is once you go past that, what -- what obligation you have becomes completely unknowable at that stage.",
  "Well, and that's -- that --",
  "Justice Stevens, the truth is most of them -- we do. And -- and this is not a -- and -- and look at the way the system operates here. It's not like we -- we sent out this notice, got back, and raced off to sell the property with a gotcha in hand. I mean, we -- we went through a very protracted process each time trying to get this person to -- to show up. I mean, put this into a certain amount of context. And again, you have to deal with the generality of cases rather than this one, but I mean, this is a property that's got a tax lien on it already for unpaid income taxes of -- of approximately, I think, about $14,000, and then it has unpaid property taxes, you know, up to the -- up to the total amount of $200. And you know, under those circumstances, we let it sit there for years. I mean, there's no question we would be better served if -- if they would have shown up and just paid off the taxes. But it seems to me that all goes into the calculation of what's the right answer as a legislative matter, and legislatures have made pretty reasonable adjustments in terms of, you know, how strong is -- I mean, I think what Arkansas did here. If this is your homestead, we're going to go just as far as you said, Justice Stevens, to try to make sure we get the information to you.",
  "If it's not, then we're not -- I'm sorry.",
  "Oh, I think absolutely because it's significantly undermines the State's overall effort in trying to get its money back because it's all well and good to say we can sell the property, but if nobody is going to pay for the property anything that comes close to the value of even getting our liens paid off, then we're not going to get the revenue stream that we would otherwise be entitled to. And even if you, you know, go through the -- through the kind of machinations of --",
  "That assumes that there's a -- that there's a purchaser that wants to undertake the burden and -- and to assume that risk.",
  "I mean, we couldn't sell this the first time out.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it's worth taking at least 2 seconds to focus on the market value argument here, this $80,000 number. That was a number that arises in connection with the supersedeas bond, and it's only a number that came forward by the private loan -- property purchaser, not the State. And the reason was, was because they said, if you don't put up an $80,000 bond, we want to take over the property immediately. And so they had every incentive to say a number that was significantly higher than what the value of this property is. The best evidence of what the value of this property is is around the $20,000 that a real purchaser put on the table in order to purchase it. The point here --",
  "I'd be willing to stipulate to that, Mr. Chief Justice, but the truth is nobody showed up even for an auction on this property. So we don't have much in the way of evidence as to the value of it. And all I'm saying is the suggestion of -- of $80,000 as the relevant number here is a number that's picked out of the air for a purpose that has nothing to do with fair market value. It has to do with the value of a -- of a bond that would have to be issued in order to stop the transfer of possession of the property in the ejectment action.",
  "Well, it has to be -- I think it has to be a minimum that, but you know, it could be 100 percent of the fair market value.",
  "Right, but it could also be 100 percent.",
  "So you don't know. And -- and in his brief, his argument was that we -- that there was a stipulation to the $80,000.",
  "Exactly. That -- that's the only point I was trying to make on that score.",
  "I think I would still make the same argument. I just think the argument has extraordinary force when the -- when the petitioner has an obligation to provide us with notice because, again, it goes -- you know, why is this reasonably calculated? It's -- it's in the context of a scheme that says you will provide us specific information and we will rely upon that as the mechanism by which we inform you of your obligations to us and that under those circumstances and only those circumstances, do you forfeit your property rights.",
  "The -- the only reason he would know that duty is because every -- every property tax form has on it a change of address at the very bottom of it that's perforated. So every time you get a tax form, you get a thing that says change your -- let me know if you've changed your address.",
  "The -- the statute talks about costs, but the State has never interpreted that term to mean just sort of the out-of-pocket -- those kinds of inchoate costs, and they usually talk about very specific costs like the cost of noticing publication and other -- you know, other items that you can -- you know, where you have a receipt.",
  "In practice the answer is no. If there are no other questions, Your Honors, I urge the Court to affirm.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The fundamental question that's posed in this particular case is whether or not the court of appeals by adopting a rule that declares categorically that three out of the four traditional factors for deciding whether or not to grant permanent injunctive relief will be irrebuttably presumed to be satisfied whenever a jury has found that a patent is valid and has been infringed. The rule in the Federal Circuit for at least 20 years has been that if you have validity and infringement decided by the jury, that then there is inadequate remedy at law, and that the balance of harms decidedly favors the plaintiff, and that the only issue circumstance is a heightened scrutiny on the standard of whether or not the -- the public interest commands that an injunction be denied in a particular case. And even in that context, the Federal Circuit's rule is extraordinarily stringent because not just any public interest can -- will satisfy, but instead, it has to be a public interest that endangers the public health.",
  "That -- that is precise -- I think it's the only way to read Judge Bryson's decision, Justice Ginsburg, where the court says, at page 26a, that a permanent injunction will issue once infringement and validity have been adjudged, and then say, to be sure, it will not be so to protect the public interest. And we all know the traditional rule with respect to the grant of injunctive relief is that it's a four-factor test.",
  "Well, the point is that if an infringement, then that means that there has to be -- there has to be irreparable injury, inadequate remedy in -- in favor of the plaintiff. And then the only issue that remains is whether or not the public interest justifies not granting an injunction under the circumstances of this case. It seems to me there's no other way to read that. And if you read it in the context of the -- of the previous 20 years of decisions from the Federal Circuit, it is absolutely clear. We don't have the opportunity to come back as a defendant in an infringement action and say, Your Honor, in the specific facts of this case, this is someone for whom money damages is a completely adequate remedy. And -- and it seems to me quite clear that section 283 is designed to be exactly the opposite of the way the Federal Circuit has interpreted this -- this scheme. Section 283 says explicitly -- and this is at page 1 of the blue brief -- district courts, quote, may -- not shall -- grant injunctions in accordance with principles of equity. And principles of equity, as Justice Story said almost 200 years ago, systematically reject the idea that you will act on a or withdraw the injunctive relief in -- in particular circumstances. And to the contrary, you have to look And in that regard --",
  "Right. And -- and Congress already made the -- the balance, Justice Scalia, with respect to that because Congress obviously identified the property right as the right to exclude. And then Congress did not confer upon the district courts no discretion to act in -- in a situation where the property right has been violated. Instead, Congress discretion. To be sure, in the ordinary case, you -- you very well may have irreparable injury proved, but and any specific facts of the case and instead not only presume it, which I think is a mistake, although the district court did that and found that in this case the presumption was rebutted, but to -- but to say irrebuttably it's presumed that you have irreparable injury, irrebuttably presumed that you don't have an adequate remedy at law, and irrebuttably presume that the balance of equities tilt in favor of the plaintiff. And that, it seems to me, cannot be squared with the language of the statute. And, indeed, on that score, the United States sort of magically ends up on our side of the -- of the table because the United States says the same thing. There is no way --",
  "I don't know of any. I mean, have to I guess is the way I would respond to that.",
  "That's precisely what this case involves.",
  "Well, I don't know that there are a whole lot of them like that, but the one thing that -- I mean, there are two things to think about the property concept in the statute. First of all, Congress does not declare that the property interest here is a real property interest, which traditionally has been protected differently. It's a personal property interest, which is traditionally given -- accorded less protection under this kind of a scheme. And so there -- and -- and again, Congress in any event struck the balance. It didn't say, as it could have, that there is presumed -- didn't say, as it could have, that we shall have a -- shall have either a presumption or an injunction in any here, it seems to --",
  "I think in those cases, the irreparable injury and the inadequacy of the remedy at law will be -- will be easy to demonstrate, as they have been for hundreds of years. The -- the fundamental difference -- this is important to have this in mind. The Federal Circuit adopted this rule of law some 20 years ago. That's before the high-tech boom, before the explosion in the number of patents. And so the opportunity to deal with these issues on an individualized basis that might give rise to some kinds of rules that you could, in fact, apply to the generality of cases based on an experience has never been there. We have been dealing with an -- has completely stultified the ability to develop any of those kinds of rules. this point is to say, no, enough is enough. We need to go back to a time where the -- go back to the language of the statute, confer the discretion on the district courts. And it's important not just for a case like this one, but it -- but it distorts tremendously the settlement value and the process and the relationship between the patent holder and all of the potential licensees because we're in a -- in a world -- and I don't think the Court can ignore this because it's in the amicus briefs. We're in a world where if a patent holder files a lawsuit in Marshall, Texas, no patent has ever been declared invalid in that jurisdiction, and no patent has ever been found not to infringe. And then you take that finding automatically and you turn it into an injunction. Any person who has been threatened under those circumstances and told that we're going to face a lawsuit in Marshall, Texas is going to have a very different negotiating posture than in a situation where --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, I think the -- the market will take care of the problem. The question is under what standards are you going to apply. Are you going to say that there is no effective check on the jury system, that it goes automatically from a jury's finding to injunctive relief, or are you going to implement it against the backdrop of what Congress specifically provides, which is that the district courts should exercise equitable discretion in deciding how best to proceed. the district court exercising equitable discretion without a close review by the Federal Circuit is just handle, that is, you get a tremendous disparity among district judges. I don't know that it's only in Marshall, Texas that you have a tilt in one direction or in the other. So the Federal Circuit is put there not to say that the district judges have no discretion, but to try to rein it in somewhat so that you won't have wide disparities, which you very well might have if you just say discretion to the district judges and very light review on appeal.",
  "But, Justice Ginsburg, the -- the problem with that is that that's not the scheme that Congress created with respect to the remedial aspects of -- of the patent laws. I mean, it is surely the case that Congress meant, as -- as substantive patent law is generally enforced and implemented, that the Federal Circuit would play a significant role in ensuring some kind of uniformity, but Congress didn't then go the extra step and say, and when it comes time to decide whether or not injunctive relief ought to be granted, that it will -- that we will presume it or that we will deal with it in a categorical way. and with good reason because district --",
  "Well, I don't know that I need a wide-ranging allowance with respect to this. What I need is elimination of the irrebuttable presumption that doesn't allow any consideration of whether money damages are adequate in a particular case. And -- and here, it's very important to focus. The -- the district judge didn't just say, I woke up this morning and I felt really good about the defendant, and therefore, I'm not granting an injunction. The district court here said, I'm making specific findings of fact with regard to the adequacy of money damages to deal --",
  "Well, that's --",
  "That's -- that's not precisely what he said, Mr. Chief Justice. What he said was that business method patents stand on a somewhat different footing because they're subject --",
  "Right.",
  "I think probably, at the end of the day, it wouldn't be, but the bottom line is that he did that in the context of analyzing the public interest consideration and he said that didn't --",
  "-- tilt in favor.",
  "Sure. And --",
  "I should know that actually, but --",
  "But, Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I think you can -- it's -- it's not fair to pick apart each one of his findings and say does that finding good enough or is that finding enough. The truth is the district court made a series of four findings that overlap, and one of which was, obviously, he doesn't -- he doesn't practice this patent. He also doesn't effectively license. He's willing to license his patent to eBay. He's willing to license this patent to anybody under these circumstances.",
  "And candidly, most of the I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.",
  "I -- I think in -- in a proper case -- and I don't think you do it under the -- under the public interest analysis. I think you'd probably end up doing it under the balance of the hardships. But in any event -- and -- and what you -- you know, obviously, this case is -- is more complicated because --",
  "Well, I -- I mean, there's plenty left because he doesn't practice this invention. He has no intention of practicing this invention beyond the receipt of money. Money damages are a completely adequate remedy under these particular circumstances, given -- given especially the fact that this is not a situation where he proposes to continue to infringe. We propose to work around it, but if the damages and all of the deterrent power that that has, plus the possibility, obviously, down the road that the district court could, on a rule 54 motion, now come back and say, well, no, now I've decided that injunctive relief is warranted under these circumstances.",
  "But -- but we're not asking for a compulsory license because it is not our intention, going forward, to infringe this patent. We've made it very clear to the district court and the district court recognizes that we not only intend to but have, in fact, implemented a design-around or a work-around to this particular patent. And that's what we expect will happen. So we're not asking for the right to continue to infringe and a willingness to Our concern -- and this does go to the business method patent because it does go to the -- to know where the line is going to be drawn. That's why the district court said specifically, you know, there's going to be unending litigation on this because it's very difficult to define the metes and bounds of this particular patent, and we're going to have to fight over that, so that the traditional reason for injunctive relief, which is to bring peace, isn't available in this case. We're not going to have peace under these circumstances. And when you have that situation and you have the kind of uncertainty, not because of business method patents generally -- that's -- that's where I was I think probably giving up too much immediately. I don't think the fact of a business method patent is per se a problem, but I think analyzing the specific business method patent and its uncertainty is a legitimate consideration for the district court to take into account in deciding whether or not, in a particular circumstance, we are better off saying, pay the plaintiff the money for the past injury, let's see how the work-around develops, and take it into account, but",
  "Well, of course, the consequences of the -- of the process are significantly different because, obviously, the remedies for -- for contempt are significantly more draconian than -- than just a finding of a -- of a violation. But more -- more important than that, Justice Kennedy --",
  "Well, and the reality is the district court already looked at this and said that it -- it is the district court's judgment that they're going to require full infringement trials. I mean, that was the finding it made with respect to the appeals nor the -- nor the Respondent in this case has -- has challenged that particular finding. So the determination that that's not -- that process is either not available or not practical in the context of this particular case, which of course, goes back to why it's important to make sure that you look at each of these cases on their individual facts rather than across the board on a -- on these -- on an irrebuttable presumption basis. The -- the additional point that I think it's important I at least spend a minute on, because the Court asked for us to deal with Continental Paper Bag, is that it does seem to me quite clear that, at least at this stage, the parties are pretty much in sync, that -- that the Court need not revisit Continental Paper Bag. The holding in that case is actually almost a sort of quintessential situation where you have two participants in the market, one of whom would like to take advantage of a patent that will improve that participant's ability to produce a product. The patent holder is not ready yet to develop that product using that particular method and, therefore, sues to stop his competitor from entering into that market. I mean, -- you know, where you -- where you've got the potential infringer is looking at what's going on and implement it. And the Court said, under those circumstances, you get an injunction. But here, of course, we're dealing with a vastly different situation, as we -- as we point out that -- in our brief, where the -- at page 9 where the district court specifically found that not any of eBay's success is attributable to anything in the patents of the plaintiff in this case and that nothing in the patents that were put forward by the plaintiff in this case provide any basis on which anyone could build a business model. So this is, to my mind, the antithesis of the situation in Continental Paper Bag. But in any event, the holding there is clearly not implicated here. It's been codified by Congress. There's no basis for the Court to reconsider it. To the extent that there is -- is dicta in there that talks about the right to exclude, Justice Scalia, I think, in general, the right to exclude is one that you do, in fact, enforce with injunctive relief in many cases, but the question here is whether that says you -- you enforce it in every case irrebuttably as to three of the four factors, and as to requiring the plaintiff to show that there's a -- an imminent public health crisis. Under those circumstances, it seems to me the Court should reverse the court of appeals. And, indeed, if there were ever a case in which the Court ought to uphold the district court on a -- under the abuse of discretion standard, it is this case.",
  "Because the -- because Congress didn't dictate that he gets that leverage in every situation. And -- and it's quite possible that the -- there are going to be a lot of situations. And the Solicitor General's brief identifies four of them in which an inventor, who doesn't plan to practice the schemes that create all kinds of interrelationships among the way the patent is going to be developed, and easily justify injunctive relief in precisely the kind of case that you pose, Mr. Chief Justice. But that's not this case.",
  "Right. But again, you've licensed it and there are certain rights that, obviously, arise out of the licensing. None of these factors is alone, I don't believe, sufficient to say you don't get injunctive relief. But I think what the district court said, and I think that this is why the Court ought to affirm the district court's under -- under an abuse of discretion standard, which never been applied to this case -- what the Court should say is, look, and where you have no practicing of the invention by the inventor, where you have a complete willingness specifically, and where you've never sought preliminary injunctive relief, under all of those -- and where -- be drawn, there's no benefit to be had by -- in the way of trying to eliminate the amount of litigation on an ongoing basis, under all of those circumstances, all of which the district court identified, then it's not appropriate to grant injunctive relief. We'll allow enhanced damages in the interim and even the potential down the road, obviously, of -- of an injunction to serve as enough of a deterrent to protect the right to exclude that the plaintiff has under the statute.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes, I think -- I think I simply that you don't practice the invention. It's that you're not in the market itself because that's -- that's the Continental Paper Bag case. You know, in Continental Paper Bag, they don't want to -- they don't want to practice the invention either because they want to hold it back in order to be able effectively to use it. If they had wanted to license it, that would have made sense too. But this is not a competitor in the market. If they were a -- it seems to me you have a much better claim to a need to occupy space. That's what the injunction is trying to say. This is my space. I want to occupy it. But if you choose not to occupy it, it's not to say that you abandon your right to an injunction, but that that ought to be a legitimate, individualized consideration, among other considerations --",
  "Well, if you didn't license it -- and actually we have no relevant licenses here too that ought to count in the mix. Again, it's not -- I'm not looking for a presumption the other way and I'm not if you're a nonperforming entity, that you don't get a license, or even if you're a troll, as that term gets bandied around, that you're never entitled to a -- to an injunction.",
  "For my clients, it's been the scary thing under the bridge, but --",
  "Yes, I believe that's the -- I think that's what -- what it is, although you -- maybe we should think of it more as Orks, now that we have a new generation, but at this point troll is the word that gets -- that gets used. If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, Your Honors.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is no more vexing set of issues in the employment discrimination context than arise out of issues of retaliation under section 704 of title VII. As the Solicitor General's brief and a couple of the other amici briefs point out, the number of -- the number of these claims has increased by more than 100 percent over the course of the last decade, more than 30 percent of the EEOC's docket is now made up of retaliation claims, and the cost of an average contested retaliation claim exceeds $130,000 per case. Plainly, this is a fundamentally important question, and the standard to be applied under section 704 is critically important to both employers and employees. And the Respondent has given you truly a choice and not a shadow in this particular case because the Respondent's analysis of section 704, based essentially on the language, any discrimination, is that everything that is in any sense against an employee, any act of retaliation, no matter how trivial, is nevertheless a basis for a section 704 lawsuit. This is a position that's embraced by none of her supporting amici. It's a position that's been embraced by no court of appeals up until this point, and it is a position that is utterly untethered in the relationship between section 704 and its language and section 703, which is the heart and soul of the anti - discrimination norms in title VII.",
  "Not -- not that broad -- no, not even the EEOC in its most aggressive interpretation, which obviously the United States has rejected in this case, ever went to the point of saying any. And I'll give you a good illustration of that because in the guidelines, the commission always said that in a situation where there was absolutely no question of retaliation, charge filed against a supervisor, supervisor disinvites an employee to lunch, a lunch that's held with all the other employees -- it has always been the position of the -- of the EEOC that in that circumstance, that would not be enough to raise even a fact issue to go to a jury on. Under the Respondent's theory of this case, it is clear to me that being disinvited to a lunch would, in fact, be a basis for a Federal lawsuit under section 704. So there is no one, neither governmental nor nongovernmental, that has embraced the extreme position that the Respondent has put forward under section 704. And indeed, it's very difficult for me to understand why Congress would ever have adopted a rule that was more protective of those against whom -- against -- where retaliation takes place as opposed to the core of who was protected by section 703, which is the people who are in the protected class in the first instance. To adopt the rule, I think, of the Respondent in this case would not only increase the number of claims another 100 percent, at least, in the future, but it seems to me would render completely meaningless the observation of this Court in Weber that management prerogatives are to be left undisturbed to the greatest extent possible. There are no management prerogatives once an employee has filed a complaint under -- and, therefore, is protected under section 704. At that point, everything becomes essentially a straitjacket problem. I don't think there's a rationale to support that interpretation, and so therefore the question is, what is the right standard under section 704? And here, it seems to me the United States and Burlington Northern are on exactly the same page. We believe that this Court announced the appropriate standard under section 703 in dealing with harassment cases. That's the Ellerth standard, and we believe that the Ellerth standard is the proper one for defining a tangible employment action.",
  "Right. Justice Scalia, this Court has also said that that negative pregnant has never been used as an overarching interpretive guide. You have to evaluate 703 and 704 in tandem, and it seems much easier to interpret 704 as simply using discrimination against as a shorthand for the wide range of discriminations that are outlined in section 703. It seems quite cumbersome, at a minimum, and probably worse if Congress were to actually sit down and try to rewrite every aspect of 703 in order simply to say in addition to the protected classes that 703 protects, there is certain conduct under 704 that we protect in exactly the same way that we protect --",
  "They could have said it that way, but it seems to me quite clear that Congress still intended for 703 and 704 to be interpreted in pari materia. And -- and again, you -- you still run into the same problem, Justice Scalia, as to why is it that Congress would want to protect more thoroughly 704 plaintiffs than it would 703 plaintiffs. And it seems to me there's no --",
  "That would be -- that would be the question.",
  "Well, I will tell you, Justice Breyer, that the -- at least one of the problems with that is that the EEOC's guidelines expressly state that that is not a claim that's actionable under section 704.",
  "That would fit under the EEOC's definition, although I don't think it's an answer to Justice Breyer's hypothetical --",
  "-- that was talking the big power lunch.",
  "No, not under my -- no, that's not necessarily the case, Justice Ginsburg. In my -- you know, there are two standards under -- under an adverse employment action. The first one is whether there's a tangible action, and that's the Ellerth standard. And then there's always the pervasive and severe standard, so that if you have -- you know, being routinely excluded rises to the level of pervasive or severe, that would still be actionable under 704 in exactly the same way that that's actionable under 703.",
  "And -- and does it on a pervasive basis, sustained and pervasive basis.",
  "Well, I think you probably have a jury question at some point, depending on how long it went on for because it would become -- it would become a pervasive practice. And under those circumstances, this Court has a rule that allows that to become a jury issue. But if it's only once or twice, it strikes me that that's not a particular problem.",
  "Well, the -- the reason why that's not a problem is that there is no economic effect that attaches to not working on the forklift for a year or for 10 years. The -- the proof in this case is absolutely clear.",
  "But that was not the -- but the -- but she didn't get hired as a forklift operator. She was hired as a track laborer, Justice Kennedy.",
  "Well, there's -- there's no question that there's a jury finding of retaliation. The question is whether or not this is a tangible employment action.",
  "Justice Souter, let me -- in the first place, it's not a very practical hypothetical because, one, when you -- when you define your job positions --",
  "Well, one, she wasn't typically picking up steel rails with her bare hands. All of this stuff is done mechanically. She was pulling nails out of rails periodically. So I'm not sure that that's precisely the way to characterize it. But the -- but at the end of the day, it still seems to me that what Ellerth tells you you should look at is primarily whether there is a -- a direct economic effect. And if there is no direct economic effect, then what you ought to be looking for is whether or not the -- the conduct is severe or pervasive, and -- and if it is --",
  "-- then, it seems to me, there's a separate action. But that's not the claim she brought in this case.",
  "No, I don't think it can be the only criterion. I think that you would have a situation -- and a lot of times the -- the economic effect will be either immediate or potentially indirect in the sense of the hypothetical the commission uses in its guidelines where a butcher is shifted over to be a cashier. And in that situation, that's a fundamentally different job with a fundamentally different career path. And it may not have any economic effects in the short run, but in the long run, it will have. And that may be an answer in part to your question, Justice Souter, about just one big job classification that --",
  "Right. That's a quid pro quo violation.",
  "This Court held in -- in Ellerth that those kinds of quid pro quos are -- are subject to liability.",
  "Right, because the employer -- I mean, employers aren't going to --",
  "-- adopt that kind of a standard. I'm sorry, Justice Stevens?",
  "Well, in that -- you know, in -- under those circumstances, it seems to me that the standard is slightly different for quid pro quo violations than they are for simply tangible employment actions.",
  "It -- right, because the -- there are -- I mean, they are all adverse employment actions. There's a tangible employment action. There's a quid pro quo action, and then there's the --",
  "No. I -- I don't believe so because I'm -- I'm -- what I'm trying to do at least is to apply the Ellerth standard under 703 for each of the three elements in the same way that I'm trying to apply them under 704.",
  "Well, I think that if -- if you could certainly envision a circumstance -- and again, this goes to the pervasiveness of it. It's -- it's a fundamental, sort of constructive adjustment of your employment situation. Terms and conditions is a fairly capacious term, Justice Scalia, and I could well imagine that if you were being systematically treated differently and differently from every other employee --",
  "-- then at some point it becomes severe or pervasive in a way that -- that, it would seem to me, would raise a jury trial issue.",
  "Going to lunch once, no.",
  "Going to lunch twice, I'm sure not. But, you know, if it is a continuous process, at some point it strikes me that it would become somewhat problematic. Yes.",
  "But -- and that is why it's important, and it goes back to Justice Breyer's question, if I can go back to that for a second, because he asked about the D.C. Circuit's opinion, which, you know, of course, adopted the EEOC's now- discredited theory of this case and, again, untethers 703 from 704. That's the problem with the D.C. Circuit's interpretation.",
  "I suspect you could, actually.",
  "Right.",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Justice Breyer --",
  "-- I mean, you can ask Mr. Garre what his view is with respect to the waiting on the position of the Solicitor General here. But it still seems to me that there is a fundamental difference between the way the D.C. Circuit is analyzing this case and -- and the way this Court analyzed it Ellerth. And the fundamental difference is -- I agree with you. There are other circumstances that are not tangible employment actions that are, nevertheless, actionable under both 703 and 704, but those are -- those are taken care of under the Meritor standards. The -- the assumption is that they are both retaliatory in purpose and that they are severe or pervasive.",
  "When you reach that standard, then you create a question of fact for the jury.",
  "I doubt it actually, Justice Ginsburg, because I think typically mere inconveniences, even -- even significant inconveniences, have traditionally been rejected as bases for taking an issue to the jury.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, every one of these cases is based on the assumption that the only reason it was done is because of retaliation.",
  "The lunch is in exactly the same position.",
  "So that can't be the standard.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, if you adopt the other approach, what you say is that every change in assignments within the ordinary course of business is subject to claim by a plaintiff --",
  "-- in any situation --",
  "-- where he or she thinks she's been retaliated against.",
  "And -- and again, the problem with that legal standard, Justice Ginsburg, is it is not the same one that applies under section 703, and it seems to me there's no reason to provide greater protections under 704 to plaintiffs than you would have under section 703.",
  "Pervasive.",
  "I mean, to be sure, that's a possibility -- that's a possible answer.",
  "But it could be severe enough.",
  "Right, but the question is, is it severe, I think, to that person? I think that is the Meritor standard, is, is it severe to the individual plaintiff?",
  "Right. Well, that's because that's the tangible employment aspect of it. Justice Scalia says you're right about -- well, I don't know if he said I'm right about the tangible -- tangible employment aspect of it. But he says, you know, as you recognize, there is a second category of claims, and the second category of claims is the Meritor standard, which I've been arguing for.",
  "It -- it probably depends on whether or not it was the expectation of the -- of the employee that -- that he or she would have a certain set of hours, because an awful lot of employees take a job with the expectation that they'll work any hours. Now, you may get into a particular pattern and -- and even set yourself up for that, but if -- if the expectation is that you were going to work potentially 24 hours and you shift from one set to another, that I don't think is a change in terms and conditions of employment within the meaning of 703. If I could just shift slightly to the suspension, pending investigation, part of the case. And there are two parts, and it's important to recognize that if the Court sets aside either one of those claims, then we're entitled to a new trial because the damages flow directly from both and there was no specific -- there was no special verdict in this case to identify what -- where the damages come from. And our argument with respect to the suspension, pending investigation, is that there was simply no final action taken by the employer in this context until 15 days later. She was suspended for insubordination by her supervisor. Under the collective bargaining agreement, all she had to do was send in a letter. If she didn't want to send in a letter, the -- the decision would become final and there would be final action that's clearly subject to a claim under section 704. She did send in a letter. There was an informal investigation. The informal investigation concluded that there was no basis for suspending her for insubordination, and she was reinstated with complete back pay.",
  "Except that it was all -- it was -- it was reinstated.",
  "There is official action.",
  "Right, but then the question still remains, Justice Scalia, for it to be a tangible employment action, is it -- is it available to the employer to cure, when the purpose of this entire statutory scheme is to avoid litigation and to provide informal mechanisms for protecting the rights of the employee.",
  "Right.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, there still remains the core question of whether this is a tangible employment action. It's not a long-term action. It's not an economic effect, and the fact of -- of anxiety -- that happens all the time in the work place. It's not actionable.",
  "But she did something about it, and it was corrected, Your Honor. I'd like to --",
  "To be sure. And the question is, can you cure it? And that's the fundamental issue we ask you to decide. Can I reserve the balance of my time?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me begin by focusing on the jury instruction in this case. The jury was not instructed with the Ellerth standard. There's a variant of the Ellerth standard, and it was not upheld by the court of appeals on the Ellerth standard. What the court of appeals said was in the Sixth Circuit there is a unique circumstances standard that arises out of its particular way of analyzing these issues, and under that standard, it could be upheld. And that was the same basis on which the district court at Pet. App. 118a upheld this particular verdict. So the question of the right standard to be applied and whether a reasonable jury could find it under these circumstances, Justice Scalia, is clearly presented in this case, and it's an issue that this Court still has to decide. Second, with respect to the suspension, the -- the collective bargaining agreement specifically provides for discipline and then 15 days. It's not a final decision. There's nothing in that collective bargaining agreement that says it's a decision of the employer. To the contrary, the decision at the end of the -- of the investigation is the decision of the carrier. And we don't need a final employer action standard in order to prevail on this. What we need is the opportunity to cure and a reasonable way under -- under section 704, as the D.C. Circuit held specifically in Taylor. And then finally, with respect to the observation about, you know, don't make any per se rules, well, the truth is there aren't going to be any per se rules. There will be a lot of cases that get dismissed out under a tangible employment action theory because there aren't tangible employment actions. But there will always be available the severe and -- and pervasive standard, which is always going to constrain any employer from -- from adopting those kinds of policies. And the point that counsel made is that he recommends to every one of his employees -- he probably should recommend two things. One, you show up. You ought to file a complaint about discrimination in the work place because under his approach, you will, therefore, be super-protected under section 704 in a way you wouldn't have been by merely being protected under 703. That cannot possibly be what Congress intended or what is helpful for the work place. The Court should reject that approach, should reject the Sixth Circuit's view, and remand. Thank you, Your Honors.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves the somewhat murky concept of an association-in-fact enterprise within the meaning of section 1961(4) of title 18, which is the RICO statute, and actually the specific language in this case, which is reproduced in the Petitioner's brief at page 2, is a group of individuals associated in fact. In this case, there are two fairly obvious enterprises that one might have expected a plaintiff to identify in this -- in its -- in their complaint. The first one is Mohawk Industries, which is their employer. That is a corporation, clearly eligible to serve as an enterprise. But, of course, the problem is if you identify Mohawk as the -- as the enterprise, you then cannot sue Mohawk as the person under this Court's decision in Kushner. And so Mohawk was an unattractive enterprise under -- on that -- because of that reason. Second, there are the recruiting and temporary agencies which are likely corporations and certainly are legal entities and, again, are eligible to be enterprises within the meaning of the statute. But, again, here the problem is that there is no indication that Mohawk in any way directs or conducts the affairs of those agencies, and therefore, under this Court's explicit holding in Reves, there would no -- there would be no basis for liability. And so the plaintiffs have attempted to sort of move around those two substantial obstacles to stating a claim by laying the claim to what is called an association-in-fact enterprise. Their complaint at paragraph 76, which is on page 23 of the joint appendix, states this fairly broadly. Mohawk has participated in an association-in-fact enterprise with third party employment agencies and other recruiters. The question is what is this enterprise and does it have legs for purposes of bringing a RICO action. In analyzing that question, it seems to me there are two subissues within that. The first one is whether or not the language of section 1961(4) precludes using the corporation as part of an association-in-fact enterprise because 1961(4) explicitly -- or specifically refers to individuals, and everyone has recognized, including I think the Respondents and the United States, that if -- if it were clear that association-in-fact enterprises or that enterprises limited to individuals under these circumstances, given the structure of the statute, the corporation would not be permissibly brought in on this particular theory. So you have to get past whether or not that is a limiting principle under this definition.",
  "Justice Scalia, the -- the answer -- a couple answers. First of all, obviously, we could not have raised this before the -- either the district court or the court of appeals because the law was absolutely settled in the Eleventh Circuit.",
  "As it is in nine other circuits.",
  "To be sure.",
  "Right. But the second -- but the question is not -- the question is whether or not that issue is fairly subsumed within the question that was actually presented, and that --",
  "The -- the question presented in this case -- and it's the same question that was presented below -- is whether the defendant corporation and its agents under these circumstances can constitute an enterprise.",
  "To be sure. But the --",
  "But, Justice Scalia, the in light of certainly raises the secondary issue, but it's still -- I mean, the rule is whether it's fairly subsumed within the question. And it is a logically prior question whether or not the statute extends to this particular situation.",
  "But the situation that's presented here is identical to the situation that existed in McNally v. United States, Justice Scalia. In that case, the question was whether or not an intangible rights theory of mail fraud could be extended to include nongovernment officials. That was the specific question presented in that case, and that's the -- the question the Court granted. And every court of appeals had interpreted that statute to say that intangible rights theories are valid under that statute. And -- and that issue was not adverted to in the petition, and it was briefed in this Court --",
  "-- and it was regarded as fairly subsumed just as --",
  "I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "I -- I don't have any specific authority to the contrary, although the other side didn't argue 1292(b) as in some sense a limitation here. And I don't see anything in this Court's rules which broadly authorize the Court to grant certiorari to any question that's fairly subsumed within the question presented. And it is a totally artificial inquiry to sit here and say, you know, how are we going to analyze what is --",
  "Right.",
  "The -- the clause that introduces that is under current law, and that's absolutely true in the Eleventh Circuit. Under current law, as it existed in the Eleventh Circuit when we wrote that, there was no question that a corporation can be included within an association-in-fact enterprise. Therefore, all we were doing was conceding what the state of the law was in the Eleventh Circuit and not questioning that, as -- as, candidly, we had no ability to do that. It would have been an utterly futile gesture to have raised this issue at any point prior to. We could have raised it in the petition for certiorari, to be sure. We -- we think it is fairly subsumed within the question presented, and we also think it would be an -- an utterly artificial exercise to try to analyze what is an association-in-fact enterprise without first deciding whether or not a corporation could be included in the first instance because, as Justice Scalia says, if they can't, then it seems to me this is a substantially easier question, and also it is an extraordinarily important one. It is true that the courts of appeals have lined up consistently on the other side of this issue, but it is equally true that none of them has analyzed this issue with anything near the kind of care that would at least give me comfort that they've finally and fully resolved the issue. And we're not going to get a more thorough vetting of it at this point because the circuits are -- are at this -- at this stage essentially lined up. So the right time and opportunity for the Court is here.",
  "But all of those courts are going to say the same thing, which is that this issue has been resolved. It's possible, presumably, you might get an en banc review on it, but again, you don't have the question -- you don't have a split anywhere other than some district court decisions that have -- that have recognized our interpretation. The issue is squarely posed here at this point. It's been fully briefed for this Court.",
  "Yes, that's true.",
  "Because all of those various combinations can still be attacked under the theory of RICO by just simply structuring your -- your enterprise in the proper way. It is true you can't broaden it. You can't expand the enterprise definition in order to include a variety of different elements, but there's no way -- I mean, in this case, for instance, they could have named Mohawk as the enterprise. They could have named the -- the recruiting agencies as the enterprise. They could have named the corporate officers as the enterprise, and they could have dealt with all of them as a conspiracy. And all of those are ways to get at precisely the issues that you identify, Justice Breyer.",
  "And the answer --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, a partnership is identified specifically under the statute as a -- as a -- as an enterprise -- as eligible for an enterprise.",
  "That's correct. That wouldn't be this particular --",
  "Well, no. If we were a partnership, it couldn't be in an enterprise with -- with an association of individuals. The question is --",
  "-- does -- can you have an associational enterprise that extends beyond individuals, that gets -- that goes beyond the gangs and their family.",
  "Yes, let me be clear on this, that if -- if you just bring an action against the partnership qua partnership you could clearly do that because that's defined as a -- as a legal entity --",
  "-- for purposes -- if you're trying to take the partnership and tag it to another group of rag-tag individuals, that would not be an enterprise in fact because that's not an -- an association of individuals. It's a partnership which has an entity apart from the individuals. Now, if you disaggregated all of the individuals within the partnership and called them individuals and said that they group with another group of individuals, then, yes. I think if you could demonstrate that there is the loose organization, common purpose, and all of the requirements for having an association-in-fact available, sure, that wouldn't be any problem.",
  "Because --",
  "No. Well, because what they have -- you have to go back to the original list. The list starts off with individuals, corporations, partnerships, associations, and other legal entities, unions, which is in addition to that because it's not a legal entity, or at least there was case law at the time --",
  "-- that it's not a legal entity. And then other associations.",
  "Right. This is just a union.",
  "Right.",
  "It's just an additional item in the list.",
  "Because I think they viewed those as absolutely synonymous, Justice Alito, and -- and the reason I think that is because we know that in some instances they use including but not limited to, which reflects that Congress recognized that includes in some contexts is an exhaustive listing, and I think they thought in some contexts, meaning 1961(4), that it was an exhaustive listing. And also, it's important to look at the other definitions of 1961(4), and I think this is the most important element of the other side's submission in this case because they do no business with any of the other definitions. The Attorney General, the definition of property for forfeiture purposes, those are unquestionably exhaustive lists. At least, that's the way I -- we argued it. They didn't respond to that. And yet, those are introduced with the term includes. So it strikes me that the best contextual evidence of what Congress intended here was that includes would be used exhaustively and that the use of individuals of associated in fact would be used as a limiting principle, not as part of an exhaustive principle that expands the scope of this beyond -- beyond -- into a realm where it becomes nothing but a mere conspiracy statute, which is what it is today under this -- under this particular theory. That's -- unless there are further questions about the straight statutory interpretation question, then I would go to the second issue, which is assuming that corporations can, nevertheless, be involved in association-in-fact enterprises, does this state such a thing. And here, you have to go back to the Court's opinion in Reves, and in Reves, what the Court held is that liability depends on showing that the defendants conducted or participated in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs, not just their own affairs. Okay? So it is an element of RICO liability that you have to distinguish the -- the corporate defendant's affairs in that case and -- and the affairs of the -- of the enterprise in this case.",
  "Justice Souter, that is the only allegation that comes remotely close to suggesting anything along those lines, but I -- my submission to you is that it doesn't get you there because what it says is that the recruiters are sometimes assisted -- it does say the recruiters -- by Mohawk employees who carry Social Security cards which they use for prospective or existing employees' needs to assume a new identity. That's when they come to Mohawk as applicants or as employees, Mohawk provides them with this identification. That's the allegation. That's simply Mohawk conducting its own affairs. That's not conducting or directing the affairs.",
  "Well, I don't doubt that there's a claim that -- that there's illegality. All of this is permeated with claims of illegality.",
  "I don't think so because even in Reves, the -- Ernst & Young had been found to have engaged in illegality, that there was -- that there was securities fraud involved there. So that's -- that doesn't distinguish it. The fact of illegality would make it a conspiracy, but it doesn't demonstrate either what the -- what the association-in-fact enterprise is and what are its affairs that are distinguished from the affairs of the corporation.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Souter, because -- because the -- it's a question I think of abstraction. What we normally do is hire employees and review their applications. Now, in that process, we've been alleged to engage in illegal acts by providing them with false identifications. But I don't see how that's any different from the Reves situation where the claim is that you're providing ordinary auditing advice, but in the process you're lying. You're engaged in illegal activities. It seems to me it is precisely the same problem in both situations.",
  "Intentionally.",
  "Right. Justice Souter, I don't doubt that, but the question is what is the legal standard in Reves. And Reves doesn't say, did you engage in illegality, and Reves doesn't say, can we make out a claim of conspiracy. Reves says what you have to demonstrate is that you are conducting or directing the operations or affairs of some entity, apart from yourself. And here, all we're doing is giving ID cards to our either actual or potential employees.",
  "But that still doesn't seem to me, Justice Souter, to satisfy the Reves standard, which is not just that there has to be something more than conducting your own affairs immediately, although that's important, and I don't think that -- I don't think you can show that -- either that we went beyond conducting our affairs or that the recruiters went beyond conducting their affairs. All of these allegations break out that way. But what Reves says you have to do is demonstrate that you conducted or directed the affairs of whatever this association-in-fact entity is.",
  "And that's the part that's missing. I'm sorry.",
  "No, I don't think either of those --",
  "Well, see, under those circumstances, I wouldn't have any problem calling Mohawk the enterprise. I mean, that's the whole point of this. The -- the logical enterprise here is the corporation. The question is do you go beyond that to create these completely artificial entities. I mean, you know, this -- this associational enterprise doesn't exist except in the minds of the plaintiffs.",
  "Well, I think it's a little late in the day, Justice Scalia, because that is precisely the standard the Court articulated in Reves. It said the question is not do you -- are you -- are you conducting the affairs of your own operation, however that's defined. But I'm not sure whether you need to -- you need to define. I mean, you know, in some ways, this also goes to why it -- it's a mistake to get into this in the first place because if you just said it has to be individuals associated in fact, you don't have to get into any of this inquiry. You could obviate the need to evaluate all of these problems in one fell swoop. But even assuming that you still want to live in this world, you still -- it seems to me you've got to identify what it is -- what -- what is the nature, what is the loose organization of this separate enterprise, and then what are its functions. And then you have to evaluate how it is that the defendant is, in fact, operating or conducting or directing the affairs of that enterprise. And that's what's missing, Justice Souter, in -- in footnote -- or excuse me -- in paragraph 76 because while it goes to -- you know, it says we paid for illegal aliens to be employed. Okay, well, that -- that's clearly hiring. That's the first one. The second one is they have temp agencies and they pool their employees and they loan them to us for a fee. Well, that's the business of temp agencies. That's what they do. They transport employees to -- so they'll have them available in their pool. That's not -- we don't direct any of that. We -- we are their -- we are -- it's an arms-length deal.",
  "Well, the -- the --",
  "Well, according to the allegation in paragraph 77, it just says obtaining illegal workers. It doesn't say anything about providing them with cover, that the common purpose of this enterprise --",
  "That's paragraph 76.",
  "And that's a factual allegation. But -- but it -- but all I'm saying is --",
  "No, because what you still need -- there's still a higher -- it's not just the higher threshold that it's got to be something that moves beyond what the corporation does. It has to involve the direction or the conduct of the operation of a separate entity.",
  "Well, obviously, we're going to disagree about this I think, but at the end of the day, I think the bottom line is what we're doing is when the applicant shows up at our doorstep or when they have, in fact, been hired, if for -- and this is the allegation. Obviously, none of this is true. But this is the allegation. That we then -- we then supply those employees -- our employees and our applicants with these false ID's. That's part of the process of our own hiring.",
  "Well, it -- the allegation certainly doesn't say that.",
  "There is only one sentence in the allegation that even remotely says anything about this. And again, Justice Souter, the -- the fundamental assumption here is that if there's something that goes anywhere beyond our affairs, that that by itself is sufficient to take you out of Reves. And what I would argue strenuously is that what Reves says is you have to be conducting or directing the operations of the other entity's affairs. And providing this doesn't conduct or direct anything. It may -- it may be a conspiracy. It may satisfy some interrelationship, but I don't see how it gets you to the point of an existing enterprise. If there are no further questions, I'd reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Ginsburg, let me -- let me try to justify having this issue before the Court. First of all, 1292(b) has never been as narrowly confined as you suggest, and indeed, in this case, you know, what you're entitled to do is to bring up any issues related to the challenged order. And in this case we not only raised the RICO issue, but we also raise State law issues in the -- in the Eleventh Circuit which were not within the specific grant and were entertained by the Eleventh Circuit because that's the standard. And then once you get past that, Justice Kennedy is absolutely right. The issue is whether there's an order to be reviewed. There is no final judgment rule on claims coming out of the Federal courts of appeals, and therefore, it's -- it's absolutely fair game. And the issue is I -- I submit, fairly subsumed within the question presented. Justice Souter, you know, with respect to the ID cards, I think it's very important to recognize that for us to do our business, we have to have an ID card in order to fill out the forms necessary to satisfy the immigration laws. So that -- you know, those ID cards add nothing to the -- to the conduct of our business. And, you know, Mr. Stewart just suggested that, well, but you know, we do go beyond that and that H.J. allows some a -- a different analysis of this particular point. But H.J. preceded Reves. This Court held in Reves that you have to distinguish between the activities of the enterprise and the activities of the defendant and -- and they've never made any effort to do that. All they do is suggest we've engaged in wrongdoing, that our third party recruiters engaged in wrongdoing, and that we're a conspiracy. There's nothing in there that remotely suggests that there is an existing enterprise. With respect to the question of how to interpret this particular statute, Justice Scalia is absolutely correct that at the end of the day, this is at most an ambiguous provision, and if it's an ambiguous provision, we ought to be entitled to the rule of lenity. I didn't hear any adequate answer to Justice Kennedy's specific question about why do they use person in the subsection just ahead of it, if they really meant to embrace everything here. And it's no answer to say, well, enterprise is a term that could be -- that has a general background. Enterprise is the linchpin of this statute. The notion that Congress didn't mean to very specifically and explicitly define enterprise here is absurd. Of course, it defined it, and it provided a very specific and detailed definition. And it's not free for the Government or for anyone else then to come here and shunt aside that definition and say, well, we're just going to deal with background principles. The truth is they're trying to write out of it groups of individuals acting in association. That language is there. It was put there for a reason. The Government concedes that it didn't -- that it never -- that Congress never had this issue in mind. How it can be then that this is not at least sufficiently ambiguous that you should construe it in our favor strikes me as -- as very difficult to understand. And finally, I don't -- I've never heard the expression RICO-ize before, Justice Breyer, but I -- I embrace it wholeheartedly because that is precisely what we're talking about here. These are enormous penalties that are imposed, and it's a statute that this Court has recognized in the past, even on its own terms, is very broad. Certainly there is no reason to take those terms and RICO-ize the -- the breadth of corporate activity that the plaintiffs' complaint in this case would -- would allow. The Court should reverse the decision below and dismiss this complaint, just as the Seventh Circuit did. If there are no further questions, thank you, Your Honors.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The fundamental question in this case is whether the common law doctrine of equivalence between defendant negligence and plaintiff negligence applies under the FELA. The doctrine of equivalence is, I think, most clearly stated in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which is reproduced on page 19 of our blue brief in the middle paragraph. And I think it is worth taking a second to read it. The rules which determine the causal relation between a plaintiff's negligent conduct and the harm resulting to him are the same as those determining the causal relation between the defendant's negligent conduct and resulting harm to others. That is a principle of law that has been in effect long before the Federal Employers Liability Act was enacted. It is obviously a restatement of the law in 1965, and it is an absolutely clear statement of the law as it applies today. There is nothing in the Federal Employers Liability Act that remotely modifies the doctrine of equivalence. The two provisions, section 51 talks about negligence resulting from -- or negligence in whole or in part. And section 53, which describes the contributory negligence portion or comparative negligence talks about negligence attributable to. None of that deviates at all from any kind of common law doctrines. Negligence inherently calls for an analysis of proximate causation.",
  "Well, even if that were true, we would still, of course, be entitled to -- I mean, it doesn't change the doctrine of equivalence. It doesn't say that we're not entitled to the same rule with respect to the -- our clients - -",
  "The plaintiff would be. That doctrine is unaffected by that holding. Now, I'd like to take issue with the interpretation of Rogers, if you want, at this point. But it seems to me the doctrine of equivalence is fundamentally different from the doctrine of proximate causation. And therefore, you can change one without affecting the other one whatsoever.",
  "That's not our attack, Justice Ginsburg. Our objection, which is reproduced in 28A of the cert -- of the petition's appendix, that says -- and I think the current MAI instruction has a different causation standard for comparative fault, meaning that under Missouri's rules, we must prove that such negligence of plaintiff directly contributed to the cause -- to cause the injury. And that misstates the law, because of the doctrine of equivalence. That's our initial argument, is that no matter how you analyze this, whether you do it from a proximate cause or a slightest cause standard as the appropriate way to evaluate our negligence, that same standard has to be applied in evaluating the plaintiff's negligence. That's the core doctrine. That's what we sought certiorari on. The argument with respect to Rogers was not an argument we put into this case, Justice Ginsburg. It's an argument that the Respondent put into this case.",
  "We would regard that as certainly at least half a loaf, maybe more than half a loaf. But at the end of the day, I think the right answer in this case is that the Court ought to go ahead and decide whether or not Rogers really did work a sea change in the law.",
  "You wouldn't have to address that issue.",
  "Absolutely don't have to address that issue. On the other hand, the question is squarely presented. And - -",
  "We clearly did that, Justice Kennedy. And we didn't raise -- we are not here complaining about Rogers as an argument for why we shouldn't be liable. That's not our -- we're not criticizing that. What we're saying is, in response to the Respondent's argument which seeks to undermine the doctrine of equivalence based on an overreading, I would argue, of Rogers, that that interpretation is incorrect. And if we're right that that interpretation is incorrect, we would win on the doctrine of equivalence for two different reasons. The first one that Justice Souter described. And the second one would be that to the extent that there's any equivalence, there's no problem here because proximate cause is required in every case. And we think that that's an issue that the Court doesn't have to decide, but certainly could. I'm sorry, Your Honor.",
  "No, what we're saying, Justice Ginsburg, is that we were entitled to the same -- if they were going to use slight negligence with respect to our negligence, then with respect to the plaintiff's negligence, we were entitled to slight negligence as well. That's our fundamental argument. That's the issue we have put on the table. And candidly, I don't think there's an answer to that that's been offered in this case, other than a harmless error argument, which I think is candidly without substance. The issue, then, is whether in evaluating the doctrine of equivalence, do you want to then entertain the plaintiff's or the Respondent's counter argument, which is that somehow Rogers requires this fundamental change, and indeed overrules the doctrine of equivalence as it applies to FELA. And I would say, one, Rogers doesn't speak to the doctrine of equivalence at all. And, two, to the extent it does speak to it, it was never meant to change the fundamental rule with respect to proximate causation.",
  "Well, at least one circuit clearly.",
  "Well, I think the -- well, the answer is yes, of course, I expect to get five votes for that.",
  "But you know, the basic -- the point here is that if you look at the decisions that have analyzed this Court's opinion in Rogers, I don't think any of them has analyzed it with much care. And the reality is the Third Circuit has analyzed this case with care, and reached the opposite conclusion. We think there is a split in the circuits. And at some point, if not through this vehicle to address that issue, then through another vehicle to address that issue. But, yes, it seems reasonably clear that, first of all, there were at least 20 decisions of this Court dealing not only with the sufficiency evidence, but also with the adequacy of the jury instructions prior to Rogers that refer specifically to proximate causation. There is nothing in the statute that remotely meant to change that. There is nothing that's been identified in that context. It is at least clear to me, and I hope clear to five of you - -",
  "But what Rogers saying in whole or in part eliminated was the specific proximate causation standard existing in Missouri. And Missouri's proximate cause standard talked about sole causation. And this Court said, no, in whole or in part means sole causation can not be the right standard for proximate cause. The Court was not asked to decide, and I don't think it did decide, that proximate causation, as it is traditionally understood, was also thrown out the door, or more fundamentally, that you can never ask for a jury instruction that calls for proximate causation to be given to both parties -- I'm sorry.",
  "Yes, that is a typical proximate cause instruction, and that meant that our burden was heavier than the plaintiff's burden, which is why we're saying that under the doctrine of equivalence, we're entitled to the equivalent instructions. Whatever they are. If it is slight cause or proximate cause.",
  "Right. But we are only doing that in response to the Respondent's argument. I'm not -- we didn't bring to this Court an affirmative argument that said we are entitled to no liability because of proximate cause. That's not the argument we made. The argument - -",
  "Because if you look at the opposition to the cert petition, which took us to task for not discussing Rogers in our petition, it says on page 6, \"inexplicably, petitioner does not cite, let alone discuss Rogers, an omission that enfeebles its entire discussion of FELA's causation standards.\" Against that kind of an attack, we felt it incumbent on us to deal with Rogers.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right, we're arguing both.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, it does say that in the blue brief. Because what we say is that the doctrine of equivalence is the principle that should apply. And you know, it is not specifically before the Court whether that means slight cause or proximate cause.",
  "That's fair.",
  "Well, I don't know that it's - -",
  "I don't know that it's extraneous. It clearly is not something that the Court needs to decide. On the other hand, it is something that the Respondents, to my mind at least, put into the case. And then we responded, to be sure, somewhat aggressively in urging the Court to rethink whether Rogers was right -- whether Rogers really decided this issue as some courts of appeals have.",
  "There is no question about that, Justice Ginsburg. But the point is that we made both arguments. And they are in some ways intertwined, in part because so much of the doctrine of equivalence itself is based on proximate cause as the standard. And so if you go back and look at all of the common law analyses here, which are the predicate - -",
  "Except to the extent that the Respondents are asking you to interpret Rogers as a mechanism for getting at the doctrine of equivalence. Now, it seems to me you can answer that in one of two ways. You can say simply, as I said to Justice Scalia, Rogers doesn't speak to the doctrine of equivalence, and therefore, you don't have to entertain that, you should just reaffirm a doctrine that every court except the courts in Missouri have recognized for a very long time. Or alternatively, you can say, well, look, they say that in order to properly analyze the doctrine of equivalence, you should examine whether or not Rogers worked a sea change in the law. And we took them up on that argument, and said, we don't think it did. And that if it didn't work a sea change in the law, then there is no basis at all for doubting that you would grant equivalent instructions in these two cases. And that's the guidance you would give to the lower courts on remand. Because this case would have to go back for a new trial.",
  "And you know, Justice Kennedy, I understand that. But the reality is we raised the doctrine of equivalence as our question presented. The other side raises and uses a substantial amount of its pages for the issue of the meaning of Rogers. We answer that in the reply brief. The Court grants certiorari. We decided under those circumstances that the sensible way to proceed was to address the Rogers issue. Now, to be sure, I suppose we could have said, here's -- section one is the doctrine of equivalence. That's a 10 page brief. Maybe the better way to do it is just write a 15 page brief, wait for their 47 page brief on Rogers, and then 20 pages on Rogers. But we anticipated that they were going to do precisely what they did, which is - -",
  "Well, because -- courts of appeals have been doing that for years. There have been a lot -- you know, a lot of them assume that there's a lower standard, and they say that the doctrine of equivalence requires that if the plaintiff gets to go with slight cause, then the defendant gets slight cause. So that's a ruling that's been rendered for years and years. Is that the most sensible way? I don't know. I think it would make sense for this Court to address the more fundamental issue of Rogers. Because I think it is an important issue that needs to be decided. I don't think the Court needs to decide it. I do think it has been thoroughly vetted for the Court on both sides, and it would certainly provide significant guidance to the lower courts.",
  "Yes.",
  "Let me take the first question first, and then I'll address the second one. There were three theories that the plaintiff put forward of the negligence of the railroad. Not just that the one driver drove the other driver off the side of the road. There was also a claim that the road wasn't constructed properly, and there was a claim that he wasn't given adequate safety instructions. And there's no way, given that this was a general verdict, to remotely figure out which of those theories was the one the jury thought was correct, and how that theory might line up with a causation theory, based on the plaintiff's own particular view and the defendant's arguments in this particular case. So it is not as cut and dried as he said, he said, and that's it. They were more theories in it. And you know, if you accept the idea that jury instructions count, and there's clearly a very different burden that's imposed on one as opposed to the other, then it seems to me the answer is there's no way for the Court to make a harmless error determination. It is also a question of State law. It ought to be decided by the Missouri courts in the first instance in any event, I would think, rather than this Court trying to sort through the record. With respect to the argument at the close of the case, I don't remember any specific arguments that either side made with respect to the burdens, because the jury instructions were what they were. And I think each side was saying, you know, we really didn't do anything wrong. And so that's basically the way that it was presented. But I think given the way the jury instructions played out, that there's no way at this time to unscramble that.",
  "Correct.",
  "Right.",
  "Correct.",
  "Right.",
  "You know, that's - -",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Well, I think if we were entitled to go back to the trial court, and if the issue was what's the proper instruction, we would have asked for and we should have properly received a proximate cause instruction. And that's what -- that's the question that will be at issue on the remand.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, it is not a correct statement of the law.",
  "Is the answer.",
  "Well, because it doesn't adequately explain to the jury what decisionmaking it has to go through in order to evaluate this case. I mean, it is true, it is not an incorrect statement in the sense that there's nothing wrong with it. But it is not an adequate statement because it doesn't deal, it is not sufficient, it doesn't deal with the proximate cause issue. I mean, it seems to me - -",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I think it is wrong on two levels. One is, I don't know why you would need to have proximate cause as your fallback, the last comment you just made, because it seems to me if you're saying slight cause, which is what Missouri thinks the in whole or in part means, then you can just say slight cause when you're describing the contributory negligence.",
  "What we asked for was an equivalence.",
  "That was not the basis on which the judge rejected it. He didn't reject it on the basis - -",
  "Well, the point here that remains is we said we are entitled to an equivalent instruction. Now, if there's some variant of that, we could certainly argue about that.",
  "Well, that is the specific issue in this case.",
  "Right. That's our argument.",
  "Well -- I think -- I think the argument would be that that cuts it too fine, candidly. I think you can make an argument that what, you know, what we were entitled to was some variant. And that -- our objection here is not - -",
  "The slightest cause.",
  "Right.",
  "That's our basic argument.",
  "And we didn't get that.",
  "Well, it may be that the in whole part of this may have been slightly misleading, although I think you can make an argument that you can end up with in whole on both sides as a conceptual matter. But that's not the -- that wasn't the complaint at trial. It wasn't the basis for the trial judge's decision, wasn't the basis for the court of appeals decision. If the Court wants to send it back and say, is there another objection to this instruction, that's fine. But it seems to me, this Court ought to address this issue in the way it has been presented.",
  "Because that's proximate causation. And that's higher than we were required to prove under a doctrine of equivalence, Your Honor.",
  "Yes.",
  "I would like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to address just sort of two issues. One is the minimalist issue that Justice Breyer asked about. It seems to me that the minimalist way to look at this case is we raised the question of whether or not the Missouri standard which says that you cannot deviate from our designated instructions creates a disparity in the way you approach negligence and contributory negligence, that disparity is inconsistent with the common law doctrines, and nothing in FELA modifies it, and it's wrong. And that by itself warrants the case being set aside and a new jury being -- and a new trial. That's the simplest way to resolve the issue. If the Court wishes to go forward and deal with the issue that Justice Souter addressed, then the question is, what does Rogers mean and what do you do with this \"in whole or in part\" language. And if you go back -- you asked the question, Justice Souter, you know, what does the common law say. We cite this on page 38. If its negligence contributes proximately to the injury, no matter how slightly -- there must be a dozen cases that we cite in those briefs that talk about no matter how slightly. And they refer to \"in whole or in part\" as language that still recognizes that you still require proximate causation. The reality is nothing in Rogers remotely casts doubt on cases like Brady that say but-for causation is not enough, you have to have proximate causation, or Earnest, where this Court said that proximate causation is the correct jury instruction that has to be given. This Court said nothing about that in Rogers.",
  "No, Justice Ginsburg. We didn't ask for that. All I'm saying to you - -",
  "-- is that the guidance of the Court on remand, you could, and we would ask you to address that issue and to resolve it. It is fairly in front of you.",
  "Yes. That would be my preferred instruction on remand, yes.",
  "I think that would certainly go a long way. I don't know exactly how strictly you want to do it, but sure. I mean, that's the pivotal problem with the way that instruction reads today, Justice Stevens.",
  "Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think I am inclined instead of starting with the jurisdictional issue to focus initially on the regulatory history immediately in the wake of the 1980 rules. Because it seems to me it is very clear that the understanding of everyone in the industry, outside the industry, from 1980, candidly well beyond 1988 all the way up until 1999, was that these regulations didn't apply under any circumstances in the absence of an increase in the capacity. And you had to demonstrate that there would be an increase in the hourly rate of the emissions.",
  "To confirm precisely that interpretation. That's exactly why GE went to Mr. Reich and asked for a determination of applicability, and was told categorically PSD applicability is determined by evaluating any change in emissions rates caused by the conversion.",
  "No. Well - -",
  "As I heard Mr. Donahue, he was talking about WEPCO. Understand the context of WEPCO. WEPCO was a situation where every one of the changes was a modification within the meaning of NSPS. And then the question is were they also modification - - major modifications within the -- within the meaning of the PSD. And that's what they analyzed. So it didn't say anything about the argument we've been making which is what is a modification. The only statements that I know of that are out there are the two Reich statements which I just quoted to you, says exactly our interpretation. But even more powerful at least in my view is the quotation from the amicus brief from the State of Alabama and the 12 States that relied on the Region 4 statement and that's on pages 7 and 8 of that amicus brief and the answer, the question is -- you know -- how do you determine what is a modification? You know does something that doesn't increase the hours, the emissions per hour, constitute it? It says no. Since the modification does not cause any increase in the hourly particulate emissions, no increase in annual emissions should be calculated. They could not have said that any more clearly than - -",
  "That is the -- it is the chief of the air and waste management division, James Wolburn, giving guidance to Region 4. Region 4 is not only Alabama, it is also North Carolina and South Carolina. And then, in the wake of this, right? 1982, North Carolina and South Carolina submit their SIPs and in their SIPs, certainly the South Carolina SIP expressly incorporates the concept of modification. North Carolina a little less expressly incorporates the entirety of the regulatory scheme under title 50 -- under part 51 of the Code of Federal Regulations.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I think Puerto Rico cement is a somewhat complicated problem. Because what you are dealing with there is the elimination of two existing units, the two kilns, and a replacement with a brand-new unit, which would have been a modification under any -- I think under anybody's theory, because there would have been an increase in the hourly emissions anyway. So it would have been a NSPS subject to the PSD. It didn't get analyzed that way but the truth is it would have been fully -- the way that decision came out would have been exactly consistent with the way that they analyzed it.",
  "But that was based on the question of involving you know, normal operations or non-normal operations. The Court really didn't have to address -- and I don't think did address the question of how do you relate - -",
  "I don't think they were really arguing that particular point. I mean, that's not the way I would have read the argument that EPA was making. But, and the bottom line is they didn't address this issue in WEPCO. To the extent they came close to addressing this issue in WEPCO they lost it in the Seventh Circuit because WEPCO adopted an interpretation that's much closer to what we are asking for. The answer given on the other side at this point, that we should have -- we should have sought a determination. Well, the problem with that, of course, is every one of these projects was being inspected. The record is replete with examples from North Carolina and South Carolina and EPA inspectors on site looking at every one of these projects.",
  "But that is the issue in front of you, I believe.",
  "Because - -",
  "To be sure, but that's the opinion. That's not the judgment. The judgment of the court of appeals is that this enforcement- -",
  "If -- I'm not sure I understood the predicate of the question, Justice Stevens. Which question are you asking?",
  "Oh, I see.",
  "Right.",
  "No, our position would be no. That would have been an -- inappropriate under the rationale of Justice Scalia.",
  "Yes, actually we're making both arguments. Our basic argument is that all along, they have interpreted it in a certain way. And then 19 years later, they reversed course. And that is arbitrary and capricious, Justice Breyer, and it is a basis on which to defend the judgment of the court of appeals.",
  "I think that's exactly what they have to be arguing. And it seems to me that that cannot be what 307(b)(1) means. Justice Kennedy, you asked a great question. Should we have raised this in 1980, 1992, 2000? When were we supposed to bring this up? And the truth is in 1980 we interpreted this statute, the regulation, exactly the same way EPA did. It would have been silly for us to raise that. It is true that this issue comes up 25 years later in a bizarre proceeding. But that's not what 307(b)(2) is all about. It says you are precluded from making a challenge in an enforcement action if the action of the administrator was subject to challenge. Well, the action of the administrator was not subject to challenge in 1980. And when we did have the subsequent rulemaking - -",
  "Yes. Well, I think that, that is precisely what we are saying. But you know, Judge Tatel, with all due respect to him, is dead wrong. Because the interpretation of modification under NSPS and under the regulatory PSD was identical. The regulations couldn't be any clearer in that regard because if you look at 15a of our appendix, you know, the modification, this is the NSPS definition -- I'm sorry, better go back a page. 17a. 60.14 modification defines emission rate and the emission rate is expressed as kilogram per hour. So that is absolutely clear that that is the NSPS -- Dobbs modification.",
  "That's the NSPS section. Then you go two pages earlier to 15a and you have the PSD regulatory definition, and it comes right back to emission rate, or the regulatory history that says the emission rate as used in this provides is identical - -",
  "Well, in the first place it would apply in at least South Carolina immediately because there is a SIP that incorporates exactly the same language. And second of all, the notion that this regulation is inoperative on one side and fully operative on the other side make no sense. It makes much more sense to recognize that modification is the trigger for construction which is in part 51(2) and that that incorporates this entire modification language.",
  "Okay.",
  "The way that would apply - -",
  "Right. Go back to then -- you have to go back to 12(a), I think it is where we talk about the interpretation and we get to construction. This is (b)(8), construction means a modification, okay, of an emissions unit. So that -- and modification, if it is undefined in title 51, right? According to 15.100, means whatever it means under the statute. So that just takes you back to the statute. And this is the interpretation under the statute. The 52 interpretation is also an interpretation under the statute. So it is completely circular and brings you right back to the same definition. I agree by its terms it doesn't apply to 51. But going through the definitional provision in part 51 through the definition of the trigger for construction, which is modification, it takes you right back to the same meaning of the same provisions. So there is no difference between the two. And to me, it is really critical. And it seems to me there are sort of two points to make here. One is nobody on the Petitioner's side of this case answers the State -- the dozen States who say we relied upon you when we adopted these SIPs. We realized that you are asking us to take on enormous burdens. And you should have told us that before we went down this path in the first place.",
  "No. Absolutely not. I mean, you would -- you -- there is no rational - -",
  "And I have not heard the other side make an argument that there is a rational distinction between the two. And the truth is if EPA wanted to achieve what it thought it was achieving, that is to eliminate the concept of modification, what it should have done is two things. It should have -- it should have deleted 52.01. And it should have adopted the proposed regulation that it didn't adopt from the 1979 regs. This is on page 9 of their brief. This statement is astonishing to me. \"The term major modification serves as the definition of modification or modified when used in the act in reference to a major stationary source.\" If they had adopted that regulation in 1980, I wouldn't had to litigate this issue 25 years later. We would have litigated this question in 1980 because then we would have said that's flatly inconsistent with the statutory scheme because you're not entitled.",
  "Page 9 of their reply brief.",
  "The SG's reply brief, I apologize. The gray brief. Where they seek to get some support for the idea that modification was dropped out of this analysis. But the truth is, that was a proposed rule that would have done exactly what they say that the 1980 rule did without adopting that particular regulation.",
  "Substantively different?",
  "No, I think that would be impermissible",
  "Yes. I don't understand how it's possible that Congress says in the statute that you take the NSPS trigger -- remember, this is not just some random definition we're talking about. Construction is the trigger for this part of this entire regulatory scheme, and modification is the trigger, and say it is as defined in, and they did it twice.",
  "My answer is no.",
  "I thought I said that first.",
  "That's a no with some emphasis.",
  "For all of it?",
  "Yes. I think there is plenty of room within that - -",
  "Yes. I think as long as you maintain consistency between the two, there is a fair amount of discretion for - -",
  "Well, I think the premise of that is, the real question is, if Congress had meant that, why would Congress have adopted the same word, modification, as the construction trigger that existed in NSPS?",
  "Because by the time the statute came up for review by Congress, and the PSD program, the new source review, there was already a very extensive regulatory history about the meaning of the term \"modification.\"",
  "And it also seems to me, Justice Breyer, it clearly creates an obligation on the part of EPA to be very explicit if it's, in fact, going to do what you say it's going to do. You don't go about saying I am going to define modification in one statute fundamentally different from the way I define modification in another statute without discussing the word modification. And to put this in context, you'll remember, these regulations were adopted in the wake of the Alabama Power decision. Alabama Power didn't deal with the issue of modification. That wasn't before the court. Nobody had challenged modification's definition. The hourly emissions rate was a perfectly valid one. What the court in Alabama Power said is, you can't use this threshold for major modification. And then the case - - so then the matter comes back, and if EPA immediately adopts a new set of regulations that deal what, with what? Major modification, not with modification. And then they go through this entire elaborate analysis of major modification, none of which, candidly, do we challenge. We have no quarrel with their interpretation of the concept of major modification. If anybody does, my guess is the State environmental groups would.",
  "Yeah. And if the Solicitor, and if EPA had enacted the regulation that they proposed but didn't enact, that says major modification means modification, then we might have an argument there. But the concept that when you have modification as a core baseline construction -- I mean trigger for the applicability of this portion of the scheme, and then you take that same -- and you not only do it once but you do it twice, and you do it in the context of an entire regulatory scheme that was designed to implement this statutorily -- or implement this before the statute was enacted, and you have Congress saying well, you didn't get that right, but you did get this right, and they leave this language exactly in the way it is, the only fair inference you can draw from that, it seems to me - -",
  "Sure.",
  "Where it says in the statute is where it makes this specific cross-reference, because if all they wanted to do was get that definition, all they had to do was use the word modification. They didn't have to use modification as defined - -",
  "It's a general principle that - -",
  "No, but the general principle is that if the same language is used in two different portions, you presume they have the same meaning. When you go beyond that -- because otherwise, their interpretation rendered superfluous the specific cross-references to as defined in and as used in; and while I know some don't like the legislative history, the legislative history is quite clear that they had in mind, and regulatory history as well - -",
  "It depends on which general principle, I suppose you're talking about. I'm not relying on the mere presumption. I think this is much stronger than the mere presumption.",
  "I think if you read it in context, when you recognize that what Congress was doing is adopting a statutory scheme that overlays on a regulatory scheme that was well established with very specific meanings, and where Congress quite clearly picked and chose -- I think that's the way to say it - - from the regulatory scheme, and said we'll take these and not take those, and has a provision at the end - - 168 says, all the regulations remain in effect until they get changed at some point, suggesting - -",
  "No. It would not be nearly as strong as it is. We would still have a presumption - -",
  "I don't know if I have to go quite that far because I have more evidence than that in this particular case, because I have the fact that they say as used in, which suggests that it's more than just a definitional point. We do have a legislative history that seems to have in mind this regulatory background; and we've been told by EPA that when Congress incorporated modification, it really did incorporate that luggage, baggage as well.",
  "I do endorse it. The only question I have -- I mean, I don't think that it necessarily has to be -- that every word has to be identical in the two provisions, but I do think they have to be congruent. And so, that's the strong version of our argument, and that's pretty close to where the Fourth Circuit was. The weaker version of our argument, which gets I think some mileage on the arbitrary and capricious part of the argument, is at a minimum, if Congress adopts as the trigger point the same word in two statutes, and EPA then purports to be implementing that statute, it has some obligation to explain how it is that they're doing a 180 with respect to the term modification. And the reason - -",
  "Yes. You're right.",
  "Right. They owe us some responsibility to explain, how do you not follow that course.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Could they have gotten away with that? I mean, that would have been a much stronger argument. It seems to me the better argument, and - - but see, the point here is if they had done that, or if they had done what they proposed in 1979, which is just to simply redefine major modification to be modification, then we would have taken that issue directly to the D.C. Circuit at that point in time.",
  "Yes.",
  "The other side has not argued collateral estoppel, if that's the argument you're trying to make, Justice Breyer.",
  "Well, you have to put that into context. We're talking about a matter that was closed for 25 years and then was reopened. And this argument -- and it is true, a variant of this argument was made. I don't think it's the full argument that we've made before this Court. And it was rejected by the D.C. Circuit. But if you're arguing that as a 307(b) argument, my answer to that is this is still not action by the administrator that would trigger a 307(b) bar. If you're asking about collateral estoppel, my argument is - -",
  "Well, again, if you are arguing that as a matter of collateral estoppel, then - -",
  "But if it's not collateral estoppel and it's not 307(b)(2), then - -",
  "So you are doing it as - - see, I don't think it -- I think if you read 307(b)(2)'s language, it talks about action of the administrator, and what action of the administrator are we, in fact, challenging here? Nothing. Because in our view, the 1980 regulation quite clearly says what we want it to say. The only thing that's changed is that the preambles have interpreted the 1980. We challenged that and the D.C. Circuit said no, we're not going to address that issue. That's an issue when you get back up, when you get back on your enforcement action. Then you can complain about that aspect of it. That issue is not ripe. And that is exactly what we are trying to argue in this case. And it's a variant of what I think - -",
  "As long as they are consistent?",
  "Yes. That is my position, Justice Stevens.",
  "Right. Because there is no action of the administrator that we would challenge. The only action of the administrator was the 1980 regulation, which we interpret as not changing modification. If you read 52.01(d), it clearly retains modification. We have no quarrel, then, with what the administrator did in 1980. Then they adopt preambles to the subsequent regs. We do challenge those, but the D.C. Circuit said we're not entitled to do that, that's got to wait for an enforcement action. The only thing that's left out there is this sort of inchoate interpretation by the administrator. But there's no final action by the administrator for us to challenge. Then the only question would be, do we have some obligation - -",
  "I don't know how that's a final action. The filing of a complaint, as this Court held in Harrison, is not a final action. So that doesn't trigger it, and I don't know what else is out there for us to serve as a hook. I would think at a minimum the Court would want to be very, very loathe to jump on a expansive interpretation of 307(b) where it operates in a context like this as a pure gotcha. You adopt regulations that nobody has a quarrel with, you change the regulation afterwards and then you come back and you say you can't challenge it at this point. That just cannot be a sensible interpretation of that statute. If there are no further questions, I would ask the Court to affirm the Fourth Circuit. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1995 Congress acted decisively to curb abusive private securities litigation. It took the extraordinary step of rejecting categorically the traditional rule of notice pleading in complaints that are filed under the securities laws. Instead it declared that, and this is at page 2 of our petition, \"The complaint shall state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" The fundamental error in the court of appeals analysis in this case was in writing out of the statute the strong inference language that Congress clearly intended to be not only in those statutes, but obviously applied rigorously.",
  "I think the answer to the question is that it does not have to be the same. I think Congress actually has greater authority in dealing with pleadings that is distinct from the Seventh Amendment right, but the Court doesn't need to go that far in this particular case because I think the inferences that we are asking the Court to draw from the record in this case would avoid any - -",
  "That's what the Court held - - held in Huddleston, yes, Your Honor.",
  "Well, it's important as a standard of allegation, because what we're talking about here is an analysis of the allegations of the lawyers, and not any kind of an evidentiary showing by any of the plaintiffs. So I do think it's removed. I mean, this Court has really never addressed the issue of the extent to which the Seventh Amendment extends to pleadings. And I don't think this is the case in which to take up that issue because I think it is quite clear that what at least we're asking for as the appropriate interpretation of the Reform Act is that you need to apply -- that you simply follow Matushita and Monsanto, and that is to force the plaintiffs to demonstrate that innocent explanations can be set aside. And if you take that particular approach, which clearly is consistent with the Seventh Amendment, then it seems to me you - - the Seventh that you followed under the Constitution, is eliminated.",
  "I don't know that there are any other instances in which that's true, Justice Ginsburg, but I don't think it's a constitutional problem. I think at the end of the day the question is, does Congress have the power to enforce its view of the appropriate way to proceed as a matter of policy at the pleadings stage, and I think the answer to that question is yes. But again, you don't have to - -",
  "Well, I'm not sure that's 100 percent true. I think the real problem with the Second Circuit is there's no monolithic Second Circuit rule that's out there. The Second Circuit applied a number of cases under its particularity standards under 9(b) prior to the time Congress adopted the strong inference standard. Some of them -- I think we would be very comfortable with the analysis in Shields versus Citytrust Bank, for instance. The way Judge Jacobs analyzed the complaint in that case is precisely the way we're trying to analyze the complaint in this case. So if you - -",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "I think it would have to be stronger than that, although I don't know how to translate that into percentages, Justice Stevens.",
  "I think the use of the language \"strong inference\" carries with it a very significant burden that has to be demonstrated by the buyer.",
  "Oh, to be sure.",
  "Absolutely, Justice Scalia. And if you read the Securities Industries amicus brief, it ticks off all of the instances of harm that are caused by allowing -- too much of the private litigation is precisely that, which Congress was responding to.",
  "Yes. I believe Congress would have intended it to be more - -",
  "I think at the end of the day I would make that argument. I don't have to make that argument here because it's clear to me that the same standards of Matushita and Monsanto that say you have to exclude innocent explanations would apply at the summary judgment stage as we're trying to apply at the pleading stage, so there is no disconnect. But if I were actually forced into that position, I think I would take that view, although I probably would argue first that the standard of Huddleston ought to be reconsidered, rather than rejecting clearly what Congress had in mind in 1995 when it acted to curb the abuses of private securities litigation.",
  "I think there may be a slight semantic difference there, but the truth is at end of the day all we're asking for the Court to do is to evaluate the complaint, taking both the positive and the negative inferences from it, excluding ambiguities, interpreting them not in favor of the plaintiff, as you traditionally do, take into account whether there is an allegation of motive, and say at the end of the day whether or not that reaches a -- rises to the level of a strong inference.",
  "Well, if I'm going to err on either side, I obviously prefer that the Court carries out Congress's intent. We thing you needn't go any further than Matsushita did in order to reverse the court of appeals in this particular case. Obviously there is probably some potential distance between the two, where you could certainly interpret the strong inference standard more in the line the way the United States interprets it, as creating a high likelihood of scienter. And we don't -- we're certainly not objecting to that. We're just saying to the Court that you needn't go that far in order to decide this case, although obviously we would welcome a ruling along those lines if the Court's inclined to go that far.",
  "Well, again, I think it -- I think it puts an issue -- and we raised this in our reply brief, whether or not Huddleston should be reconsidered in light of this sort of basic change in the way Congress is approaching private securities litigation. But, so my - -",
  "There are a number of ways to go at it. But if it turned out to be a disconnect, that would not offend at least my sense of what Congress was trying to achieve here.",
  "All I'm suggesting is that if the Court were concerned that somehow there is a disconnect between the pleading standard and the ultimate standard of proof, the way to resolve that incongruity -- if it is one -- would to be reconsider the ultimate standard of proof, not to throw out the clearly congressionally approved baby as part of that bath water.",
  "Right.",
  "You mean with a specific earnings report rather than just simply sort of sales projections and demand?",
  "Well, my guess is they - -",
  "Well, I think they would have to make an allegation that the -- that the CEO routinely is provided with that information rather than simply assume it. I think it's the same problem you have with their -- with their allegation that it's common sense that CEOs will act to protect their own personal self interest and the overall welfare of the company by misrepresenting the status of events.",
  "I'm not - -",
  "I don't think that's sufficient, because it requires for the facts that particularly show - -",
  "But the -- but the problem with that allegation, and we're talking about the 6500, the Titan 6500 product specifically, in that context, the report is, there's nothing in there that says what those reports say about the 6500. And remember, this is a case where the plaintiffs have 27 whistleblowers inside the company who could provide you with all of the detail in the world; and yet when it comes time to tell you what was in the 6500 report that would -- that would suggest that it's not available, there's not word one in the allegation.",
  "Right but that's -- that being delayed for a year is not the basis for the claim. The question was is the, is the 6500 being sold; and that was the allegation. And the answer to that is he -- I -- he had every reason to believe that, based on what they've claimed because they've not produced a report or said that there's anything inside the report that says to the contrary about that. Again, it seems to me - -",
  "I think - -",
  "But Justice Breyer, that - - that long been delayed period runs all the way back to 1998. And we're talking about events in 2000 and 2001. So the notion that it's been long delayed says nothing about what Mr. Notebaert was -- was revealing in March and April and June of 2001. It, it could potentially, but it equally, it couldn't. It's the same problem you get with the 5500, where the court of appeals specifically said it is quite plausible that Mr. Notebaert never saw those reports. Now how you can make that concession and nevertheless say there is a strong inference that he acted to deceive, strikes me as absolutely implausible.",
  "But you -- you - - Justice Breyer, you make a leap there.",
  "Is that they all knew that. The point is they knew that it was delayed back in 1999. What they don't do is tie that in to what he knew in 2001; and that, to me, that's the central point in this case, is do you require that kind of specificity? And it seems to me there's no other way to read what Congress says in this statute than to that. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I have to confess I'm -- I'm slightly perplexed by exactly what the Respondent's position is in this case so I'm inclined to kind of go back to the core points that have been raised by the questions from -- from the Court. And in the first instance, it seems to me quite clear that the Seventh Circuit did not apply the strong inference standard. If -- you can compare the language from the First Circuit circuit that specifically says it has to be reasonable and strong, strong has completely fallen out here. I don't see any way to read it the other way. I think in response to Justice Breyer's question, which is how do, how should you write the opinion, I think the meaningful way to write the opinion is to be respectful of Justice Scalia's desire to provide guidance. So I do think you should say, you have to, as Justice Alito said, review the entirety of the document and -- and infer both positively and negatively as you go forward. We know that has to be true. Almost every court that's dealt with these issues --",
  "Absolutely. Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg. There's no question that that's - - that that's what Congress had to have meant under these circumstances. And the best example of that is the CEO who sells securities during the time period of the class action. There are dozens of cases in which that happens. Does it create an inference of scienter? It might, because it's quite possible that he sold and - - he lied about the stock in order to keep the price up to sell. It is also possible that he sells only about 1 percent of the stock - -",
  "Well, that is - -",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I couldn't disagree with you more about that. That is precisely what Congress says when -- when it says with particularity. And when Congress says you have to look at each defendant. You cannot do - -",
  "Yes.",
  "But the strong inference of scienter is not pled on a group basis. It has to be pled with respect to each individual defendant. So it's quite convenient - -",
  "Well, there were a lot more than that.",
  "Well, I -- I -- I mean, I was commenting primarily on Professor Miller's decision to just sort of sweep everything in and say look, back in 1999 and 2000 when the Seventh Circuit itself specifically said that the knowledge, for instance, of the 5500 decline didn't happen until March of 2001. So I was just saying you can't start sweeping everything in. But -- and it is true, the court distinguished between those two individuals; but the bottom line remains the same. You have to analyze them, each. And you have to take into account contending inferences. You have to construe ambiguity contrary to the plaintiff sometimes - -",
  "I think you better make an allegation with particularity that that date was at a time when the individual would know that the -- that the information that he was conveying was -- was wrong. I don't see how you can infer strongly - -",
  "-- scienter otherwise.",
  "Well, the plaintiff can ask the confidential informant as much as, as he wants about the information; and if he can't come up with it, that's the price you pay. That was exactly what Congress said, is if you cannot make those particular allegations, then you're out of luck. And it's not as though they give you one shot for this.",
  "I could be flip to say it's the right way. But I think the -- I mean the answer to the, the answer to why to choose our approach is because it is consistent with Matsushita and Monsanto and it will allow, Justice Breyer, to apply it in an individualized way, in a fashion that will give guidance to the lower courts. Thank you.",
  ": Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress in what is now Section 11501(b)(1) crafted what this Court described as a straightforward approach to determining whether a State is unlawfully taxing railroad property. Congress used a precise formula that is set out in a pictorial form on page 6 of the Petitioner's brief, and I think it's probably easier to kind of follow along on that. What basically Congress said is that the court in making a determination as to whether there's an illegal tax considers the assessed value of rail transportation property as the numerator on the left side of the fraction, compares that to the true market value of rail transportation property, and then compares that ratio to the ratio created by examining the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property over the true market value. Fortunately, in this particular case three out of four of those variables are agreed to by the parties, so the only issue in this case is what constitutes the true market value of the rail transportation property within the meaning of that statute. This Court in Burlington Northern first evaluated the language of this statute and held, in what I think the Court later would describe as a straightforward fashion, that 10501(b)(1) declares that the district court -- for the district court, that it is necessary for that court to determine what the true market values of the respective properties are.",
  "No, I think it's pretty clear that Congress did not adopt that particular formulation. What Congress tasked the district court with doing was determining the true market value. And if you look at footnote 8 of the district court's opinion, I think he does a fairly interesting job of explaining what that would normally mean. He says: In an ordinary valuation case I would take in all of the expert testimony from the railroad, I would take in all of the expert testimony of the State, I would evaluate them and I would come up with a conclusion as to what I think is the true market value.",
  "No, I don't - -",
  "Yes. I think every facet of the question of, that goes into the determination of what is a true market value.",
  "No. I think all it says is that in this particular case under these particular circumstances that methodology led to what was the true market value.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's not accurate. I think what will happen is that the circumstances change every day. Let's just take a pretty simple example. Let's assume that in year 1 the district court decides to use discounted cash flow. In year 2 it turns out that CSX or some other railroad property is sold, so that you have an actual direct sales comparison data available to you by which to make the market value.",
  "Right. I'm sure that's true that we'll cite it, but the reality is that the district court in the second case is not bound by the decision of the district court in the first case. And the truth is every single one of these - -",
  "Well, at the end of the day the district court's going to make a valuation. It's going to say that this is the true market value. That determination is a question of fact and therefore, yes, the court of appeals will evaluate that to determine whether or not that fact is clearly erroneous.",
  "I believe that's correct.",
  "Sure, Justice Alito, that's exactly what could happen. But the reality is is that that's exactly what's been going on since the statute was enacted in 1976. 48 of the 50 States have railroads that have to be evaluated and, as the AAR's amicus brief points out, there have been 12 cases on this particular issue. It is not as though it is cost-free for the railroads to challenge what the States are doing under these circumstances. There is no cost shifting or fee shifting arrangement. And second, you're suing the very person who's going to be making the decision next year as to the value of your property.",
  "Yes. Well, blissfully, more often than not it turns out that the overvaluation are not nearly that stark. But I think that goes to the core point here, which is that if this Court concludes like the Eleventh Circuit did, which is that there is no basis for challenging the methodology, then it would have been completely within the province of the State of Georgia to say, we're going to adopt a stock and debt method, which virtually everybody recognizes is not an accurate way to determine true market value, that that number would have been $12.2 billion.",
  "Well, I don't think there's ever a reason why the Federal court has to adopt a single methodology and I don't think that's what Congress intended. I think what Congress intended is what happens in every run of the mine valuation case that comes up in either State or Federal court, which is that each side presents its best guess as to what the true market value is and the district court resolves those differences and comes out with a number that the district court believes constitutes the true market value.",
  "Yes, Justice Scalia, there are.",
  "If you read footnote 8 of the district court's opinion, the district judge says, if this were a typical valuation case what I would have done is I would have listened to the railroad, I would have listened to the State and I would have made a judgment as to what I think is the right - -",
  "But that's because there's usually --which rates affect the taking of property?",
  "Or what the rates ought to be?",
  "But that's because that's regulated by a Federal agency that formulates a very precise approach typically. But there's nothing like that -- and that approach governs every utility subject to the jurisdiction of FERC.",
  "It's permitted for them to use different methodologies because typically they do. The reality is they almost never use the same methodology for determining railroad property as they do for other commercial and industrial property because the data that are available for the two are never the same.",
  "You would make that argument, but you'd also make an argument as to sort of what data are available in any particular case to allow a particular methodology to be used.",
  "At the end of the day the test here is purely a results-driven test. It doesn't tell the State what methodologies to use on either side of the equation. What it says is at the end of the process you end up with a ratio between assessed and true market value for each that's within 5 percent.",
  "Well, the State can use any -- the State can assess any way it wants to in defense of its ultimate outcome.",
  "At the outcome it has to have the right ratio. That's clearly what Congress intended. I mean, this language could not be more straightforward.",
  "Well, my guess is that the district judge in that situation would probably say that that is the true market value. The problem is when you deviate from that methodology when you're evaluating commercial and industrial property what happens in that context? Does that end up with a true market value that's much higher or lower.",
  "Right. Well, at the end of the day that's right. The question here is the comparison of assessed to true market value on both sides of the equation. It doesn't dictate the methodology for get ting there in either situation.",
  "I believe that is, yes.",
  "Yes, Justice Scalia.",
  "More often than not, my answer would be no, there wouldn't be any basis.",
  "But the protection that we're seeking, Justice, to answer Justice Scalia's question, is to have the independent de novo assessment by the district court. I mean, that's the real purpose of the statute, is to provide a Federal forum.",
  "Well, it depends on what you're asking me. Are you talking about how the district court, or the court of appeals? If it's in the district court - -",
  "-- because the question for the district court is not with deference to how the State is evaluating this issue. The question is for the district court, de novo, to make a determination of what the true market value is. But asking on the court of appeals side, that's a different question.",
  "As I understand the way this statute applies, this is not a statute that worries about sort of how you get to the numbers. All this statute worries about is when you get to a number at the end of the day, is it within 5 percent of the same number that you -- the same ratio you would have gotten using whatever methodology you use on a commercial and industrial side. If the answer to that is it's more than 5 percent, then we are entitled to injunctive relief; and if it's not, then we are not entitled to injunctive relief. And that's why I think it doesn't make sense to think about this in the context of - - because you know, there's deference to the way the State analyzes - -",
  "Well, in some ways it's difficult to know. In this particular case - -",
  "Well, I think they should be applying the professional standards of appraisal.",
  "Trust me, having read them, you can't grab them out of thin air.",
  "To be sure.",
  "And Justice Souter, that's driven largely by what data are available and what do we know about how these methods have been applied in the past to value this particular property.",
  "There is also an element of judgment.",
  "In a different world, that would make perfect sense. That's an approach Congress clearly could have embraced. The problem is Congress didn't do that. Congress said choose the true market value.",
  "Right. And the answer to that is that Congress didn't intend to set this up as a review process of what the State does. Congress intended for the district court to do what this Court said in Burlington Northern, make the necessary determination of the true market value of that property.",
  "No, I don't think so. I think what the Court said is that -- or what Congress has said is that the district court can take all of that into account; but at the end of the day, it is the district court serving as a check on what the State does that decides what the true market value. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I will try to be brief. First of all, Justice Stevens, in response to your question on the comparisons between Georgia and other States, on page 22 of our cert petition we pointed out that in the 2006 tax year Georgia and Florida had adopted unit values of $11.2 billion and $12.9 billion; whereas, every other State in those jurisdictions that used the unit value had an assessment value of $7.1 billion. And the Respondent State did not question that. So I mean the reality is there are wide swings, and it does make a difference what methodology you do, and it's part of the reason why it's absolutely critical that the Court should enforce the language of the statute. As Justice Scalia quite properly recognizes, it is the true market value. And this is not a statute like, for instance, 28 U.S.C. 1254(d)(1) in AEDPA, which says the Federal courts should defer to any reasonable determination by the State courts in a judgment Federal law. This is a statute that vests the district court with the exclusive authority to make the determination of the true market value.",
  "No.",
  "Absolutely. And that's -- and that's exactly the point, Mr. Chief Justice. There isn't any single method that's out there. All we have are a series of evidences of value, and the district court needs to be able to evaluate them without regard to some kind of thumb on the scale of the State, in favor of the State. And as you asked the question, you know, is there any other valuation process that would work this way, the answer was no. And the problem is that there is nothing in this, in this statute that remotely suggests that Congress would have wanted to do anything other than the ordinary or typical valuation in this context. Justice Souter, I think you made the point, which is the one I wanted to make in my opening statement, which is how is it possible that Congress recognizes decades of discrimination involving tens or hundreds of millions of dollars would have said and now when you get to the point of trying to correct that discrimination, what are you going to do? Defer to the entity that's been discriminating for all of those years. It is at least passing strange, if not incredible to think that that's what Congress meant. It is much more sensible to think that Congress wanted the district court to serve as a serious check on what the state did. That's what we didn't get in this case. That's what we are entitled to. I urge the Court to vacate and to revamp. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this case two very sophisticated parties agreed to arbitrate an ongoing dispute that was pending in litigation before the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. Their agreement states plainly that after an arbitration award is issued the district court -- and this is at Pet. App. 16A -- \"shall vacate, modify, or correct any award where the arbitrator's conclusions of law are erroneous.\" Ultimately what this Court must decide is whether there is anything in either the Federal Arbitration Act or any other Federal law that renders this non-adhesive, unambiguous contract agreement unenforceable.",
  "I would be more concerned about identifying a standard of review for the district court than identifying a standard for modifying the arbitration award pursuant to the agreement. So I think that's a different issue. I think that's closer to dealing with a judicial function than this is, which is simply implementing the intent of the parties as to what the standard ought to be for enforcing an initial award.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I recognize that there is a limit to party autonomy. I think there ought to be a very strong preference for party autonomy, and I'm not saying that if I were here and I had an agreement by which de novo review is the standard I wouldn't defend that autonomy. All I'm saying is that I recognize that there are limitations on autonomy that recognize the functions of the Judiciary. But that limitation isn't remotely implicated in this particular case.",
  "That one I think worries me less because it doesn't -- it doesn't suggest -- I mean it just says that we will leave to the district, to the district court the findings, and essentially renders the arbitration agreement - -",
  "But again, the parties under those circumstances it seems to me are perfectly free to decide whether they want those issues to be decided conclusively by the arbitrator or to have them adjudicated at the end of the day by the Federal court. And so, if they choose to go through the arbitral process, and then still say nevertheless that's nonbinding and that the district court's free to evaluate that on a de novo record, that it seems to me doesn't in fact implicate the judicial function in quite the same way that the standard of review does.",
  "Precisely, Justice Scalia.",
  "Right. And in that context you're not raising the same problem that you're referring to, Justice Ginsburg, because you're not saying anything about the standard of review. You're just simply saying that the court ought to decide the legal issues. Now, I do think that when the parties agree that it's a question of law that the question of law is for the district court to decide. My assumption is that the district court in fact will use de novo review, but the parties are not dictating that. That's a matter that's left -- I'm sorry.",
  "They do, but that issue - - that standard of review is not at issue in this particular case. The only question here is whether or not there has been an error of law committed, and obviously the district court found that there was a clear error of law committed. Indeed, the dissenting judge below said it was an irrational decision on the law.",
  "No. There are, there are clearly two different standards that are set out in the arbitration agreement and one of them is substantial evidence. But when the matter went from the arbitrator to the district court there was no issue presented by Hall Street on the question of substantial evidence. We didn't challenge any of the factual findings by the - - by the arbitrator, and therefore that issue is not presented. I'm not saying I wouldn't defend it. All I'm saying is I don't have to defend it in this particular case because the only issue here is whether there has been an error of law.",
  "Well, the problem there - - and again, I think this is largely a fanciful concern because I don't think serious parties who are engaged in arbitration agreements are likely to come up with standards that are completely alien to the judicial process, and indeed there's no empirical evidence to support that. Certainly Respondent didn't cite anything and our amici didn't cite anything like that. But to be sure, Judge Kozinski in his concurring opinion in the original panel decision in Kyocera said he would have a very different reaction to this case if we were talking about the district court either flipping a coin or looking at the entrails of dead birds as the basis for decision. And our basic point is we're not embracing that extreme approach. I mean, we recognize party autonomy as a significant part of what Section 2 of the Arbitration Act is all about and we think that ought to drive the analysis of this Court significantly, particularly in how you interpret Section 9.",
  "That's absolutely true, particularly in this context, Mr. Chief Justice, because here we have a situation where we were before the district court, this arrangement came out of the mediation process, the district court reviewed it, blessed it, sent it to the arbitrator - -",
  "-- and it came right back.",
  "No, no, I should win.",
  "Because the problem here is not what happens in the instance if, Section 9 not applying, that we're suddenly -- we go back to square one and start over. That might be true in a different case, but in this particular case we started in Federal district court. We brought this action as a -- as a contract action.",
  "Diversity, Your Honor.",
  "Right, and that's exactly what we would ask this Court to be doing here.",
  "No, Mr. Chief Justice, you've flipped it around. Remember, we lost in the arbitration. We won in the district court. The district court was prepared to enforce the agreement.",
  "Both the underlying lease agreement and the arbitration agreement. It was the court of appeals that said no, you can't do that, you can't enter a final judgment in this case, and the reason is - -",
  "-- because of the Federal Arbitration Act.",
  "Right. No, that's absolutely true. But that's exactly what we're asking you to do here.",
  "Right.",
  "I thought that - -",
  "I was just looking for the case of the day, Your Honor, actually.",
  "Well, we know that -- I think the answer to that is that Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, which this Court has recognized repeatedly has a very strong preference for enforcing the agreement of the parties, is a part of the answer to that. And you couple that with the fact that Justice Story, back as early as 1814, said that as a matter of common law that the notion of restricted arbitration is a matter completely left to the parties. So I think that there are general common law standards. Now, you know, could Oregon law have gone the other way on that? Maybe. I think it would be an interesting preemption question. But the Respondent has never argued that this is unenforceable as a matter of Oregon law. So I don't think that issue is in this case. As a matter of case management, if the Court wants to defer to anything then it ought to refer to the district court's own assessment that this agreement should be utterly enforceable, that - -",
  "Right. They never - -",
  "That it is enforceable?",
  "No, we've never argued - -",
  "-- Oregon law.",
  "No, no.",
  "Right, but the State law contract action that they're talking about is precisely the State law contract action we brought in this case before the Federal district court under diversity jurisdiction. And at the end of the day what we're asking for is for the Court to enforce - -",
  "-- the district judge's determination - -",
  "Because it falls squarely within the Federal Arbitration Act.",
  "Right. But I think the answer to that is that if Congress had a choice as between those alternatives, Congress clearly in Section 9 made it absolutely indisputable that there's a simple way to enforce it, but it didn't suggest the alternative, which is that you relegate it to some kind of State law, completely complicated process to try and get this arbitration award enforced under those circumstances.",
  "No, we clearly can't do that.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. And I think the Court, this Court is the court that's got to decide that at this point and - -",
  "To be sure.",
  "I don't think we disagree on that, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the -- I think that's enforceable.",
  "Well, the benefit is the efficiency that the Federal Arbitration Act is trying to promote. I mean, to be sure, there -- there could potentially be any number of routes you might want to identify. The clearest one is where the parties don't care about what happens on the back end, where they say, once you get your -- you have your -- you get your arbitration award and then you go off and you do Section 9 and we don't have any agreement on that. And that one is easy, and that's the most efficient. Then the question is what do you do in a situation where the parties don't agree with that, where they want the district court to review it.",
  "Those are regulated by State law.",
  "Purely by State law. But this is the contract that falls within Section 2, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Well, that's sort of the core question I think that sort of comes out of Southland and - -",
  "I mean, I think that's what Southland - -",
  "That's the logic of Southland, Your Honor.",
  "Right.",
  "But I think the answer to the conundrum you've raised, Mr. Chief Justice, is that if you're not in Section 9, then you ought to be in Section 2, and there you should do precisely what the contract says, which is that you should vacate or set aside the arbitration agreement - -",
  "-- unless -- if there's an error in law.",
  "No, I - -",
  "No, I don't need Section 9. All I need is Section 2 because if -- because under our agreement, what we specifically say is that the district court shall vacate, modify, or correct. We're looking for them to correct this award by saying that the right interpretation of this lease is that this is an applicable environmental law, and therefore the indemnification extends and we are protected.",
  "That's what I want under Section 2.",
  "That's true, but that's -- it seems to me that just makes my point, which is I don't need Section 9, Your Honor. All I need -- all I need is an aggressive, not even aggressive -- a fair interpretation of Section 2 that says that the parties' intent controls under these circumstances.",
  "That's quite true.",
  "Well, I don't know that that's the problem. You're right, I don't want Section 9 to be controlling here, but I don't think it's meant to be controlling under these circumstances. I think what -- I mean they're making the Section 9 argument. All I'm saying is that there's not a problem created by Section 9.",
  "I'm sorry, Justice Souter.",
  "When you say \"it's meant to be controlling,\" I don't - -",
  "Section 9. I'm sorry.",
  "Yes. Well, the answer -- the plain language doesn't -- doesn't say what happens if the parties reach a different agreement. The first - -",
  "Well, I think -- well, first of all, it would seem to me less likely that that's true, given the common law history that comes out of Justice Story's opinion, which said restrictive arbitrations are common.",
  "Justice Souter, there are two -- there are two questions there, so let me try to answer both of your questions. The first one is: What does the plain meaning of the statute say? The plain meaning of the statute, which is at 1a of the appendix to the petition, is the parties in their agreement agreed that a judgment of the court shall be entered upon the award. We never agreed to that, so the plain language of Section 9 simply doesn't get you there. Section 9 envisions that this is a -- that this is an understanding.",
  "Because under Section 2 the parties have -- have provided a mechanism for that by saying that the district court will correct an award if it's erroneous as a matter of law.",
  "Right. But all I'm saying is that Section 9 doesn't apply in this particular context, and, therefore, it makes all the sense in the world to --",
  "Well, hopefully I can persuade you by rereading the portion of the statute, that the first sentence of Section 9, which is at Appendix 1: \"If the parties\" - -",
  "1a of the appendix to the petition. Section 9: \"If the parties in their agreement have agreed that a judgment of the court shall be entered upon the award\" - -",
  "These parties didn't agree that a judgment would be entered on the award. They agreed that a judgment would be entered on the basis of whether there was a non-erroneous declaration of law by the arbitrator.",
  "Correct.",
  "Correct.",
  "Both parties agreed to it under Section 2.",
  "Well, if you -- if you want to make a judgment call and you think there's really a judgment you have to make as between Section 2 and Section 9, then it seems to me that all of the Court's decisions have recognized that the single most important objective of the Federal Arbitration Act is embodied in Section 2, which is -- which is to enforce the intent of the parties - -",
  "-- is you way you should come out.",
  "Yes.",
  "What do you do?",
  "Right.",
  "But, Justice Souter - -",
  "Well, I think I have come to grips with it.",
  "No, it's not the intent of the parties to arbitrate. It is every facet of the agreement is to be enforced consistent with the intent of the parties.",
  "Well, of course not, Justice Souter.",
  "Well, to be sure. But the bottom line here -- and -- and I do want to answer the Illinois v. New York part of this, because I think that's a complete red herring in this case. But it still seems to me that if you think that there is an ambiguity with respect to Section 9, first you should resolve that ambiguity by construing it to implement the parties' intent, because that is the overriding objection to the FAA. And second - -",
  "-- if you go to Section 10 - -",
  "Okay. All right, let me answer the red herring. Then -- then I'll tell you what I think about Section 10. On the red herring, all - - all the -- first of all, there's nothing in the legislative history that suggests that Congress made some kind of conscious choice between New York and Illinois. They talk about the New York model. There is not a word in the legislative history about Illinois. So I don't think that's what the decision was. But even if that were the choice they made, that still doesn't go to the question of what do you do if the parties reach a different agreement.",
  "No. None of -- None of those cases fall in that category.",
  "That's exactly right.",
  "Correct.",
  "Well, I think the important part about Section 10 to keep in mind is -- is their argument also is predicated on the assumption that Section 10 exhaustively lists all of the grounds for modifying an -- vacating an arbitration award. And it is absolutely clear from this Court's decisions both in Wilko and in W.R. Grace that the list in Section 10 is not an exclusive list.",
  "The manifest disregard of the law and the -- and public policy. W.R. Grace says you can't enforce any contract that violates public policy.",
  "I -- I think, yes, I think it probably would, because - -",
  "I don't think Congress meant for it to be -- I don't think Congress intended for this to be not subject to change.",
  "I mean, you know, there are -- the question in all of these provisions is are there some components of the FAA that are meant to be mandatory, and there are others that are all subject to change. And I think that one strikes me at least as most likely subject to change, Justice Stevens. If there are no further questions, I'll reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Under Section 9. I hate to use the words \"broadly FAA,\" because here's the situation: You can have arbitration awards that are clearly covered under Section 2, but they are not covered under Section 9. Section 9 is a streamlined procedure for enforcement of arbitration where it's under the FAA. When Congress enacted the statute, they said, you know, we are going to give a streamlined approach. If you want to go quickly from award to judgment, you can go right into court and hear Section 9. That -- and you could agree to this. You have to agree to use Section 9. You have to agree to this confirmation. You come in, and that court must enforce that award, confirm that award, unless Sections 10 and 11 are met. And that's exactly what Congress did.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'll try to give you back some of that time before I'm done. In my experience in evaluating cases like this, it seems to me that in some ways where you end up depends in large measure on where you start. And the parties fundamentally disagree about whether or not this is an agreement that should be -- you know, who's got the burden? Do we have to show that this agreement is authorized by something or are we entitled to have this agreement and it's their burden to demonstrate clearly that Congress meant not to allow this to be enforced? And it seems to me clear that the answer to that is that it's their burden to find something specific in the Federal Arbitration Act or otherwise that precludes this. Section 9 doesn't get them there because Section 9 is predicated always on an agreement of the parties in the first instance, and so that's not a basis for doing that, but even if you thought Section - -",
  "I don't see how the severability ruling has any relevance to this particular problem, because what we're saying is we are entitled to enforce the -- the agreement of the parties with respect to exactly what the district court has the authority to do. The fact that it -- whether it's severable or not severable doesn't mean that we're not entitled to the enforcement of the agreement as written by the parties. Severability doesn't eliminate our right to have that part of the agreement - -",
  "Right, but all I'm saying is that I think that puts the cart before the horse. Remember, severability only comes up after the court of appeals had decided that this provision in the contract was unenforceable. And then the question is, is there any part -- you know, is the entire arbitration set aside. And what I'm saying is that initial decision is wrong. And, therefore, you don't have to worry about severability. And the reason why it's wrong is because it's their burden to show something in the Federal Arbitration Act that's, that precludes enforcement of this provision. Section 9 doesn't get you there. Section 10 wouldn't get you there because it's not - -",
  "Right. Because of the \"if\" clause.",
  "Well no - -",
  "Subject to the condition that the district court would make a determination that there was no error in law. And that -- I mean, that's -- you know, they had -- I mean - -",
  "Right. But the point is if, if all you do is agree to an arbitration, then Section 9 and Section 10 apply directly. But if you agree to an arbitration that is subject to legal error or review, okay, then the \"if\" clause doesn't prevent you from being allowed to have that portion enforced, Your Honor.",
  "I think the enforcement would be under the existing authority that the district court had in this particular case, because this was a case that was pending before the district court under diversity jurisdiction seeking to enforce the lease agreement. And we have a final decision from the arbitrator. The judge has now made a decision that that is wrong as a matter of law and has enforced the lease in a particular way. And so the question is, is that judgment of the district court subject to challenge? And our answer to that is no. There is nothing in the Federal Arbitration Act that prevents the district judge from doing precisely what it did.",
  "I'm not sure there is any inconsistency between those two things, between those two things -- statements.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. Well, all I'm saying is that we can win on either theory. My whole point here has been Section 9 doesn't prevent us from being able to do this. Section 10 is not an exhaustive list and, therefore, we are allowed to add to Section 10. And at the end of the day, regardless, you ought to interpret this under Section 2, consistent with the intent of the parties to ensure that we get what we want. The one point I did want to make about how all of this operates is, you know, in the relationship between the courts and arbitrators, it seems to there is probably no more important issue than who decides whether something is arbitratable. And yet, this Court held quite clearly in First Options that even though the statute says it's the arbitrator -- I mean, that it's the court, it can be made the arbitrator by the parties. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Souter, I want to go to your question, because, frankly, I think it is the key to the entirety of this case. And that is, what is the \"it\" that we are talking about? And what's absolutely critical here is, yes, there was -- you know, this is the first sale doctrine. It's easy to call it patent-exhaustion, but the truth is it's the first sale doctrine. And the question is, what was sold here? And the only sale that was involved here was the chipsets. And there is a completely separate patent that deals with the rest of the system and that deals with the method. And nothing -- and this is the key point of this. The exhaustion doctrine only goes as far as the sale.",
  "It would be -- and that's why you would ordinarily -- you don't deal with this as an exhaustion issue. That's why you would deal with this as an implied licensing issue. The assumption would be, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, that if I'm selling you something that only has a single use and that's in a separate patent, that you in fact are being licensed to go and use it that way. But what's absolutely critical in this case is that both the district court and the court of appeals specifically rejected the notion that there was any implied license. And it's important to realize this. Even as we approach this case, we didn't sue for any of the activities that predated when the other side received its notice. We sued only for the activities post notice. Why? Because at that stage it was absolutely clear that there was no implied license any longer and there's no basis for expanding the exhaustion doctrine to try to fill that void. The exhaustion doctrine ought to be retained as a very narrow first sale doctrine, because it doesn't have any congressional support or approval at this point. It is a logical way of proceeding. It protects people against being surprised when they purchase a particular product. But to go beyond that and to say that simply because that sale, that particular product is, quote, an \"essential feature\" of a separate patent and therefore you have now exhausted the rights to that second patent seems to me a stretch that - -",
  "I don't have any problem with your hypothetical because it's not this case. Your hypothetical deals with the situation of what would have happened if you had bought the chip. Would we be in a position to say, even though you bought the chip, we nevertheless want to retain some right to come out -- to come after you claiming we still have a patent in that chip? And the answer is no. We exhausted -- that was exhausted by the sale of the chip. The question is if you buy a pedal, can you then take that pedal that was designed for a bicycle, put it into a Stair Master - -",
  "-- patent in the Stair Master - -",
  "Right.",
  "That is true. But the -- but the point here is that that's not the relevant distinction. It's not whether or not this is in some sense an essential use. What this Court said in Univis is that this would be a very -- that would have been a very different case if there had been a separate patent on the grinding and finishing of those lenses. And that is precisely our case. There is a separate patent when you take those components and you then put them into our separate system. And from my perspective, Your Honor, the better way to analyze this is not as a question of exhaustion. Let's keep the exhaustion doctrine where it fits. It's a first sale component. You buy it, you exhaust. Let's use the implied licensing as the mechanism for dealing with related patents. But the beauty of that in this case, obviously, is that -- is that the implied license in this case the courts below have flatly said doesn't exist. And it goes to the point that you made, Justice Breyer, as well when you said, you know, I buy this and I sort of assume that I'm going to be able to use it in a particular way. These -- this is a $10 billion company that at the time they bought these components, these chips, received explicit and specific notice that the one thing they could not do was use these chips to build new systems and then sell those systems, obviously, beyond -- you know, under a completely separate patent.",
  "So it's not as though they didn't know what they were getting when they bought it. They bought cheap chips and turned them into $2,000 laptops because they didn't - -",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "No. Because that -- that depends on the scope of the patent exhaustion doctrine. If the patent exhaustion doctrine is limited to the sale of the specific product -- let's for instance assume for a moment that what in fact happened was that Intel sold the system, rather than the chips. Then that would - - that would exhaust the patent doctrine. Now, you know, the question is -- and here there is a disconnect in some respects between the Mallinckrodt decision in the Federal Circuit and some of this Court's previous decisions on to the extent to which you can condition a sale, and I think in some ways that language may have been given up what rights we might have been able to assert under Mallinckrodt on a somewhat broader basis. But I don't think it can be read any further than that, and it certainly -- and the key to this is it certainly doesn't in any way waive our rights, you know, as an implied license matter, because that's -- specifically what both the district court and the court of appeals held is there is no implied license in this particular context, and so therefore for them to prevail they have to expand the patent exhaustion doctrine or the first sale doctrine beyond the first sale; and that I submit to you is something that's simply not appropriate.",
  "I do not defend the Mallinckrodt decision, Justice Stevens, and clearly I don't believe I have to. All I need to do is have this Court recognize that the central limiting feature of Univis was the fact that it was all one patent and that all you were doing was fulfilling the rights that had been provided for you in that single patent, and that that that's fundamentally -- and that the Court recognized that if there were a separate patent involved and you were trying to enforce those rights, that would be a completely different matter.",
  "Right, the chip.",
  "Absolutely. There's no question about that. We have never challenged that, and I think the point I made earlier is also valid. We didn't challenge their use, their otherwise infringement of our system until we gave them notice; and at that point we said there is no implied license, because I do think, Mr. Chief Justice, it's a fair point, and it's the same point Justice Breyer made, which is, look, if you buy something and you think this is your normal assumption that you're going to use it in a particular way, that ought to be protected. I think that's ordinary kind of contract expectation rules. But the point here is that the language of this notice could not have been plainer to anyone - -",
  "Me too.",
  "Right.",
  "Pedal.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, in that -- in that particular context, in the absence of relatively clear notice, I think it would be quite reasonable to potentially find that there was an implied license to use it under those circumstances.",
  "Because the courts below specifically analyzed whether there was -- -",
  "No, no. They got it right because there was very specific and explicit notice provided to the purchaser at the time of the purchase that, while this clearly gives you the right to use this particular product, what it doesn't give you the right --",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, we can quarrel about sort of the nature of the notice and what notice is adequate to do that, but the basic point here, which I think is indisputable, is that, one, the notice here is quite clear. It's one page. It's very specific. These are very sophisticated parties and they understood that they were not obtaining an implied license by purchasing the chips rather than going out and purchasing the systems.",
  "Oh, to be sure. If I have separate patent on the bicycle, I'm entitled to stop people from using that particular bicycle. Now, generally speaking, to be sure, you don't go after the consumers because most people who are in the business of manufacturing don't develop a really good following by suing their ultimate consumers. So what you do is you find the people who are in the middle, the middle spot, who are actually doing the manufacturing and who are in fact violating the patent, and that's who you go after. And in this context - -",
  "Precisely -- I'm sorry.",
  "I think the better answer is one, because they had clear notice.",
  "Right. I think there is an argument as to whether there might be non-infringing uses. We disagree about that. But I think the better argument is one.",
  "No. The court below did not rely on that.",
  "Right, right. Well, I mean, the court of appeals had a much -- it was a much easier case, frankly - -",
  "Well, I mean I think the district court just said, look, that -- you know, ordinarily you would say, if you're buying something with the understanding that you're going to -- that its primary or maybe exclusive use will be in a particular way, that that would be a reasonable implied -- you could imply a license by those facts alone. Then the question is whether or not that implication has in some sense been clearly overridden by the conduct of the parties under the circumstances.",
  "Right. And once he received -- and once the - -",
  "No, but every -- every sale after - -",
  "No, no, but that just means that the patent - -",
  "Well, you mean both Intel and --",
  "Oh, yes. Both Intel and - - and Quanta clearly agreed -- I mean, both Intel and and LG clearly agreed to that, if that's what you're asking about. But the -- but the point here is that the notice was prior to the sale.",
  "Of the sale.",
  "Well, when else -- an implied license clearly can't extend to the ultimate purchaser until the ultimate purchaser gives something.",
  "Right.",
  "But we clearly didn't do that. That -- I mean that -- the two court rulings clearly resolved that.",
  "Right. But if I say at the time, but you cannot use it in a bicycle because it has a separate patent, and therefore\" - -",
  "Yes, that's exactly what the notice says.",
  "But that goes to clear -- I mean, but that goes to the clear understanding -- I mean the question is -- if the question is did Intel have the right to sell the system as a system, the answer is yes. It was licensed to do that. But it didn't sell the system as a system. It sold the components of the system. And then the question is, does it have as a consequence of that some kind of an implied license to do this? And the courts below both specifically held no. And I think the other thing about this, Justice Scalia, is that this was not an issue in this case. Both courts below held that that's not the question presented. In order for the Petitioner in this case to prevail, they have to demonstrate that this is an exhaustion concept.",
  "That's the question presented in the petition.",
  "Right, and the problem - -",
  "I think so.",
  "Because, because it ignores the fact that there are separate patents involved in this case. There is no question that -- there is an issue. I mean I don't think there's a question that - - you know, as to how far you can go down the road in trying to condition a particular sale. I thought this Court may have resolved this already. Mallinckrodt leaves that issue open, but that's not -- that's not the question. The issue here is if I sell to you, Justice Souter, a particular chip, whether I condition it or not, I think that's -- to me that's unenforceable. But the question is, can you then take that chip and use it to violate a separate patent? And the reason you know that it's not exhaustion - -",
  "Right.",
  "Exactly.",
  "T hat's not the issue in this case.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "That's - -",
  "That is correct, Justice Souter.",
  "And let me further - -",
  "Well, I think that clearly understates the role of the PTO in granting a separate patent. I mean, this is not -- these are not things you pick up at the corner drugstore. You have to justify them. And if you look at Section 282, \"a patent shall be presumed valid,\" each claim shall be presumed valid independently of the validity of other claims. And there's an independence that's embedded in this entire scheme. If it's true that the PTO has in fact granted patent rights on something that's fundamentally not different from the other -- from some other patent, the solution to that is a validity challenge. And candidly, I think that's exactly what all of those arguments are --",
  "-- is patent validity challenges.",
  "Right, but all -- I'm not - - I'm not particularly criticizing the PTO. What I'm saying is that the statutory scheme presumes that there is a separateness when a patent is issued and, therefore -- and which is why -- again, the first -- there's no reason to go to an expansion of the first-sale doctrine in order to deal with the kinds of problems you have here because in general -- in general you can deal with it as a matter of implied license, but that issue has been resolved adverse to the other side in this case, and there's no reason to sort of fill in that void.",
  "That's correct.",
  "From Intel to the buyers.",
  "Yes. That's -- that's the critical component of this case.",
  "The buyer would have to assert exhaustion.",
  "To be sure, Intel has the authority to sell these things, and it has the authority to sell -- it depends on what the things are. It has the authority to sell the chips. It has the authority to sell the systems, but what it doesn't have the authority to do is to allow somebody downstream to take the chips and put them into the separately patented systems, and the -- and the people downstream know that they don't have that entitlement. Justice Souter, to me the patent-exhaustion doctrine is - -",
  "I think the answer to that is it shouldn't, that the exhaustion doctrine should be retained as a first-sale doctrine alone. That's the way it's always been understood for 150 years. And to expand it this way is to undermine the rights of -- in the separate patents. And now I'll try to make the point I wanted to make to Justice Souter. Read the reply brief: A sale authorized by one patentee does not exhaust patents held by a different patentee. So we wouldn't even be in this case if it turned out that we didn't just -- we didn't happen to have all of these rights in the first place. I mean, if they bought the chips and if Wang had held on to some portion of the system patent in this case, there is no question that Wang would have the full opportunity -- that sale didn't exhaust their rights in that patent.",
  "I mean there can't -- there's no serious basis for doubting what Intel knew precisely what it was getting in this. It was getting peace on both sides of the aisle in terms of litigation, and it knew that there were separate patents here and that when it sold the chips it would certainly be entitled to assume that there would be exhaustion. That's the provision you read. But when it sells the chips, it didn't know and it specifically gave notice that it recognized that that doesn't remotely say what the right answer is with respect to the systems and with respect to the methods. And that to me, Mr. Chief Justice, is the fundamental distinction.",
  "Well, that's part of the reason why it was negotiated in that way. But I mean that is -- so far as I know, there is no particular issue by reference to that particular limitation. The reality is if we entered into the same agreement with AMD, which is one of the other chipmakers, I am sure they would ask for the same restriction on it: That you could only do it with AMD products, as well. I mean that doesn't have anything to do with the nature of the underlying problem that we are confronting in this particular context. It seems to me the fundamental issue here is they have a limited right when they purchase that product. They didn't get the right to make other products. They didn't get the right to breach or infringe a completely separate patent. And that is the basis on which the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which is all that is before the Court, should be affirmed.",
  "Well, I mean they recognized specifically that these are completely separate. That the claims that are at issue here are different from the amounts that were -- from the products that were, in fact, purchased. So the elements, the constituent elements, they have clearly embraced. The conclusion, they have clearly not embraced.",
  "Well, my - -",
  "Well, what I was actually saying is that if you read the language in 4a and 5a where it says: The patents asserted by LGE do not cover the products licensed to, or sold by, Intel. They have to be combined with additional components. And then in 5a they say: Notably, the sale involved a component of the inserted, patented invention, not the entire patented system. So they recognize, to my mind, what are the predicate factual bases from which I say the \"exhaustion doctrine\" shouldn't have been -- shouldn't have been triggered. But, to be sure, they -- they -- it was a much easier task for them because they -- as far as they are concerned, all kinds of conditions are permissible. And we don't need that in order to win this case. I'm not asking the Court to embrace that particular approach. If there are no other questions, I would ask you to affirm the decision.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Six years ago, this Court in Buckman recognized that policing fraud against Federal agencies is hardly a field the states have traditionally occupied. Based on that premise, this Court in Buckman struck down a novel State tort that was based on the whole concept of fraud on the FDA. And the Court concluded that that tortious analysis as a matter of State law would inevitably conflict with the FDA's responsibility to police fraud. A responsibility that the Court recognized was essentially cradle to grave covered by Federal law. It arises out of Federal law, it is regulated by Federal law and it is ultimately terminated by Federal law. Michigan has adopted a unique product liability statute, and on the one hand confers a very broad immunity of defense against all product liability claims for manufacturers who comply with the FDA's requirements. But then on the other hand, withdraws that immunity for the defense, this is PDA App. 42A, if the manufacturer intentionally withholds from or misrepresents to the United States Food and Drug Administration information concerning the drug that is required to be submitted pursuant to -- and then it goes and lists very specific provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act -- and the drug would not have been approved or the Food and Drug Administration would have withdrawn approval. It is difficult for me to imagine a statute that would more consciously and openly tread into exactly the same territory that this Court declared in Buckman as a matter of exclusive Federal and concern not available to the states to regulate.",
  "I will acknowledge that's a fundamentally different issue, Justice Scalia, because there you are talking about what duties are owed to the public that are enforced by the FDA and potentially are enforceable by the states as well. But here we're talking about duties that are owed from the manufacturer exclusively - -",
  "That suit would not be barred, I don't think, by Buckman. I think the question there will really go to what the Court is going to decide next term in Wyeth as to how far when if you have FDA approval of certain activities that that has the effect of - -",
  "I don't think it is an unreasonable next step, but it is clearly the next step that has to be taken. Because what this Court decided in Buckman -- and it's central and candidly we are here seeking a very narrow ruling from the Court is that when you're defining the relationship between the manufacturer and the seller of the drugs and the FDA in terms of the disclosure of information to that entity and the determination both whether that information is adequate to allow the agency to perform its business and then, more fundamentally, whether or not the agency is acting in accordance with its own exclusive authority to decide how to proceed - -",
  "It seems to me that the same argument you just made, Justice Scalia, would have led the Court to the opposite result in Buckman, because what's the -- you know, if Congress didn't care about allowing State tort law to be -- to serve as the enforcement mechanism, then why wouldn't you allow them to do that in that context as well? And this Court said the reason is because there is a very uniquely Federal interest in taking care of the business and the relationship between those two entities.",
  "Well, when you say \"here\" what we're talking -- what we're talking about here is a very unique State statute that is the sole basis on which the tort liability is set aside. We're not -- we're not pre-empting the underlying tort claims by the Federal law that's at issue in this case. The State statute pre-empts the common law court claims. That first portion of the defense wipes those out. So it's not pre-emption of the traditional State law cause of action, as the Second Circuit wrongly evaluated it. What we're talking about here is a provision that in the most exquisite terms says: Allow the State, either by the court or the juries, to evaluate the adequacy of the information that the FDA required. And it's important to understand how that plays out, because what it says is pursuant to those statutes. It specifically identifies provisions in the statutes. It doesn't say anything about how the FDA - - how the FDA interprets those statutes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, I think what you're basically arguing for is an argument I think one of the amici made on the other side, which is: Does the greater power include the lesser power? That is, if we had the authority not to give you a defense in the first place, don't we have the authority to use this as a lever in order to allow us essentially to undertake to regulate in precisely the same way the FDA would? And the answer is: No, because this is not a situation - -",
  "Well, I think it is an unconstitutional condition. But I think the bottom line is it's not a question of us taking the bad with the good. The problem here is that the Federal Government has an independent interest, and it is the Federal Government's independent interest that is being essentially wiped away.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, that's clearly a question of State law. I mean, that's a severability issue to be sure. And I -- but I think it's not fair to condemn the way the Sixth Circuit analyzed this case. What the Sixth Circuit said is if it's still available to the State to come in after the FDA has both found that there has been a material deception of one sort or another and that the FDA has decided to withdraw the product as a consequence of that, and that -- and then State law is allowed to come in and enforce product liability claims under those circumstances, that the legislature would have been perfectly satisfied with that arrangement. And, candidly, that is precisely what we have asked for before both the Second Circuit and this Court.",
  "Correct.",
  "I think the question goes to how far that response goes. If you in fact instructed, if the trial judge instructed the jury that if it found, and then just quoted the language of the statute that there's no, then I'd say, yes, that is pre-empted in precisely the same way. And the language the Court used in Buckman was \"critical element.\" If the FDA's regulatory authority is a critical element of the case, then, yes, it is pre-empted. Whether or not -- whether evidence by itself would be a critical element is harder to tell.",
  "Sure.",
  "I mean, the government is probably in a better position to evaluate that than I am. But, you know - -",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I think what the Court said in Buckman about that probably applies equally here, which is that, rather than look to see whether there is, in fact, going to be an interference, we ought to recognize that this is a territory that is locked off exclusively to the Federal Government's control, and we shouldn't -- and there shouldn't be that external pull, the extraneous pull, that State law provides under these circumstances. And the same logic obviously applied here would say: We don't wait until there's a serious interference with how the FDA is trying to do its job; we try to prevent that because there's no -- there's no legitimate State interest to be served here.",
  "No. I think there's a difference between the bribery statute, because again that doesn't go to the direct relationship between the manufacturer or the seller or the regulated entity and the FDA itself. That goes to the relationship between -- that -- that is governed by a different set of laws. And I think it's traditionally been the case that States are in fact entitled to enforce laws against bribery of Federal officials. So I don't think the same -- as I say, what I'm looking for here is an extremely narrow ruling from this Court.",
  "Well, I think - -",
  "Well, I think when the - -",
  "No, I'm not going to let a jury decide that.",
  "What the district court found here, obviously, was that there was compliance, because the other side didn't challenge the compliance.",
  "And, candidly, I think that is going to happen 99.999 percent of the time, because that's not going to be the issue. But, you know, could it eventually be a problem if a State jury -- if a State court were to decide that there hasn't been compliance? It seems to me that's much closer, again, to what you're going to take up again next term in Wyeth. I think that is a legitimate issue, but it's a very different one from the question of how do you regulate the relationship between a -- the regulated entity and the FDA in terms of the information flow that goes between those two entities.",
  "Even if there is no pre-emption on -- on the -- well, I hope I win this case regardless.",
  "Right, well -- you mean I would have won this case on the merits of it?",
  "Well, I mean, clearly we know that the FDA didn't withdrew this as a consequence of fraud. So in that sense, I suppose you're right, but - - but the reality is that the more fundamental problem remains, whether or not these kinds of statutes are still out there, are going to create this -- as the Court said -- extraneous pull.",
  "We don't have any problem with that, Justice Breyer.",
  "No, we were very - -",
  "If the Court wanted to go that way, that's fine. I don't think it's presented in this case, but that wouldn't present any problem for us. I think what we -- what we have here is the Second Circuit is wrong, and the judgment should be reversed. Thank you, Your Honors.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens. Hopefully, I'll give you back some of that time, so you can get to lunch. Justice Kennedy, I think the best case for us without Buckman would have been Hoyle versus United Technologies. That's a case involving again a uniquely federal interest. And the advantage of that particular case is it also reflects that pre-emption is not an all or nothing proposition. You can preempt out the specific parts that is offensive and retain the part of State law that is not offensive. And that's precisely what we're trying to do in this case.",
  "Well, I think that's what made it a uniquely Federal interest. But I don't know that it's any more a uniquely Federal interest than this one. At least this is the way the Court has analyzed both of them in Buckman. Justice Ginsburg, with respect to severability, I think, frankly, the Second Circuit already answered the question. They said that we would defer to the Sixth Circuit under Factors and then analyze certification. And it concluded that, given the clarity of the Sixth Circuit's decision in Garcia, that there's nothing left to be decided on that issue.",
  "Well, if you -- if you - -",
  "I would suggest you read the Petition Appendix 14a, where it says on the one hand, under Factors we are bound to follow Garcia's conclusions as to questions of Michigan State law, and then the footnote reflects that the Sixth Circuit in Garcia had clearly decided the severability issue here. So, frankly, if - -",
  "To be sure. But on the other hand, it does seem to me that it spoke specifically to the issue and recognized the right outcome.",
  "Oh, but there is a discussion of that in the Sixth Circuit decision. Garcia specifically deals with that, because it says the bitter that you have to take is if the FDA in fact makes all of the very specific and intricate findings that are required by the exception and concludes that the product should be withdrawn for fraud, then in fact you get the bitter, which is that the lawsuit goes forward under those circumstances, and that that's the reasonable compromise that the State legislature had in mind or would have been satisfied with.",
  "All I'm saying is I think the Court addressed that in Garcia and specifically concluded that the legislature in fact would have passed that; And that traditionally, the Second Circuit would defer, as would this Court.",
  "No, clearly it's not foreclosed.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Exactly. Justice Scalia, I'd like to answer your question about if we were going forward with respect to withdrawal as opposed to looking back. I mean, the FDA still has the authority to order disgorgement, to order restitution for victims. I think the notion that the FDA is indifferent to claims of fraud is just -- is flatly offensive. The reality is - -",
  "Well, whatever injuries - - yeah, I mean, I don't know exactly what the sweep of restitution would be, but disgorgement of profits would certainly provide a mechanism for providing - -",
  "I understand that. All I'm suggesting, Justice Stevens, is that there are remedial mechanisms still available to the FDA if in fact it concluded that there was some problem, and that those - -",
  "Well, as I understood the FDA's position is that they have pretty broad remedial authority and that it extends to some form of restitution to the victims. So I - -",
  "Well, I mean, there is a provision for citizen petitions that exists, that's cited. So, yes, there is a mechanism.",
  "Well, no. It entertains it. In point of fact, there was a petition filed by Public Citizen to withdraw Rezulin in this specific case, and it was reviewed and it was rejected for exactly the reason Justice Breyer identified, because if you took it off the market, people would die. That was the concern that drove the FDA to say: We're not going to do that under these circumstances. If there are no further questions, Your Honors.",
  "Your Honor, we do agree that that last part, Justice Scalia, looking at could there have been a rational basis, is the proper test. But that is a factual determination at some level that, as this Court in Kimel and a variety of other cases has said, that you still have to look to the underlying facts. And even the Solicitor General doesn't disagree at page 5 of their brief when they say you have to look to whether -- that whatever that rationale is, it is supported by the record. The government had the opportunity to --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It seems to me that if the argument that just ended doesn't prove anything, it suggests that perhaps the Court ought to follow the simple expedient of read the statute as it's written, apply it as written and come to what strikes me, at least, as a reasonably easy resolution of this particular case. The statute says that a party aggrieved by the alleged failure to arbitrate -- and we have that precisely in this case because the other side has filed a lawsuit against our indemnitee arising out of an underlying dispute -- may petition any United States district court which, save for such an agreement -- it's pretty clear that everybody agrees that in this context you just simply put the agreement aside -- and then you say would have jurisdiction under Title 28 in a civil action of the subject matter of the suit arising out of the controversy between the parties. It seems to me reasonably clear to interpret that language as saying you look to the underlying dispute between the parties.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, the language of section 4 actually talks about the subject matter of a suit arising out of, not the existence of a suit; and section 4 doesn't require that a lawsuit have been filed. So it's not appropriate simply to say to yourself look at what litigation actually exists, because in as many cases as not there is not going to be any litigation ongoing. So the court has to make the hypothetical: would the court have had jurisdiction over the subject matter of this dispute? And the dispute in this case, which Professor Ortiz was very explicit about -- he said specifically that if he had brought this as an affirmative lawsuit it would have arisen under Federal law. It seems to me that's as clear a concession that the nature of this dispute is a question of Federal law. And therefore - -",
  "I think what the judge has to do is to take -- is to give the plaintiff in the section 4 complaint the benefit of his allegations. And we have made an allegation here that the subject matter of this dispute arises under Federal law, and we did that not just based on our own assessment of the situation in the abstract, but we did that on the basis that she had filed a very specific claim against us asserting that we had violated essentially section 20.",
  "But Justice Ginsburg, I think the difference is that we are not seeking to remove her original lawsuit. That's not -- if that were the case, then I think the argument you're making is a legitimate one. All we are seeking to do is to assert our independent section 4 rights and that's not at all dependent on the - -",
  "Well, there are a couple possibilities. I mean, first of all, the arbitration agreement is quite explicit in saying that if, if you - - if this starts off as litigation and then a subsequent claim is made by either of the parties, the parties have the right to enforce the arbitration as to that particular claim. So that's specifically what we did in this particular case. So in theory, at least the collection action would remain in State court as a State cause of action, although it would certainly be available to the Petitioner in this case to say, well, no, if you're going to arbitrate that portion of the case then I'm content to arbitrate the rest of the case as well. So they could do it that way or we could arbitrate the Federal law.",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Oh, right. Yeah -- no - - exactly. That's absolutely true.",
  "Right.",
  "But I couldn't -- I couldn't remove it - -",
  "I think that was the point she was trying to make.",
  "Right. I -- I understand that, Justice Ginsburg, but the -- the -- but the point I am trying to make here is that the language of section 4 just talks about the subject matter of the controversy between the parties. It doesn't specifically talk about an existing lawsuit, and frankly it doesn't envision the existence of a specific lawsuit.",
  "Well, in that - -",
  "But -- no -- well, I mean you could -- you can certainly view it as part of the same controversy, but the -- but the bottom line is, the question is: Would a Federal court have jurisdiction over the dispute that arises under Federal law between the Petitioner and the Respondents? And the answer is clearly yes.",
  "It's defined by our complaint in section 4.",
  "Well, I'm not sure -- I'm not even sure - -",
  "Well, I -- I mean the problem with that -- I mean the difficulty arises, Justice Scalia, because the language of the statute does say that the court has to determine whether it would have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the controversy. And then that - -",
  "Well, with his interpretation, you have to imagine everything. In point of fact, you have to imagine that this had something to do with ouster when it doesn't use the word \"ouster.\"",
  "It has to do with equity and law when it uses \"equity\" and \"law\" in other contexts. And - -",
  "Well, no. That's true, but what it -- but -- but the flip side of that is that this is a section, a fundamental provision, of the Federal Arbitration Act that apparently was designed to provide a basis of Federal jurisdiction for the Gila Indian Tribe claims. It seems inconceivable to me that Congress had that narrow an interpretation of section 4 in mind when it passed this particular law.",
  "But I think all of this really is talking -- I mean this is not significantly different - -",
  "Right.",
  "And it may well be, Justice Scalia, that in that context the answer is that the court will say that the claim is unripe; that we don't know for sure whether or not this is going to congeal into a real dispute between the parties. And if that's the case, obviously, then the court does not have to go forward. But you don't have to worry about that in the context of this particular litigation because that dispute has congealed. The parties are at loggerheads over the particular issue in this case. And -- I'm sorry.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. Although, you know, that's to the -- obviously, that sets aside the arbitration agreement completely.",
  "Well, first of all, section 4 doesn't apply in - -",
  "To be sure, section 2 does, but whether or not - -",
  "Right, but the flip side of that is - -",
  "Because we have serious doubts as to whether or not in fact we will have our Federal rights protected as zealously as we would in a Federal court.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, Justice Kennedy. I believe we could have done both of those.",
  "Well, because we brought the action under section 4, which I think - -",
  "Assuming there's no statute of limitations issue, and I don't know that there would be, but that would available. But it still seems to me that the bottom-line question is: Are you entitled to bring an action under section 4?",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Right, and the judge would have the discretion to decide - -",
  "Right.",
  "Right. There could be a letter that says, look, what you're doing here violates Federal law, and if you don't stop it, we are going to take action against you. And then we have to sit there and wait.",
  "But they are here. They are here.",
  "And that's precisely what we've asked for here, Justice Breyer.",
  "Right.",
  "Right, and there's no question about that, and it's - -",
  "And I understand that, Mr. Chief Justice. And in the right case, you know, I'm not sure how I would come out in that particular - -",
  "You see, I would comply with the original complaint.",
  "Right. Well, that's exactly what the Eleventh Circuit held.",
  "Right.",
  "Well -- and in the right case, the Federal -- you know, if I had to go that far, I might well make that argument, Mr. Chief Justice, but in this case I don't have to go that far. And I think all the Court needs to resolve is in a situation where the parties have a very concrete dispute between them, one that arises exclusively under Federal law, and a party seeks to have that claim arbitrated under section 4 pursuant to - -",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Yes, the State court suit is pending.",
  "The State court has stayed its hand pending the outcome of the Federal litigation. So we'll see what happens. But, obviously, as I say - -",
  "Well, I mean, in some ways, as I say, it seems to me that's Petitioner's right or potentially -- or ours. I suppose either side could ask to have that arbitrated, but the truth is if you took - -",
  "Right.",
  "But see, Justice Ginsburg, I think that's not right. I think that actually what happens is you eliminate what I perceive to be the Federal question in this through the arbitral process. You still have the underlying collection action. If the Court says, no, there is no violation of the usury laws, you have not overcharged, you have not made any mistakes, the question we still have is a claim on the debt and her obligation to pay it. Now, whether she wants to adjudicate that in State court or resolve it as part of the arbitral process, that's really up to her as far as how that goes. But the arbitration agreement could not be plainer in saying that you can divide up the claims for purposes of seeking arbitration, and that seems to fit perfectly well with an effort to say that there is a specific claim here that arises exclusively under Federal law, and that, therefore, we can enforce our arbitration rights pursuant to that section 4 right. And that's, frankly, all we are trying to accomplish here, Justice Ginsburg. The second part of the statute which is the -- you know, the one that has obviously created the greatest amount of controversy here, is, you know, \"would have jurisdiction over the subject matter.\" Again, it seems to me that this is the easiest case the Court is going to face in this area, because here is one where there is no question - -",
  "Well, I think what's going to happen -- I candidly don't think they are going to come up that much, in part because these issues have been around a long time. You know, it's not like there have been dozens of these kinds of issues arising over time. I don't think it's likely to be that big a problem. But again, it seems to me that district courts have the authority to resolve this, because if they don't believe that there really is a Federal claim that would justify exercise of section 4, they can say that. If they do, then they will -- then they will send it. I mean, look -- the other thing about this is, you know, the other side makes a big fuss about federalism, but we are not asking to take the issues away from the Federal court -- from the State courts to the Federal courts. What we are asking for is what everybody has agreed to here, which is to have these disputes resolved by arbitration.",
  "There is no question about that, Justice Ginsburg. The problem is that there is some lack of confidence in the State courts that we will get the same treatment under section 4 that we would get in Federal court. And Congress created that right.",
  "Well, I wish it were that easy to get this Court to grant review of everything that I bring up here in the first place.",
  "I appreciate that.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. But the -- and that's fine and we have to live with that. And obviously, since we can't change the standards of review on the back end under sections 9, 10 and 11, we are going to be pretty much stuck with that -- with that determination. But the truth is the bigger risk is that the trial judge, the State court will not send it to arbitration.",
  "No.",
  "I mean, It wasn't litigated. It's not clear on the face of the opinion. So if there is something he knows that I don't know, maybe. But I -- I -- certainly nothing in there that reflects that -- that view of the world.",
  "Well, now, the nondiverse party issue, it depends on how you read section 4. You know, section 4 talks about the parties. And the parties there I don't think means parties to the underlying controversy. I think there parties refers specifically to the dispute in front of the court. So I don't think the pass-through problem for 1332 applies in that particular context for complete diversity. I don't think Congress envisioned you would look beyond the immediate dispute under section 4 to see whether there are additional parties, except to the extent, obviously, that you would have necessary and indispensable party litigation that might bring them in. I think the assumption is you take the complaint as it's written, and then you look to see whether or not there is amount of controversy. For that you have to go beyond because the dispute with respect to arbitration is not going to get you anywhere near that number. And you have to look beyond for Federal questions to see whether or not there is a Federal issue there to be enforced.",
  "I'm not going to give a good response?",
  "Under their interpretation?",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "Sure. Right.",
  "Right. Assuming the amount of - -",
  "Assuming the amount of controversy -- I mean, it could have an amount - -",
  "Right. It has to have an independent basis for Federal jurisdiction.",
  "Well, that's exactly our point. That's why you have to look through.",
  "Pretty much that's our view of the case.",
  "Yes. I'm sure my opponent will say something different than that.",
  "Yes.",
  "Probably not.",
  "Right.",
  "Oh absolutely. I mean, you know, in a situation -- it depends on how you interpret it. If you interpret it the way that the Petitioner does in saying that you can't have any look through - - now he softens that and says, well, no, you can have look through for diversity. But if you accept the idea that section 4 only makes you look at the dispute at the arbitration level, then the reality is you're going to have no cases that are going to be covered, because you're never going to satisfy the amount in controversy. And then the issue is why do you get to look through for diversity purposes and never get to look through for Federal question purposes? And it -- it seems to me the much easier way to reconcile the language of the statute is to say, of course, you look through to see, particularly if you have an unquestioned Federal question dispute that's being litigated between the parties; we know that; there is not an issue before us. In fact, he has conceded as much even here in court today. And so, it seems to me that's the solution to this case. Now admittedly, there will be other cases where you may have right in these questions, and there will be other cases where the parties will have to fight at the Federal district court level as to precisely what's at issue and what the plaintiff really means to be fighting over. And it may be in some instances you won't get an order that directs arbitration. But that's not this case.",
  "Well, there are two problems with that. First of all, the statute talks about the subject matter of the controversy. It doesn't talk about the specific controversy. And second of all, the statute clearly envisions that there are going to be situations where there is no complaint, there is no underlying State court cause of action, and it still envisions in that situation that a district court is going to have to determine whether or not it would have jurisdiction.",
  "But it seems to me that's precisely what the language \"would have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the controversy\" asks this Court to make a determination of.",
  "But it seems to me, Justice Ginsburg, the better way to think about this is what if we were getting letters from the Petitioner saying you are engaged in usurious conduct, you're outrageous, you got to stop what you're doing, we are going to bring a class action against you, you had better change your behavior tomorrow, and they don't sue us, and they don't sue us, and they don't sue us? And then the question is are we entitled to go to court to get that resolved and are we entitled to have the resolution to that issue as a matter of arbitration?",
  "Right. Well, that's - - actually, you're right.",
  "That is this case.",
  "Right. I thought your question absolutely nailed it because you said, would this -- you know, if you brought that suit could you and would you, and the answer is yes, you could, and therefore you know as -- without any question that it's a Federal suit.",
  "Right. I think that's no doubt that that's their position.",
  "Well, I mean the interesting thing about 9, 10 and 11 is if anything the language is broader than our language. If we didn't have the \"save for\" and \"would have jurisdiction under,\" this would clearly be an action that arises under Federal law, because the question, you know, section 4 says have you been aggrieved, do you have a right of action, and do you have a remedy for that action? I mean, without this rigamarole that we've been talking about this whole time, we would have -- we would easily have a 1331 action. So if anything you would argue that 9, 10 and 11 arise under Federal law regardless. Now if you don't want to go that far, then it seems to me you just say you read sections 9, 10 and 11 and pairing material with the limitation in Section 4 and you wouldn't read it any broader than that. But there is no basis for taking the unlimited languages in 9, 10 and 11 and somehow distorting that to more narrowly limit the rights that we have under Section 4. So I - -",
  "Yes. This case arises under section 4 through Section 27.",
  "Yes, it does create it, because section 4, without the \"would have jurisdiction\" language clearly would be arising under jurisdiction, in my judgment, and the only thing -- and then it places an additional requirement on you. You can't just use the contract that gets you into Federal court. You have to then look to see whether you would have had an underlying cause of action or an underlying Federal claim or whether there would have been diversity jurisdiction on the underlying claim.",
  "Because I think -- I think the reference in the statute to controversy clearly envisions the underlying dispute between the parties, because it's not just the arbitration agreement and it's not even just the controversy; it's the subject matter of the controversy, and you compare that to section 2 and it's clear that what the Congress has in mind there is the underlying dispute between the parties.",
  "Well, I mean, I don't know if it's compromised by it. I think it -- the Beneficial case makes it absolutely clear that we have here a Federal claim and therefore - -",
  "Right. But again I don't think -- I don't think section 4 is asking the courts to make that determination. I think what section 4 is asking the Court to look at is the subject matter of the controversy, and is it -- is it clear under the circumstances that there is in fact a Federal claim underlying it? And here there is no question on that. I ask you to affirm.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think I would like to start with Justice Scalia's narrowest question in terms of the easiest way to resolve this case, which is did the FCC in its remand order in fact recognize that it had made a change in policy and therefore dealt forthrightly with the fact that it had made a change in policy. While it is true that the Second Circuit was prepared to accept the idea that the Commission had changed, the reality is you will read that opinion without any ability to discern that. And the need - -",
  "It -- well, that they are in fact adopting a new policy, I think that is probably right, Justice Souter. I think the problem here is that ordinarily when you are in fact forthrightly changing your policy it is incumbent upon the agency to say: We are changing our policy, we recognize we are changing our policy, and here is the explanation for why we are changing our policy.",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "The only thing that's strikingly different about that, Justice Scalia, is they are very express in dealing with issue in the Golden Globes order, which - -",
  "-- General Garre specifically identifies. It's interesting, when you say where is it in the order under review when they say they are going to do that, he says look in paragraph 12 of the Golden Globes order. And Justice Ginsburg is absolutely right: this case came to the Second Circuit; the Commission said No, send it back; give us a full opportunity to explain exactly what we are doing. Thy take it back and they come in and they don't deal with this issue.",
  "That was part of it.",
  "And then provide a final reviewable order from the Commission, presumably that defends in all respects that decision. But as I say - -",
  "Right. All -- all I am suggesting, Mr. Chief Justice, is that there is equally an opposite language in which the Commission -- and the Second Circuit acknowledged this, too -- in which the Commission seems to back off whether or not it thinks it has made a change in this particular order. And it seems unreliable - -",
  "This Court said in State Farm that when an agency changes its position it is incumbent upon the agency to provide more of an explanation in that context than -- than if it were adopting the position in the first instance. So I think yes, if there is - -",
  "Right.",
  "Yes. Well, I -- I think it -- we wouldn't be having this debate if the Commission had simply dealt with this issue in the same forthright fashion that it did with respect to the Golden Globes order. But even if the Court accepts the idea that there is a change, it seems to me quite clear that the Commission has not even remotely satisfied its -- its obligation to demonstrate that that change is not arbitrary and capricious. And I think - -",
  "And then explain why.",
  "And that goes into what I think is the next point that I would like to make which is the answer to the Justice Breyer's question, which is where in the opinion does the Commission explain the change in position with respect to the -- to the first prong of the indecency standard, which is whether or not these words inherently mean either sexual or excretory activities; and there, it seems to me, there is a - - whether there is a change or not, the reality is that from 1978 until 2004 this kind of language was used routinely, without the Commission remotely suggesting that every time it was used, it necessarily had a particular meaning. And then suddenly in 2004, this language has changed its tone completely, and there is no explanation for what is different or what is the reason for adopting that particular view. The fact is that the reading of that is so fundamentally at odds with the way the Court - -",
  "This Court expressly said in Cohen v California, in talking about exactly the same word, that it cannot plausibly be maintained that this vulgar allusion would conjure up such -- up such psychic stimulation. And if the Court would say that in 1970, it applies with even more force in 2008.",
  "Well, all that Cohen says is that you cannot immediately jump -- you -- it wouldn't even remotely strike you that the reason the language is being used is for its particular sexual meaning.",
  "The same reason the S-Word does; it's because in some circles it is inappropriate.",
  "I mean, I -- to say that, I suppose you can say it, but I don't understand on what basis. There is no empirical support for that. There's no - -",
  "-- anything in the record that remotely suggests that.",
  "People use all kinds of euphemisms for it, and nobody blinks about it. The point is -- is that for 20-some years the Commission didn't draw that inference, didn't reach that conclusion and nothing has changed over those 20-some years.",
  "I think it probably would, if all you are doing is looking at just the sort of raw Administrative Procedure Act standard, as it would normally apply to non-content.",
  "Well, I -- I don't think that's a fair way to -- to look at this case. Because I don't see how you can -- it seems to me a completely artificial inquiry to look at this as you're regulating the price of oil going through a pipeline. At the end of the day you are regulating the content of speech, and therefore the First Amendment ought to inform everybody's assessment of what can the Commission do as it moves - -",
  "In a more content-restrictive way.",
  "But that would only be - -",
  "No, I don't think that's exactly right, Justice Souter, because the constitutional avoidance doctrine is not going to be much of a problem obviously unless there is a grave constitutional threat. So, it's not every assertion of the existence of a constitutional issue that suddenly triggers withdrawal. When you are dealing in this area, which is content regulation and restriction on the basis of content, it seems to me that's inherently a First Amendment problem. And when you are in that world, then it seems to me the agency, even in the APA context, has more of a responsibility, or at least the Court should say it has more of a responsibility to explain.",
  "Well, the Administrative Procedure Act expressly says - -",
  "Well, the - -",
  "The Administrative Procedure Act also says \"not in accordance with law,\" which also refers to other statutes and obviously the Constitution. So, it's not as though I am asking you to add more to what the -- to the statute.",
  "Yes, I am asking for a higher standard under the APA because we are talking about content-based restrictions on free speech.",
  "Because it was not talking about restrictions on speech, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Well, it - -",
  "This Court hasn't had to hold that in any particular context, but the reality is, as a logical matter, if you are thinking about -- you know, there is an -- a restriction on \"in accordance with law.\" The First Amendment is obviously with law, so you have that limitation. And then you have - -",
  "And in order to avoid those issues - -",
  "All I'm saying is that it seems to me a remarkably artificial inquiry, to look at this as if you are regulating the price of oil going through, to a pipeline as opposed to what you are talking about - -",
  "But - -",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I am perfectly content to talk about the APA, because at the end of the day, the APA - -",
  "I like the more complicated version, but I am happy to deal with the simpliciter one as well.",
  "But the reality that goes back to Justice Breyer's question, at the end of the day the important part of this is what explains this fundamental shift. Now, I think Justice Souter, you know, has probably made a respectable argument on APA grounds.",
  "But unfortunately that's not the position that the FCC took.",
  "I have nothing but the highest regard for him. But the other -- the other part of this case that seems to have gotten lost track of is that this is not a statute that -- that the Commission has the responsibility to enforce. This is a criminal statute. This is section 1464. And through section 503, the Commission doesn't have broad-based discretion to define for itself these terms. The Commission has to decide what is indecent within the meaning of a Federal criminal statute, which means we are entitled to the rule of lenity, which means we are entitled to an interpretation of that first prong which, in dealing with indecency, says that it has to describe or depict sexual activity.",
  "Well, they are being lenient in one sense. I think you have to step back, Mr. Chief Justice, and recognize what the -- what we've got here. We are talking about an extraordinary in terrorem regime that the FCC has created. And I would commend to you all the amicus briefs from the NAB, from the former FCC officials, and from others who describe in exquisite detail the chilling effect that this particular scheme may have. To be sure, you know, Fox isn't being immediately penalized by this, but to go back to Justice Breyer's question of General Garre, what he said -- you know, does everybody have everything on tape and delaying? No, of course not. And why not? Because it may be one thing for Fox to be able to put a show like this on a delayed basis, but if you are dealing with a local television station that is just getting by hand-to-mouth, and they want to televise a football game, and in the middle of that football game some student decides to express himself in ways that nobody anticipated - -",
  "Well, I'm not sure that -- I mean, I don't remember the FCC being in a position to describe how children are able to perceive one set of uses of the word as opposed to another set of uses of the word. But what I think this Court - -",
  "You can't seriously believe that the average nine-year-old, first of all, who is probably more horrified by the arm being blown off to begin with, but putting that aside, you -- it cannot possibly be that the child has more of a reaction to that word in that context than if a young high school football player is running down the field screaming a particular expletive.",
  "The young high school player actually might be more of a celebrity in some communities than -- at least than where I live, and - -",
  "But the problem is, Mr. Chief Justice, once you open the door, then you end up with all of the vagueness and overbreadth problems that are inherent in this regime.",
  "Justice Scalia, you could say the same thing - -",
  "-- but we're not saying the same thing.",
  "No, because the point we are making here is that we haven't asked this Court to revisit Pacifica. And the point is that when you move away from Pacifica, which is the verbal shock treatment formulation, and say, you know, that's perfectly consistent with the First Amendment and with everything that agency decisionmaking requires, and say that's all right -- when you shift from that, which is an enormous switchover, and go into fleeting expletives, then it's a fundamental -- all we're saying is that's a fundamentally different issue and that implicates more serious First Amendment issues, because everybody knows what is something that is verbal shock treatment or at least we know how to stay pretty far away from it; whereas, if I say every fleeting expletive potentially exposes every broadcaster to $325,000 fines made solely at the discretion of five individuals, unelected, that impresses me, Your Honors, as simply an inappropriate problem, and one that just follows naturally, Mr. Chief Justice, from saying, well, all we are going to do is open the door. Because once you open the door, it is clearly a Pandora's box we are talking about.",
  "Because it affects audience share. There are some people - -",
  "Because some people are offended it; not the whole community. There are probably a lot of people who would actually prefer to have more of it. But some - -",
  "But that's a heckler's veto.",
  "Well, first of all, that's a heckler's veto, and there have been long holdings in this Court that suggest simply pandering to one small segment of the population is no way to enforce First Amendment rights. So that's -- I mean, that's my primary answer to that.",
  "No, I don't think there goes Pacifica, because Pacifica was only one person - -",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "No. What - -",
  "But the problem is that the Chief Justice's question was: Why do we have a 24-hour rule. And the answer is: It's one thing for us to voluntarily assume that. I think it is a mistake, and I don't know that -- and I don't think -- I didn't read anything in the Commission's opinion that reflects it. But they say that fact suddenly defines the community standards for purposes of what is indecent and what is not indecent. That simply reflects our own best judgment about how to serve our audience.",
  "Well - -",
  "I mean I -- I believe that society is significantly more tolerant of these words today than it was in -- 30 years ago.",
  "In -- in the scheme of things, probably very, very little to do with that compared to the way the language is used. Go to a baseball game, Justice Scalia. You hear these words every -- every time you go to a ballgame.",
  "But the -- I mean I think what Justice Stevens is getting at is: What has changed over the last 30 years? And if anything has changed, it would be exactly the opposite, which is they are going to be more and more tolerant of this language; not that they are less tolerant of this language. And, therefore, there is even less reason for the Commission to have taken the position that it did in this particular context.",
  "I think both.",
  "Well, I am not saying there is not a difference, but I am suggesting that there are -- that the -- that the change over time has -- has made this less of a compelling argument than it would have been, at least in my judgment, in -- in 1978. I would like to make a couple of different, additional points. Another thing that has changed since 1978 is that there is much more opportunity for parents to control access for their children because of the V - clip. That's available. Second, in terms of this effort to try to lessen the coarsening of America - -",
  "Well, but if you put in a V-chip, it doesn't matter whether your parents are working or not. The truth is if you had had a V-chip for the 2003 version of this, which would have said PGL, which is for language, children couldn't have gotten on there whether the parents were at home or not. The V-chip is a usable and feasible technology and is a less restrictive alternative than the one that we have on the -- on the table under these particular circumstances. The -- I wanted to go back to the -- to the statute, the fact that this is a criminal statute. Again, the Commission is not arguing here for broad - - recognizing, or accepting, or arguing for, that they have a broad delegation of authority. They don't have the authority to decide what indecency is.",
  "Well, I - -",
  "Well, the NAB amicus brief actually has a pretty good description of a variety of different instances in which this has -- has occurred. And, of course, the NAB represents obviously the large networks but also all of the individual stations. And that, to me at least, makes a compelling argument that you -- you cannot simply have one rule that says: Let's just impose additional costs on everybody. Because the answer to that is that those stations will simply refuse to broadcast. And to me the best illustration of it, and the one that the public interest, I would hope, would command or demand the Court take account of, is the Vermont public station that refused to broadcast a debate or -- or allow a number of Senatorial candidates to participate in a debate because that candidate had used expletives in a previous public forum, and, therefore, didn't think it could allow that broadcast and take that risk because it can't afford to have the tape-delayed technology that you are talking about. And -- and that to me is the quintessential example. But there are loads of them, and it's just going to get worse once you decide to get past the notion that a fleeting expletive, no matter how it arises, requires to you justify it. Because we went from a system that said: We will, in general, never condemn fleeting expletives to the system that exists now, which is we routinely condemn them unless we think its okay. And that's a system, it seems to me, this Court ought not to countenance. It is embedded in the Second Circuit's decision. The Court should affirm that decision and vacate back to the Commission so that it can go forward -- or to remand back to the Commission so it can do the best it can to try to come up with a justification that satisfies both the APA and the First Amendment that it has not done so far.",
  "Yes, we did.",
  "I mean it wasn't a complaint. Actually, it was -- it was a petition for review - -",
  "-- going right to the Second Circuit.",
  "So it doesn't have the same bill of particulars that you might otherwise have.",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg. We - - we do believe that the Commission changed its position, and -- and, again, we had to file a separate petition for review from the remand order over and above the petition for review we filed from the first order. So, you know, we took into account this assessment in saying we don't think the agency had adequately justified its change in position.",
  "Yes, Justice Kennedy.",
  "I think it -- at least to me it's hard. I don't think so, but I -- I can understand that Pacifica could be read that way, although in pacifica, itself, George Carlin does, in fact, use the fleeting expletive in an explicitly sexual way at -- at times. But I -- I think the hardest case, candidly, is the situation where you have a string of expletives, all of which are clearly not designed to reflect anything about sexual activity and what you do in that situation. That is the hardest case.",
  "Yes.",
  "I apologize. I didn't -- I misunderstood your question. No, I don't think so. I think the question -- the first prong of the indecency inquiry is whether or not the particular language used does, in fact, describe or depict sexual or excretory activities or organs. And that's the No. 1 inquiry. And I don't think the number of times in which you use it affects the - -",
  "I -- I would have thought that, since you were dealing with a statute that is - - that imposes criminal sanctions, that if you have those two alternative interpretions available, you have to choose the one that is more favorable to the defendant. And, therefore, you would -- you would say that the - -",
  "I am sorry?",
  "That would be my argument, yes, Justice Stevens.",
  "Well, I -- I agree with that completely, Justice Souter. No. That is exactly how you can characterize it. I mean it may not be the precise verbal formulation we used, but, candidly, that is it and essentially the way Judge Lebal looked at it. And he just said at the end of the day, because I have to defer to the agency, I am going to let them have that interpretation.",
  "Justice Scalia, the language of the statute itself would suggest that, because the statute says that the Commission may find violate -- may impose certain enforcement actions for people who violate section 1464. That, of course, is a criminal statute. Therefore, it is not a statute that has been delegated to the agency's broad discretion to decide what falls within that language. It is within the agency's discretion to choose a penalty that, in fact, enforces that criminal dictate. And to go back to Justice Stevens's position -- I shouldn't give it as your position, it is my position -- but the point, I think, we were discussing, if you have a choice of two ways to read indecency, you have to read it in a way more favorable to the defendant, that precludes the approach that the government has taken in this particular case. If there are no further questions, Your Honor, I would reserve.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Judge Wood on the Seventh Circuit addressed precisely the same issue that's before this Court, I think she correctly observed that the distinction between an ongoing violation that arises with each new use of a seniority system and the present effect of a past discrimination is a distinction that is subtle at best. But it is the line that this Court has asked the lower courts to draw, and I think the majority of those courts have actually drawn that line appropriately, although you could actually probably argue that it's more a scatter plot than it is a line. And I think it's a scatter plot that essentially looks to three primary factors in evaluating whether or not this is a case that is more like Evans and Lorance and Ledbetter, or a case that is more like Bazemore. And those three factors are the stale nature of the claims, whether or not there is a seniority at stake, and whether or not the employees have fair and adequate notice at the time of the action of the employer. Let's look at the staleness of the claim. In this particular case, we are talking about maternity leaves that were taken by -- taken by the Respondents between 1968 and 1976. The information that's available to AT&T today is simply whether or not these particular individuals were paid for periods of time. There is nothing more than that. We have no way of knowing whether or not these were maternity leaves or not maternity leaves, whether these were leaves to go to school, leaves to take care of -- of parents, or leaves for any other particular purpose.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, they not only could have, but they did. If you look at the Eighth Circuit's decision -- and, indeed, Respondents in this case did -- in the Communications Worker case out of the Eighth Circuit, which is 602 F.2d 304, they specifically alleged that one of the Bell operating companies, one of the subsidiaries, had, in fact, refused to grant these -- these exact service credits, sued on that basis pre-PDA, and alleged that they were entitled to relief. The Eighth Circuit in that case looked at this Court's decision in Gilbert and looked at this Court's decision in Satty, and said specifically this case is more like Gilbert than it's like Satty, but never remotely questioned that that was an actionable claim at that point in time. And, candidly, it seems to me clear that that's an actionable claim because there -- there is very little that is quite as critical in this process -- in the employment relationship as seniority. And -- and we are not talking about simply benefits seniority here. We are talking about competitive seniority. So whether you have a -- a better claim to a cushier job or -- or to better working conditions, all of those are determined on the basis of -- of seniority, which is being decided on an individualized basis.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I question the premise that there was nothing to be done. I think the average person told that they have less seniority today than they had yesterday, and if they were told that on the basis of -- of gender-based discrimination or race-based discrimination, would say: I am entitled to go to court today. Not only do I think that that's the way most people would react to it, but the reality is if you look at the way the litigation arose in the Eighth Circuit case that I alluded to earlier, these very -- the same union here made exactly that claim prior to the passage of the PDA. So the notion that the employees, one, didn't have notice -- they clearly did have notice -- and, two, didn't have an incentive to act, they clearly did have an incentive to act. And I think this is not much different from what the Court said in Ricks, which is that obviously you have more of an incentive when you feel the true pain of a -- of a discriminatory act, assuming the act was in -- was, in fact, discriminatory, but the obligation to respond more -- to respond sooner remains on the plaintiff. And, again, to go back to the point I was trying to make initially, these are all claims that arose -- these are all actions taken between 1968 and 1976. And one of the --",
  "I mean, Justice Ginsburg, there's -- there's no question that the impact in Evans is -- is stronger than the impact here. I will readily concede that. But what I won't concede is that the importance of seniority is so far down the pecking order or so de minimis in its impact that it would be reasonable to assume that the average employee, told that I'm am taking away your seniority on the basis -- on the basis of your race, would then sit back and say: I'm not going to do anything; I'm going to wait until the impact of that is felt. To the contrary, you would expect, given the -- the centrality of seniority as a term of employment, that any employee under those circumstances would respond, you know, almost immediately under those circumstances. The -- the second factor in this case that, it seems to me, this Court has relied upon significantly in the prior decisions that have come out on the side of not allowing this kind of litigation to go forward is we are talking about a seniority system here. And the -- as I said a minute ago, it's not just the rights of the individual and what benefits she might be entitled to. The seniority system obviously affects the rights of all members of the -- of the seniority plan and all of the pension plan and the entire system that the seniority operates on. And so there are third-party interests that are involved here. And, again, both Congress and this Court's decisions have consistently recognized that when that situation arises, the resolution of the question ought to be to say, no, these are present effects of past discriminatory acts; we should be loath to try to interfere with those -- with that seniority scheme under these circumstances. And then the third factor that it seems to me the Court has been concerned about -- and it's one we have been discussing -- which is the -- the -- you know, the adequacy of the notice, where the employee is put on notice at the time that actions were being taken. Now, we can quarrel about how serious the -- the actions were, how detrimental they might have been. But it seems to me there is no question that the -- that the injury here is real and that the average employee being told that you are being deprived of seniority on -- on a race-based or sex-based or any other condition that is protected would act immediately. Now, it seems to me that the only argument that the -- that the Respondents offer on the other side -- and it's almost a mantra-like exposition by them and it was certainly the basis for the Ninth Circuit, and I think it's where the mistake arises -- is this claim that this is -- is a facially discriminatory policy. And their argument is if it's facially discriminatory, then you can apply it now, and all of the reasons why this Court has not applied these -- these kinds of claims in the past in Evans and Lorance and Ledbetter is -- is -- are off the hook in this circumstance. But the truth is this is not a facially discriminatory policy. In the first place, this exact same policy was looked at in \"SAH-tee\" or \"SAT-ee.\" I don't know exactly how to pronounce it. And the Court said these kinds of arrangements where you don't give service credit for people who take pregnancy leave is not facially discriminatory. So --",
  "Well, I don't know whether it would be regarded as facially discriminatory today. I think it would be regarded as illegal today. Whether it would be facially discriminatory I think is a -- is a trickier question, because again it seems to me that -- that the other side relies heavily on the statement in Lorance about facially discriminatory plans. But what the Court described as a facially discriminatory plan in that day was it was -- in that case, was a situation where every day a male worker is credited with a full day of work for a day's -- a day's effort, and a woman is credited with half a day's work for a day's effort. And -- and the Court said, quite rightly, that's a facially discriminatory plan. Well, we don't have anything like that in this case. This plan was changed in the wake of the passage of the PDA to bring it completely in compliance. So the plan, as it operates today, is -- is not only not facially discriminatory; it is in no way discriminatory --",
  "Right.",
  "Justice Breyer, I -- I -- in looking at this case, I have long thought of it as kind of an M.C. Escher picture, where you look at it from one direction and it looks one way, and then you turn it and you look at it the other way, and it looks completely different to you. But I think the right answer to -- to your analysis is that the way to look at Bazemore is that every day after the statute was enacted, every employee who showed up to work who was black was paid less than every employee who showed up to work who was white. And that, it seems to me, as the Court said in Bazemore, unanimously and without a whole lot of fanfare, is just something simply illegal under Title VII under those circumstances.",
  "I -- I mean, I think the answer to that, Justice Souter, is that's not -- that's certainly not an implausible way of trying to look at this problem, but if you look at the language of this Court two terms ago in Ledbetter, and I'll quote it for you: \"The fact that pre-charging period discrimination adversely affects the calculation of a neutral factor like seniority\" -- which is what we are talking about here -- \"that is used in determining future pay\" -- which is the benefits from this program -- \"does not mean that each new paycheck constitutes a new violation and restarts the EEOC charging period.\"",
  "No, I think Ledbetter deals with Bazemore in the context of a -- of a true seniority system and an arrangement in which what you are looking at -- because our case is a fortiori from -- from Evans and -- and Ledbetter because, remember, we are talking about a situation where what we did at the time, in our judgment, was perfectly legal.",
  "Right, I understand that, but --",
  "And then --",
  "I mean, I understand that, Justice Ginsburg, and obviously we don't quarrel with that. The problem obviously is the Court did decide Gilbert; the Court didn't say the law changed. It was the way the Court interpreted the statute at the time, and under the interpretation of Gilbert and Satty, what we did was perfectly legal, and when the statute changed, what we did was to bring ourselves into assiduous compliance with that position, Justice Souter, which is what I think distinguishes --",
  "Justice Souter, there's no question that you can read Bazemore that way. I just think that the way this Court has read Bazemore and Lorance and Ledbetter suggests that, in the context of the case we have here, the right answer is this is more like present effects of past allegedly discriminatory acts and, therefore, not actionable at this time.",
  "We are -- well, both, actually. We say it's not -- we say it's untimely, but we also say that if --",
  "Right, exactly. And that otherwise it would have to be retroactive application of the PDA. I would like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd just like to make a couple of points: Justice Ginsburg, you asked a question about the earlier litigation, and let me just quote from the first page of Judge Bright's opinion where it says the appellants in the class action allege that Southwestern Bell discriminates against women by, quote, \"refusing to extend full seniority credit to female employees on maternity leave.\" That is precisely the claim that's being litigated in this particular case. And contrary to my brother's position just a few minutes ago, that these don't have any impact and why would anybody act on the basis of them, it seems to me that that lawsuit belies that fact. They recognize the impact on seniority, and they acted immediately as a consequence of that. Justice Souter, I do agree with you. I think the reason that Bazemore is not the -- I wouldn't say \"line\" -- more the point of authority to be as the departure in this particular case is because of the implications for the seniority system. Justice Kennedy, the problem here is we don't know exactly what the impact's going to be. What we do know is that all plans are funded on a set of actuarial assumptions, and, candidly, if they say we were overfunded a couple months ago, given to what has happened to my pension plans in the last couple of months, I would worry a little bit about what the situation is. But the -- but the most fundamental point is you don't know. And in that context, what we do understand is that Congress routinely says protect the seniority systems, protect the pension plans. You know, my colleague says, well, but this is all form over substance because what if they come back at the end and decided to do all these calculations? That fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the pension process. You have to fund these in advance. You make actuarial assumptions. No one is in a position where they're going to allow the determination of seniority to be made at the tail end without making assumptions about what they are going to be like going in. And, Justice Breyer, I think that is the answer to your question because we are not taking this complex system wholesale and just dumping it post-PDA. What we did is we retained the specific rules with respect to the accrual and the seniority, and we eliminated the underlying distinctions between pregnancy and other kinds of disabilities. And that's how we apply it, and that, frankly, is fundamentally different from Bazemore because we are not discriminating every day in a way that harms them. We made a seniority decision, like a pay decision, pre-Act; now we are acting -- it's not a pay decision post-Act. And it's -- to my mind in that sense it is just like Evans and that line of cases. Finally, you asked the question, Justice Souter, could Congress have done -- have done exactly what the Respondents ask? And the answer to that is yes. Congress could say today we're not going to allow this. It would upset a lot of pension plans. It would upset a lot of expectations. Congress could have done it. Congress didn't do it, or at least if it were going to upset all of those reliance interests, Congress would have done so in language that was much more explicit than what it has done in the PDA and 706(e)(2). If there are no further questions, Your Honor, I urge you to reverse the judgment below.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think the previous 25 or so minutes has demonstrated one sort of overarching fact, which is that there is an enormous risk, if this Court decides to interpret the language of this statute broadly, that it will easily sweep beyond any kind of arrangements between Iran and the United States in ways that fundamentally, obviously, disadvantage the very people that Congress clearly intended to benefit by this entire statutory scheme. This is a scheme that was designed to provide remedies, recoveries, to the victims of terrorism. And somehow in the scheme of everything that was discussed in the first 25 or so minutes of this argument, the victims of terrorism are completely shunted aside on basic -- on the basis of very technical ways of reading it. But if we go back to the language of the statute, which is in the Petitioner's brief at 11a, it talks about \"enforcement against property that is at issue in claims against the United States.\" So the notion that we would focus on the word \"property,\" as it relates to the tribunal and that the tribunal has in front of it, is a natural consequence of the language of that provision. And to me, at least, the best way to look at the logic is to review how often the United States has described and Iran has described what was the property at issue before the claims tribunal and the B/61 proceeding? And this is at 65a of the joint -- of the government's brief: \"The property at issue consists of one air combat maneuvering range system and all necessary subparts.\" There is no dispute that the property was within the jurisdiction of the United States. Now - -",
  "Absolutely.",
  "I think they would be because of the way the Iranians actually pled this. They said give us either back -- give us either the military equipment that we bought, or give us the economic value of that. But that's -- and that's why - -",
  "Well, there are two answers to that. The first one is remember precisely what the arbitration award is. The arbitration award is not the value of the asset. That was asked for; that was rejected by the arbitrator. The arbitration award is for the value of a separate contract between Cubic and the Canadian government. You will recall in the award, specifically the arbitrator said with respect to the underlying ACMR contract with Iran, that was mutually walked away from by both parties, and then there was a separate agreement that was entered into between the parties, and that was the basis for the arbitration award saying the value of breach of that secondary agreement is the part that serves as the arbitral award. That it seems to me ought to be regarded at a minimum as one step too far removed, because that's not the property that is at issue before the claims tribunal in any way that the parties are disputing about it. They accept that number. And then - -",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, you clearly -- and I agree with you; there is no question you can read this statute either way.",
  "Right. First of all - -",
  "A significant purpose of this entire exercise obviously is to provide redress to the victims of terrorism.",
  "201(d) is a specific statutory construction provision which seems to suggest that Congress says that if there are doubts about how to apply this particular provision, you ought to put the thumb on the scale in favor of the victim. So you do - - you will give meaning to section 201(c)(4) of the TRIA if you adopt a position consistent with our position. The reality is that given that there are two more lienholders in line, none of this has anything to do with Iran and with the way the tribunal is going to proceed, because even if you were to say that Dr. Elahi is not entitled to this, there is no relinquishment claim with respect to the others, so this money is never going back to Iran, under any set of circumstances.",
  "But -- but - -",
  "But Justice Breyer - -",
  "But the problem with this, Justice Breyer, is that this is a relinquishment provision. It -- it is saying to us in return for these limited resources, 20 percent of the judgment -- and that is only 20 percent of the compensatory judgment and completely lose the punitive judgment -- in return for that you have to relinquish certain rights; and it seems to me that Congress would not have adopted the a provision that said and the rights you relinquish are essentially unknowable under any circumstances and extend to the ends of the earth. What I - -",
  "Justice Breyer - -",
  "The parties have been very specific about it, and we cited in a series of quotations about what is the property at issue here; and the property at issue, Justice Breyer is the ACMR system or the economic value of the ACMR system. What is not at issue in this case is the value of the Cubic judgment. First of all, there was an effort to bring the Cubic judgment specifically before the tribunal, and it was rejected as having no jurisdiction, certainly no jurisdiction over Cubic and then no jurisdiction over the United States' part of the Cubic judgment because that was not a contract between - -",
  "They did - -",
  "But that's the whole point of this. The property at issue before the tribunal is the ACMR system, and indeed in 1981 when this was originally brought what Iran wanted was the ACMR system.",
  "Justice Breyer, there is no question that the fact that there are subsequent lienholders in line affects the possibility, but I would have thought it would only affect it in a way that is positive for me. Because Iran is saying, look, this doesn't have any relevance to the -- to the Iran tribunal if we don't ever get the money; and the reality is whether Dr. Elahi gets the money or the other lienholders get the money, Iran is never going to get the money, which says to me it's not at issue under any theory of the case in front of the U.S.-Iranian claims tribunal. And so that would be my quickest answer to that; to the extent that you have other lienholders, it simply means that there really is nothing at issue there. But it still seems to me that the better way - -",
  "Right, the United States would still have that -- would still have that argument, but it's not a claim against the United States, which is what's required under the statute that we are dealing with here when it's viewed that way.",
  "No, I don't think there is anybody whose going to -- well, maybe there is some sense in which examining the Cubic judgment, but I don't think the tribunal has remotely been asked to or will under any circumstances be asked to review the Cubic judgment.",
  "Well, I mean, I think there is no question these are for two different obligations. And I think that's why candidly the Court ought to decide that this is not property at issue here, because it is so clearly unrelated to the weapons system itself or to any monetization of the weapons system. Remember the Cubic judgment comes from an arbitral award that doesn't have anything to do with that arms sale. It has to do with a completely separate contractual undertaking between the Cubic and the Canadian government - -",
  "-- and Iran.",
  "I don't know how there could be an argument on that point, Justice Kennedy. If you read the opinion of the arbitrator, it is absolutely clear that the -- that the underlying agreement between Iran and Cubic with respect to the arms sale was mutually terminated by the parties, and a new agreement entered into in order to resell those properties to Canada. The opinion is crystalline in that regard. And it was on the basis of the violation of that separate agreement that the -- that Cubic was then held to be liable to Iran for the $2.8 million.",
  "Between Iran and Cubic.",
  "Well, it just says that you move even further down the road from what are the properties that are, in fact, at issue before the tribunal.",
  "Although they wanted that.",
  "And they still want that.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, that - - that -- they may have been able to make that argument. That is not an argument they have made. The argument they made, which represents the property at issue in the claims, is first, give us back the arms; and then two, give us the value of those arms, not as they have been reformulated in a completely separate contract, give us the value of those arms. It seems to me the - -",
  "Well, the question was, they were going to try to go forward in these arrangements. And it was a, you know, complicated problem because you couldn't tell whether or not you would ever be able to send things back to Iran, et cetera. And so, they were perfectly happy to enter into an agreement where they would say, look, we will just do the best we can and see how it turns out. I mean, in reality, the litigation in front of the Ninth Circuit, obviously, on the Cubic judgment, Cubic is screaming loud and clear that they don't think they owe a nickel as a consequence of this arrangement that there had been no breach of anything under any circumstances, and that there is not a penny that's to be owed. And as counsel said earlier, it's in some ways unfortunate that this has moved in this sequence. So, we don't really have - -",
  "Well, it was stayed as a consequence of this other litigation -- as a consequence of these proceedings in order to allow, I think in general the Iran claims tribunal to -- to sort out, at least, some portion of these issues. It would obvious be -- I mean, we have moved -- I mean, we are not a party.",
  "Right. I mean, the truth is just as the issue was a more important issue for the United States prior to the new blocking order, you know, the questions that could potentially have arisen were potentially more important to the claims tribunal at the outset. As the litigation has played out, it turns out that there's no relationship between the two.",
  "Sure.",
  "But it also provides protection for victims, right, and those are the people who are the most - -",
  "Justice Breyer, I think the Hague cases are the place to look in terms of trying to understand this, because what it's what -- Hague, that line of cases all involve efforts to seize consular properties of Iran and all arose prior to the Accords, and every one of those courts of appeals has concluded that each of those properties is beyond the ability of the courts to attach all of those properties. And -- and it seems to me that what Congress was concerned about was having inconsistent claims potentially arise in both the district -- in federal court in the United States and in front of the claims tribunal. So where you have a situation where the claims tribunal says, look, that's a consular property that belongs to the Iranian government, you should return it, and have the United States have to show up in front of that tribunal and say, oh, excuse me, but unfortunately, we have been forced to sell that property under a federal court order and the embarrassment that arises from that. That seems to me so clearly what Congress had in mind, or at least is clearly covered by this and the case law or all the case law up to this point that has dealt with it has consistently ruled in favor of the United States and Iran in that context. But there is no reason to go beyond that context in order to deprive the clear victims of terrorism of a meaningful remedy. And I think, Justice Breyer, just to be clear about this, we got money back, to be sure. A substantial portion of the money we got back came from the values of the properties that the United States seized from Iran that they've used, they have leased out embassies and stuff like that. And that is not property that comes out of the United States' fist. So it's not reasonable to assume, as the government does, that simply because these moneys were paid out, that there is some huge relinquishment that is required there. It seems to me that it makes much more sense for this Court to narrowly construe this. I guess the last thing I would say in that regard is, that insofar as we can tell, this case will affect one party -- actually, I guess the other two lienholders behind us. But realistically, there are no cases in the pipeline. There is no other litigation that is on going out there. This is a singular -- I mean, it's kind of unusual for this Court, but this is the only case that we can figure that this applies to.",
  "Right. And, Mr. Chief Justice, that -- I understand why the government filed in support of Certiorari at the earlier stages of this proceeding. But after the intervening blocking order that takes the -- I mean, that issue is off the table. We are no longer defending the Ninth Circuit's view that the United States breached the original Algiers Accords in the context of this case. Nothing in the blocking order that is in place now and would prevent Iran from getting this remotely violates the Algiers Accords. And as far as I know, no one is making that argument at this stage. So all you have is a relatively clean -- issues. Does the blocking order apply here in stopping the payment of these funds to Iran? There the answer seems to me unquestionably yes. And then the second question is, do we adopt a rule to the detriment to a single terrorist victim in a way that deprives him of an opportunity to get back fair redress in the absence of some clear indication from Congress that it intended that result where it would affect no one else and where Congress has said specifically in a rule of construction, put your thumb on the scale in favor of the victim of terrorism? That's what we are asking the Court to do in this case. It provides no problems to the United States in its claims tribunal litigation. It's only an issue of money.",
  "Yes. It's 201(d)(4), the Petitioner's brief at 11a.",
  "Well, I think what you have to do is give the language some credit. And our way - - what we think Congress intended there was to say, tip the scale in favor of the victims of terrorism, which is the underlying purpose of the statute. I will confess, the language is not nearly as clear as I would like it to be, but I will also recognize that the -- the Government of Iran's position renders that language as total dead letter - -",
  "-- alternative it seems to me you ought to give it -- again, give the tie to the victims under this - -",
  "No, I think Congress does - - is entitled to suggest, if it's -- if you have ambiguity in our language, which way to come out as a matter of policy. No, I don't think that's -- no, I don't think that's dictating -- that's certainly not dictating a result in this particular case.",
  "You mean in the situations where the United States has subrogate -- right to subrogation?",
  "Well, I think it would almost certainly work as a matter of diplomacy and not as a matter of adjudicated resolution. I think what they will say is, these are rights, these are amounts of money that we have had to pay. And if we are ever to normalize relations with the Government of Iran, we are going to expect the Government of Iran to recognize those payments and to make some kind of retribution to the United States under those circumstances. And again, all it does is it shifts the burden of these injuries from the victims, who are in the least best position to deal with them, and put them in the United States, which is in a position of at least some hope of being able to resolve them diplomatically in a way that the United States can, in fact, be recompensed.",
  "There are, but the problem is you have to back into the situation of property that is at issue in the claims tribunal. The claims tribunal was created in '81. It's not a lot of that property around. We're talking 25 years later. So, they have pretty much played out their course. There were the Hague noted cases, and the Elahi case. The others are going to be resolved without regard to these provisions. And so, the reality is what the Court says today will affect my client, but as far as I can tell no one else. And certainly, the only interest the United States has at this stage in this litigation is its own financial interest. And it would seem to me, that's not a basis on which to interpret the statute. If there are no further questions, I urge the Court to affirm.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think I would like to start with Justice Alito's question because he said: Doesn't Section 5 of the Rehabilitation Act specifically require the Secretary to approve this lease? And Mr. Kneedler conceded that it does. And so then the question is: Doesn't that create some kind of a duty? And it seems to me clearly it does, just as the Court I think implicitly said in Navajo 1, the difference between Navajo 1 and Navajo 2 being that this Court then went on to examine IMLA, the Indian Mineral Leasing Act. It concluded that IMLA very specifically for the entirety of native Americans and for the entirety of Indian mineral leasing had a preference to ensure that the Indian tribes themselves would -- would attain a certain self sufficiency. And it essentially advocated the responsibility of having to deal with individual negotiations and allowed it for the tribes to take over.",
  "Oh, I would -- I would never assume that, Justice Ginsburg. I -- I think -- I think the operative term here is \"relevant.\" And that is that the Court for purposes of analyzing the question presented and disposing of it evaluated not only IMLA but the other two provisions that the -- that the government and the Court felt needed to be disposed of at that point. The Court didn't address the alternative arguments under either Macrow or the Rehabilitation Act. To be sure, they were argued. But I -- I have seen many instances in which alternative arguments were made, and - -",
  "Not relevant to the question presented, which is the proper interpretation of the - - the Indian Mineral Leasing Act. And, indeed, if you look at the other two provisions, the opinion of the Court analyzing them through the -- through the prism of the Indian Mineral Leasing Act, it says those don't add to the Indian Mineral Leasing Act. Our argument here is that Section 5 of the Rehabilitation Act provides a wholly independent basis on which there is a duty imposed, but that duty is then implemented in the regulations that are identified in the -- in the Secretary's - -",
  "Is that applicable to mineral leases?",
  "Absolutely, it's applicable to mineral leases. The -- the language of the statute is \"business leases, including those for the development of mineral resources.\" So clearly it applies to Indian mineral leases, but - -",
  "Mineral resources.",
  "Yes, the development of the \"resources\" for the Navajo and Hopi Indians.",
  "I'm sorry. The development for utilization of natural resources. But the basic point there is, at least as I read section 5, what it's saying is that it grants broad leasing authority. The Solicitor General is absolutely right about that. But that authority extends to certain kinds of mineral leasing. And that says -- and that's an authority and it's important to recognize this. Because while it is true for the run-of-the-mill Native Americans who are - - who are engaged in mineral leasing it may make sense to say: Look, we -- we are going to take a hands-off approach for the most part. We are going to set a minimum ceiling or a minimum floor and above that you negotiate as hard as you want. But the -- but the Navajo were in a fundamentally different position in 1950 when this legislation was enacted. The -- the median education on that -- on that reservation was less than one year of education. The resources were $400 per year annual income. This was a tribe in horrible condition. And so it would make perfect sense for Congress to say: Look, for -- for most tribes we want to go ahead and have the approval be based with the -- with the Secretary taking a hands-off approach above a certain minimum, but when you deal with the Navajo - -",
  "No, I don't think it would have to be solely under it. I -- I think that's a -- a false dichotomy. I don't think this is an either/or proposition. I think there are parts of IMLA that can reasonably be applied here, and -- and section 5 specifically says no authority from other statutes, which would include IMLA, is meant to be superseded by the passage of section 5. So I think there is a rule. And I think that the lease -- if you read the lease on its face -- Justice Scalia asked the question: Does this lease conform to the form lease that you get under IMLA? The answer is clearly not. This is a mix and match between some provisions, it seems to me, that clearly provides additional protection for the Navajo and other provisions that - -",
  "I think the Secretary has to approve it under both of those provisions. It is just that IMLA in this particular context would impose a 10-cent minimum over time.",
  "I think it would be permitted under the Rehabilitation Act because the last sentence of section 5 specifically says that this is not meant to limit any other authority provided under any other statute. And since IMLA provides additional time and durational protections for the tribes under these circumstances, that provision would definitely allow you to use IMLA's time limits rather than the Rehabilitation Act.",
  "Yes. I think the -- the key distinction is to look at the -- at who is being regulated, and under the Rehabilitation act it's the Navajo and the Hopi. And -- and Congress said, look, we are going to take special care to protect and to try to put them into a position where they can even just catch up to other Native Americans. And so it seems to me that there is - - that's a special protection with a special duty, and that duty is enforced through the 162 regulations.",
  "Correct.",
  "Because the last section under section 5 says that, notwithstanding anything else, this provision doesn't preclude -- doesn't - - doesn't limit the authority that would otherwise exist.",
  "I'm sorry, it's because the provision applies to a lot of other leases, too. Are you asking when the 20 or 10 and 10.",
  "No, I understand. Right. I have the answer your question which is this provision in section 5 applies not just to mineral lease, it applies to all business site leasing.",
  "But -- but -- but the important distinction -- and I hope I can articulate this -- is that section 5 applies beyond mineral leases.",
  "So that all -- so the time limitation of 10 years and 10 years, if you bring a barber shop, you want to build a barber shop on those lands, you want to lease the space in order to do that, you would be subject to the section 5 time limitations, unless for some reason there is another authorization somewhere.",
  "I need a haircut.",
  "There is a -- way beyond that there is an entire defense plant on the Navajo tribe - - on the Navajo reservation right now that would obviously be subject to precisely these same limitations. So it's not just trivial, it's all business lease citing that is covered why that. So it seems to me not at all unreasonable to think that Congress, in its -- in its very protective effort here under section 5 would say, here are all the leases that you are allowed to enter into. You have broad leasing authority, we are going to protect you against overreaching by restricting how long you can go, but if there are other provisions of law that allow these to be modified in a particular area, we will allow those to be modified in that way. And in this context, what that last sentence would, in my mind, say is there is no reason to try and -- to say that IMLA or the Rehabilitation Act. It seems to me much more sensible to say that Congress would have intended multiple protections for the Navajo.",
  "Right. But you see I don't think that's an authority. I would say -- I would not read - -",
  "The notion that the Navajo tribe would be in a position to better -- to better - - to -- I'm sorry, to achieve self-sufficiency.",
  "I'm sure there isn't - -",
  "Right. But that's exactly why the Navajo Rehabilitation Act of 1950 does modify IMLA.",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Obviously, Justice Ginsburg, you are in a much better position to judge what was intended here. On the other hand, my experience with the Court generally is that when you analyze a case, that you analyze it in terms of the specific question that is presented, and if you are posing to go beyond the question presented, you say so expressly, not simply by the use of the word \"claim\" or \"argument.\" So while I recognize that the Court -- that the government has an argument to be made that has pre-decided that, I think, frankly, one, the Court didn't decide this issue; and two, the Court should decide the question that was presented here as to the scope of section 5, because it's obviously of extraordinary importance to not only section 5 but also to section 8 as well.",
  "Yeah, the government's wrong about that. I believe -- the program itself is for the overall rehabilitation of the Navajo and the Hopi. There are a series of projects that the -- where the statute says such programs shall include the following projects. It doesn't say it's limited to the following projects, and those projects have been set out over time. But the program itself is not limited that way and more fundamentally, it is completely inconsistent with that kind of time limitation on the statute overall. Congress would have repealed certain sections of this act, sections 9 and 10 after the 10-year period that expired if the statute didn't have any continuing implication. It also would have meant that the leasing protections in section 5 had expired after 10 years, which seems to me quite inconsistent with the overall purpose here to accomplish that. So I think the temporal argument doesn't get the government particularly far. I would like to take a second to talk about sort what I think is an important distinction between 635 and other provisions, which is that 634(a) imposes a duty that the Secretary's brief, I think, evidently sets out, that duty means that you have to make sure there is fair market value, that those are reasonable rates, and that was not done. So that's the violation that took place. Then the question is, is there a money-generating, money-mandating obligation imposed here. And there it seems to be the distinction between 635(a), which said nothing about liability, and 635(b) and (c), which expressly -- expressly excludes the possibility of liability, suggests clearly why 635(a) ought to be viewed by this Court as a sufficient -- as creating a fair inference, is what the Court said in Mitchell two, a fair inference under these particular circumstances. The other issue that we have put on the table that the government didn't actually address in its opening, although I have to suspect - -",
  "No, 635(a) creates the fiduciary duties. The juxtaposition of (a) to (b) and (c) demonstrates that that duty is a money-mandating or rights-creating duty that's enforceable under the Indian Tucker Act, Justice Breyer. The other duty, it seems to me, that the Secretary breached there is the duty embedded in section 8 of this statute, which requires him to make disclosures as part of this program. And the one thing that is absolutely clear that the Court of Federal Claims - -",
  "Right. And then - -",
  "Right.",
  "Well, it doesn't -- it doesn't - -",
  "No, just to read (b) which unfortunately isn't reproduced I don't think in any of the papers, but it says notwithstanding any other provision of law, land owned in fee simple by the Navajo may be leased, sold or otherwise disposed of by the sole authority of the tribal council in any manner that a similar land in this State is situated may be leased, sold or otherwise disposed of by other private land owners, and the -- such disposition shall create no liability on the part of the United States.",
  "No, that -- the -- the trust relationship doesn't come out of the PNC; the money creating component of it, it seems to me comes, out of PNC. The trust relationship comes from the fact that the entirety of the statute was enacted to implement the treaties, that these are all lands that are held in trust, and that -- and that there is a specific duty embedded in (a) that requires that the Secretary approve what is otherwise basically controlled as a trust arrangement, and that is implemented through regulations that require the Secretary to do this under a fair market value standard.",
  "Well, that's for the sale of fee simple lands, so you are dealing with a very different set of -- of circumstances. Which is talking about -- it's aimed clearly at a different set of properties that were being held and therefore they said, when you engage in leases for that kind of property, there is no liability.",
  "A fair inference, I think is all I have to demonstrate - -",
  "I wasn't here then.",
  "Can I ask you - -",
  "Right. There's two -- there are two answers; I was being facetious as to why we didn't push this argument the last time. It was largely because the Federal Circuit concluded the last time based on IMLA alone that there was in fact a sufficient right-creating provision. And therefore we depended - -",
  "I don't know if those were from the brief. I know there was a statement of undisputed facts in the first round of litigation. But there is no question in the Court -- if we are right, that the Court remanded to -- from consideration consistent with this. We then went down upon remand from the Federal Circuit; we took additional discovery; and we obtained the information that we got. And also, remember, the United States' brief in the Ninth Circuit specifically says that this was approved pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act - -",
  "That was an overstatement, there's no question. Based on what we knew at the time, we thought it was in fact an IMLA lease, but in truth - -",
  "-- is it's not IMLA, anyway.",
  "Yes, but this is the only one that deals specifically with the Navajo Reservation and deals with leasing for business purposes for the development of resources. And so while I -- I agree with you in one sense, the other one has a -- some superficial closeness here. It seems to me that the closer one is actually the provision that deals with this specific reservation and this specific type of a lease arrangement.",
  "Well, we -- we obtained additional information, certainly, you know. We have the Udall declaration that specifically said that when he negotiated this lease he negotiated it as the centerpiece of the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act of 1950.",
  "It was after the first time around. I mean, there is no question that if we had won the first time around, we would have stood by that statement, but having lost it - -",
  "-- there is a tendency to focus the mind elsewhere, and we did. But the reality is that if you look at the parties, the -- Secretary Udall specifically says this was adopted pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act. Peabody Coal Company in briefing in the Arizona courts has specifically said that this was approved under the Rehabilitation Act, and the United States Government itself in briefing in other courts has said that this was approved pursuant to the - -",
  "Obviously - -",
  "He has a good memory, Justice Scalia.",
  "No, Justice Scalia, I understand that, but the -- the bottom line here is, the question is, is this, you know -- is it absolutely clear that this is exclusively an IMLA lease? And the answer to that is there is a lot of evidence that suggests no. It's not in the form of IMLA; there are a lot from other statements that say yes, and more fundamentally it seems to me is the Court should not view it as an either/or proposition. It could be adopted under IMLA or it could be adopted separately. So the section 8 argument - -",
  "Well, I don't know that it's a factual question; it is that candidly, we obviously focused more on IMLA because the Federal Circuit - - first of all, the Court of Federal Claims in the first go-around adopted IMLA as the test and just said you lose because you don't have an IMLA lease here; and we had argued here that it's not just an IMLA lease. Then we went to the Federal Circuit and we won on the grounds that it was an IMLA controlled error and we should prevail on that basis. When it was sent back down and we obviously didn't have IMLA available, since the Federal Circuit specifically precluded us from any further reliance on IMLA, we looked at the other provisions; we tried to understand their context, and then that -- all I'm trying to do is explain why it is that we would suddenly focus more on the Navajo act, not to say that you couldn't read the statute and say it would necessarily apply in that circumstance.",
  "Right.",
  "I'm not sure I understand the last part about - -",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I would go back to Justice Alito's first question that was posed to Mr. Kneedler, which was is this provision has a duty - - because it has an approval requirement; and the answer is yes, this Court in Navajo I looked further at IMLA, at that specific statute, and concluded that that statute overall had a very significant limitation embedded in that duty; and the question is, is there anything in the Rehabilitation Act that has that same limitation?",
  "And my answer to that is no, there is nothing in it; and contrary to the overall intent of IMLA, which was to guarantee self-sufficiency, the overall intent of this statute was to allow the Navajo to come somewhere in the area of those standards. In addition to that, I do think there are regulations that do require the Secretary to invoke a fair market value assessment of the rates that are embedded in this lease, and that he did not -- he clearly did not do that.",
  "Well, I -- I think the key to that is -- is sort of two-fold. One, I think when you -- in the absence of some clear statement in this statute akin to the one that existed in IMLA, that reduces the duty of the United States, that the Court ought to then simply examine this against the background of the trust principles and say you have a duty; you ought to exercise your duty consistent with your role as a trustee; and you ought to -- you ought to be acting in the best interests of the Navajo Nation.",
  "And then the second -- I mean, if you are not prepared to accept the general trust principles, although, again, they go through the context of a specific imposed duty that -- that 635(a) has in the first instance. But even if you want to go beyond that, then I go to 635(b) and (c), where Congress clearly seems to have in mind the possibility of not having liability imposed in certain circumstances and yet left 635(a) there without a similar protection for the United States, which, again, may not be the compelled inference, but it certainly seems to me to create a fair inference.",
  "Well, unless you are saying that -- I don't know what context Mr. Chief Justice was talking about. I mean -- but to be sure, lawyers don't want to read it that way because they are in litigation right now. But I don't see anything in the statutory scheme or in the regulatory scheme that would say that. And certainly, if you go back and look at the Secretary's brief, in their analysis of the regulatory scheme, the -- let me see if I can find this -- page 25 to 26, where they point out that there was a gap where -- where the Secretary did not exclude mineral leasing from the 635 - -",
  "He's fully on board, Justice Scalia.",
  "It's not in the brief. I'll just conclude with the section (a) argument, which is to recognize that the Secretary did owe a duty of candor and disclosure embedded in section (a). That program did not end. That disclosure responsibility did not end. What the measure of damages for that breach of duty is a question that obviously is still open on remand. But the notion that the Secretary can behave the way the Secretary did in this case, which is to know that he was not going to take personal jurisdiction over the final decision, command that no decision be made, leave the Navajo in a state of distress under those circumstances, force them to negotiate with one hand tied behind their back at a minimum, and then handed up an agreement that was half what the fair market value would have been for the quality of coal is an outrage, and the Court ought to allow the damages action to go forward. If there are no further questions, I urge the Court to affirm.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It does seem to me in some ways the Petitioner and Respondent in this case are ships passing in the night because the issues here are unbelievably complicated. I will say in 25 years of advocacy before this Court I have not seen one area of the law that seems to me as difficult to sort out as this particular one is. That said, I would hope that the Court would seize upon this as an opportunity to provide some significant clarity in the law, rather than seize this as an opportunity to decide this case on the potentially most narrow ground, which, frankly, as far as I can tell, will not only not decide this case, ultimately, but certainly will not do anything to resolve the mass confusion that seems to exist among the lower courts. So, I would urge the Court not to evaluate this case strictly on the question of whether direct versus circumstantial evidence is the appropriate way to proceed. In part that's because that is not the basis on which the Eighth Circuit decided this case. The Eighth Circuit said that it interpreted Justice O'Connor's separate opinion calling for direct evidence as talking about a specific link between the proof -- in the proof of the discriminatory considerations and the adverse action that was taken. So, direct versus circumstantial doesn't even -- you know, if you remand to evaluate non-circumstantial evidence, you are still not going to be in a position where that is going to affect the outcome.",
  "Well, then -- of course, they go on to say what they think that decision means. But there is no question, Justice Ginsburg, that that is the basis for that holding. So, I mean, I suppose the Court could say, no, we disagree with the basis of Price Waterhouse as Justice White's separate concurring opinion, which, frankly, I think it is -- you know, having read it more times than I care to admit, is not exactly clear as to what he thinks the appropriate standard would have been. At least Justice Ginsburg's provides the formulation that the lower courts can use to try to provide some kind of a jury instruction - -",
  "Did I say Ginsburg?",
  "I'm going to hear about this one.",
  "I apologize. But the problem -- you know, the -- but the fundamental problem is, it's just simply not clear what Justice White's opinion means. And therefore, the lower courts have seized upon an opinion that at least provided serious guidance that they could embody into a jury instruction. It goes to the point that Justice Alito was making, which is that, it's one thing when you are dealing with bench trials and what do you ask the judge to do, it's something fundamentally different when you are shifting the burden of proof. Justice Kennedy asked the question does it make a difference tactically, and the same question Justice Souter in some ways was asking and the answer is clearly it does, and you can see it in this case. Here's a situation where the defendant prior to the trial shows up, or when the jury gets selected. Opening statement says there is going to be no evidence of actual age discrimination in this case. The case is tried on that theory. The basis for the judgment that there is going to be no evidence of age discrimination in this case is the discovery, extensive discovery that has taken place, where there is no statements by anyone talking about age, no other employee who believes that he or she had been ever been affected by age. It's all of this very abstract claim and the notion that somehow there is no better explanation for what happened except for age. You go through the entirety of the trial saying to the jury, there is no evidence of age, there is no evidence of age discrimination, and then at the last minute, not because you have asserted an affirmative defense -- because we didn't assert an affirmative defense -- one is foisted on us by the jury instruction that the plaintiff asked for in this particular case that says that if there is a motivating factor, if you can prove a motivating factor -- which it is interesting to get to the specifics of a motivating factor, which means it played a part or a role, which is about as minimalist as you can have it -- then the burden shifts and we then have the burden to prove that we would have taken the same action notwithstanding age. Well, that's a very different inquiry, and when you go to the jury at the end you can't conceive - -",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "No, I don't believe he would be required to enter judgment on the defendant.",
  "Right, but I -- it does seem to me that the jury -- it would be fair to ask the jury to decide which of those two considerations probably played the greater role. But I think -- and that's why I think taking it to the jury is one thing. Switching the burden of proof to insist that we prove that the - - that the nondiscriminatory ground was the primary reason for the decision is -- is an inappropriate way to proceed because there is no basis in the statute for that. The plaintiff still retains the burden to prove that there was discrimination because of.",
  "I would think that that would be sufficient to get to the jury, because I don't think we have to prove -- I don't think the plaintiff has to prove, you know, obviously, beyond a reasonable doubt or anything. I mean, I think the jury could fairly say that those are the two grounds, and I think in some ways that -- that is the sort of common sense basis on which Price Waterhouse was decided. And it's -- you know, it's important -- if -- you know, the Chamber of Commerce brief actually focuses a great deal, Justice Stevens, on this multi-member decisionmaking body. And you know, it seems to me if you look at cases like Mt. Healthy and Price Waterhouse, those are all cases where you have multi-member decisionmakers, and some of whom may have expressed some biases and others of whom clearly didn't, and how do you deal with that situation, which impresses me as fundamentally different that the situation here where you have a single supervisor dealing with a single employee and where the case is tried on the theory that there has been no discrimination whatsoever, and it's up to the jury to make that determination at the end, and at the last minute we have the jury instruction that shifts the burden to us notwithstanding that - -",
  "-- we never sought to make this an affirmative defense.",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "I mean, that's a Banner case.",
  "Yes, absolutely.",
  "Played a role.",
  "Yeah, it did.",
  "It's on page 10 of the joint appendix.",
  "Right. But -- right. It just - -",
  "Can I just, if you go to the next instruction - -",
  "-- it says a -- \"Plaintiff's age was a motivating factor if plaintiff's age played a part or a role in the defendant's decision.\" So \"a motivating factor\" is a very narrow formulation - -",
  "-- as instruction in this particular case.",
  "Well, I mean -- in the first place, saying that something is a motivating factor or played a role is, as a sufficient basis on which to impose liability, is flatly inconsistent with what this Court has said numerous time. It said it in Burdine, it said it in Reeves, it said it in Hazen Paper, it said it I think last term in the Kentucky case, where it says it has to play a role and be determinative. And that's the standard the Court has announced over and over again in age discrimination cases. The \"a motivating factor\" formulation does come in Title VII, but that's because of the 1991 statute that specifically frames the argument in terms of \"a motivating factor.\" So the -- the bottom line here is that, unless the Court deviates from the historic practice, which is if you are in civil litigation the plaintiff retains the burden of proof throughout the process - -",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Well, my basic point on Price Waterhouse is that it seemed to me reasonably clear that a majority of the Court, whether you -- whether you rely upon Justice White or Justice O'Connor -- clearly didn't intend for the jury -- for the burden of proof to shift willy-nilly. But it's supposed to be an exception to the rule, narrowly defined. And the reality - -",
  "Played -- played a role. There is no question about that, Justice Ginsburg. But that is not much different, frankly, from a prima facie showing. The truth is if you only make a prima facie showing and the defendant doesn't show up, you will have in fact satisfied your burden.",
  "Well, there is no question -- I mean, although again what a motivating factor means is still to my mind extraordinarily narrow in this - -",
  "-- or limited in terms of what is required here.",
  "But, Justice - -",
  "Clearly he would win under those circumstances, but the problem there is - -",
  "No, he doesn't lose, but the question is, what do you do once you make that finding? Do you, in fact, at the plaintiff's behest, shift the burden of proof to the defendant? I mean, it admits one thing, and the Solicitor General, you know, has properly identified that in some instances the defendants as a tactical matter are willing to accept as an affirmative defense and -- and pursue the course you just articulated, Justice Stevens. But that's not what happened in this case. We were not prepared to accept the idea that age played a role. We still don't think the evidence supports that. That's obviously not the issue here before us, but it does make it extremely important to resolve the question of, at what stage can you foist, essentially - -",
  "--- an affirmative defense on the other side?",
  "Well - -",
  "I am always reluctant to say that, Justice Breyer.",
  "I think that, in ordinary tort law, the standard of causation is both a combination of \"but for\" and proximate causation, so - -",
  "Well, I don't think - -",
  "-- that's a fair - -",
  "Justice Ginsburg, at least as I read the difference between the plurality opinion in Price Waterhouse and -- and all of the other opinions in that case, Price Waterhouse's plurality said a motivating factor is actually a standard below \"but for\" causation. The plurality was unwilling to accept even \"but for\" causation as a requirement under the Age Discrimination and Employment Act. The rest of the Justices seemed to not -- not accept that. But that seems to me the very -- yes, the basic holding of the plurality -- again, not of the Court -- is that something less than \"but for\" causation is required. I would be delighted, candidly, if the court would go back to just \"but for\" causation as the element of age discrimination because I think, if you get to that point, you get out of this business of trying to figure out at what point do you shift the burden. If you - -",
  "Well, to be clear about this, I'm not pushing so much the, quote, McDonnell Douglas framework as I am Burdine, Hazen Paper, and the other cases that talk about \"determinative factor.\" And all we're saying is - -",
  "Determinative factor, right. I think the answer to the question, Justice Ginsburg, is the -- the way the Chief Justice asked the question, which is, how sensible is it to pull the one thread out of -- out of the Price Waterhouse analysis, assuming that Justice O'Connor speaks for the Court in some sense, you know, without examining how that plays in, given the underlying theory of the case? And I think that's a perfectly valid point. If the Court thinks additional briefing is warranted, then it would seem to me the right answer is to -- is to call for additional briefing, but I think - -",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, clearly it's going to affect Title VII.",
  "Clearly is it going to affect Title VII.",
  "Right, because there's a specific statute that defines it as a motivating factor, shifts the burden, and creates an entire remedial regime that doesn't exist under the age discrimination statute.",
  "Well, I think the primary one is the 1991 amendment, where Congress clearly changed the language in Title VII.",
  "Well, it seems to me it's beyond that. I mean, there's almost a separation of powers problem when you say it's statutory because, again, Congress very consciously decided to modify Title VII, created a complete regime. It would be a bit of a stretch for this Court not only to modify the standards in a way that would change substantive liability but would create the -- the affirmative defense as a remedial component of it.",
  "Both Congress and this Court have recognized precisely that as a problem. I mean, there are reasons to treat age discrimination differently from other forms of discrimination. But, again, you know, there's no question that if you revisit Price Waterhouse, it will change some -- the Americans with Disabilities Act and some of the other provisions. But the reality is, if you are talking about a mess to begin with, the truth is the lower courts are in a state of -- of disrepair at this point in any event. And it's even shown in this case. I mean, the truth is the Eighth Circuit has three different formulations of Justice O'Connor's evidence standard: circumstantial, strong evidence, and substantial evidence, substantial factor. So if you are a district court judge sitting in the Eighth Circuit, you can pick any one of those -- those three to go with.",
  "Yes, I believe it could.",
  "Yes -- I mean, if you were asking me how I would decide that case, yes, I think it ought to be -- it ought to be because of. Now, if the Court wants to formulate some greater specificity of how the causation standards apply, that's fine. But, at a minimum, it seems to me the Court would do well to go back at least to the notion of \"but for\" causation as embodied in the Age Discrimination and Employment Act.",
  "It has never rejected that as a Court.",
  "I -- it seems to me juries are asked to make that kind of a decision. I agree with Justice Souter: Juries are a lot smarter than the lawyers.",
  "Right, and I understand that. And in those situations -- look, Justice O'Connor's analysis of this certainly -- certainly plays to a kind of gut feeling. When you -- and Mt. Healthy is a good illustration of it, even maybe more so, when you say: We are firing you for two reasons; one of them is completely invalid, and the other is completely valid. What are you supposed to do in that situation? But it seems to me that under -- under normal civil litigation rules, and the ones that Congress clearly had in its mind, the approach you would take under those circumstances say that's enough to get you to the jury, but that's not enough to force the jury to be instructed that they have to rule in favor of the plaintiff unless the defendant can show that but-for, that -- that no matter -- regardless of the discriminatory animus, they nevertheless would have taken precisely the same action. That, to me, is the guts of -- of what -- of what this case is about. It's not about direct versus circumstantial evidence. It's about under what circumstances does the burden of proof shift? And -- and in a case like this where there's no assertion of an affirmative defense - - whereas, I think, Justice Stevens, in your situations, there were -- you know, most likely you would expect a defendant to say, I want to accept that burden because I think I can in fact prove something.",
  "There -- there is no question about that. And it is -- again, the only question is: Who bears the burden of proof? And what do you do with all of those decisions of this Court that say that the -- that the -- that the burden to -- to show that age, or whatever, was the determinative factor rests throughout on the plaintiff?",
  "Well, I think you have to go back to the -- to the question that Justice Alito posed actually, to say -- when -- when he asked her: How do you -- how much sense does it make to think about mixed motive versus other motive? Isn't it true that by the time the case gets to the jury everything is mixed motive, because there is going to be the claim that this was -- and this is a great illustration of that concept. There is a claim that age was the basis for the decision, and there is a claim that there are any of a thousand other possible reasons that are out there, and age just didn't happen to be one. And under those circumstances the question is: What's the reasonable way to proceed? Now, Justice Ginsburg, I apologize that we didn't raise this specifically in the brief in opposition. On the other hand, the reality is that the primary position that was taken by the other side was that this Court essentially can ignore or should overrule a portion of Price Waterhouse as a consequence of the -- of the intervening Costa decision. And it seems to me under those circumstances, if you are going to put the issue of the validity of Price Waterhouse -- whatever it means -- at issue, then it seems to us a reasonable response on the merits to say, well, you shouldn't do it as -- as a - - in isolation. That that's a completely artificial inquiry, and you ought to take a step back and say, maybe we haven't gotten this right in the first place, particularly given the difficulty of the lower courts in trying to figure out exactly what Price Waterhouse means. Whose is the controlling opinion, and how do you allocate these burdens and under what circumstances? And given that the lower courts are in disarray, it would seem to me this is a situation where I don't know whether this is the best vehicle or the worst vehicle, but it is certainly an appropriate vehicle for the Court to step back and evaluate it. And if the Court is concerned about whether it has enough information to allow it to assess what would be the -- the significant impact of revising Price Waterhouse, then it seems to me the right answer would be to ask the parties to -- to brief that in addition to the way they briefed it at this stage. And now you simply throw up your hands.",
  "I -- I don't disagree with that, Justice Ginsburg. I -- I don't think there are any -- any guidelines out there that speak directly to this specific question. But, obviously, to the extent that the Solicitor General could speak for the EEOC, that would -- I am not denying that that would -- that might be helpful. But I think what the -- what the Court needs to do is recognize that what it cannot - - what it should not do in this case is take the -- the very narrowest way of vacating and remanding. Because if it follows that course, nothing will move. Nothing will have been achieved by all the work that has been put into this case at this point, because the court of appeals didn't believe the difference was between direct and circumstantial evidence. And, therefore, the Court at some point is going to have to evaluate beyond the quality of the evidence what quantity of evidence is appropriate under the circumstances. It seems to me the Court has that in front of it. The jury instruction in this case shifted the burden way too early or on -- on way too little showing. A part, a role, that's not enough to shift the burden under -- I don't even think under Justice White's version.",
  "Well, there is a question about the adequacy of the jury instruction.",
  "Right. No, I don't -- there is no question that -- that -- well, there is a question on that. It's not before you. It's -- it's back in front of the Eighth Circuit. But there is still the issue of whether a motivating factor, meaning that it played a role, is a sufficient basis on which to trigger the -- the burden shifting instruction in this case. That -- that is the narrowest basis on which this Court could affirm by simply saying that Justice White's opinion requires a substantial showing. The instruction in this case clearly doesn't accomplish that, and, therefore, the Court should set that aside, or the Court should affirm the Eighth Circuit and remand so that the district court can have a new trial on that issue. If there are no further questions, I'd urge the Court to affirm.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: North Carolina breached the Southeast Compact in this case. Whether you examine it from the perspective of the sanctions that were imposed by the Commission, or whether you evaluate it from the perspective of the repeated statements by the executives of the Commission that there had been a material breach and a repudiation, or whether you examine it from the perspective of the undisputed record that was collected by the Special Master, the conclusion, it seems to me, is inescapable that what North Carolina did here by taking no action between December 1997 and July of 1996 simply does not fulfill the responsibilities that they had -- that North Carolina had assumed, and therefore the only issue should be: What is the appropriate remedy for this extraordinary breach? To go to the specific record, just to be clear about this, the Special Master says at page 10 of his report: \"The parties do not dispute that North Carolina did not take additional steps to pursue a license for a waste facility during that period.\" Our undisputed statement of facts is that North Carolina took no further steps to license between 1997 and 1999.",
  "Right. Well, North Carolina assumed the responsibility more than a decade prior to that time to take all appropriate steps in order to provide for licensing and for construction of a facility. \"Appropriate steps\" in that context has to mean something more than simply doing nothing, declaring categorically that you are going to repudiate the agreement, and attempting to extort from the compact and its Commission additional monies that it is absolutely clear that the Commission has no responsibility to North Carolina to pay.",
  "No, it did it with -- with the approval of the other States in the compact, for the purpose of promoting the ultimate objective of the -- of the contract --",
  "The language of the -- of the compact itself, Justice Scalia, is quite plain. It's clear that the Commission has no responsibility to create -- to pay for the creation of this -- of this facility. That was clear from day one. North Carolina, not only in its legislation authorizing its authority, but also its governor repeatedly saying, we understand that we have a responsibility to create this facility, that --",
  "At whatever cost --",
  "Well --",
  "I would say that the -- that the State of North Carolina would have -- have a defense of impossibility if they could argue that going down this path would have bankrupted North Carolina.",
  "Yes, but the -- but the payment of $80 million by the Commission was way above what any of the parties expected at the beginning of the process as well.",
  "I think it was reasonable to assume that the construction of the facility itself would have cost an additional $75 million.",
  "Probably 34 million to complete the license.",
  "Right, but the -- the --",
  "To be sure, but the -- but the --",
  "I don't know that there were any initial estimates, at least that I recall.",
  "I doubt that that would have included the full construction.",
  "Yes. I mean, I think North Carolina -- first of all, North Carolina never did assert a right of impossibility.",
  "Well, it said it wouldn't complete this project. It imposed upon us and unilaterally imposed upon the other States to the compact the obligation to fund, an obligation none of them had -- had assumed under the contract. To be sure, they had provided moneys to North Carolina with the expectation that North Carolina would use those moneys ultimately to build a project. But the reality is in 1997, in December, North Carolina unilaterally declared that they were not going to complete the project and that they were going to take no actions further -- in furtherance --",
  "Right. Yes, Justice Ginsburg. Our argument is that -- you know, whether -- you know --",
  "I think there's an open question of whether the withdrawal in '97 would have been in good faith or not. That would be a separate issue. But there is no question that the one thing that a contracting party does not have the right to do is to unilaterally decide to repudiate the agreement, get the benefit of the agreement --",
  "Right, and -- and the question then, obviously, that -- the legal issue that that presents is whether or not a party to a contract who is not entitled to expect the other participants to the agreement to pay any more money or in fact any money whatsoever has the authority essentially to attempt to extort that money while continuing to gain the benefits of the contract for an additional year and a half; at that point, then they -- then they withdraw. We can debate about whether the withdrawal was in good faith or not. But the bottom line is there is no substantial difference between the repudiation and the complete disregard of the contractual obligations.",
  "Well, the benefits of being a part of the compact is all of the powers that the Commission had to deal with other compacts in terms of how to license -- not how to license, but how to dispose of waste. They got all of the benefits of being a part of a compact during the entirety of that period. So, you know, it was not in their interest to repudiate this agreement or to withdraw from it until they got to the point where they were -- where they recognized that they were about to be sanctioned for their failure to comply with their responsibilities.",
  "Well, there were huge benefits, Justice Scalia.",
  "The Barnwell facility in South Carolina was disposing of waste and was only going to take wastes from the compact States in the Southeast Compact. So North Carolina had -- had ample access to that South Carolina facility that, if it had never joined the compact, it never would have had available to it.",
  "In 1995, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "Right, but they still had the benefit of the compact's -- the Commission's authority to negotiate on behalf of the member States deals with other compacts for the disposal in those facilities which you otherwise don't have the benefit of.",
  "Well, this would be bad faith withdrawal.",
  "Where the State assumes -- accepts $80 million, goes down a path, is not entitled to any of that money or to any other money, and then unilaterally withdraws --",
  "That's an open issue at this point. We haven't analyzed that. That's part of what I think what would be involved with the last three counts of the -- of the complaint. We don't know exactly whether that money was properly spent or not. But -- but either way, I think it is important to recognize that, even if it were not, quote \"misspent\", at the end of the day which entity has the benefit of the $80 million? Is it the six members of the compact today? No. It's North Carolina. If the -- if the Federal Government were to declare tomorrow, in response to some terrorist problem, that on-site storage of low-level nuclear waste is no longer permissible and that those wastes have got to be disposed of somewhere other -- in some other kind of a facility, the State that is -- other than Texas, which is about to start one up, but the State that’s clearly in the best position to do that today is North Carolina. Why? Because they have got a $134 million jump on everybody, $80 million the benefit of which was conferred by the Commission and the compact and the sister States that were a part of --",
  "I -- I think if -- it would be a tougher case if they had taken the 80 million and come to the conclusion of this and there was a finding by the State authorities that this facility simply cannot be built consistent with health and safety. I think that would be an argument that we are not entitled to the money back. But what I think you are not entitled to do, as North Carolina, is to decide unilaterally that more money should be paid, which is not provided for under the agreement, and insist on that as a condition of fulfilling any of its responsibilities under the agreement.",
  "No. I mean, well, the working assumption is that the facilities would be in operation for 20 years. And the reality, Justice Alito, is that once you have one of these facilities built, given that there are not very many of them and they are and would be a monopoly within the compact region, you have virtually limited -- unlimited authority to dictate whatever price you want to require for taking on the disposal. And if you look at the sites that exist -- it was true in Barnwell; it's certainly true in Utah and in Washington -- I mean, those are licenses to print money, essentially, at this point. And the expectation --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "None so far. Texas I think is as -- is as far along in its process as -- as anyone, and it's -- and it’s part of a compact. But you know, obviously there is a \"not in my backyard\" mentality here. But the -- at the end of the day, the fundamental question remains, you know, what -- who bears the responsibility? North Carolina -- it wasn't as though North Carolina was the unfortunate recipient of this particular decision and then said, you know, we don't want to do this, we can't pay for this, there’s no way we can accomplish this. North Carolina, after having been designated as the host State, affirmatively passed legislation accepting that responsibility and committing the State to actually providing for a facility. Now, Justice Stevens, I agree, if it had turned out that as a matter of public health and safety -- that's the big bugaboo here -- if that had been an obstacle, or maybe, Justice Sotomayor, if the expense had been so far out of the range of what's conceivable, maybe there’s an impossibility element to it. But the --",
  "Of course.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. The only thing -- there is nothing express in the contract, in the compact, that would prevent them from doing that. I do think there is an implied duty of good faith. But in the situation you pose, Your Honor, I don't think there’s any question that they acted in good faith.",
  "Well, other than -- other than the fact that to say \"We can't\" strikes me as utterly implausible. To say \"We don't want to\" strikes me as much more arguable.",
  "Right. But the problem was --",
  "Well, I think the problem -- what turns it into bad faith is taking the 80 million, consistently committing to going forward with it, and then walking away right before you are going to get sanctioned for failure to comply with the -- with the agreement. I think those are the elements that make it --",
  "I don't have any -- any decision of this Court. I do have an opinion by the D.C. Circuit some years ago that says that every contract carries with it an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. You may remember that opinion.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, the only -- the only argument we have with respect to that -- and it's important to recognize, we don't have to win this issue in order to win the breach of contract claim in this particular case.",
  "Well, because there’s massive repudiation long before the -- the question still is, what do you do with 1997 to 1999? Before they withdraw, they have repudiated the agreement. They have breached it totally. The very essence of the agreement was lost once North Carolina refused to take any steps, much less appropriate steps.",
  "And take -- well, what they are supposed to do is take appropriate steps to license, which means --",
  "-- continue to do what's necessary to get a license.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes, that's absolutely right, Justice Breyer.",
  "I don't know that there is specific authority for that proposition. But, Justice Breyer, it seems to me what you describe there is exquisitely close to what this -- what this Court resolved in Mobil Oil Exploration, where Congress passed a statute saying that the administrative side would not be permitted to go forward, and this Court said that action constituted a repudiation of the underlying obligation, even though it was far from clear that there would ever be any exploration or production of oil on this -- on the outer continental shelf sites that were in there. This Court said that when -- that if an obligor will commit a breach that would of itself give the obligee a claim for damages for total breach, so that it so substantially impairs the value of the contract, and the government said it would break or did break an important contractual promise, impairing the value of the contract, then the government must give the companies back the money.",
  "Yes, I think that's a fair ­ -",
  "But we have other arguments, obviously, but then -- but on the breach --",
  "-- we should win. In my judgment, that's -- the conduct of North Carolina between 1997 and 1999 is exactly the same conduct that the United States entered into in Mobil Exploration.",
  "Yes, it’s a --",
  "I believe that they are the sole judge, yes.",
  "Article 7(C).",
  "Okay. That’s in the -- that will be in the sanctions order that's in the appendix, so that -- in the record. I think it's around page 400. I will get that for you, Justice Breyer. But the specific finding is that North Carolina had a duty to go forward and -- and stopped completely. It repudiated. In addition to that, when North Carolina announced that it was shutting down the project and that it was not going forward, that it was just going to run out and wait and hope, frankly, that additional funding would come forward, the -- the compact -- the director of the compact specifically wrote to the governor twice, saying: These are acts in repudiation and in violation of the agreement; it is your responsibility.",
  "Refused, right.",
  "The basic proposal -- the draft memorandum of understanding would have -- would have led to the Commission providing, I think, about $21 million, and the generators in the Southeast States providing a loan to North Carolina of an additional -- I think it was $13 million. And that gets you the $34 million -- comes from -- for the -- for the finalized elements of getting a license put in place. So we had -- you know, we thought we had in place an offer to fund. I mean, that's what makes North Carolina --",
  "You might want to ask Mr. Dellinger that question. They didn't -- they didn't provide us with any explanation for why they didn't ­ - why they turned that down.",
  "Right. And that would have been a loan for the future.",
  "Right. Everybody on our side had agreed to that, including the -- the other members of the compact.",
  "Because the --",
  "Well, you know, when you -- when you've got the power to extort, you know, the temptation to go down that path, Justice Scalia, is obviously pretty strong. And the reason they did it was --",
  "Well, the difficulty --",
  "Right. But remember, you are talking now also about the Commission and the other compact States having sunk $80 million in the investment to get this site up and running. So we've -- I mean, we've already got $80 million in the hole.",
  "Yes, our position would be exactly the same.",
  "Well, I think the answer to your question is -- you know, of course, is: What's the appropriate remedy for the particular breach in any given case? In this context, if we were talking about a couple thousand dollars --",
  "But I -- well, I think the ultimate question is still: What is the obligation? And Justice Breyer identified it, I think, quite precisely. And again, this is only with respect to count 2 in that breach claim. But our argument there is that they had a responsibility from December 1997 until July of 1999 to take appropriate steps. And they massively repudiated that obligation and repudiated the entirety of --",
  "-- of the contract.",
  "Yes. Subject to what I would think was a duty of good faith, they could have done that. But they didn't do that.",
  "Right.",
  "No, I think it's more subtle than that, Justice Sotomayor. I mean, my point is they always had an obligation to take appropriate steps to get licensed. That was an obligation that lasted until they withdrew. And from -- from December 1997 on, they refused to take any steps toward getting a license. And we don't know today whether something could have happened in that year and a half that might have changed the entire dynamic of this and allowed it to in fact be completed in a way that all of the parties would have been satisfied with.",
  "Of course.",
  "Right.",
  "I think it's a pure legal argument. I think we have put forward everything before the Special Master that we think is relevant for the -- for a disposition of that --",
  "Right. The bill of complaint itself doesn't distinguish between claims based on any particular party. They list the parties and they list the claims, and there is no effort to mix and match as between them. In terms --",
  "Well, I would think at a minimum we are very much like the private oil companies in the Maryland v. Louisiana case, in any event, where, you know, the claims were out there; it was far from clear exactly how those claims were going to play out in one way or another. And this Court didn't sit down and say: We have to sort that out ahead of going forward with the litigation. What the Court said was: These all look to be pretty close and there’s no basis on which to assume that they are doing more -- that they are asking for more, and therefore there’s no Eleventh Amendment problem. And, of course, remember the Special Master has held open the possibility that if for some reason the claims of the Commission were to deviate from the claims of -- of any of the compact States, which as far as I can tell to this point they have -- they have not deviated one iota, then the Special Master would allow North Carolina to revisit -- to renew its motion at that point.",
  "Right.",
  "Well --",
  "But that -- it seems to me, Justice Sotomayor, what you are doing there is collapsing the question on the merits into the jurisdictional issue of --",
  "Right.",
  "Right. Although --",
  "Right. Although this -- this Court has also recognized in Georgia v. United States, for instance, that if -- if there are clearly claims that exist, that are legitimately litigable, notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment, and there may be some question about others, that the Court nevertheless should go forward and figure out --",
  "-- which ones work and which ones don't.",
  "Right. And I think the answer to that is -- just as the Special Master said, it's premature to try to judge that until we get to a point in the litigation where it becomes clear that there is some departure between what the States are doing and what the Commission is doing.",
  "I get --",
  "No, the Commission is asking for the money on behalf of the -- of the compact States, and the compact States are asking for the money on their own behalf. I do think it's an easier vehicle for the Court to be able to provide a remedy by giving money under these circumstances.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I would like to respond to a number of the points that have been made. It seems to me the most fundamental one that Mr. Dellinger relies upon is the notion that this $80 million was not the money of the compact States, and he -- he keeps saying that repeatedly -- you know, based solely on the fact that the money doesn't come through the treasury of the States. But he ignores, on 12A, article 4(H)(2)(b), which says, with respect to the levying of the special fees or surcharges, which was the basis upon which the entirety of the $80 million comes, that this must represent the financial commitments of all party States to the Commission. It was the understanding that, in exercising the authority to levy these amounts of money in order to generate this, that that was the States' money, all of the States' money, and ultimately, if this Court would have determined that the money --",
  "It says each State hosting ­ - you know, \"shall annually levy surcharges.\" The total of those surcharges represent the financial commitments of all of the party States to the Commission. That seems to me to say that it is the commitment of the party States that's -- that's being provided for in that context. It's not the money of the Commission. It's not the money of the generators. It's the money of the compact States that's being used for whatever purpose is necessary in order to fulfill the overall objectives of the compact. In this context, it was used to ask North Carolina to go forward to site a facility.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "We don't know, and we wouldn't -- and the truth is, at the end --",
  "I think there’s no question that it -- that it can be read as -- as saying that, which, of course, then tells you, if it's not the Commission's responsibility and it's not the States’ responsibility, then it was clearly, from the outset and has always been, North Carolina's. But I think it goes beyond that, Justice Scalia. I think it actually tells you, as an agreement among all of the party States to this compact, that this is the money of the States, and ultimately --",
  "Oh, no. You --",
  "Well, there would be a way to allocate it. It seems to me that maybe -- that either the Commission, based on the vote of the parties -- the party States, could either allocate it back on a pro rata basis, or they can do it on the basis of the percentage of the -- of the waste that was used in any particular fund. There’s no specific provision on that, but it seems to me that doesn't detract, Justice Scalia, from the fundamental point that what the compact members agreed upon was that this money would be the money of all of the States. And, therefore, we can't keep it as a Commission.",
  "Right, South Carolina, in this particular context. The -- immediately, it would be South Carolina, and ultimately, then -- assuming North Carolina or another State were to site a facility, then, from there on, that money would continue to be their commitment.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right, because the compact agreed among themselves, as part of this agreement, that the -- that they would have authority to impose those surcharges on the generators, as they brought the money in.",
  "Well, I think they could have, actually.",
  "Well, no, but I -- through their membership, they certainly did. If the States agreed to disband the compact and the -- the Commission disappears and there’s $80 million in the pot, that money's going somewhere. It's not staying in -- it may get paid for legal fees, but other than that --",
  "Right.",
  "Yes.",
  "You mean, in terms as a percentage off the -- off the normal charges?",
  "Yes, that would be a bit high.",
  "Right, the generator does.",
  "Represents the commitment of the States.",
  "Right. And all that's saying is that that money, even though that -- I mean, the alternative way to do it, obviously --",
  "Right.",
  "Right, and then it comes to the Commission --",
  "-- and the Commission then used it in this context. But that's the basic point, Justice Breyer. If they didn't have this provision, you would -- you might assume it was the generators’ money or somebody else's money. The whole point of this provision was to say these moneys, which can only be levied because of the compact and the Commission's authority, remain the responsibility of the States and, ultimately, to my mind at least, would clearly go back to them. Justice Breyer, I wanted to answer your question with respect to findings of breach. January '98, there is -- the joint supplemental appendix, page 55, makes the -- is the Commission sanction order, and April '99 -- and, again, at appendix 323 and appendix 412 -- those are specific findings by the Commission that there have been breaches.",
  "Well, I mean --",
  "Well, I’m relying on this provision of the compact that says it is the --",
  "Then we have an agency theory as well.",
  "Well, I mean, yes --",
  "I -- I think that the Court -- yes, I think the Court would still have the authority, even in dealing with what is the appropriate rule of restitution, because we are too far away from that at this stage. We're not -- we're not there. But I think, if the Court finds that North Carolina breached the compact, it ought to try to find a reasonable way to remedy that particular problem, even if the technical standards didn't apply.",
  "Well, no, Justice Sotomayor, you do do that. I mean, when the Court in Kansas v. Colorado was trying --",
  "It seems to me the Court still has the authority, in deciding what is the appropriate standard of restitution in a problem as unique as this one, to do what it did in Kansas v. Colorado, which is to say: How do we measure the damages to this party? Let's look at what the injury was to the farmers who were completely unrelated to it. They clearly wouldn't -- they weren't parties to that litigation, and the Court said that's a perfectly legitimate way to figure out the right damages. So I think we would still have an argument that you -- that the Court would have the authority to grant that form of restitution under these circumstances. Mr. Dellinger spent a lot of time on what strikes me as sort of a complete fantasy with respect to the funding situation that North Carolina faced. You know, once South Carolina left, to be sure, we lost the ability to take money and help North Carolina. But the notion that North Carolina, if it had completed this facility, was not going to have a license to print money in the -- in going forward and that funding wouldn't have been available back in those days is not in the record. And, frankly, it's completely counterintuitive, because they have a monopoly. That's what the compact specifically provides for them, is the monopoly to be able to control the fees that -- on these particular wastes. Yes, Your Honor?",
  "Yes. Six months afterwards.",
  "Because the risk that South Carolina is going to pull up stakes and stop because it's been making that noise from the beginning -- that was the reason for the crisis. Washington and South Carolina said: We're not going to take every other -- every other State's waste, and we are getting out of this business. So the risk you would take in jumping out in the six months is that you then find out at the back end you have no place to dispose of your waste. So the reality is, they had -- all of the incentives to go forward existed as much in 1997 as they did in 1995, as they did in 1999. The only thing that's fundamental here is they had a responsibility not just to do what was appropriate; it was to do what was appropriate to get a license, and that's what they never did. They walked away. They took no action. Trying to negotiate funding in the abstract doesn't have anything to do with moving forward to get a license. On that score, the authority shut down and closed. Justice Sotomayor, you asked: Is there any benefit that remains? Well, the reality is, geology studies and hydrology studies that get done, those things don't change for a billion years. So every one of those studies that was done is going to be just as valid today 12 years later, although I do think the right way to analyze this is not in terms of 12 years later, but what would have happened at the time. I thank Your Honors.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Breyer, I will say to you what you asked me to say, which is I believe if you get done listening to my colleagues on the other side, it will be quite clear that this is an inherently unworkable standard that they asked us to adopt under these -­",
  "I don't know that it is necessarily any worse in this particular context. I do think what it suggests is that the Congress that looked at this problem, which as Justice Scalia pointed out was the 1938 Congress, and what that Congress was saying is we are taking a very dramatic step. We are moving in the direction of Federal regulation -­",
  "Well, I think you have to read their language as the way it was written and as the way they would have understood it at the time, which was to file any complaint, which as it would have been understood in '38 and frankly after that, when you file a complaint that usually entails some notion of formality and when you put it in the context of a specific provision where it is not only filing a complaint, but institute any proceeding, caused any proceeding to be instituted, justify any proceeding.",
  "No, because a proceeding is understood and it's used consistently in the FLSA as an official action by a government agency. So no, I don't believe that is instituting a proceeding.",
  "Right. The oral doesn't work in that particular context.",
  "I don't -- the truth is, if the employer envisions in its mind that it is instituting a proceeding, that's still not a proceeding within the meaning of what Congress meant in 1938. It had in mind an official action by a government agency. And no private employer is ever going to institute a proceeding within the meaning of that particular scheme. You know, it's extremely important in the context of this particular statute, and the one thing I should have answered, Justice Sotomayor, to your question is, what's different about this statute than any other? This statute carries a criminal penalty with it. And no other retaliation statute except for one -­",
  "Right, but the reality is that this Court held in the CIT case that the Court would not construe this statute broadly in order to expose people to potential criminal liabilities.",
  "Right.",
  "No, I -- well, it does have something to do with retaliation, but, Justice Ginsburg, it seems to me it's all of a piece, though. Because the reason why you can be comfortable with a willfulness standard even which extends to conscious disregard beyond the intent as well, but the reason why you can be comfortable with that is if you look at the way the statute is crafted in terms of the retaliation provision itself, it speaks specifically to formal actions that are taken, the filing of a complaint, the institution of a proceeding.",
  "I don't believe -- I mean, it's not a null set, but I don't believe it's a particularly, I don't think it's a large number of proceedings. But it seems to me, though, in trying to understand what the Congress of 1938 would have done and trying to understand why it would have approached this in a narrow way, and why this provision is aimed not generally to protect workers, but is aimed really to make sure that information gets to the Federal Government.",
  "Let me start by saying, first of all, even if the FLSA has broadly a pro employee protective purpose, it's still important to recognize that the retaliation provision we are talking about here specifically did not provide a cause of action, a private cause of action until 1977. So that when Congress enacted this statute in 1938, it didn't say boo about allowing the employees to show up in court and to assert their rights. This is not part of that expansive, grant rights to the employee's portion of this legislation. And then second, Justice Ginsburg, with respect to the specifics of what did Congress have in mind, it seems to me the better way to evaluate this is not did Congress have in mind a group of illiterate employees or not, but what language did Congress use in trying to formulate the specific provision that gives rise to the protections against retaliation.",
  "I will take the former argument, Your Honor.",
  "Well, my guess is the truth is they will be able to file oral complaints with the Government because, the only thing that is left open is the precise hypothetical you gave, Justice Scalia, where you make an oral complaint and nothing gets instituted in those circumstances. And it seems to me, clearly, in the Federal Government's authority to simply adopt a rule that says any time anybody makes an oral complaint to us we will institute a proceeding. And if the agency adopted that view, I don't think there is anything we could do about it.",
  "I -- I mean, my own view is the better way of reading -- that is a much closer case, I will concede that, Justice Scalia. My own view is that when you talking about file a complaint, that is just not the way Congress ordinarily thinks about file a complaint. File always has in mind written -- I'm sorry.",
  "Right. And I'm not quarrelling with that. I mean, I understand that. And the truth is, you know, I think for another day the issue will arise and the Court can decide whether or not a mere oral complaint to a government agency is sufficient to file a complaint within the meaning of this statute. I do think it is fundamentally important for this Court to decide the underlying question of whether oral complaints are sufficient only in the context in the first instance of deciding whether or not it has to go to a government agency as opposed to any kind of private or intracorporate activity.",
  "In terms of retaliation, Justice Ginsburg?",
  "No, the vast majority of those statutes talk about any action that -- opposing a practice, and therefore they deal with a lot of intracorporate activities, and obviously at some point there is an issue as to sort of what the employer's intent is and how far it got up the ladder -­",
  "Well, I suspect that issue comes up almost every day, and it is a problem; but it's a problem that Congress made a judgment that we would rather go ahead and allow those matters to be litigated; and language that is very expansive in protecting employees from retaliation. And while I -- I may chafe at that at times as a managing partner of a law firm, I recognize that that is the judgment that Congress made. Here we are talking about a Congress that made a very different judgment about how it wanted to protect retaliation. And it was a judgment that was made, it seems to me, very much in the context of 1938. Justice Sotomayor, you are very right; they were not sure they even had constitutional authority to be adopting this approach; and they are attaching to it criminal sanctions, and they are not providing a private right of action; and in that context it seems to me that this Court should comfortably say that this is a much narrower proposition.",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "And Congress must have recognized that fact, and -­",
  "No, because if under those circumstances when you're going to impose criminal sanctions on somebody, you're going to say we are not going to do that.",
  "I mean, I am perfectly comfortable with that.",
  "The -- I mean, the truth is -­",
  "Well, I don't want to give up either of the points, actually. But the bottom line is, Justice Breyer, the question presented is -- is very broad. I mean, the question of whether this goes to a governmental entity is fairly -­",
  "Well, I don't know that there's 50 or 60 years of allowing oral complaints -­",
  "-- to be in the -- in the private context. There may be 50 to 60 years of allowing oral complaints being brought to the government agency, which I do think would go to Justice Scalia's point, but with respect to intracorporate communications there is no 60-year practice -­",
  "I would not give any deference to the Government's position. Certainly not Chevron deference because this is not a -­",
  "Well, I mean I -- yes. There is no Chevron deference -­",
  "-- because this is not a matter that has been allocated to either the EEOC or the Secretary of Labor to administer and to adopt regulations.",
  "But Justice Breyer, that would strike me as a more persuasive argument if Congress hadn't -- hadn't delegated to the Secretary of Labor specific rulemaking authority with respect to specific provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and does not have a similar provision in connection with section 215(a).",
  "Right. But -- agency decisionmaking, but we don't have that either. All we have here are certain enforcement actions that are being brought by the agency and indeed, if you look at the enforcement actions, they all ultimately tie to some official action by some government entity. None of the actions that -- that you can go back to say I am going to defer to this, go into the circumstance we are talking about here, where it's a purely private action as opposed to some kind of a public -­",
  "I would give it no weight at all. But even if you gave it weight -­",
  "-- its persuasive weight, its persuasive weight as applied on a private side is nonexistent. You know, again, if -- if the issue were before -- if the -­",
  "Well, it might be -­",
  "Right, but we don't have -­",
  "Well, I -- I think the answer to that question is you don't have anywhere near the 50 years of practice dealing with the specific hypothetical you posed, Justice Breyer.",
  "I mean, I don't think that's the most natural way -­",
  "-- to read this statute. And I think the right way to read the statute is to either say -­",
  "-- that a -- that an oral complaint is -- is not sufficient, but if -- but I don't think you have to decide that issue. I think the better way to decide this case and the more fundamental one; it is the one Justice Scalia was coming back to, is does it apply beyond the government agency context? And if that isn't -­",
  "It wasn't brought up specifically in the brief in opposition. On the other hand, it was clearly presented and decided by the Seventh Circuit, so it was in the case as it came to this Court; and this Court's rule is that you can defend the judgment on any ground that's fairly presented. And -- and this ground seems to me more than fairly presented, since it -­",
  "Well, the -- yes -- if you go back to the legislative history there is a colloquy between the two Senators, and I recognize some members of the Court are unenthusiastic -- but -- but you know, in that colloquy, they talk about malicious complaints, and it seems to me malicious in that context is talking about where you have essentially defamed your employer through a government agency.",
  "Well, I think if you are going back and trying to figure out what the Congress of 1938 had in mind, the best way to do that is to look at the language chosen and the company that that language keeps. And when you take about filing a complaint and you file a -- you talk about instituting a proceeding or causing a proceeding to be instituted, or testifying at a proceeding that's formal, or belonging to a -- to a company committee that is again, a governmentally instituted methodology, the best way to read that is to say what they have in mind is an official government action of some sort. And it makes perfect -­",
  "Right. It is tied to this.",
  "Right.",
  "I have no doubt that an employee under those circumstances if -- if discharged would be able to make a claim under Title VII of retaliation for that particular conduct.",
  "Right. And I -- I think the key to this process, Justice Ginsburg, is what lens you are looking at. Are you looking through the cracked and yellowed glass that I am looking through from 1938, or the glass as it looks through in 2010, and the truth is if you were going to adopt -­",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "To be sure, Justice Ginsburg, but the -- but the -- this statute was enacted in 1938, and it was enacted as fairly radical and made an -- an initial incursion from protecting people from rehabilitation. It doesn't purport to be as expansive as any of the subsequent -- and the truth is -- can I make this point?",
  "Since the Federal Arbitration Act -- well, it actually probably predates the Federal Arbitration Act.",
  "Oh, it would have been back around the same period of time, in the 1930s.",
  "Yes. I don't -- I believe that proceeding is used in the Fair Labor Standards Act consistently throughout the statute to talk about Government -- official Government actions and not simply -­",
  "No, nothing.",
  "Well, I mean, that -- in the brief we identified a number of places where Congress uses the word \"proceedings,\" and every place where they use the word \"proceedings\" they have in mind an official Government activity. And so I think it is the most reasonable -- logical way to read this particular language as incorporating that. Of course, even if that were true, even if you would preserve that, that still wouldn't be a basis for going forward with this case, because there was no proceeding that was instituted pursuant to the informal actions that were taken.",
  "I understand that, but I'm -­",
  "I do not believe they would have regarded that as retaliatory under the statute because of the fact that the way this is all set up is the -- and the -- it's just the narrowness of the Fair Labor Standards Act. And, Justice Ginsburg, to your question about the subsequent legislation that has all been enacted, it seems to me in a lot of ways that that reinforces the core interpretive approach that I have taken in this case, because if it were absolutely clear that the language about filing a complaint and instituting a proceeding were as broad as -- certainly as the Petitioner proposes in this case, where any kind of oral grumbling is sufficient, Congress never would have needed to deviate from that template and all the legislation that came afterwards. And there are tons of statutes that say: File a complaint, institute a proceeding, and otherwise oppose. And there would have been no reason for Congress to do that if this language would have accomplished precisely the same thing.",
  "Well, I'm sure there are such cases, Your Honor. I mean, I doubt -- it probably wouldn't come up so much in the Fair Labor Standards Act process. And that's the problem: This has got a fairly narrow sweep to it. Obviously, wage and hours is not a significant activity, but it doesn't tend to generate the same kind of intensity that you might expect out of Title VII or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act or some of the other provisions. If there are no further questions, Your Honors, I would ask the Court to affirm the judgment.",
  "Sure.",
  "Intuitively, I don't disagree with that, Justice Ginsburg, but we have to go, again: What was the purpose of this particular statute? And this statute was not intended as a protection to the employer or to the employee -- or to the employer. This was a provision that was designed to give information to the Federal Government. And we know that because there's no private right of action to the employee that it is enforceable as a criminal sanction. And if you go back to the precursors of the Fair Labor Standards Act -- and somebody asked; this was the first one. I gathered there was a third one. There was the Railway Labor Act, the NLRA, and then there was this particular provision. But if you go back to these precursors, you see that it's, again, a very narrow approach that was taken under those statutes as well.",
  "I mean, part of it depends on whether the Fair Labor Standards Act applies to Federal employees. There is a whole separate regime that deals with Federal employees. And I can't -- I'm not 100 percent sure whether this provision applies under those circumstances.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The pivotal, and in my judgment, incorrect holding of the Eleventh Circuit in the Norfolk Southern case is reproduced in the appendix to this case, because Norfolk Southern is the controlling precedent for our -­ for our particular dispute. And at page 29A of the appendix to the petition, in there, the court of appeals said that there is nothing in the 4-R Act's plain language that indicates an intent to reach exemptions content from generally applicable sales and use taxes. To our way of thinking, all this case is about: Whether or not the State has free reign to employ exemptions without exposing the effects of those exemptions to a challenge under (b)(4) of the statute.",
  "No, I think, Justice Kennedy, what we are doing is recognizing that Congress was very specific and very explicit about how to treat property taxes and set up an entire quite carefully articulated scheme in dealing with them in (b)(1) and (b)(3), and then said, in general, when you are dealing with areas that are not approved by (b)(1) and (b)(3), then you have to examine whether or not the overall scheme, in fact, discriminates against rail carriers. So, while it is true that there could be circumstances in which you may end up with somewhat more protection as a consequence of (b)(4), I think that's a function of Congress not having limited the (b)(4) exemption to property, and just saying it's -- it's a discrimination against the rail carrier generally that the statute is aimed to prevent or to protect against.",
  "Well, I think because Congress didn't have the full run mine of possibilities in front of it at that point in time. I mean, it probably had some sense of what other taxes were out there that might pose discrimination, but I do think that Congress is very much concerned that the States, once they saw the roadmap laid out for them in (b)(1) through (b)(3), might seek other ways to recoup what they were going to lose in revenues when the 3-year period lapsed, and to be in a position to protect the railroads in the (b)(4) -- through (b)(4) in a situation when there would be future actions taken by the States.",
  "Not -- there's very little in the legislative record, Your Honor, because the -- the specific formulation of -- of this (b)(4) catch-all provision comes in very, very late in the 15-year process. Every other lower court that -- every lower court that has looked at it has drawn the inference, which seems to me the only fair inference to draw, when Congress said: Look, this is not just for in lieu taxes. I mean, there was -- there was some debate about that going on between the House and the Senate, and the conference committee makes it clear. This is not just something that's adopted by the States in lieu of a broader property tax. It is intended, then, to have, I think, the language that you would normally give to a term as broad and sweeping as any other tax that discriminates against rail carriers.",
  "That -- that -- no, I don't believe that's the necessary -­",
  "Well, I think it -- it is discrimination that Congress would have intended to prohibit under these circumstances. So I think in the situation where you are talking about a single exemption for some group that does not compete or otherwise do any business with the railroads, we would not have a basis for saying they were similarly situated -­",
  "Well, it -- it did to some extent, because there was a whole question about how -­ you know, you had a whole comparative class that Congress defines in the property context. So you make a context between the industrial and commercial property and the railroads' property. So Congress defined the comparison class, but I don't think it's fair -­",
  "To be sure, Justice Scalia, but it was still as compared to the entirety of the industrial and commercial property base, and it was -­ and the analysis has traditionally been the averages of the commercial industrial property. So you -- and part of the problem here -­ it's not a problem, but, you know, one of the reasons why you can't make direct comparisons is that because of ACF Industries, you don't evaluate exemptions under (b)(1) to (b)(3) -­",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, but -- remember, Justice Kennedy, we don't even get to this issue if what you say is we are going to take all exemptions off the table. And I guess I would go back to Justice Scalia's point, which is that there is a reason why this is a viscerally satisfying case, because we are talking here about a discrimination. You know, when Congress says, we want to -­ we want to eliminate any tax that discriminates against, the one thing it seems to me, clearly, Congress did not intend to exclude from that was a tax that discriminates against the -- the immediate direct competitors of the railroads in a way that would undoubtedly undermine the stability of the -- the financial stability and success of the railroad.",
  "That's -- that's correct, Justice Ginsberg, but I think the premise of your -- of your question is the place where we would probably differ, which is: To be sure, Congress intended to protect interstate carriers against discrimination in favor of local operations. That's clear in (b)(1) through (b)(3) and otherwise pervades the legislative history. But there is also a significant amount of discussion in that same legislative history to encourage intermodal competition; that is, competition between the railroads and others, both intrastate and interstate. And so it seems to me that the statute that's -- that prohibits all discrimination against rail carriers, identified as carriers -­",
  "I can see us making that argument -­",
  "Well, I always like to come back, but I don't -- I think the answer to that is -­ again, I think the -- the Court ought to interpret the term \"discrimination\" against the clear objectives that Congress intended to fulfill when it protected the railroads this way. And the two protections that are embedded in there is one that Justice Ginsberg identified, which was to protect them against local interests in a way where they had no political influence, and the other one is to protect them against their direct competitors in the intermodal competition realm. And if it's -- if it's a discrimination that doesn't achieve either of those, then it seems to me you either say they are -- are not similarly situated or you would held -- you would hold that the State has a legitimate reason for doing what it's doing, and that that's just not a discrimination within the meaning of the statute.",
  "Well, they would have -- they would be, to be sure, local interests. But I think the problem with this is, and it goes to the core argument that the State makes, which is: How are you supposed to define \"local business\" for these purposes. And I don't think the -- the answer to that is: I have no way to know that, because Congress didn't purport to define the comparison class for purposes of (b)(4). It seems to me that when Congress said \"any other tax\" -­",
  "But it seems to me quite -- I mean, the flip side of that argument would be to say, if they imposed the tax of 4 percent on the railroads and 2 percent on 85-year-old widows, that would be challengeable under (b)(4), because it's not an exemption, it's a differential, and that the exemption down to zero is -- is attackable under (b)(4). It seems to me the right answer to this is, there is no reason to include your widow as a relative comparison class for purposes of (b)(4) and get out of that problem as opposed to setting this up. To me, the fallacy of this analysis is to try to use exemptions and say that there is something special about exemptions beyond the (b)(1), (b)(3) context where Congress clearly acted, recognizing that it had to protect the States' ability to have exemptions for property taxes. But then Congress goes to non-property taxes and to other taxes not covered by (b)(1) and (b)(3). Then, it seems to me, you have to -- you just should change the analysis. Look at whether or not similarly situated are being treated differently and if there is any kind of State justification for that, and if not, go through the analysis in the way -- and protect the railroads precisely the way that Congress meant for them to be protected.",
  "I think, ultimately, my conclusion would be that you can't have one -- you can't have this kind of a tax on us and not tax the motor carriers the same way. But I do think it's important to recognize two considerations, at least as this case comes to this Court. One is that the State and the trial court conceded that the appropriate comparison class was the motor and water carriers. So the question of who is the -- who is properly in the comparison class has never been adjudicated. And second, it seems to me that the question of what constitutes discrimination is not the issue in this case. The only question in this case is whether there is something special about exemptions that makes them off-limits to the (b)(4) inquiry. So I think, candidly, Justice Ginsburg, while I'm quite certain that Alabama and I would disagree fundamentally about how to approach this, it doesn't seem to me that that's a question that this Court should tarry long over, and instead ought to simply evaluate the very narrow question that was both presented by the holding below and presented in the petition as it came through the Solicitor General's invitation stage, which again, as I say, very narrowly focuses exclusively on exemptions, and of course allow us to have them.",
  "Well, I think part of the reason, it may well be because the property tax was a big-ticket item, so you were trying to protect certain State interests, and Congress did it very clearly. I think it is quite a remarkable stretch of -- of construction of the statute for the Court to say, we're going to take this very carefully reticulated scheme, which creates the inference that Congress meant to protect these kinds of exemptions for the States, and say we are going to now incorporate that wholesale, when Congress didn't use language that in any way compares. It didn't include -- it didn't limit it to railroad property. It didn't define a class in any particular way, and instead, it basically said, what we need here is something that will protect the railroads when the States become more innovative and come forward with additional problems. And we would leave it to the courts, unfortunately -- I recognize that is not the most satisfying solution sometimes, but we will leave it to the courts to decide what forms of discrimination we would have intended to preclude, because we are here to protect the railroads. If there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a -- a few quick points. First of all, with respect to the reason why the States didn't challenge these tax exemptions earlier; for some of us it's relatively easy to remember what the price of fuel oil was back in the 1970s, it was somewhere in the sort of 10 to 30 cents a gallon range. Therefore exemptions of that amount of tax, 1 percent exemption of that amount of tax is not a whole lot of money. Today the rates are $4 a gallon, and an exemption under those circumstances, particularly when you have a fixed rate for your major competitor, gives you a more than substantial incentive to bring an action under these circumstances. The notion that somehow the -- the State has gone down this path because of Federal law has not been true for at least 15 years. That statute was repealed and Alabama could have modified its tax however it wanted to and chose not to do so. Justice Alito, your hypothetical I think is almost exactly this case, because as my friend indicated, diesel fuel is by far the biggest expense that the railroads have. It's also a very significant expense for the motor carriers, and it is a pretty trivial expense for everybody else in the -- in the State of Alabama.",
  "Well, you're ultimately going to have to come down to the same issue, and the problem is, and I -- the reason why I -- I find it hard to accept Justice Kennedy's formulation, which is simply singling out the railroads, because in ACF the Court sort of said well, we will hold that out as a possibility. If you're doing -- you know, it would be one thing if you are just singling them out. But it seems to me that in a statute like (b)(4), where you -- where you are more broadly, and you don't have the (b)(1) to (b)(3) baggage to deal with property taxes, the idea that you would then limit (b)(4) solely to the situation of singling out is -- is simply not a fair way to characterize it.",
  "Right. It has to be that -­ the traditional and common understanding of discriminate is that you treat similarly situated individuals differently without -- with an adequate justification.",
  "Well, it depends on the -­ it's going to depend on the tax, and I don't know the answer in this context, because as Justice Alito's question reveals -­",
  "-- it could be that the vast majority of diesel fuel is -­",
  "I -- the first one I think without question.",
  "I think the second one has more of a problem, because I don't think Congress intended to allow to you favor direct competitors of the railroads when the ultimate effect of that may be to undermine the -- the financial stability of the railroads.",
  "I would define.",
  "Right. I think ultimately the way to analyze this is case is what was Congress's ultimate objective. And if the state is putting forward a legitimate reason that is fully consistent with Congress's overall objective, then there is no problem.",
  "Competition among carriers.",
  "Which suggests to me that there are two ways to worry about discrimination. Have you singled out other carriers for more favorable treatment? There I think if the answer is per se, if you do that you lose. And if you are not in that world and you are talking about some other classes, then it seems to me it depends on how far you want to go in terms of how much of an exemption you want to play. But the important part of this is still and I think the questions to Mr. Maze reflected is that you should undertake the inquiry to determine whether there is discrimination even if the State happens to use the guise of exemptions as opposed to rate differentials or anything else. There is nothing special about exemptions that takes it off the table. It proposes the Federalism concerns and that ACF spoke to this issue. ACF said you should not extend the statute beyond its evident reach reflecting the (b)(1), (b)(3) and (b)(4) relationship without a clear statement. That's not what we have in this case, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: What this Court has under review today is an extraordinary and unprecedented order issued by a three­ judge district court requiring the release of between 36,000 and 45,000 inmates, currently incarcerated in the California penal system, within a 2-year period. The order in this particular case is made particularly remarkable because it strikes me that at a minimum it is extraordinarily premature. That -- it may come at some point in this process that an order, probably substantially smaller in scope than this one, may become appropriate. But if this is supposed to be an order or remedy of last resort, and what the district court has done here is leapfrogged a series of steps that should have been taken ahead of going this particular route.",
  "Yes, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "That's absolutely true, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "No, Justice Ginsburg. I think, obviously, the length of time you have to wait in some ways depends on what the state of the remedial phase is in the particular case. And in this case and in recognition, frankly, of the substantial problems that were inherent in the -- in the penal system as it existed during the 1990s and up until the early 2000s, a receiver was appointed, specifically in the Plata class, but there was also connections between the receiver and the special master even in the Coleman class before the three-judge panel was convened. And under those circumstances and given the extraordinary powers that the receiver had been accorded, what should have -- the most logical course, if this is supposed to be a remedy of last resort, was to allow the receiver an opportunity to implement the extraordinary powers that were conferred upon him, and then see -- because if it turns out that we aren't making progress -­",
  "The -- the -­",
  "Sure.",
  "I don't think that's a fair characterization of what the receiver said. The receiver said that, at any population, he would in fact get you to the point -­",
  "No, no. That's not all I'm relying on. All I'm suggesting -­",
  "Well, if you -- all you have to do is look at what the receiver has done over the course of the period of time since his appointment, and particularly when the second receiver was put in place. First of all, A.B. 900 has been enacted. There is significant construction. There has been ground broken. There are substantial facilities in place. Second, the receiver has had extraordinary success in the hiring process. They are -- we are at close to 90 percent -­",
  "Justice Ginsburg, the fundamental issue in this case seems to me as -- what is the real cause of the constitutional violation here? And the real cause of the constitutional violation here has always been the culture of disregard for the inmate. What the receiver was put in place for, the reason he was appointed, and properly so -- this was with the State's consent; this is not over our objection -- was to change that fundamental culture and to provide, one, construction, to provide increased numbers, to provide -­",
  "Except that since the August 8th, 2008, period of time, you know, literally hundreds of millions of dollars have gone to construction specifically and more than $4 billion have been spent on the provision of health care in this particular system. And a great deal of that is because of the receiver.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I don't think we could get that relief from the single-judge district court, unless you're asking me to actually seek to remove the entirety of the claim. I mean, the order that says that we have to get to 137.5 percent of the design, the design capacity, within 2 years is a three-judge district court decision.",
  "Right, but that will always be the case, Justice Sotomayor. The fundamental question here is: Congress shifted dramatically the approach that you're supposed to take as a court of equity in this context. This is supposed to be a matter of last resort, which would mean that you would give the receiver a full opportunity to do what the receiver -­",
  "Well -­",
  "And then -­",
  "No, but, Justice Breyer, the legislature also approved a smaller but nevertheless multibillion-dollar construction program.",
  "Well, I -- I mean, they approved -­",
  "Yes, they did approve that -­",
  "-- and that money is being spent.",
  "Right, and the receiver -­",
  "Well, I don't know whether it will get you there or not.",
  "Well, there is the evidence that the receiver asked for contempt for not getting the 8 billion and withdrew that motion. So, obviously, there is some sense in which the receiver is reasonably satisfied with 2.35 billion as an opening gambit. But, again, all of this goes to what is, at least from my perspective, the fundamental question the court should have evaluated in the first instance, which is: Are we ready yet to give up hope at this point?",
  "Well, there's -­",
  "Justice Breyer, when the receiver says that -- now remember, he says at current population levels. He doesn't suggest, and his brief is very clear, that it doesn't urge this Court to affirm the particular order in this case.",
  "Can I -­",
  "-- just finish this? And the reality is that the population levels have dropped pretty significantly since August, since the trial in this particular case. And given the actions by the legislature in A.B. 18 and the actions of the legislatures in A.B. 900, there are both a lot of expenditures on the table and substantial reductions in the population size. And so, therefore, even under the receiver's -­",
  "Well, it's down to around, as I understand it, about 147,000 from a high of around 165 to 170,000, and it has dropped, as we know, because there has been a change in the good time credits. There has been a significant number of transfers. I mean, that was the purpose of the governor's proclamation declaring an emergency.",
  "I think it unlikely.",
  "I mean, there's a core sort of federalism answer and then a basic sort of factual point to be made here. Let me make the second one first, and then I want to come back to the -- what you may regard as rhetorical, but nevertheless I think important, which is that when we made our initial proposal to the three-judge court suggesting what we thought would be a reasonable reduction within a reasonable period of time, it was met with both a motion for contempt and summary rejection out of hand, notwithstanding that there was improvement at the time -­",
  "No. I think the -- no, this goes to the federalism point.",
  "I don't know. I -- you know, if -- if balancing all of the policies that the State has to take into account, can it get there and is that in the best interest of the State of California? If it is, yes, then we can get there.",
  "Absolutely. And California recognizes that.",
  "I'll do my best. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "I mean, first of all, let's -- you know, if you look at the receiver's 2009 death review which came out in September 2010, it specifically says that there has been a significant downward trend over the past 4 years. The suicides -- the 25 suicides in '09 were 66 percent of the average for the preceding 3 years, and the 9 homicides were 60 percent of the average. There have been significant improvements. And the more important point in response to your specific question, Justice Sotomayor, is that the record in this case was cut off in August of 2008, and so what we have are -­",
  "Well, I'm not sure we've stated that.",
  "Justice Kennedy, I agree with everything you say except -- and I even agree with the last statement, because, you know, you needed a significant remedy. There's no question about it. But you got a significant remedy when the receiver was appointed in 2005 and implemented a program in 2006. I mean, our -­",
  "Well, there's no -- Justice Kagan, there's no specific time frame. I mean, obviously, we believe that we are entitled to a reasonable opportunity to comply with the receiver's orders and to bring ourselves ultimately into compliance with the Constitution, and -­",
  "No, that's -- Justice Kennedy, you know, given all of the other constraints, et cetera -- again, there's a fundamental difference between what you do under the hammer of a district court order, which is what we have under these circumstances, and what the State will do. That said, the State is absolutely committed. I mean, the -- again, to go back to what is the root cause of the constitutional violation, it's not overcrowding. I mean, when California violated the constitutional rights of the mentally ill in the 1990s, the prisons weren't crowded. It was because there was a fundamental lack of attentiveness to medical care under those circumstances. And that's unfortunate, to be sure. More than that. But that was the reason. To go back to your point, Justice Kennedy, that's why the receiver, which is an extraordinary remedy. To confer upon a private individual the entire authority to run the California Department of Corrections, not just simply a facility or anything like that, but the entire Department of Corrections' medical and -- medical health provision, is incredible.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, even if you accept that, and I don't think that's precisely how I would interpret what the receiver said under these circumstances anyway, but even if you accept that, the idea of a 137-1/2 percent design cap that has to be implemented within fewer than 2 years is a remedy that's neither necessary nor sufficient. It is not aimed at the specific class. It doesn't remedy the specific Federal rights as required by the Prisoners Litigation Reform Act.",
  "I think, Justice Ginsburg, the -- the fundamental point here is that it may eventually be that you have to get to that stage, but if you look at the receiver's reports since August 2008, which consistently analyzed this issue, and they say: And we have been able successfully to bring in very qualified personnel, and we have significantly larger numbers; we know there is construction in place; it may not be as substantial as what I originally proposed; it is nevertheless very significant. And -- and Congress was very explicit that the remedy of a prisoner release order should be the remedy of last resort.",
  "Well -­",
  "I would say that the Prisoners Litigation Reform Act has a series of very specific requirements that the Federal court has to comply with, and that in deciding to go to a three-judge district court in the first instance, you have to examine the orders that are in place and whether those orders have had a reasonable time within which to operate. And -­",
  "Well, it depends on what you mean by -­",
  "I -- I mean, it seems to me that, first of all, I'm not sure that's consistent with the language. It's the primary cause of the constitutional violation, not the primary impediment to the implementation of a specific remedy. So I think that's still a difficult and open question as to how to proceed. But it still strikes me that the sequence that Congress envisions and the one that would make the most sense and ultimately the one that hopefully would accommodate both the plaintiffs' interests and the State's interests, and the Department of Corrections' interests, is to allow the receiver to stay on a course that candidly I think will in fact get you there. I mean, again, one of the real flaws in this case, Justice Kennedy, is nobody doubts for a moment that there have been very significant violations of constitutional rights years gone by and, indeed, a failure on the mental health side ultimately to get you -- get to the point where we are in fact providing a significant remedy. The reality is, is that in the course of the last 3 to 4 years under the guidance of the -- of the receiver, who coordinates with the special master on the mental health side and does it with the cooperation of the State of California, there have been significant -­ there has been significant movement in the right direction. And if the court had not jumped the gun and said, look, we're not going to -- we're not going to let that part play itself out, we are going to leap ahead and go to a three-judge court and go to the prisons -­ to the prisoner release order, this process would have played itself out and we wouldn't be here -­",

  "No, Your Honor, that's obviously not appropriate, and one of the things we've complained about -­",
  "Well, to be sure, although, candidly, we had -- we had referred to some of those same statements even in the jurisdictional statement in this litigation. This has been part of the case for quite some time. So I -- I don't know what motivated the special master to file an out-of-time brief -- or I mean, the receiver to file an out-of-time brief. But I understand -- you know, we didn't object to it so long as the Court was of a mind to hear from the receiver. But I do think the most important part of that, though, to keep in mind in this context is the receiver didn't ask for this Court to affirm. The receiver simply clarified certain statements that had been made and tried to say, as Justice Alito described, put them into some kind of context. And that's -- and that's fine, and we obviously don't have any quarrel with -- with that particular presentation. But I do think to say that the receiver has insisted that he cannot get to a constitutionally permissible result without the order that has been imposed in this particular case is -- is simply not consistent with either the record and certainly not consistent with that amicus brief.",
  "I mean, experts made the -­ certainly reached that specific conclusion. But this Court has recognized -­",
  "Well -­",
  "Right. But, again, it seems to me that there is a very, very, very big difference between what do you need to accomplish in order to remedy whatever -- whatever the constitutional violation is, recognizing in the first instance that the biggest element of an Eighth Amendment violation is the deliberate indifference prong, which absolutely seems to me to have been completely eliminated by the conduct of the State over the course of the last 3 to 4 years. There is no evidence to support -­",
  "Well, it depends I suppose on some ways on how you -­",
  "Right.",
  "Well, if the Court were to conclude that the three-judge panel shouldn't have been convened, that would be one outcome. If the Court concludes that it was appropriate to convene it, but 137-1/2 percent is not narrowly tailored, it would be a different one. Either way, it will go back, obviously, to a court of equity. The receiver is in place. The receiver has a comprehensive plan in place which he is implementing as we speak. I mean, you know, one of the things that -­",
  "Well, I mean, 400 million of it has already been spent. The rest of it has already been earmarked for this particular purpose, and there is -- and the expectation from the State of California is that money is -- is going forward.

  "-- every time the receiver asks for a check he gets one.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Well, the receiver is saying it's not etched in stone. I understand that. But our assumption and our expectation and our belief is that that money is going to be used for construction. There are projects that are finished, there are projects that are under way, and there are project that are scheduled to begin within the next 6 weeks, all of which will be funded out of that $2.35 billion.",
  "They asked for additional information, to be sure. But the expectation, again, from the governor, both this governor and the governor-elect, is that that money will ultimately be approved and that that facility would be built. And we're moving along very rapidly to get that construction under way, because we're talking about enormous facilities under these particular circumstances, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "The -- there -- the fundamental problem with the fact-finding in this -­ well, there are actually two fundamental problems. First of all, remember that the receiver gets appointed, and then 3 months later you get a motion for a three-judge court. The three-judge court convenes itself before the receiver has even finalized the comprehensive plan to bring everybody into compliance in the first instance. So the reality is that's -- that's the fundamental legal error I'm asking this Court to correct. But even if you get beyond that and you're looking at the primary cause analysis, it seems to me that's -- that's at most -- at best, a mixed question of law and fact, and it's the kind of standard that this Court ought to analyze to determine in the first instance and on an independent review whether or not the overcrowding is, quote, \"the primary cause of the violation.\" And what makes that inquiry particularly appropriate for this Court, as opposed to simply slavishly adhering -- deferring to the district court in this circumstance, is that the district court arbitrarily cut off the record in August of '08 and there have been enormous developments since then. And there were enormous developments -­",
  "Well, there's a huge difference between not allowing formal tours and all of the rigamarole that goes with that, which is what the State specifically objected to. But what the State wanted to do and what the intervenors on our side in even greater vehemence wanted to do was to bring forward evidence that proved that in the interim period of time there have been, in fact, significant improvements. As I sit here today, Justice Kennedy, you said it's conceded that we're -- that we're in constitutional violation. It is conceded that we have been in constitutional violation. I don't know whether today we are in violation.",
  "Yes. Justice Ginsburg, I understand what the ordinary rule would be in a -- of a court of equity dealing with a constitutional violation. But we're talking about an order entered under the Prisoners Litigation Reform Act, and it's quite clear, the statute couldn't be any plainer, that it shifts the burden significantly onto the plaintiff when you are going to go for a remedy as extreme as insisting that somewhere between potentially 36,000 and 45,000 inmates be released within a -- within a 2-year period of time. Again, if you go back, you know, the receiver has not -- at the time that all of this took place, the receiver had been appointed. The receiver had devised a plan. The receiver is currently spending an enormous amount of money, $4 billion on health care, to get -- to get the system moving in the right direction, with the right attitude, in order to bring ourselves without question into constitutional compliance. The truth is we haven't really had an assessment of where we are in the constitutional compliance spectrum.",
  "Coleman is obviously a much -- a much more serious problem. I don't doubt that. But it seems -- and if the Court were to conclude ultimately that Coleman ought to go back for another analysis based on the problems there, I could understand that. And it would be a very different prisoner release order under those circumstances because then you'd have to take out all of the evidence with respect to Plata and let that play out. But even that, it seems to me, would be a mistake under these circumstances where the special master and the receiver have been in a sense joined at the hip in a variety of ways. And it only makes sense, because the -- the receiver is controlling the provision of medical care in the CDCR and the special master is taking care of or trying to promote a very small slice of that. So in the scheme of things, as you might expect, the receiver consistently gets the ultimate authority to make the decisions to help provide the kind of resources, both in quality and quantity and staff and construction and access to health care.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Because the district court -­ because the district court could not have been plainer. And when the intervenor's counsel stood up in the opening statement and said, I want to start talking about the beneficial changes and where the status is today as opposed to where it was way back when, the three-judge court, or at least one member of the three-judge court said: We have been as clear as we can be that we are not entertaining any evidence on that point. So the notion of coming forward with a proffer, while technically it might have been -- is clearly a futile act, and we had already annoyed the judges on our side by even making reference to it. So I don't think it's an appropriate response to say that we should have put forward more, because the truth is we would have -­",
  "All right. But Justice Sotomayor, there is, to my mind at least, a complete disconnect by saying, I'm not going to tell you exactly where the constitutional violation is today, we're not going to get into that, we're just going to assume there's a constitutional violation; now prove to me that the remedy -- you know, what remedy will or will not work under those circumstances. It seems to me the exact opposite is the way to do it. You determine where the constitutional violation is -­",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points. First of all, with respect to the state of the record and what was proffered and what was not proffered, if you look at the joint appendix at 2085, there's a specific proffer that is made by the intervenors in that context -- or I mean -- I'm sorry. There's a specific proffer made by the State of the -­",
  "2085. That's volume 6 of the -- and it is at that point where the plaintiffs, the intervening plaintiffs say we'd like to put on evidence of constitutional violations. And Judge Karlton says: Twice this court has said we will not receive that evidence. You've made a clear -- as clear a record as you can; please don't waste our time. And then later, at 2338, which is again in volume 6, where we enter Mr. Dezember, who is the assistant secretary of CDCR in charge of health care, he specifically said -- I've read the -- I've read the Dezember declaration, and it will not be received to the extent that it says the State is in compliance. So we've made our efforts -­",

  "We -­",
  "Well, it's -­",
  "Look, I mean, the plaintiffs' counsel talks about all of the things that you can do, and if you -- if you look at 70a of the -- the jurisdictional statement appendix, it specifically says there's a line; above the line we can implement, and that will get you about 16,000 inmates, and below the line you need legislation in order to implement these things. But the reality is that anytime you say you're going to release 30,000 inmates in a very compressed period of time, I guarantee you that there's going to be more crime and people are going to die on the streets of California. I mean that -- there's no way out of that particular box.",
  "I think so, but I'm still concerned, because the district court in this specific says -- said: We have not evaluated the -- the safety impact of each of the State's -- of the elements of the State's proposed plan. And it seems to me they had an obligation to do that. The other point I want to make with respect to Justice Kennedy's question is that there is not a shred of evidence that 137.5 makes any sense whatsoever. That is a pulled-out-of-the-air number. Theirs was aspirational. None of that is based on what is the constitutional violation that exists at the time you adopt that particular percentage. And it seems to me that's the entire problem with this -- this exercise, which is to say we're going to fix this across the board, rather than what would make much more sense, which is to evaluate these matters facility by facility, to evaluate these matters on the basis of the various elements discrete elements of how you can reduce the prison population, and to do it in -­ in conjunction with a receiver who is in place who can help to implement this in a very systemic way and that will get us to where we want to get to.",
  "Because the district court's order said you're going to have to reach 137.5 percent in 2 years, period. That's the categorical rule. And the first time we went in to suggest something above 137.5, Judge Henderson said: I'm not hearing that.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1986, Congress converted what had been before that time a merely peripheral concern of immigration policy -- that is, how to regulate worker authorization -- and converted it into a core concern of immigration policy by the passage of the -- of the Immigration Reform and Control Act. This Court has characterized that change in legislation as providing a comprehensive scheme for dealing with those issues, and that characterization is obviously apt because Congress provided for an exhaustive and exclusively Federal method of bringing to the attention of Federal authorities problems in worker authorization, the method by which those matters should be investigated, the method by which they should be adjudicated, all of which are controlled as a matter of Federal -- exclusive Federal activity; and, indeed, the ultimate judicial review goes exclusively to the Federal courts of appeals. The sanctioning provisions are very explicit and they're very clear and they are very balanced; and for a good reason. Congress realized in this context that if you over-enforce in one direction -- that is, if you try to deter the hiring of unauthorized workers -­ you run a very serious risk of causing employers to err on the side of not hiring others who are in fact authorized but who may fall into protected classes. And so Congress very carefully calibrated the penalties on both sides so that the employer essentially would play it straight down the middle and hire the best people for the job under these circumstances, while, of course, complying if at all possible with the Federal requirements. And so it's against that backdrop -­",
  "Well, the State statute has two components to it. One is knowing and one is intent. But -­",
  "But I don't see how that -­",
  "Well, I think part of the problem is that there -- it is never 100 percent clear precisely who is and who is not an authorized worker. And I think what Congress said was -- I'm not going to deal with this problem in the kind of granular way you're looking at it, Justice Scalia, which is specifically at each of the individual employment decisions. I'm going to look at the generality of situations, and realize that if you put in -- on one side of the scale what Arizona has done here, which is to say you can -- you can essentially have the death penalty to the business, that is, complete eliminate the business's right to exist, and, on the other side of the scale, a $250 fine, it would -- it would be pretty remarkable to say, well, I -- you know, I'm going to hide behind the intent and knowing requirements and, instead, simply avoid if at all possible the risk of Arizona's sanctions being imposed upon me.",
  "Well, I'm quite sure that that's what Arizona will say.",
  "Right. It does ultimately does come down to the \"through licensing\" laws and -­ the -- the part of the -- and the fundamental problem, obviously, with Arizona's scheme here is that this is not a licensing law. This is a worker authorization sanctioning law.",
  "Right. Justice Kennedy, I think the better way to try to -- to grapple with the meaning of the licensing law or whether it ought to be construed broadly to allow the State wide authority to engage in supplemental enforcement in this, or narrowly in order to say that what really ought to happen in this context is, if you deal with a situation where the Federal Government has enacted -- I'm sorry -- has enforced a provision and imposed a penalty through the Federal scheme, that then as a supplement to that the State does in fact have the authority to add something over and above what it -- what the Federal Government has done. But it seems to me quite remarkable to think that Congress intended through a parenthetical referring to \"through licensing laws\" to allow the State to adopt an entire alternative shadow enforcement mechanism, a non-administrative decision-making process, completely a State-run operation; and even at the end, the sanction is not -- is not imposed ultimately in effect by the -­ by any regulating entity. It is ordered by a State court.",
  "Justice Scalia, I -- I understand the point, and I understand the motivation for why Arizona did what it did. But the -- the problem is the statute was enacted in 1986, and that's when the pre-emption standards were put in place. And the -­ again, the notion -- if you look at the way the structure of the statute -- and this also responds in some ways to Justice Kennedy's question about how should you read licensing, since it's not a self-defining concept -- is if you -- is that, first, Congress said very specifically that the immigration laws should be enforced uniformly, which says that there shouldn't be 40,000 different localities offering up their view of licensing and -- and the additional 50 States. Second of all, and this part I think is particularly telling in terms of this massive State scheme that's been adopted, which is that under section 1324a(b)(5), which is in 134a of the -- of the appendix, Congress specifically outlaws the use of the I-9 form. And in some ways this goes to your question, Justice Scalia, because it would be inconceivable that the State can in fact enforce knowing and intentional decision making without having access to the I-9 form, because that's -­",
  "Sure.",
  "That is true, Justice Alito.",
  "Well, I -- I think the answer to that specific hypothetical is that's still not a licensing law, because it doesn't tie the grant of the license to the revocation powers.

  "Well, no, no. But, Justice Scalia, there's a vast difference between that and what they're saying.",
  "Actually, Justice Scalia, can I stop you there?",

It just simply gives you the right to exist, and you may very well need to get a separate document in order to actually do business in a particular State.",
  "No, you don't need that.",

First is Congress, in section 115 of the statute, specifically says enforcement should be uniform, which suggests to me that this ought to be exclusively a Federal investigation and -- and adjudication process. Two, the point I was making earlier about the I-9 form. Those forms cannot be used in any location -­",

And -- and the last thing I would say with respect to that was the conforming amendments with respect to the Agricultural Workers Protection Act, there's a situation where the Department of Labor, which used to engage in adjudication as well, was divested of that authority. It seems quite unlikely Congress meant to give that authority to the States and take it from the Department of Labor.",
  "But Arizona doesn't purport -­",

  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and, once again, may it please the Court: I want to begin frankly where Justice Sotomayor pointed me to before, which is the question of whether or not there really is a basis for allowing the States to independently investigate and to independently adjudicate these matters. And what is the evidence that Congress did not intend that? Justice Breyer quoted from the House report, recognizing not everybody accepts that, but it does seem to me to articulate a very commonsense limitation that says you have to have a Federal adjudication in the first instance, and once you've got that, then the State is allowed to add that sanction. That -- that principle, it seems to me, is reinforced by the limitation on what you can use the I-9 for. Justice Alito, you asked that question, but it does seem to me quite clear that what Congress envisioned in 1986 when it adopted this is you're going to have an exclusively Federal enforcement scheme including the adjudicatory process, and it is only in that context that you are allowed to use the I-9. And the notion that the State could adopt a standard of intentional or knowingly, and not be able to have the I-9 materials available, seems to me flatly at odds with each other, and, therefore, it cannot be that Congress intended under those circumstances to allow these matters to be adjudicated in that particular fashion.",
  "I -- it seems to me the easiest -- and of course, this has nothing to do with what Arizona does -- but the easiest is, if a -- an employer is convicted of -- of violating IRCA and a criminal sanction, and he happens to be a barber, and the State licensing law says if you're convicted of a -­ of a Federal crime you will lose your license, it is available to the State under those circumstances -- and I think this is exactly what Congress had in mind -- to issue a notice to show cause why that particular person shouldn't have the license revoked and then go from there.",
  "Justice Scalia -­",
  "Well, no. But, Justice Scalia, it seems to me the whole question here -- and first of all, I don't think pre-emption can be a moving target. I think you have to decide it on a basis of what Congress had in front of it in 1986. But remember, Congress was balancing three, at least, very difficult problems: minimizing burdens on the employers, minimizing discrimination against people who are permitted to be hired, and avoiding hiring people who are not permitted to do so. And how you properly reconcile that is very difficult, but the one thing that seems to me clear is that that was a choice Congress meant to leave to itself and to the Federal Government to sort out and not to give the States the opportunity to come in where they did. And to say one last word about E-Verify -­",
  "Well, if you -- if you interpret the savings clause as I do, which means truly as a supplement to Federal -- Federal adjudication, then it is a very narrow limitation on that basis, because at that point you've already invoked the entirety of the Federal scheme, and it doesn't modify the balance on those broader legal issues, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The proposition that Petitioners are here challenging is the one adopted or embraced by the Federal Circuit that says that the United States Government can declare that certain of its government contracting partners have operated in default and, under those circumstances, can reach into the government contractor's pocket, withdraw at the time $1.35 billion of moneys that were spent by the United States, but for services that were rendered, without question, pursuant to the contract, pursuant to the instructions of the United States Government, and that when the contractor seeks to defend against the claim that it has engaged in some kind of default conduct, that the government can assert the state-secrets privilege and, in so doing, deprive the contractor of the ability effectively to respond to the government's conclusion. Under those circumstances, it seems to me that the statement in this Court's decision in United States v. Reynolds, which is that the government is certainly free to assert the state-secrets privilege, but when it does so, it has to assume certain responsibilities that come from it, at least in the circumstances where the United States is the moving party.",
  "There was nothing specific with respect to that, Justice Ginsburg. The first time the contractors identified the superior knowledge problem arose, obviously, when the government took the extraordinary step of issuing a cure notice, because up until that point, obviously, the parties are attempting to negotiate and work to a final resolution of this project, as you would hope any contracting entities would, to bring the contract to a happy resolution, so -­",
  "Well, yes, I think you have to put it in context, Justice Ginsburg, because during this period of time, obviously, there were consistent efforts and requests being made to get access to both the B-2 and the A-117 stealth technologies, and there were discussions that went back and forth, and the district court -- or the Court of Federal Claims specifically held -- eventually, the information was forthcoming, but it was, candidly, too little and too late in order to effectively allow the contract to proceed as -- as planned. So I think -- I mean, I agree, you know, in a perfect world, maybe you would have identified this. But in this situation, the parties are simply trying to come to some kind of a resolution that allows both sides to be satisfied by the final -­",
  "-- disposition.",
  "No, I think -- I think, Justice -­",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Well, you have to --",
  "Right. And we would have been perfectly content to proceed with the evidence we had. But the ultimate decision by the Court of Federal Claims was that it was impossible to ultimately be in a position to resolve it. But I want to answer your more fundamental question, Your Honor, as to the -- you know, the basic point is, is that the background principle of law, the superior knowledge defense, is the understanding of the parties when they enter into an agreement. I mean, that would have been true just as much in the Helene Curtis case and the other cases where the Federal Circuit has acknowledged the superior knowledge defense. That's been around for a long time. It's a-- it's an understood basis on which the parties enter into an agreement. That's the first answer. The second answer is that you're asking us to put into a contract something about information that we don't know anything about. We -- I mean, we have some sense about the B-2 and the A-117, but we don't know anything about the other programs that are identified here.",
  "Well, our claim -- we have separate -- we have a series of distinct claims. Our first claim is that we never would have entered into the contract in the first place if the government had provided us with information based on its superior knowledge that the -- for instance, the weight specifics that we were being asked to provide or to supply were literally impossible to comply with based on what the government already knew. If we had been just told that much, just given a warning, we wouldn't be in the situation where we are here -­",
  "Well -- I mean, that may be a factual dispute, but I'd be -- and I'd be happy to litigate that issue if -- if we can get to that point where we're in fact allowed to litigate any aspects of our particular defense. But the bottom line here is -- and again to state the proposition as starkly as it -­ as it is, because this is the way it comes to the Court from the Federal Circuit: They're saying that the government can assert a claim for $1.35 billion dollars against us and tell us that we cannot defend against that claim even though the reason why we were unable to comply with the contract is because of the fact that the government didn't provide us information either at the outset or as we went along.",
  "Can I answer -­",
  "Well, I don't -­",
  "Right. Well, it seems to me clearly that this is the precise situation where Reynolds is saying if you cannot bring forward a legitimate defense -- I mean, part of the problem is we don't know precisely what information we didn't have and were never entitled to. So it's very difficult to say how strong is our defense under these circumstances. What we do know is that the Court of Federal Claims judge looked very carefully at this and said that we had made an impressive showing without regard to any of the confidential or privileged information of a prima facie defense in these circumstances. So our position is we had a very valid defense. This is not pretextual. We're not throwing this in simply as a mechanism to force the government to assert its state secrets. It's a fairly contrived approach to litigation and, frankly, not something that I could imagine any circumstance in which we would do that. Two, I don't see how this throws a monkey wrench into this process whatsoever, much less throws out the monkey, because -- because the basic understanding here is that the government is not entitled to force its contractor down along this course. If the government has information available to it, then it has to make that information -- has to be forthcoming with the information with the contractor, either at the outset, which would have been the best of all circumstances here, or as matters go along.",
  "Well, not -- I mean, \"moving party\" I think is -- is not a self-defined concept, Justice Alito. The Petitioners are the plaintiffs.",
  "Well, because the review scheme also says that the very -- in 1986, in the Assurance case, the Federal Circuit said -- which was before this contract was entered into, the Federal Circuit said the filing -- the mere filing of a complaint immediately vacates the contracting officer's rule. So our understanding at the time we entered into this agreement is that if there were a problem with the way the contracting officer operated, we would be allowed to file a claim and immediately take the contracting officer's rule off the table. Under those circumstances, it seems to me all we're asking for is to go back to the status quo ante in that situation, which means there's no contracting officer decision, there's no basis on which the government can make a claim for 1.35 billion, now $3 billion.",
  "Well, what had not happened is that the final -- there had not been a final sign-off by the contracting officer approving it and thereby reducing it to a liquidated claim. But that's a vastly different statement than to say -- and, indeed, we have an argument that, at least with respect to half of that, that it had already effectively been approved through a mechanism independent of the contracting officer. But the bottom line here is these were services rendered, actually rendered. This was not some kind of a prepayment for services to be rendered in the future. That's not the nature of this contract. These were -- this was for work we had done, for which we had submitted specific claims, and for which the contracting officer had pending before him at the time. And so, you know, what the government says is that -- is that it was a payment and they didn't ultimately get the airplanes that were the ultimate desire of the contract under these circumstances, and that's obviously true because they terminated the contract a year before the airplanes were due to be provided to them.",
  "No. No, Justice Ginsburg, that's not true. All we are asking for is -- are the remedies that are fully available if you were to convert this from a termination for default into a termination for convenience. And under those circumstances, what -­ you know, that -- the government has a wonderful mechanism there. It protects it against the kinds of lost profits damages that might otherwise be available in a situation where you have a more traditional breach of contract. So all we're -- all we're asking for is the actual amount of money that we expended, that the -­ frankly, the Court of Federal Claims explicitly found, and at this stage it's unchallenged, although presumably it might be litigable at some point, but that these were all reasonable, allowable, and fairly allocable costs to these -- to this particular contract.",
  "Justice Alito, I think that is precisely how you ought to look at it, and -- and we'd be very comfortable with that, because it's quite clear to me that, except in the hyper-technical way that -- that you articulate because of -- because of the way the Contracts Disputes Act plays out, that the government is unquestionably the moving party, the party seeking affirmative relief to be able to take 1.35 billion -­",
  "Well, not -- I mean, you could -- that's one way to articulate it. I think the other way to articulate it, which -- which is much more consistent with the reality of what's going on here, is that the government is making a claim for $1.35 billion for which -- on the basis that we did not act in a timely fashion. And that's the only basis that exists in this litigation anymore, is just the time of the actions that we took. And our answer to that claim is to say: No, we -- we are not at fault for the delays because you did not provide us the information or you did not spare us the burden of having to go down this path in the first instance.",
  "But -­",
  "Right. But that just goes to Justice Alito's question about is there some way to evaluate those claims separately, and the answer is, yes, they should be evaluated separately. And -­",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I mean, to be sure, we would be much more comfortable in the world you just articulated, Justice Scalia, than we are in the Federal Circuit.",
  "With interest.",
  "That's starting to add up, Your Honor.",
  "But -- and -- certainly we think that's -- that is the minimum that we should be entitled to, and maybe to some extent you could say we're sort of being a little greedy. But the -- the reality is that the standard rule is that if you take a contract and you say you cannot make a determination that the contractor has been guilty of default, then that contract should be, in the -- kind of the basic contract law and it's also in this -- in this agreement, that you -- you convert it to a termination for convenience. And then the question simply is, what rights flow from having declared this to be a termination for convenience?",
  "Right. And that -- that -­",
  "Well, no. I mean, actually, what -- what the $1.2 billion was, was the additional amounts of money that were actually expended by the contractors that were reasonable, allocable, and allowable, by and according to the Court of Federal Claims, on this agreement. So, there -- and it would be the standard operating procedure. If you have a termination for convenience, where the government says, look, we've decided we just don't want to have this -­ these -- we don't want these airplanes anymore, so let's just call it off, which the government has the right to do, then the question is, what are the reasonable costs that are, you know, sort of reallocated as a consequence of that? And the Court of Federal Claims -­",
  "Well, it seems to me the -- I mean, the question is was the default -­",
  "Well, and the question is, if you call the game off, what -- what flows from that? And it seems to me that it -- you can say we'll let the government call it a default, I suppose, or you could just as easily say -- and obviously the position we would take is you say the government cannot call it a default because, in order to get some kind of a determination along those lines, somebody is going to have to make a judgment that's not an honest assessment of the -- of the -- of the facts of this case. And so, if you say it's not a default termination, then there's just a certain amount of -- certain consequences that flow from converting it, and it automatically converts at that point to a termination for convenience. And in a termination for convenience situation, then you reallocate the costs in precisely the way that the Court of Federal Claims has done this at this point.",
  "Right. And the question is -­",
  "Well, I -- I -- the problem -­",
  "Right. Well, I would think that the -- that the more appropriate way to proceed under those circumstances, given that a default termination carries with it a lot of collateral consequences, it exposes you to subsequent problems in the contracting context, it creates the possibility of debarment in -- in future proceedings, that rather than allow a finding that no one can comfortably conclude is the right finding to stay in place and have those collateral consequences flow from it, the more appropriate way to proceed would be to say: Look, I can't make a determination in this case that there should be a termination for default. And under those -- and so, therefore, the -­ the -- under the contract, under the government contracting principles generally, it automatically converts over to a termination for convenience. And once that happens, then you go down the road of -- of evaluating those costs.

  "Sure, and so could the government. I mean, the reality is that the background principle here is United States v. Reynolds. And United States v. Reynolds says that if somebody is the moving party, that is the party seeking affirmative relief, that's the party who's going to bear the burden to -­",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I -- I think that actually the Court in Reynolds, to the extent it would have envisioned any of these circumstances decades ago, used the language \"moving party\" rather than \"plaintiff\" or \"defendant\" precisely for that reason, because I think what the Court had in mind is the party who was seeking affirmative relief. And -­",
  "Oh, no. To be sure, that -­ that's the specific context, although the Court's language is broader than that. It just didn't talk about itself as a defendant in a tort action.",
  "Well, because in the one situation I have $1.35 billion in my pocket for services that were unquestionably rendered and which, in our judgment, you know, satisfied our portion of the obligation under this contract.",

  "And the non-privileged information that it had available to it.",
  "Well, it recognized that it terminated the discovery early. And, actually, it did -- it terminated discovery very early, and -- and there are whole programs that we know nothing about. We know about the B-2 and the A-15. What we don't know are the other programs, and there's nothing in this record on any of that, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Kennedy, I think the answer to your question is that this case can properly be decided on Federal common law principles, and indeed I would ask the Court to apply those same -- those contract principles in this context to -- it's just on the Joint Appendix on page 209. General Katyal focuses on what happens when the contracting officer takes some action. What he leaves out is the following sentence: The contractor shall have the right of appeal under the disputes clause from any determination by the contracting officer. And while the General spends an awful lot of time talking about what do you do in the Article III context, the Contracting Disputes Act specifically allows to us go to a board of contract appeals, which is not an Article III institution. And I guarantee you that the government would be making exactly the same argument if we had taken that particular route. It seems to me the case ought not to be decided on the basis of this kind of a technical assessment. The case ought to be decided on the basis of sort of where the rights are and what's the fundamental change and who's making the shift in one direction or the other. And if you do that -- and Justice Ginsburg, you specifically asked the question, am I asking for all or nothing? No. I think there's no question you can come up with a principled basis to adopt precisely the principle that Justice Scalia pointed out, which is to say we will stay our hand, we'll -- we will not uphold the -- the contracting officer's decision, and therefore we're not going to say there's a default -­",
  "-- but we're not going to go the extra mile and say it's a termination for convenience. The Court can certainly do that.",
  "There is a middle way. There's no question about it. All I was saying in response to Justice Scalia's question was, you know --",
  "On the principle of law that if you don't have a contract for default, then there's no basis for -- and we're not going to do any more than that; we can't decide who's right and who's wrong, and therefore we're not going to enforce the contracting officer's decision, or we're not going to do anything more than this. We're going to leave the status quo ante, which means before the contracting officer declared that there was a default under these circumstances.",
  "I actually get that a lot, Justice Scalia.",
  "No. I don't read that, Justice Kagan. I mean, we -- we certainly have a due process argument in there, but embedded in there as well is -- are a number of references to Federal common law principles as a -- as a -- obviously nonconstitutional basis on which to rule in our favor. And I -- I mean, I think the Court ought to be informed in -- in making its determination about how to interpret the contracting arrangement by the question of whether this is fundamentally unfair and unconscionable, obviously, but you would probably do that as a matter of Federal common law principles in trying to decide on the -- on contracting principles or not. At the end of the day, Your Honors, this has been fundamentally unfair, and we would ask for the Court to reverse.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Public funding of elections results in more speech and more electoral competition and directly furthers the government's compelling interest in combatting real and apparent corruption in politics. There was a suggestion in response, I believe, to Justice Kagan's question that this law was not intended to combat corruption, but I -­",
  "Well, Your Honor, it would result in more speech certainly if all the candidates got the $10,000. There's no evidence in the record of anyone actually not spending, any independent group not spending money either in that circumstance or any other circumstance.",
  "The evidence would -- would simply look -- plausibly, even just someone saying that they didn't spend money because of that, although that would be not very hard evidence. But there isn't even that sort of evidence with respect to independent groups here, Your Honor. And it makes sense, Your Honor -­",
  "I -- that's possibly true, Your Honor. The statistical data, however, here indicates that individual expenditures have in fact gone up since the implementation of matching funds in Arizona. That obviously doesn't directly address the three-candidate situation, I acknowledge that. But there's no evidence that independent expenditures have been suppressed at all, Your Honor. And I would -- I think the question here, Your Honor, is -­",
  "It combats -­",
  "Your Honor, Arizona's triggered matching funds provision combats corruption in the same manner that public funding combats corruption, because that -- the law is designed to encourage candidates to accept public funding because it offers a viable public funding option to them while conserving the State's resources. And public funding serves the anticorruption rationale in two fundamental ways. First, it frees the candidates who accept public funding from the need to accept potentially corrupting private contributions.",
  "Well, Your Honor, I think for the same reasons I think that are implicit in the Buckley Court's upholding of public funding at the same time that the Court upheld contribution limits and disclosure requirements, I think implicitly therefore holding that the three could go together, serving the anticorruption interests. And I think it does that, first, by, first by -- first by freeing, as I said, freeing the publicly funded candidates from the need even to take the limited privately -- private contributions that would be allowed under the law, and which this Court has never held there's a minimum at which that no longer conceivably becomes corrupting. But secondly, it -- it combats corruption by providing for more candidates running, more political speech, and more electoral competition, all of which have happened in Arizona. And where you have more candidates and more electoral competition, you have less -- you are going to have less corruption. The record -­",
  "Yes.",
  "It would encourage them more, Your Honor. It's not our contention that anything that a State or Congress did to encourage public funding would necessarily be constitutional. I think the question would be different if it were a two to one or, to make a more stark contrast, a ten to one match. I think that would raise multiple questions. One question would be, looking at the statute in its entirety, has the public funding scheme become coercive rather than voluntary? It would raise the question whether the purpose of the law were really to simply provide viable funding to candidates -­",
  "I think somewhere in the First Amendment there is a line, Your Honor, implicit in Buckley, where a public funding law provides such substantial benefits without sufficient countervailing burdens to publicly funded candidates that it becomes coercive rather than voluntary, and therefore you have coerced someone into accepting a spending limit, which I believe would be certainly subject to strict scrutiny and almost surely unconstitutional. And I think that is -- the Court would need to assess that in each instance, and I think it could be done. I certainly don't think that here you have a coercive system. A third of the candidates don't accept public funding, and most of those who don't and accept -- and face publicly funded candidates actually win.",
  "Certainly it doesn't work in the sense, Your Honor, if the goal were for everyone to accept public funding, it doesn't work in that sense. But it certainly works in the sense that two-thirds of the candidates do, and it works in the sense that there hasn't been a repeat of the public corruption scandals in Arizona since the law was passed.",
  "Your Honor, independent -­",
  "Well, Your Honor, independent expenditure groups -- there's no evidence that it really in fact has been deterred. Your Honor, independent expenditure groups essentially have to take their candidates as they find them, if they will. There's no discrimination among someone who is speaking in favor of a privately financed candidate and one who is speaking in favor of a participating candidate. The different treatment is the different treatment of the candidates. Someone who speaks against a privately financed candidate runs the risk that that person is going to use the ad against them to do all of the things that the public financed candidate may not do. He can raise private contributions, he can take money from his political party, he can spend his own money and he can spend unlimited amounts of money.",
  "Maybe I should say there's no significant evidence, Your Honor.",
  "But with respect to each of the items that you mentioned: With respect to the population point, Your Honor, there is no evidence in the record and it does not make sense that expenditures either by candidates or by independent groups would increase proportionally to the population of a State because most of the expenses of a campaign are fixed and -­",
  "-- and not variable.",
  "No, no, Your Honor. Of course not.",
  "Of course not, Your Honor. I don't suggest that there's no relationship between population and expenditures, but you wouldn't expect it to go up proportionally, which is what the argument that the Petitioners make, is that it didn't go up proportionally. You wouldn't expect that, particularly given what the demographics of the population increase have been in Arizona and elsewhere in the country. With respect to the evidence of individuals, there are two Petitioner independent committees in this case, Your Honor, the Arizona Taxpayers Action Committee and the Arizona Free Enterprise Club. At Joint Appendix 584 is the testimony of the first that they never withheld money from a race because of matching funds and can't recall any contributor to them doing so. And the Arizona Free Enterprise Club at Joint Appendix 666 and 670, the treasurer testified that matching funds never caused them not to make a contribution and that the PAC to which they contribute at JA 670 didn't recall making a decision not to spend money because of matching funds with respect to -­",
  "I might think twice about it, Your Honor. But first, I think thinking twice is not a severe burden. I think I might think twice in some circumstances if I knew that by spending a certain amount of money I had to disclose the fact that I was doing that and what my political views were and lose my anonymity, but thinking twice this Court has held in that circumstance doesn't create a severe burden, and we would submit that thinking twice here similarly does not.",
  "Well, Your Honor, if it were a sufficient burden, it would presumably have been a sufficient burden with respect to disclosure, where this Court has recognized that some people may not spend or contribute because of the disclosure requirements.",
  "Yes. Yes, Your Honor, but the point I'm making is that the disclosure, this Court has recognized, potentially chills, deters the expression itself.",
  "No, Your Honor, I wasn't suggesting that. But I -­",
  "Well, Your Honor, I was making the analogy to disclosure in the sense of the think-twice notion that Mr. Chief Justice raised, but I don't think -- I don't think this creates any more of a burden, indeed we would submit less of a burden, than a disclosure requirement. You would expect somebody who believes that their speech is more persuasive than the other participants in the race, whether they be an independent group or a candidate, to choose more speech, because they think that, if I speak, even if the other people speak, my message is going to get out there and it's going to be preferable. There may be some few candidates, although there's not a record of that here, some few groups or candidates who would decide that they would prefer less speech. It's better for me if my opponent or the other candidate doesn't speak more because he's going to be more persuasive than I am.",
  "Well, Your Honor, I don't think that the State is doing that. What I'm addressing is the effect of the law, and I think Your Honor makes a good point, which is that they assume, Petitioners assume, that essentially this is a zero-sum game and that because if I spend $10,000 the other guy is going to get $10,000 to respond, that somehow that's a wash. Well, it's not a wash, first, because I think my speech is more persuasive so I'm going to do it anyway, because I'd rather get it out there; and secondly, because I may be spending my $10,000 on getting out my voters, and I need to do that regardless. And that's why you don't see in the statistics any evidence that this actually suppresses speech. And as I said, there may be some few candidates who would opt for less speech because it's strategically better for them, but we would submit that that -­",
  "Well, Your Honor, I think what it proves is that you -- the key point in here is that initial choice that is voluntarily made by each of the candidates, whether the system of public financing under which you may receive matching funds is better for them or whether the system -­",
  "Because, Your Honor, the discrimination, if you want to -- if you call it discrimination or different treatment, is based on the initial choices of the candidates as to how they're going to finance their campaigns. It's not based on the content of the speech. There's -- matching funds do not turn in any way on the ideas or the messages or the viewpoints or the subject matter of the candidate or the independent group's speech or on the identity of the speaker. It turns entirely on what choice the candidate made at the outset. And it is analogous, in a sense, Your Honor, to the situation that's faced by a contributor who is deciding whether to contribute, for example, to a 501(c)(3) or a 501(c)(4) organization. If they contribute to the organization that can lobby, they don't get a tax deduction.",
  "And -- and, Your Honor, two points. You're free, of course, to run an ad that addresses the issue without expressly advocating for or against any candidate without triggering matching funds. And secondly, the candidates made a choice, and if you're the person who is -- who supports the participating candidate, you can't make a contribution to that candidate, while you could to the other candidate because of the choice that was made. And you can be responded to, if you run an ad criticizing the non-participating candidate, you can be responded to with unlimited amounts of money from -- taken from a political party, the person's own money, whereas, too, if you attack a privately financed candidate, you would only be subject to being potentially responded to with limited matching funds. And it all flows from the voluntary choice that is made at the outset by the candidates about which system of financing is better for them. And this is a system, the matching funds system, is a mechanism that the State uses in order to be able to offer viable public funding to candidates without wasting public resources, and both the logic and evidence demonstrates that it is, in fact, effective, both at promoting speech by encouraging candidates to run and, indeed, particularly resulting in more competitive races for incumbents -- against incumbents in Arizona and promoting speech. And I would just like briefly to address Justice Alito's question about the ex ante measurement of the funds. Now, of course, we would submit that it's not relevant because we're not in -- should not be in strict scrutiny and therefore don't need to show this is the least restrictive means, Your Honor. But, Justice Alito, an ex ante system would run substantial risks of underfunding or overfunding races, and in particular -- and therefore wouldn't serve the State's interest in saving money or in properly measuring -- but, in particular, would run the risk of having an incumbent who might have been in office for several terms unopposed and not having spent any money in those races, and now you are measuring how much his possibly now viable challenger will get in public funding based upon some minuscule amount of money that the incumbent has needed to spend. So I think that that would not serve the State's interests in ensuring the candidates actually have viable public funding. And I see my time has expired. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: I'd like to focus on two points that came out of the questioning in the first part of the oral argument today. First of all, I would like to focus on the question -- the comment, at least, and the question that flows from it, from Justice Alito, which is that there has never been a recognition of a cause of action in any Ex parte Young case. And that's a hundred percent true, and I didn't hear response to the other side that suggests anything to the contrary. And the reason for that is, obviously, what this Court said in the Verizon case and what it said in Shaw is that you look to the Supremacy Clause as the basis for arising-under jurisdiction, and then if you have jurisdiction, then you look to the traditional equitable standards to determine whether they've been satisfied in a particular case. And under this Court's decision in Ex parte Young, what the Court said was \"an injunction which restrains the state officer from taking any steps towards the enforcement of an unconstitutional enactment, to the injury of the complainant\" is the basis for relief. And that's exactly the circumstance that we have in this case, and thus --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, there is a very fundamental difference between an implied right of action or an action under section 1983 and -- and a very simple and straightforward Ex parte Young remedy that's otherwise available. Under 1983, at private rights of action, the district courts, the Federal courts, State courts for that matter in enforcing them, have authority to grant damages, they have much broader injunctive relief, and under section 1983, there's --",
  "Well, Ex parte Young has been pretty consistently evaluated as saying simply you cannot do what the Constitution immediately prohibits you from doing. And so -- and, frankly, the Ex parte Young remedy has been a negative --",
  "-- not to violate the --",
  "-- not to violate the Supremacy Clause.",
  "Well, but -- but if you go back and look at the cases in which 1983 relief has been involved, a case like Blessing -- in Blessing, the complaint there sought essentially to take over the entire State law function of providing support for children. And that was the injunctive relief that was requested. And if the Court had adopted the notion that 1983 carried with it a private right of action, that would have been available relief; there would have been a claim for damages in that circumstance; and there would have been access to attorneys' fees.",
  "None of those things is available here.",
  "In that -- in that situation, there's obviously no authority to bring a private right of action under the statute. That still doesn't answer the question whether or not there is a right to invoke the Supremacy Clause --",
  "-- when there's a conflict between Federal and State law.",
  "Right.",
  "No, I understand that, Mr. Chief Justice, but you still have the problem that even under those circumstances, a regime can arise in which there is a square and, in this case, you know, I think undeniable, conflict between Federal and State law, and the question is -- and that that conflict imposes not only injury in fact to an individual but also imposes irreparable harm.",
  "Of the Federal statute.",
  "Yes. Whether or not you would in fact get relief under the Supremacy Clause seems to me a very --",
  "-- tough question.",
  "I don't think Congress has the authority to essentially say there are some conflicts between Federal and State law that we will simply ignore even though they cause irreparable injury.",
  "Absolutely not, Justice Kagan.",
  "Right. And it seems to me here is a situation where you would expect Congress to have spoken explicitly --",
  "Of course.",
  "And the reason why the default rule would almost certainly be that in fact you can bring the Ex parte Young cause of action is because the effect -- the Spending Clause has been subject to the -- to pre-emption claims since 1968. This whole notion that they contracted against this background of what obligations did they assume -- the obligation that they clearly would have assumed is that if in fact there is a violation of Federal law based on a failure to satisfy one of the conditions of spending under these circumstances, you would -- they would be susceptible to an Ex parte Young --",
  "-- injunctive action.",
  "Right.",
  "Can I --",
  "Can I --",
  "But can I deal with that one immediately?",
  "Because I think it's important in the context of this case to recognize. We're talking about the issuance of a preliminary injunction that was designed to hold everything until matters could be avoided. We realize that we're talking about a situation where the State, solely for budgetary reasons, without regard to Federal law whatsoever, simply made a slash in the reimbursements.",
  "Right. I --",
  "And that's what I just want to be clear on.",
  "Right.",
  "The -- the third possibility, it seems to me, Justice Breyer, is not much different from a lot of the other cases that this Court has already decided --",
  "-- like Crosby and like Engine Manufacturers, where there's the vague standard out there, and the -- and it doesn't -- and they're not asserting a right to be -- not to have an enforcement action brought against them. And this Court has routinely held in that circumstance that there is in fact a Supremacy Clause action available. So, I don't think the third option is really an option. And it also ultimately goes to the merits of the pre-emption claim. If it turns out that all of this is just too squishy to evaluate, then it would seem to me that on the merits, then you would say there's not a clear enough statement of Federal law to justify saying there's a conflict that would -- and, therefore, you would lose on the merits. But that wouldn't prevent you from going into court and trying to make the kind of showing that we made here.",
  "Yes.",
  "But, Justice Breyer, the agency always has the ultimate authority here to step in and take action. And I think the real question is, is it reasonable to think that Congress meant to place this in an agency, in circumstances where the agency isn't going to receive notice of the implementation of the change before it gets implemented, where the State is permitted to take no -- to make no response to a request for information and allow the unlawful rates to go into effect for years on end?",
  "I didn't think I was.",
  "Doctrine.",
  "Justice Sotomayor --",
  "There's nothing wrong with that. Candidly, we -- we would be perfectly comfortable with that, but I don't understand the other side to be complaining about the scope of the injunctive relief. It is not that they are saying --",
  "Right. And so --",
  "Right.",
  "Well, we did have an alternative argument that the injunction should -- should stay into effect at least until HHS acts, and the -- the district court granted a broader preliminary injunction and didn't consider the alternative argument that was -- that was there. But, again, it seems to me that, you know, the court ought to recognize that you're in the context of preliminary injunctive relief in this situation, and -- and there will be plenty of time to kind of work through the nature of the injunctive relief if in fact the court's allowed to go forward and take up the Ex parte Young issue under the circumstance.",
  "I'm not perfectly comfortable with that rationale. I think the answer is it's sort of a combination of the Supremacy Clause and the -- and broad equitable relief, rather than -- I mean, clearly one or the other. They seem to go pretty much hand-in-glove in the ex parte line of cases. And so, I don't have any particular problem with that.",
  "Well, I -- suppose there were --",
  "It will depend on the -- on the circumstances of the case, but I do think there is some gap between the full extent of Congress's power in this area and -- and the protections of the Supremacy Clause, if for no other reason -- and because the executive branch also has the authority and, certainly acting within its own exclusive authority, could -- could pre-empt State law or could create a situation where State law would be pre-empted. And I don't think Congress would have the authority to -- to take away the Ex parte Young remedy under -- under those particular circumstances.",
  "The -- I mean, to be sure, the Court in Ex parte Young was dealing with a specific situation of trying to prevent enforcement. But the -- the Supreme Court -- this Court in all of its decisions post-Ex parte Young has never said that that's the only circumstance and has certainly never said that in exercising the judicial power under Article III that extends to all cases in equity, that it means only the equity that existed in -- in the 18th century at that point in time. So, it seems to me the right answer at this stage is for this Court to look at the situation and say: Is this a context in which equitable relief would be appropriate? And if you just use the preliminary injunction standards, it clearly would be appropriate under -- under these particular circumstances, where we have a likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, and the balance of harms favor the -- favor the plaintiff.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, all -- all we --",
  "Well, any of the cases in which the Court has recognized that obviously in order to get -- in order to get injunctive relief, you have to demonstrate that there's -- that there's no adequate remedy at law. So, I mean, the distinction has always been there, even after the merging of law and equity --",
  "-- in the early part of the last century.",
  "No, but I'm -- but I'm not asking for -- for -- I mean, we're not asking for damages here, Justice Scalia.",
  "All we're asking for is injunctive relief.",
  "Right. But --",
  "Right.",
  "No, but I -- I mean, all of the cases that come out of the Ex parte Young line of authority seem to base -- you know, they all tee off, obviously, the problem that exists in this context, which is -- which is the one that Justice Scalia identified.",
  "Justice Breyer, can I -- two points here: First of all, we are not talking about a situation of somebody seeking a roving commission to go find out all Federal -- all situations where State law violates Federal law. We're -- the beneficiaries in this case --",
  "But those are life-and-death problems.",
  "But my people have a life-and-death problem, Justice Breyer. So, if there were ever a situation where you would say let's look to see whether or not there is relief available, this would be the situation where -- where I would hope --",
  "But the beneficiaries --",
  "The patients are the one who lose access to --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "No, to be sure, Justice Breyer. The exception is that we have to satisfy the requirements of Article III. We have to have injury and redressability, and in order to get equitable relief, we ultimately are going to have to demonstrate that the injury is irreparable, that there is no adequate remedy at law. Those are high burdens --",
  "-- and in a circumstance where you cannot get damages and you cannot get attorneys' fees.",
  "If they had just discussed the matter?",
  "We wouldn't be here. I can guarantee you we wouldn't be here.",
  "That's --",
  "That's exactly right.",
  "Right. No, there's no question that --",
  "Right. The agency always wins. That's the rule that they --",
  "But then the question --",
  "Well, I mean -- I mean, if the agency --",
  "Right.",
  "Right, because -- well --",
  "-- I mean, I suppose it depends on whether they go ahead. If California, in the face of disapproval, continued to violate the law, that would -- I assume you meant that California complied.",
  "Oh, you can bring the lawsuit --",
  "-- Justice Alito. The -- the bottom line is you're going to lose that -- that litigation and in a circumstance where you have no realistic prospect of --",
  "Well, ultimately, you have to demonstrate that there's -- that there is a -- by clear and convincing evidence, a conflict between Federal and State law. And the agency that has -- that evaluates the standards of Federal law will have said in a very authoritative way that there is not a violation under those circumstances.",
  "Oh, no, to be sure, I have a cause of action.",
  "No, no.",
  "No, no. I'm not saying you don't, I'm just -- all I'm saying is that if the -- if the process works appropriately, there would be not the litigation that Justice Breyer was worried about, where you would have hundreds of thousands of cases going forward. If the process -- which, again, it goes back to the default rule.",
  "Sure, we would still say there's a --",
  "We would still have an argument that there's a conflict between Federal and State law.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, we -- well, the problem with the APA -- we might have an APA cause of action, but I also think that there is a -- I mean, I -- look, that hypothetical is so far afield --",
  "I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.",
  "No, of course, Federal law is determined by the agency, but not without limits.",
  "Well, I think you -- I still think you can bring an action under the Supremacy Clause. I think, ultimately, you have very -- you have zero hope of prevailing --",
  "-- which was my point.",
  "Because Congress --",
  "Right, but that doesn't -- that controls to the extent of trying to enforce directly the Federal statute; it doesn't control with respect to trying to enforce the Supremacy Clause.",
  "Well, no, but what the Supremacy Clause says is that Federal law will be supreme in all circumstances, notwithstanding State law --",
  "The Supremacy Clause -- well, I don't know of any exceptions in the Supremacy Clause where State law gets to remain supreme to Federal law.",
  "No, not -- not that -- not what the agency has done violates the Supremacy Clause; it's the State acting pursuant to what the agency has approved, that if you still thought it violated Federal law, would be a basis for seeking a Supremacy Clause action. But, no, Justice Scalia is right. The obvious -- the obvious solution to the immediate problem is to seek review of the decision by HHS and to -- and to follow it under those circumstances. The -- the second point that I wanted to focus a little bit about, because it does seem to me -- again, it goes to what are -- what should be the background principles that operate here. And a couple of Justices specifically raised the question of, you know, would this case be different if we were seeking to balance-bill -- that is, to bill the extent to which we were allowed to bill prior to the time that the State of California reduced by 10 percent, if we brought that lawsuit, would that be perfectly permissible? And I understand California, I think, has suggested that it would be, and I heard Mr. Kneedler suggest that, well, there might be some additional issues there. But the reality is, is it seems to me that shows you just how unrealistic the -- the distinction is in this particular case, because we're talking about individuals -- you know, the question is not, you know, how are you going to implement this down the road? The question is, what do you do with someone who is suffering a lack of access to vital medical care in a way that is irreparable? And is it realistic to think that Congress meant under those circumstances to deprive the individual plaintiff of any kind of rights? And the answer is no. And that's -- that's as far as the Court needs to go. It doesn't need to figure out exactly how far Congress could deal with the Supremacy Clause. I realize that there is some skepticism on that score. But on the core question here, did Congress intend to deprive these plaintiffs of their rights under Ex parte Young, the answer is no --",
  "Because -- because there is a difference between providing a private right of action and all the bells and whistles that go with that, as opposed to recognizing that Ex parte Young is the background principle that has been in place for well over a century and that says that when the -- when the standards for equitable relief are satisfied, the courts have the power, and they can prevent the violation of the Supremacy Clause.",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I would have been perfectly comfortable with that. I mean, that was one of the alternative grounds for relief that we sought. The district judge didn't happen to go down that particular path. But, clearly, from our perspective, the important element is to maintain the status quo ante until a resolution of the legality of California's statute can be made, either by the agency or by the courts. But the -- but the one thing you shouldn't be allowed to do is simply to -- to permit this to drift without any remedy and without any ability to get access to medical care that's clearly inconsistent with what Congress intended and where a remedy is available under the Ex parte Young formulation. If there are no further questions, Your Honors, thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I actually appreciate the clarification that your questions brought to this case, because I think there's a bit of confusion that I'd like to try to clear up, although my -- my colleague's movement in terms of answering some of the questions left me a little bit perplexed as to exactly what the nature of their claims are. The -- the first question that it seems to me the Court should focus on is what policy is at issue here. And, obviously, since the class certification deals with one set of issues and the plaintiff's claims deal with another set of issues, I think you have to be careful. I think you have to focus on the policies that existed in 2005. That was the basis on which he was in fact searched under these circumstances. And the policy in Burlington was that -- was primarily aimed, frankly, at health and tattoos, and the policy at Essex was aimed primarily at contraband and then secondarily at tattoos and health. And the policy at Burlington was largely a -- you come into prison, you give up your clothes, they look through your clothes, you take a shower, they examine you fairly cursorily, but look at you, and then -- then give you prison garb and move along your way.",
  "It -- it's before or during.",
  "Right.",
  "It almost certainly would have been about an arm's length, because at that -- I mean, the problem is if you're exchanging clothes with somebody, you're handing them clothes to change into, it's sort of hard to be longer than arm's length and actually get the clothes into his hand. So that -­",
  "Okay. Two arms' lengths.",
  "But I'm not -­",
  "Right.",
  "Right. And that's actually what they do in Essex. In Essex, they do it that way. The difference between Essex is that Essex, in fact, does have -- I mean, part of the problem is terminological, all right?",
  "You know, Burlington is basically a body visual observation, and the district court said that's unconstitutional, that just observing at all is unconstitutional. To some extent, it seems to me my -- my friend here has given up that part of the district court's decision, which -- then clearly the court of appeals, to the extent it reversed that part, ought to be affirmed on that ground alone.",
  "Right, although that -- that was not the district court's theory. The district court didn't say 2 to 3 feet.",
  "Well, it depends on whose version of it.",
  "You have to remember, the district court granted summary judgment to the plaintiff in this case. So, you would have to -- you would have to interpret -- you'd have to give us the benefit of the interpretation, which was that it was more than 2 feet. But the court of appeals reversed, of course, without regard to that, because the court of appeals said, look, if you -- if you apply this Court's decision in Bell v. Wolfish, it doesn't matter, because you can engage in a much more intrusive true body cavity search, which frankly is more intrusive than even what Essex County asks -- has -- does in this case, because he wasn't asked to bend over and to -- and to have a body cavity anal search. What he was asked to do was to squat and cough, in the event that -- because ordinarily that will cause the contraband then to fall out, and you can -- and you can catch it under those circumstances. So, this is -- that's sort of the context in which this issue comes up.",
  "That's correct. That's my -­ that's the rule of law I'm asking for.",
  "I would say, from my perspective, I think even -- even if they weren't going to be admitted into the general prison population, because the risks remain too substantial. But the truth is I don't have to defend that argument, because both -­ both of these jails admit the -- their inmates into the -- into the general population 99.9 percent of the time.",
  "So, that's not a line we draw.",
  "Yes, Justice Alito. I think the basic principle we're asking for is that deference to the jails and -- and to the administrators of the jails requires that this Court respect their judgment that you can't make a distinction based on that specific individual; that whether somebody is a minor offender or a major offender, one, is never all that clear in the first place, and, two, isn't a basis on which to distinguish the risks that it poses to the -­",
  "If -- if you look at the expert testimony that was before the court, in the district court in this case, both the expert testimony of the plaintiff and the expert testimony of the defendant -- this is at 348a of the joint appendix.

  "Yes.",
  "Well, I mean, we can debate that. But, Justice Sotomayor, it seems to me that the -- that the fundamental principle that ought to undergird the entirety of the Court's analysis here comes out of Turner v. Safley and that line of cases, where -­",
  "No.",
  "No, Justice Sotomayor. No.",
  "Yes, I can be clear about this. It seems to me that Hudson v. Palmer and the -­ and the history of the Fourth Amendment clearly suggest that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy of being viewed naked in a prison. And, therefore, the ordinary Burlington approach of having somebody take a shower and looking at him or her naked for tattoos and health and incidental contraband, clearly constitutional, clearly doesn't even raise a Fourth Amendment issue. When you get beyond that point and start to begin the -- what Essex does, which is not a true anal cavity search but simply an anal-focused and genital-focused search, I think that is subject to the Turner v. Safley and/or the Bell v. Wolfish standard.",
  "Justice Sotomayor, I think what is disturbing about -- about this case is, in fact, the -- that he was arrested under circumstances in which he candidly shouldn't have been arrested as a matter of State law. I understand that. But I think to change the constitutional rule and to change the Turner v. Safley and Bell v. Wolfish standards and ignore what the underlying inquiry should be here, which is these policies which apply across the board impinge constitutional protections, but nevertheless represent -­",

  "I -- if you ask me the way I would analyze it, I would -- if you want to adopt a different set of standards about who ought to be arrested and who ought to be taken to jail, that's fine. I understand that.",
  "But I think once you're talking about actually bringing someone into the jail to be admitted into the general population and what is without question one of the most dangerous, most risky environments, in that context I would hope that this Court, rather than asking individual jailers to make decisions on the basis of -- where they clearly will not have the kind of information you're asking them to make and where if they make a judgment wrong in either direction, all it means is litigation.

So, I would say there -- yes, there is some evidence from which you could infer that it's worse now than it was. But I would also ask the Court to rely on its common sense and its own -- and what it essentially took judicial notice of in Bell v. Wolfish and Rutherford v.

  "No, but the policy itself -­ may I answer the question? The policy is aimed at all people, not just at Mr. Florence, and if you aim it at all people, there are people who self-report who've obviously got an opportunity to bring in contraband, and there are a lot of people who just get arrested and happen to have drugs or something on them and, rather than show those when they're being stopped for a speeding ticket, will likely stick it in their pocket or put it somewhere else. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to respond initially to some of General Verrilli's general observations. First of all, he talks about indecency as somehow serving as the core of the overall understanding of the regulatory deal that was made here. And it's difficult for me to accept that notion when there was no effort whatsoever to enforce the -- the standard of indecency between 1927 and 1975.",
  "Well, maybe, maybe not. We don't know. All we know is that for a period of 50 years, nothing happened. So, the idea --",
  "The only point I'm trying to make, Chief Justice, is that if you're talking about this as sort of the core understanding between the parties, it simply played a fairly minor role in the process through the bulk of the regulatory period we're talking about. And, indeed, if you put it in context, this is a statute that prohibits obscenity, profanity, and indecency. And while the FCC spent a lot of time writing about profanity as somehow being offended by what went on in this omnibus order, the commission has completely abandoned that under these circumstances.",
  "Well, first of all, Justice Kagan, it was important to catch the answer to your question when you asked it of General Verrilli, which was you're not saying that we lose all of our First Amendment rights. So, clearly we retain our First Amendment rights. And, under those circumstances, it seems to me you've got this two ways: First of all, the idea that it, quote, \"worked\" -- it worked perfectly fine from all the way up until 2001, even I would say until 2004, when the commission wildly changed its approach. And it's only become dysfunctional since 2004 and, as we sit here today, literally facing thousands and thousands of ginned-up computer-generated complaints that are holding up literally hundreds of TV license renewals, so that the whole system has come to a screeching halt because of the difficulty of trying to resolve these issues. So, to say that the system is working well, it seems to me, at least from the broadcasters' perspective, is to say -- is to suggest that's just not true.",
  "Yes, Justice Alito.",
  "Well, I'm not here --",
  "Absolutely, Your Honor, because there are fundamentally different media, and there are different protections and the circumstances are different, and the Court has recognized that media have to be evaluated individually. But what has happened over the 30 years with respect to the broadcast side of television is a very fundamental change. Cable is now equally pervasive. Cable is now equally accessible to TV, satellite equally accessible to TV.",
  "Well, it seems to me there are two answers to that: First of all, the notion that one medium operates in a certain way in the exercise of its First Amendment rights can be used as an -- as an explanation for taking away or for -- for restricting the First Amendment rights of another medium is flatly inconsistent with what this Court has said across the board in the First Amendment context. You don't balance off one speaker against another and give one favored status and give another unfavored status.",
  "Well, you can get a safe harbor, and, indeed, there are a number of safe harbors that are out there. First of all, there are a ton of cable networks that are aimed exclusively at children. And, you know, there are five, six, eight stations that, I guarantee you, you will see -- where you'll see none of that language. And, second of all, it's always available to the United States Government to decide to hold this -- to create its own license for the United States to be a broadcaster and to ensure that the broadcasts of the United States public network exclude anything they want to exclude because that's government speech and is in no way restricted by what the First Amendment would provide.",
  "Not under the guidelines that the -- that Fox has used consistently from 10:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m. and candidly that all of the other networks follow. The truth is the advertisers and the audiences that have to be responded to by the networks insist on some measure of restraint, not a measure of restraint --",
  "Well, I mean, some of the things that we could at least wonder about is \"Saving Private Ryan,\" \"Catch-22,\" perhaps the beginning of the Olympics. There's a whole slew of questions.

Football games, basketball games, local news events --",
  "Right.",
  "No, no, no, of course not. But you have to realize, Justice Breyer, that what -- I mean, the Second Circuit, because it didn't have available to it sort of what to do precisely with Pacifica, tended to focus on the question of vagueness. Vagueness was certainly an argument that we made there, but --",
  "No --",
  "No. It's absolutely clear to me that if this Court wants to say no more than we decided the outer limits of the First Amendment in Pacifica --",
  "-- and it goes to the verbal shock treatment that Justice Powell described in a separate opinion, and this doesn't come anywhere near that, and, therefore, this is beyond what the First Amendment provides, the Court could clearly hold that way and rule --",
  "Well, our basic argument would then -- I mean, obviously what you'd be taking away is the vagueness argument, but that would just bring you back then, Justice Scalia, to the core Pacifica argument and the question of how far can the -- how is it permissible to allow the FCC to regulate the broadcast networks on standards that are fundamentally different than cable, the Internet, and every other medium that exists? I -- you know, I'd be perfectly happy if they want to try to adopt those kinds of standards and subject them to the strict scrutiny requirements that this Court applies to every other medium, because the truth is those requirements will not withstand scrutiny under those particular standards.",
  "I hope that -- I'm sure my client is not thrilled to hear you say that.",
  "No, I -- it would be -- you know, obviously not, because that's why we're not uniquely accessible or uniquely pervasive.",
  "Well, because -- well, we didn't ask you to intervene, actually. The FCC is the one who asked you to intervene.",
  "Well, I'd be -- well, I think once the issue is before the Court, it ought to decide the First Amendment question that's presented here, and the First Amendment question says what can the FCC do under these circumstances? It seems to me there are probably four different ways you can go about it, all of which says what the FCC did here is wrong. You can say Pacifica is an exceedingly narrow decision. It goes to the outer limits of what the First Amendment allows the FCC to do. What they've done here is unconstitutional --",
  "-- or they shouldn't do that.",
  "Well, that they will use it, perhaps. But that doesn't mean that we wouldn't continue to try to bleep it out as best we could because we have our own standards.",
  "Well, that was clearly not -- I mean, from Fox's perspective, it was not scripted to set it up that way. But, remember, the first -- the first expletive --",
  "It is inevitable that -- well, I think it's inevitable regardless that people are going to continue to use language that they would naturally use. So, yes, I do think you can expect on cable and any other forum in which you have humans speaking that this kind of language will expand. I don't know that it -- and it will probably be the case that in some context, particularly live television, which is really what's placed in jeopardy by this, that you will have less live television because your concern is people will continue to use this language. On a lot of awards shows, I think it's candidly easier to go ahead and -- and bleep this. It's not always -- it's not foolproof, but the stations are committed to doing that. They've all got their standards. And that was applied in this particular case. So, while there may be some marginal increase in it, if you compare it to the use of this language beyond the broadcast context, it's the -- it is just the narrowest of slivers of increase, Justice Kennedy.",
  "You mean, can the average child understand the difference between the two?",
  "Well, I mean, in some -- I think it probably depends on which -- which channels you -- you look at, and even in the basic channels, but the -- there's the cartoon that's significantly more adult that's on the cable channels than the cartoons that you might see on the -- on the Fox Television. So, yes, I think there's probably a certain edgierness to it, but that said, it's still clear that -- that as long as you have advertising revenue that drives a significant amount of the decisionmaking here, you're going to have the kind of self-restraint that frankly ought to cause the Court to say we should no -- we no longer need to treat the broadcast medium as the weak sister of -- of the media. And, therefore, they ought to have the same protections that everybody else has, and that they will engage in the same restrained approach to these kinds of issues that newspapers do. I mean, the Post doesn't run the language of the case that's -- that's being argued before it. Cable does. All of those media do. Because there are natural restraints. You don't need the Federal Communications Commission any longer to ensure under these circumstances. If there are --",
  "Well, I'm not suggesting that there's -- there's some kind of wildly different approach. All I'm suggesting is that there -- that, in general, most people who -- who rely upon advertising and have to play to a particular audience in order to make their money is going to -- is going to obviously be restrained.",
  "At a minimum, the broadcasters will be.",
  "Well, no, because I think it ought to go -- it ought to be analyzed the exact opposite, which is that -- that the obligation, the burden, rests on the Federal Communications Commission and Congress to show that there is a real problem that needs to be solved and that this is narrowly tailored to achieve that. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In its landmark decision in Apprendi, this Court announced as a fundamental principle of Fifth and Sixth Amendment jurisprudence that every fact necessary to increase the punishment beyond that which is otherwise maximally provided for must be presented to the jury and must be decided by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. In this particular case, the defendant was fined a total of an $18 million penalty in the context of a jury finding that there was a single day of violation under the RCRA provision. Congress is quite explicit that the maximum fine for a single day's violation is $50,000.",
  "Yes, I believe the jury trial was constitutionally required, Justice Scalia. The cutoff between what's a petty offense not subject to jury trial and what's beyond that -- I think you could -- you could get there two ways. This is a crime that Congress attaches a 5-year penalty to if it's against an individual, which suggests that it is a very serious crime. And the maximum fine under the district judge's interpretation of this would have been $38 million, even though the judge chose only to impose an $18 million penalty under these circumstances. So, either way, it seems to me clearly a serious offense.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Well, you haven't used a word -- I mean, the distinction is between a serious offense and a petty offense, and the places where the -- you know, you've drawn the line to conclude that a fine was too small to be worried about was -- was $10,000 in the Muniz case. You recognized in Bagwell that 52 million was way beyond what would be appropriate under those circumstances. But I think the Court benefits most if it just focuses on the potential penalties that Congress has adopted and use that as the guidepost, because if Congress has said that this is something for which someone could be punished --",
  "Right, absolutely. And we asserted our right to a jury trial. The government didn't contest our right to a jury trial. And I don't actually read their brief --",
  "I think the language of the Sixth Amendment couldn't be clearer, that it says in all criminal prosecutions, the -- the accused is entitled to a jury trial, and all -- and you know, Article III, section 2, says in all jury trial -- in all criminal prosecutions, there's a jury trial. So, there is no effort whatsoever to limit the -- the individual, or in any way to -- the person or persons or entities that are entitled to those rights.",
  "Well, that would have been -- we'd probably have had a different outcome if that had been the case. But, no, Your Honor, obviously \"peers\" in that context is -- is derived from the citizenry in the State or the district in which the prosecution is brought. I mean, obviously, we don't get corporate peers in that sense, but -- but no one has ever doubted that an ordinary jury would be a suitable jury of peers for corporations, and, candidly, corporations are tried all of the time, and no one has doubted it. And I don't think it -- you know, first of all, it seems clear, under the language of the Sixth Amendment and Article III, that corporations are entitled to a jury and that no one is -- in anything that's a serious offense, and that clearly is what we have here. And so, what we've got is a decision by the jury that there was at a -- at a single point in time a violation of RCRA.",
  "Right. But what the -- what the First Circuit said, Justice Ginsburg, is that the -- the most you could read the jury to have found, because it was not asked the question, the most you could read out of it, was that there was a single day of a violation, and that that then sets the maximum.",
  "The most you must read out of it.",
  "Right. They could have.",
  "Right. That's correct, Justice Scalia, and that, therefore, if you apply the core Apprendi doctrine in a principled way, as Justice Kennedy suggested in a separate concurrence, if you applied it in a principled way, you determine what -- what facts are supported by the jury's findings and how far does the penalty take it, and it goes to $50,000, and anything beyond the $50,000, if it's found by the judge, doesn't satisfy the Sixth or Fifth Amendment under those circumstances. That should be in my judgment the end of the inquiry. The First Circuit rejected that argument by turning to Oregon v. Ice and suggesting that there was a fundamental shift in how the Court applies the Apprendi doctrine. And I -- I would suggest to you that, although you're clearly better positioned to determine what you thought you meant by Ice than I am, my interpretation of Ice is that it deals with the very different situation of multiple offenses and the very different problem of trying to extend the Apprendi doctrine to the context of multiple convictions and then adopted a methodology for applying it in those circumstances that focus significantly on a particular history of consecutive versus concurrent sentences --",
  "-- in that context.",
  "More so than I do, Your Honor.",
  "More so than I do.",
  "I think the -- the problem with that analysis, Justice Breyer, is I don't think the history, first of all, is anywhere near as clear in this context as it was, for instance, in Ice in terms of who decided what. It is -- there is no history that suggests that judges had the authority to impose fines beyond whatever the maximum statutory limit that was provided for by the legislature involved. And if you -- and if you go through --",
  "Because it never was traditionally up to the judge to go beyond whatever the maximum sentence provided was. Justice Thomas's concurrence in Apprendi spends a significant amount of time with that history. He several times references jury -- I mean fines and jury determinations and consistently finds that the same rule applies in the fine context as applies in the -- in the incarceration context.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, I would have thought, if anything, our case would be a much easier one, because what you -- what you basically are saying is that the district judge on the basis of a non-reasonable doubt standard and without a jury is making a determination that there have been 761 violations of Federal law and, on that basis, imposing a sentence. It would seem to me that, whatever else you might want to say Apprendi should limit, it would be the whole idea that the judge gets to determine every aspect of all elements of the crime and the punishment that attaches to it.",
  "The United States didn't object to that. No, Your Honor. Actually, we didn't object to it either, and it wasn't an instruction that was offered by either of the parties. The judge actually was the one who divined the instruction with respect to a single --",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy --",
  "Right.",
  "Well, the -- yes, we didn't submit an instruction. On the other hand, neither side submitted the particular instruction that the judge adopted in this particular case. But what I think is important is to put it in the context of the -- of the evidence at trial and the way it was analyzed by the First Circuit under the -- on the harmless error standard. Remember that the issue here is not that they simply have mercury in a particular location without a permit. The question was, did they -- were they holding it with an intent to recycle it at some point and to make it a usable product? And there were three different points in time when evidence clearly demonstrated an intent to obtain an RFP to handle the product in precisely that way, even up to the summer of 2004, and the indictment only runs to October of 2004. So, the notion that it could be a -- a significantly shorter period, maybe not -- maybe not just a day, ultimately, but clearly you can't -- we just don't know because no one asked under those circumstances. The First Circuit said this could not be viewed as harmless error, and I think that's not challenged by the United States at this stage in the litigation. And so, it seems to me, as you say, Justice Kennedy, you have to evaluate the pure issue of -- you have 1 day of violation, that's the determination, and when -- and to take the Apprendi doctrine. As it -- as it's stated, it's quite plain.",
  "Right.",
  "Well --",
  "I dont -- I don't think so. I mean, the lower courts have been pretty consistent on the question of restitution, that restitution is, one, not a punishment within the meaning of Apprendi; and, two, it's indeterminate. And as a consequence of that, the jury doesn't have to make that determination.",
  "Well, because it is set by the --",
  "Because it is set by the number of days --",
  "-- which requires a predicate finding of how many days.",
  "Well --",
  "And the government will have to figure out what it -- what it -- its best take as to the value of the loss, and it's going to have to prove that if that's going to be the basis on which to fine.",
  "Well, if it's within limits, that's fundamentally different.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, my first line of defense would be the comment by this Court consistently that the jury trial right doesn't necessarily make for the most efficient criminal proceeding.",
  "Right, but I -- I would hope that the Court wouldn't -- wouldn't let the tail wag the dog in that particular context.",
  "My --",
  "Well, recognizing --",
  "Well, the ambiguous -- the part of the history that is unambiguous is the importance of the jury as a bulwark against the Federal Government and against the judge.",
  "If it -- up to the maximum.",
  "Well, then there -- then it's an indeterminate sentence, and, of course, they're not unconstitutional. The core of Apprendi --",
  "Right. I think that's what Justice Scalia -- or Alito was saying.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. They had both, but the one thing they didn't have is a situation where, whatever the statutory maximum was, the judge was permitted to go beyond the maximum based on findings that the judge offered up on his part without the benefit of a --",
  "Absolutely. If --",
  "Because you can take --",
  "Well, that was the easy answer.",
  "But, more fundamentally, and it's -- and it's demonstrated in a case just like this one --",
  "Well, because -- but these statutes don't speak to what Apprendi was talking about, which is a situation where you set a maximum above which the judge is permitted to go. None of the statutes that are out there exist that demonstrate that. All -- and all the language and all of the discussion in Justice Thomas's concurrence talks about up to the -- you know, you have broad discretion up to the maximum. Once you go beyond the maximum, at that point the jury trial right has to kick in. And let me say it in this context. Here's a situation where the government proves up its case in the context of a $50,000 fine; and that's what the jury is asked to decide, and it decides that; and then the judge gets to say: Okay, $38 million is now the right number. If that's not the tail wagging the dog within the meaning of even the cases that preceded Apprendi, it seems to me there's a fundamental flaw in that particular scheme. The history between fines and incarceration are essentially the same. What the Court said in Apprendi should be followed exactly under these circumstances. Ice should be distinguished on the recognition that multiple offenses are fundamentally different from a single offense. And on that basis the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.",
  "Yes. Tyler is in -- in many ways kind of imponderable. The one thing that's clear, it's not a Sixth Amendment decision. It wasn't actually argued. All it says is that under this law -- and the problem, obviously, in this case was they found -- you know, it was -- the pounds weren't -- weren't the problem. The problem was obviously they had identified one substance in the indictment, and the jury found another substance in its verdict; and so, there was the disconnect there, and the Court basically said we're not going to worry about that trifling under these circumstances. What it doesn't say remotely is that the Sixth -- is that -- you know, that the Sixth Amendment would permit the judge to make that finding under those circumstances.",
  "They could do it that way or --",
  "Well, I would have thought actually the indictment in this case was probably adequate for these purposes because it said: During the entirety of the period from September 2002 to October 2004.",
  "Right, Your Honor. That's correct, Your Honor.",
  "No. Well, I mean, look, if we think we're going to be prejudiced as a consequence of trying this in a particular way, it will be our call whether or not to waive the jury trial right under those circumstances. But, more fundamentally, at least in this particular case, obviously our position was we didn't form the intent at any point in time and -- but, you know, if ultimately the -- the jury had found that there was some other point in time, then, you know, we'll deal with that issue as we deal with it. But it wouldn't have been -- I don't think the trial in this case would have been significantly different. The only thing that would have been different is that the jury would have been properly instructed and our jury trial right would have been preserved. As it is here, our jury trial right has been savagely undermined. If there are no further questions, I reserve the balance of my time, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Hopefully, I'll be able to give you back a couple of those minutes. I'd like to -- I'd like to start with what seems to me ultimately the fundamental notion of the United States' position, which is that there is a vast gulf somehow between fines and imprisonment. And it seems to me very difficult within the constitutional structure to embrace that approach when, obviously, property interests are protected in the Fifth Amendment; they're protected in the Eighth Amendment. And if you go back to Blackstone, where he talks about inflicting corporal punishment or a stated imprisonment of a term, which is better than an excessive fine, for that amounts to imprisonment for life, there's the recognition historically that fines have an enormous impact on individuals and, of course, are entitled to fundamental constitutional protections. It seems to me that the Government's approach there to saying fines are off the table and it's completely open season on defendants under those circumstances is unjustifiable. With respect to restitution, I already suggested to the Court all lower courts have concluded that restitution is not within the Apprendi doctrine. I don't think that's going to be a problem under these circumstances. And -- and I don't think ultimately that the issue in this case is sort of what is or is not the common law tradition. Because I -- if I go back and I think -- I read Justice Thomas's concurrence and the history there, he doesn't even mention Tyler as part of -- as part of that analysis and, yet, concludes with what I think is a very powerful assessment, that juries would be available for fines up to, you know, within -- if it were going to go beyond some kind of a maximum. But within the maximum, obviously in that context, the judge would have complete discretion on -- on how to approach it.",
  "Right. Justice Ginsburg, I think it's worth considering two facts in this case in dealing with what I think is purely a policy argument that shouldn't override the Constitution. But the first one is that -- the notion that Apprendi applies to fines has been well accepted in 99 percent of the country for more than a decade. And the Antitrust Division operates and makes these kinds of decisions all the time. Fraud prosecutions are going forward. The amicus brief that was filed by the Chamber of Commerce demonstrates categorically they -- this -- this gets done every day, and it gets done effectively. So, whatever the problem of Apprendi, it has not surfaced. And -- and you'll look in the Government's brief for any specific evidence of the complaint that it makes other than the hypothetical possibility that their parade of horribles would play out.",
  "This Court has rejected that parade of horribles in every other Apprendi context.",
  "Yes, I think that's precisely what the jury would be asked to find. And juries are asked to find that all the time, and they make that kind of a determination. And I guess the last point that I think as a practical matter that ought -- the Court ought to take notice of is that no State filed an amicus brief in this case, that Apprendi has not been the problem in the fines context that would even warrant anybody to come in here and complain about it. It seems to me the right answer is to apply the core doctrine, the core principle of Apprendi, which even the Government concedes, if you just take the language, it talks about any fact that increases the penalty, that algorithm takes you to the conclusion the judgment below should be reversed.",
  "Well, we do -- I mean, we do make the -- we demonstrated two things: one, that the lower courts pretty consistently have rejected the First Circuit's approach --",
  "-- and then, two, that the -- in the amicus brief then focused more in terms of fines being used on a regular basis in that period of time in those jurisdictions. If there are no further questions, I'll cede back my rest of my time. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I guess I'd like to start on the Ferris doctrine, because it seems to me that is the fundamental issue in this case. And the principle of Ferris -- and it's interesting to me that counsel for the government never once makes any reference to the Comptroller General's interpretation of the Ferris doctrine, which in the Redbook says, as plain as day, that in circumstances like this one, where the government has more contractors than it had -- than one, and those contractors are subject to an appropriation, and it cannot exceed that appropriation -- I think all of that language, frankly, is implied anyway -- the contract --",
  "Oh, no. This --",
  "No. \"Not to exceed\" has a very significant role to play, Justice Kennedy, because --",
  "The place where \"not to exceed,\" I think, carries particular significance is that in the ordinary situation, we would be entitled to seek injunctive relief to take money from other sources within -- within the budget and get an injunction. And that's very unique to the -- to this context. Ordinarily, government contractors cannot seek injunctive relief. This \"not to exceed\" language --",
  "-- deprives us of that.",
  "I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy?",
  "The Redbook doesn't -- well, actually, the Redbook does say that all of these phrases are essentially the same, which is that they --",
  "The Redbook --",
  "Well, the Redbook talks about subject to appropriations. It talks about up through --",
  "Okay.",
  "Justice Breyer --",
  "2 GAO Redbook 6-44 --",
  "-- says --",
  "This is -- this is in our brief at page --",
  "In my brief, it's on page 31.",
  "Yes. If you look at -- I'm sorry -- 2 GAO -- well, I think you can use either of these: 2 GAO Redbook 6-28 to -29 talks --",
  "-- talks about \"for\" followed by a purpose and an amount has the, quote, \"same effect as\" -- quote -- \"words like 'not more than' or 'not to exceed.'\" So, I mean, what they're saying is that all of this --",
  "I'm sorry. I apologize, Your Honor. 2 GAO Redbook 6-28 to -29. And I think the same --",
  "Well, here, 6-45 says, \"if a contract is but one activity under a larger appropriation, it is not reasonable to expect the contractor to know how much of that appropriation remains available.\"",
  "Well, it says, if Congress appropriates a specific dollar amount for a particular contract --",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Right. Exactly.",
  "Justice Breyer, as a matter of policy -- you know, if Congress --",
  "Well, clearly --",
  "Well, I guess I don't understand exactly how to answer that question, Justice Breyer, because --",
  "I'm doing my best, Justice Breyer.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "I mean, I would read Ferris as if --",
  "Well, I mean, Ferris has a limitation. The -- the government has already told us that \"subject to appropriation\" is implicit in every -- in every agreement anyway, so there's nothing special about putting in the words \"subject to appropriation.\"",
  "Well, again, the only notice it gives is that there has to be enough money when you look at the appropriation to cover your contract.",
  "Right. That's --",
  "Clearly. And that -- I mean, and, Justice Breyer, the Court's opinion in Cherokee said that the primary purpose of the subject to availability clause is to deal with the situation where you enter into the agreement ahead of the fiscal year, and so everybody knows that if Congress, for whatever reason, decides not to appropriate any money, there's no deal, and nothing happens.",
  "Well, I mean, it seems to me it's the government's problem to sort out.",
  "Right. But, again, put it in the context, Justice Kennedy, of the individual tribe.",
  "Right.",
  "No question about it, Justice Ginsburg. I don't think this case is controlled by Cherokee. I do think Cherokee answers the question of how far can you carry the \"subject to availability\" language. I don't think it gets the government anywhere near home. And then the question is, what do you do with the \"not to exceed\" language. And what I would suggest there is that, that's no different, frankly, from Ferris or any other situation, because what the -- Congress operates against the backdrop of Ferris, which is a 120-plus-year-old doctrine that has been allowed to stay in place by Congress for that entire time. And as the Chamber of Commerce tells us, this is a rule that every contractor takes as an article of faith in dealing with the United States Government.",
  "Well, it's hard to make that argument because the -- the \"not to exceed\" language, at least, that comes out of the -- that's in the appropriations provision. That's not in the contract itself. The contract itself simply says \"subject to appropriations.\"",
  "It's -- Ferris doesn't have the \"subject to appropriation,\" but the Ferris contract says the appropriation limit is X.",
  "Well --",
  "Okay. Well, I take this, then, straight from the Redbook again. \"It is settled that contractors paid from a general appropriation are not barred from recovering for breach of contract, even though the appropriation is exhausted.\" And so even though -- and there's nothing in -- there's no limitation --",
  "Well, it would say that if you don't appropriate enough money for the specific contract, yes. I think that's clearly what Sutton holds. Is that if -- if Justice Scalia and I have an agreement, and the -- the appropriation goes to $100 for our agreement, and the contract says $500, I'm out of luck for the extra $400.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Because essentially what you're doing is putting the backs of this problem -- putting the burden of this problem on the backs of -- of innocent contractors who --",
  "Who entered into in good faith these agreements.",
  "Well, I would -- I would suggest a couple things about that. I mean, I think in general it's reasonable to look for the -- obviously, the intent of the parties and the expectations of the parties. This case went off on summary judgment that we lost. I mean, even on a -- so we didn't have an opportunity for any analysis of this. So the reality is, is that from the tribe's perspective, they recognize, because of Ferris, and because of the way the Comptroller General has interpreted Ferris, that they are under a duty to make sure that there is an appropriation that covers this contract, that the amount, purpose, time requirements are all satisfied with enough money to accomplish that. And then, of course, we have the obligation to perform, which, of course, that's the other half of the equation here. And, Justice Sotomayor, that's why I wouldn't say --",
  "Well, that -- yes, Justice Ginsburg. But the problem is, we don't know the answer to that until after the year of performance is done, or at least months into the performance. And sometimes, literally after we've already performed --",
  "I mean, that -- that is the Southern Ute case. And I -- and certainly, you can make an argument to that. The government has an argument on the other side.",
  "The argument is, it appears that Congress intended to require them to enter into that agreement. You know, the idea of Congress requiring the -- an official to enter into an agreement that violates a criminal statute is at least a -- a difficult concept to sort of wrap your mind around.",
  "No, but --",
  "No, Justice Kennedy. I told you what the meaning of the \"not to exceed\" language is. The \"not to exceed\" language ensures that we cannot turn to the BIA or anyone else at the Interior and say, give us money from another source in order to pay for our contract. And we can't use the injunctive relief that's otherwise available to us for that purpose. So that language has very significant importance in limiting what our options are --",
  "-- in a circumstance where we are not being paid enough under the -- the agreement.",
  "No. I -- I mean, I -- it seems to me that we can't -- I mean, aside from bringing a lawsuit, I mean, we -- we could go to the Secretary and say, we don't have enough money to satisfy our contract, would you take money from some other source in order to accomplish that. Because, in the ordinary course, that's not uncommon to re -- re-jigger the -- the appropriation.",
  "Well, that -- yes, there is --",
  "To be sure, that would not make our situation any better, but --",
  "No. No. It -- I don't -- I don't think it does that. It -- it places inherent limitations -- I mean, it says specifically that the Secretary is not authorized to shift money around in order to take care of this particular problem in this particular year that otherwise would be available to us.",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Of course. Then, we --",
  "Well, ultimately, it means that the burden of it will not fall on the tribes. It is -- it does mean that. But -- and let's be clear about this. The Judgment Fund -- this is not simply going to the Judgment Fund and asking for our contract support costs to be paid. Our argument here is that there has been a breach of contract, and we're entitled to the damages for the breach of contract, whether those are reliance damages or restitutionary damages, whether we -- whether we're supposed to get what we expected out of the deal, or put back in the position we would have been in --",
  "Oh, sure.",
  "Well, the easy way would be to impose specific limitations in -- in every one of the contracts, which -- which, frankly, if you read appropriations bills, which I hate to say I have occasionally done --",
  "It would look like -- for the agreement between the United States and Ramah Navajo for -- for contract support costs in this particular -- for taking over the police department, the contract support costs shall not exceed $150,000, period. That's the total appropriation. And if we look at our contract -- and there's a specific number in the contract -- and that contract number says $174,000, then we know that we're out of luck for the $24,000. We've been put on specific notice --",
  "What's that, Justice Alito?",
  "Yes. Nothing is all that easy, obviously. Some of them enter into it on a fiscal year basis. Some of them enter into it on a -- on a -- on a calendar year basis. And, frankly, the -- part of the problem is when does the government get around to signing these agreements. And, also, there are 12 regions. I mean, part of the reason -- I would like to spend a second talking about the comment that, you know, we have this fair and equitable scheme in place in which we're allocating moneys out, when the reality is, is that there is substantial evidence in the record, even though we have not had an opportunity to make a full record, that the -- that the -- that the Bureau makes mistakes in 40 percent of these contractual arrangements. And I know my -- my colleague's going to dispute that, but the truth is we've known that for years. They just make mistakes, and people get impaired -- their contract rights are impaired on that basis. This is not some kind of an equitable scheme that's operating here. There are 12 different regions operating in 12 different ways. Some people get money, some people get 300 percent of theirs, some people get 0 percent of theirs.",
  "Well, the easy way would be to take away the requirement that the government has to enter into all of these contracts at the request of the tribe. And -- and -- and that's clearly available. If they want to go down that path, they can do that in a heartbeat. And then they have all of the discretion they want -- they want to apply under these circumstances. So, I mean, there's -- obviously, there is a bit of, as we said in the brief, schizophrenia. And I have -- I have some misgivings about describing Congress that way, but there is some schizophrenia in how they approach this problem.",
  "Yes. Congress could --",
  "Right. I -- I mean, I think that would --",
  "Well, I just think it's been noted --",
  "-- but, you know, I don't disagree with that. Look, and as we argued in our brief, there are three or four different ways that Congress can fix this problem going forward. But -- and that's -- and that's the message, I thought, from Justice Sotomayor, is why don't we let Congress fix the problem and allow the background principles of Ferris, as interpreted by the Comptroller General, to apply in this case in order to resolve the contract dispute that's properly, obviously, before the Court at this point. I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Yes. Typically what happens is you enter into the agreement sometime just before the appropriation comes down. It's -- it's usually pretty close, because --",
  "And again -- and, Mr. Chief Justice, if they did that on a -- on a tribe-by-tribe, contract-by-contract basis, I -- I wouldn't have any problem with that, because then you're on notice. But when they say to you, okay, fine, here's -- you know, this is -- here is your contract support cost provision, there's a specific number in there, 1.3.78 dollars and 63 cents, that's what you ought to get, and we get an appropriation that comes back in that says the government will -- that, you know, we have appropriated $100 million for contract support costs. There are 330 other tribes out there potentially with contracts that are involved here. It is -- and -- and just to put it in context, we are talking about -- you know, many of these tribes are in incredibly remote situations. They don't have access to all the other information about what's going on. And the real question is, should you impose --",
  "-- that on the tribes?",
  "I think that's -- I actually think that would be the fairer way to do it. And I don't think it would be as burdensome as -- as your question implies, because, again, what else does staff have better to do than to sit down and put all those appropriations together?",
  "Well --",
  "Right. But then -- then they could do it by -- by -- expressly by reference. I mean, if, in fact, Interior has set it out that way and has it all done, then they can just incorporate it into the statute anyway. I mean, there are simple ways to do it. There are broader ways to do it. And as I said to Justice Sotomayor, clearly Congress could simply, you know, absolve the government of its responsibility to enter into any contract that a -- that a -- when an Indian tribe shows up at their doorstep. All of those seem to me preferable than saying to the tribes, after they have fully performed their side of the deal, okay, I'm sorry, we're not going to pay you. The -- the other thing that's odd about this --",
  "Right.",
  "That's at the beginning of performance. But -- but what we find out about the notices that we are -- that we have later receive is at some point, we're sending you 75 percent in some situations, or we're going to send you exactly the same amount of money you got last year, even though that won't cover it.",
  "Right. We haven't --",
  "Exactly. And, candidly, assume that -- either one of two things will happen. Either we will ultimately be paid in full, which has happened -- I mean, the last year, they were in fact paid in full. Or alternatively, that they will have access to the Judgment Fund in order to -- to get the recovery they are otherwise entitled to.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I think the question is it's unclear what Congress really wanted in this case, and therefore, you ought to construe the -- the scheme in a way that is most favorable to the tribes. And if that means that the scheme operates so as to protect the integrity of the appropriations process and the spending process for a particular year, and prevents us from being able to seek relief outside of this contract support cost appropriation limitation, that makes perfect sense to me, leaving open obviously the availability of the Judgment Fund at the end of the day so that the tribes do not in fact have to bear the full burden of -- of this arrangement as opposed to -- as opposed to anyone else. I mean, that's -- again, we do provide -- we've performed the services. We don't know. We do it in good faith. Under those circumstances, it seems to me that's the classic situation in which we should receive full compensation. If there are no further questions, Your Honor, thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start with the objective baseless issue in this particular case, because it seems to me the district court has done a very thorough job of analyzing every element of this case. The district judge obviously presided over the entirety of this litigation, analyzed the case for purposes of summary judgment, and then reanalyzed the case for purposes of analyzing the merits of ­­ of the claim and to ­­ and whether or not this would be an exceptional case. To be sure, it applied the Brooks standard, but basically what it analyzed was just simply whether there was an objectively legitimate basis for the decision. It's not that it has zero merit. Counsel keeps saying zero merit is objectively baseless. That's not the standard. This Court held in PRE that objectively baseless means that there has to be probable cause ­­ that it lacks probable cause to go forward, that it has to be reasonably possible.",
  "Well, I think you could argue that there is at least a First Amendment concern that's in here. But ­­ but in any event, what it seems to me you really ­­",
  "Well, access to the courts, access to the courts. Any time you talk about imposing multimillion dollar fee awards at the end of the litigation, particularly if you do it on a fairly arbitrary basis ­­",
  "Oh, I have no doubt that Congress could ­­",
  "Well, I'm not sure about in all cases.",
  "Well, I'm not sure I concede that in all cases. I do think in the run­of­the­mill cases, but when you're talking about a situation where you're talk ­­ where the assertion is that the conduct of the litigation, the bringing of the litigation itself is inappropriate ­­",
  "It is not my best argument, I appreciate that, Justice Kennedy.",
  "On the other hand, if you ­­ if you go back and look at Christiansburg, Christiansburg, in that case the court also didn't treat it as a First Amendment issue, but it still recognizes an important policy of ­­ of trying not to have too much interference with access to the courts. In any event, objectively baseless is a standard that every court knows how to use and it goes directly to the ultimate ­­",
  "Well, because the provision was enacted in 1952, Justice Sotomayor, long before this kind of litigation ­­ these kind of rules that would have rendered the litigation sanctionable existed, and so as a consequence of that ­­ and I think it's important to put it in context. Because, you know, when Congress did this initially in 1946, to be sure, it's the Senate report that talks about gross injustice, but it is the decisions of the courts that adopted that approach of gross injustice. And then when Congress, in 1952, incorporates the exceptional case standard, the revisor's notes say it's designed to go back to the legislative history and the decisions that have been interpreting that.",
  "Well ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "I think the problem with the approach you propose there, Justice Breyer, is you're trying to deal with a very small slice of the problem of litigation. You know, what you've described ­­",
  "But the problem ­­",
  "Because when Congress enacted the statute, adopted the exceptional­case standard, it meant, essentially, to require that the litigation be unjustified and vexatious. Unjustified means that it is baseless. That's the understanding that existed all along. It has to have ­­ it's not that it has zero merit, but it has to have enough merit to be ­­ to satisfy the standards of probable cause.",
  "Well, if at the end of the day there's nothing there, then I think it is objectively baseless, even though they've gone through the litigation. But what the district judge ­­",
  "It usually comes through in the opinions, actually.",
  "But, Justice Breyer, you know, the case you have in front of you though is not a case like that.",
  "But see ­­",
  "Can I say two things about that? First of all, the clear and convincing evidence issue is not in the case. It wasn't ­­ they didn't seek certiorari on that issue. You know, if the Court ­­",
  "Subjective ­­",
  "I don't ­­ well, Justice Ginsburg, I do not believe that the clear and convincing evidence standard is fairly subsumed within the question of whether or not the objective baselessness standard ought to be applied, any more than the second case you're going to hear today is subsumed by this case. Those are ­­ I mean, they all come out of the Federal Circuit, but it seems to me you ought to hear ­­ you ought to grant separately on the question of the standard of review or the standard of proof at the appropriate time.",
  "I read that opinion.",
  "Right. But there are a couple of reasons for that. One is obviously this statute was passed long before the Lanham Act was enacted and against a very different backdrop, and Congress clearly, in literally sticking its toe in the water of allowing prevailing defendants to get fees from plaintiffs in a situation was pretty unprecedented at that point in time, set the standard very high and intended for it to prevent gross injustice. The legislative history of the Lanham Act, which this Court apparently was willing to read for those purposes at that time, doesn't ­­ doesn't remotely suggest that. And the Court didn't take into account in that opinion the ­­ the standards under the Patent Act in interpreting the Lanham Act. So it seems to me you could make the argument the opposite way ­­",
  "­­ which is that the Lanham Act ought to be interpreted ­­",
  "­­ the way I propose.",
  "Well, I ­­ I ­­ two answers to that. One is, you know, if you ­­ if you want to ­­ if you want to interpret them in tandem, I would say you should interpret the Patent Act in the strict way that Congress intended it to be interpreted in 1952, and the Lanham Act should follow that. The alternative is there is a different history. Patent litigation and trademark litigation are very, very different in the impact that they have. And as a consequence, you could in fact say that Congress didn't intend that. But ­­ but, you know, I ­­ that seems to me, in some ways, the tail wagging the dog, and that ­­ and that's a mistake.",
  "Justice Breyer ­­",
  "The one thing I do want to say, Justice Breyer, in ­­ in response to ­­ to your argument about why don't you leave it for the district court in that ­­ in that circumstance. The problem is, is what you're saying to plaintiffs who bring patent litigation with ­­ with, in this case, counsel's advice and experts' advice. They got the machines. They did everything you'd want a litigant to do before bringing a litigation. They handled the case. They spend more money on legal fees as the plaintiff than the defendants did in this case. They have to hire an expert. They put in ­­ in play the validity of their patent. There are lots of disincentives for plaintiffs to bring in this case. And at the end of the process, based on a completely indeterminate standard, the district court would then retain authority to say, I conclude that what you did here is unreasonable.",
  "Well, I mean, the idea that there's nothing to lose ­­",
  "Justice Scalia ­­",
  "But there is something to lose. First of all, as I say, the plaintiff ­­ this ­­ you know, there's a reason why you don't see advertisements on television when Saiontz & Kirk says, If you think your patent has been infringed, call us. Why? Because there's not a long line of people who can bring plaintiffs' patent cases. They are expensive to litigate, and the ultimate effect ­­ and you have to get an expert, and ­­ and at the end, you put your patent into validity.",
  "Well, I mean, I don't know whether that's an easy call for the defendant. Doesn't make the ­­ it doesn't make the decision for the plaintiff all that easy to ­­ at the beginning of the process because, as I say, it's both expensive and it puts the validity of the patent at issue. And in most cases, you know, the Federal Circuit, long time ago ­­ or not that long ago said that the inequitable conduct, that is challenging what the plaintiff did before the PTO had become a plague of patent litigation. So plaintiffs who walk into court under those circumstances are not doing it without risk.",
  "Of course.",
  "Right. And the answer to that is that the standards for inequitable conduct are reasonably well set. They get applied pretty routinely, and they create exceptional­case determinations. Litigation misconduct, the standards are pretty well set, pretty well understood, and they give rise to the exceptional­case determinations and award of attorneys' fees. This case is unusual in the sense that all it deals with is that bucket that talks about whether or not you had a substantial basis for putting before the Court this litigation in the first instance. And ­­",
  "Are ­­ are you ­­ are you asking me that just about the baseless litigation or all of 285? Because clearly, inequitable conduct, willful infringement, and ­­ and certain forms of litigation misconduct, which might ­­ might create a basis for fees against the lawyer, might not actually operate against the ­­ against the party where that obviously 285 operates against the party. So there's a whole range of ­­ of behavior that is controlled by 285 that has nothing to do with Rule 11, et cetera. So, yeah, I mean, there ­­ there's clearly some overlap between them, but that ­­ that overlap shouldn't be shocking because, again, 285 was enacted in 1952, and Rule 11 didn't come into being a serious force until 1983.",
  "Again, I mean, the ­­ the clear one ­­ again, if you're only talking about the baselessness component, I don't know that there is one like that. If you're talking about inequitable conduct, they would all be because Rule 11 will never reach inequitable conduct involving the Patent and Trademark Office because it's completely irrelevant to that. So the ­­ the statutes do have some overlap, but they don't have complete correspondence. But that ­­ but to me, that's the key.",
  "Right. Right. There is patent misconduct.",
  "There is ­­",
  "Well, litigation misconduct is something that may or may not go against the party, depending on which rule it is and how it plays out. So there ­­ and the courts have long recognized that certain forms of vexatious behavior by litigants may lead you to a particular ­­ to ­­ to determine that something's an exceptional case. So there ­­ there seem to me clearly there might be. What I'm ­­ what I am conceding is that I ­­ I can't envision a situation where you have brought what a court has said is objectively baseless litigation in the first instance that might not have been actionable under Rule 11. The question would be ­­ it would be ­­ at this ­­ at this stage it would go immediately against the party as opposed to potentially against the lawyer. And ­­ and to that extent, it obviously provides broader relief, depending on which of the two parties might actually have more resources.",
  "Well, today ­­ today that's ­­ I think that may be true. I don't think that was true in 1946 and then again in 1952. The ­­ the whole notion of shifting fees to a ­­ to a losing plaintiff was ­­ was all but unprecedented at the time. And the best evidence we have of ­­ of the circumstances in which Congress wanted to have those fees imposed is ­­ is to prevent a gross injustice. And it seems to me nothing better suits that test than something that is objectively baseless, as ­­ as just that one bucket within which 285 operates. The other buckets, obviously, equally involve situations of gross injustice.",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "I mean, we ­­ we obviously have, because it's in the Federal Circuit's standard, we ­­ we embrace it, but the reality is we ­­ I don't need to win the bad faith argument if this Court concluded that bad faith is ­­ it shouldn't be an independent factor. That would ­­ that would not bother me because the district judge already found that this is objectively not baseless, so there ought to be a basis for affirmance on that ground alone. Alternatively, the Court obviously could wait for another case in which to take up that issue. I ­­ I ­­ but we don't need to win that in order to prevail on this particular case, and it certainly wouldn't cause me any heartburn if the Court were to ­­ to jettison that part of it.",
  "Yeah, I ­­ well.",
  "It's not in the ­­ that it's not before us. I mean, the rationale of clear and convincing obviously is that ­­ is whether you assume that the patent is being implemented in good faith or being ­­ being brought in good faith and therefore creates sort of a presumption in favor of the ­­ of infringement and legitimacy; and then clear and convincing evidence is obviously designed to make it harder to get over that hurdle. Again, I ­­ I'm not here to defend the clear and convincing evidence standard. I ­­ I read the concurring opinion in the Federal Circuit as well and ­­ but it seems to me clearly not in this case. It's not subsumed by the question presented and that's ­­ that's an issue that the Court ought to wait for another day. Hopefully I won't have to defend it at that time.",
  "If there are no further questions, Your Honors, I'd urge you to affirm. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It is common ground between the parties in this case that Section 101, by its terms, and with the sweeping interpretation this Court adopted in Bilski applies directly to the patents here. These are system and process patents that speak directly to Section 101. The only issue, then, is whether the Judicially­recognized exception that this Court adopted many, many years ago applies under these circumstances.",
  "That ­­ that our ­­ our patents speak directly to the language of Section 101, that is, they are a process, and they are machines, and they are ­­ and they are improvements to the process and the machines. They don't ­­ they don't dispute that by its terms 101 applies. The only argument between the parties is the abstract idea exception that exists and whether that bars us from otherwise satisfying Section 101.",
  "If our ­­ if our patent merely claimed intermediated settlements, although I have to say I don't really know exactly what that means because I don't think that's the same kind of economics ­­ basic economics concept that a hedge risk treatment is. But if it claimed that, we wouldn't ­­ we wouldn't have a distinction from Bilski. What we claim is a very specific way of dealing with a problem that came into being in the early 1970s of how to try to eliminate the risk of non­settlement in these very massive multiparty problems in which you need to deal with difficulties that exist at different time zones simultaneously and to do it with a computer so that you not only take them on chronologically, deal with them sequentially, based on the kind software analysis that the patent specifically describes by function. And it goes even further than that, and does something that no escrow agent and ­­ and no intermediated settlement that I know of ­­ settler that I know of. It actually blocks specific transactions that, in the shadow account, would violate the terms of the settlement that would ultimately be implemented.",
  "I don't disagree with it, Justice ­­",
  "I prefer not to use that word for obvious reasons.",
  "But ­­ but if you ­­ but if you look at the Solicitor ­­",
  "Right. But ­­ and ­­ and obviously, methods and processes are precisely what Section 101 permits ­­",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "It is ­­",
  "I do see the point, Justice Breyer, and it seems to me that it goes to the question of the methodology you're going to employ.",
  "Well, we could ­­",
  "No. Well, I mean, again, it seems to me that in some ways what ­­ what you described there is a caricature of what this invention is.",
  "But ­­",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. Because, Justice Breyer, the ­­ the ­­ the concept here is not simply to say stop. Stop is obviously part of the element of it. But it's also designed to ensure that at the end of the day, this transaction, in the midst of literally a global set of ­­ of deals that are going on simultaneously, will be implemented at the appropriate time in the appropriate way. And whatever else that may be, it seems to me it's difficult to say that's an abstract idea as implemented.",
  "Well, it does it through ­­ it creates the shadow accounts because of the concerns for security. You don't ­­ you're not going to allow somebody to enter into a central bank's own accounts. You create the shadow accounts. You monitor through the software that allows you to do that. You evaluate each of the transactions to ensure that the settlement will be available. You do it sequentially, and you act on it by the end of the day or whenever the transaction is to take place, and you implement that transaction.",
  "Justice Scalia ­­",
  "At one level I agree with you completely. There is no difference between them. This Court has, however, said on more than a few occasions, albeit in dicta, that coming up with an idea and then say, use a computer, is not sufficient. And what I'm trying to suggest to you is we don't fall within that dicta. Now, if you don't accept the dicta and you say use a computer is fine, then I think we're done.",
  "To be sure, Justice Scalia.",
  "Right.",
  "And ­­ and look, there's no ­­ I'll be the first one to ­­ to confess that trying to use language to describe these things is not all that easy. But the way I think you can meaningfully look at this is to say that this is not simply something that was a fundamental truth, this is not something that simply says use a computer. It's not simply something that says maintain solvency. It ­­ it operates in a much more specific and concrete environment where you're dealing with a problem that's been in existence since the 1970s, a solution in the 1990s, that CLS itself acknowledges needed a solution and came forward with their own solution that looks a lot like ours.",
  "You cannot, absolutely cannot do that with this system, because it is so complex and so many interrelated parts.",
  "But it's not just ­­ I mean, obviously, part of it is use the computer, Justice Kennedy. But more fundamentally, it goes beyond that. See, I ­­",
  "No, I don't believe so.",
  "No. Justice Ginsburg, what we did here is what the Patent and Trademark Office encourages us to do and encourages all software patent writers to do, which is to identify the functions that you want to be provided for with the software and leave it then to the software writers, who I gather are, you know, quite capable of converting these functions into very specific code.",
  "Yes. I'm saying ­­",
  "I'm saying both actually. I mean, I'm making both of those arguments. I ­­ I believe that if you analyze the claims and you don't caricature them and you don't strip them out of the limitations that are embedded in there, this is not some kind of an abstract concept. This is not some kind ­­ it's not an abstract idea. It's a very­­",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "It is ­­ well ­­ and again, it's difficult to do that because you absolutely need the computer in order to implement this. But the key to the invention is the notion of being able simultaneously, dealing with it on a chronological basis to stop transactions that will otherwise interfere with the ability to settle on time and under the appropriate circumstances. And the only way you can do that in a real­time basis when you're dealing with a global economy is to use a computer. It is necessary to the efficacy of this. So in that sense, I can't ­­ I can't disaggregate it the way in some sense you're suggesting. It seems to me it's bound up with in ­­ it's bounds up with the whole notion of is this an abstract concept.",
  "Yeah, of course.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I guess I would suggest to you that you might want to deal with the problem you know as opposed to the problems you don't know at this stage. I mean, we have had business method patents and software patents in existence for well over a decade and they're obviously quite significant in number. And ­­ and we know what the system is we have. And Congress looked at that system, right, and didn't say no to business methods patents, didn't say no to software patents, instead said the solution to this problem is to get it out of the judicial process and create an administrative process, but leave the substantive standards intact. So my suggestion to you would be follow that same advice, a liberal interpretation of 101 and not a caricature of the claims, analyze the claims as written, and therefore say that the solution is 102 and 103 and use the administrative process. If you ­­",
  "But this is post­Bilski.",
  "Well, I mean, it still seems to me that the ­­ the natural inference is Congress did not change 101. Congress created an entire administrative system to deal with 101, 102 and 103. And ­­ and I would hope ­­",
  "That's true.",
  "And you've exhausted my math skills, Your Honor.",
  "Exactly.",
  "And that's the argument we're making and ­­",
  "­­ that's the line we're asking the Court to draw here.",
  "I would urge the Court to look at Joint Appendix 159, 285­286, where it goes through the flow charts. This is ­­ and this is just a specific example of the method by which you stop a transaction, and it goes through various series of detailed steps and what the computer has to do in order to do that. It doesn't actually, obviously, put in the code, but that's what the PTO says don't do. Don't put in the code because nobody understands code, so ­­ but put in the functions, and we know ­­ and we know that someone skilled in the art will be able to put in the code. And if they aren't, if they can't do that, then it's not enabled and that's a 112 problem. To go back, Justice Breyer, to your question. So on the one hand, you've got a problem that it seems to me Congress to some extent has said is okay and we've got a solution and that solution's playing through. On the other hand, if this Court were to say much more categorically either that there's no such thing as business method patents or adopt the Solicitor General's interpretation, which is to say that there cannot be software unless the software somehow actually improves the computer, as opposed to software improving every other device or any other mechanism that might be out there. What we know is that this would inherently declare and in one fell swoop hundreds of thousands of patents invalid, and the consequences of that it seems to me are utterly unknowable. And before the Court goes down that path, I would think it would think long and hard about whether isn't that a judgment that Congress ought to make. And it seems to me in that sense you're essentially where the Court was in Chakrabarty, where everybody was saying you've got to act in one way or the other or the world comes to an end, and the courts have said, we'll apply 101 directly.",
  "Well, it would be very hard for me to see how that ­­ how ­­ how I can get around that particular problem, because the computer is the essence of it, so ­­ and a portion of it is clearly the software. So I think if you say there is no such thing as software patentability, I do lose in this case, yes, Your Honor. As do a whole lot of other people.",
  "That's the way I interpret the government's ­­ the government's brief.",
  "I read the Solicitor General's brief as broader than the Bloomberg brief in ­­ in terms of the approach. And IBM's argument is if you knock out software patents, you eliminate web browsing, word processing, cellphones, e­mail. Those are all activities that I don't think fall within the meaning of the ­­ the meaning of the government's theory of the case.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. But I ­­ and I guess my answer to that is that's nowhere in the statute and it doesn't seem to me to reflect an abstract idea. It's a ­­ it's a line you draw that takes out business method patents. If the Court wants to eliminate business method patents, fine. But you just said no to that in Bilski two, three terms ago. Now, to be sure, give the Solicitor General credit, he comes here and says to you: We didn't like the result in Bilski; we want you to say don't use process in order to get there, which is a statutory interpretation; come up with an extraordinarily complicated way of looking at the exception and use that to get to the exact same result.",
  "Well, he said there's an overlap. Here in this context, I think, basically the Respondents' theory would mean that they are completely coterminous. And I don't think that's what the Court meant. And also, we know from Diehr that there's got to be at least some significant limitations on the extent to which novelty has to be built into 101. That is the province of 102 and 103. And, as I said, Congress modified the system of adjudication to create an administrative mechanism that allows you to get to 102 and 103. And at least in context, it's important to realize there have been 11 cases since that was created. Nine of the 11 have been knocked down on 102 or 103 grounds and not on 101 grounds. And it seems to me that's the answer to this problem, is leave 101 as the coarse filter. If on its face it states these kinds of broad abstract way, I think you could still say that the system claims, which clearly are ­­ are how to create a computer system and how to implement it using that method, would be a much more concrete version of that in a way that would take it out of 101. That said, I, obviously, believe that all of our claims satisfy 101 and should go on to the next stage.",
  "I don't know if it's the same, but I would ­­ I would argue that it could very well be a patentable subject matter because ­­ but it depends on how the claims play out.",
  "I could certainly ­­ I think I could write a claim ­­ a set of claims that I believe would satisfy 101. And ­­ and to the extent that you'd ­­ that you'd think those are no different than the ones I have here, then my argument is simply I think I satisfy 101 with the claims we have before us, Your Honor. If there are no further questions, then I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd just like to make a few points. First of all, with respect to the question you asked, which is looking at 159, et cetera, all I can tell you is that if you look at claim 33, it talks about matched orders, matched orders are then described in 286 and 287, and then makes specific reference to 159, and that flow chart that's there. And it's all designed as a package. It's only one element of the ­­ of the invention, but it is a central element, and it's an easy one to understand, that it goes well beyond simply the notion of hedge ­­ hedge against settlement risk and do it by a computer.",
  "There's no basis for that statement, Your Honor. There ­­ remember, this went off on a very truncated litigation process. So there's ­­ you know, we ­­ we got cut off at the beginning of it. There's been no construction of the ­­ of the claims and ­­ and obviously, these are specifications that go to how you interpret the claim.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, I don't ­­ I don't believe so. I think there's no question. And, you know, General Verrilli could not have been any plainer in his statement of how he wants to interpret the abstract idea concept.",
  "No business methods ­­ just another way of saying no business methods. And, you know, the Court rejected that. And it seems to me extraordinary to say Congress didn't reject no business methods in 101, but we're going to do ­­ we're going to manipulate the judicial exception to accomplish precisely that same thing. It seems to me that's wholly inappropriate. Justice Ginsburg, you asked my ­­ my friend here, you know, what's his test? He didn't answer that question, you'll notice, because he doesn't have an answer. His basic argument is, whatever you do, just kill this patent. And if I were in his shoes, I suppose I'd take that same position. I think what's absolutely clear is that the test ought to be one that is structured as a very coarse filter, not the kind of filter that he's pushing for where it changes over time. I mean, I thought his ­­ I thought his response to one of the questions about e­mail and word processing that Justice Sotomayor asked is over time it would change. Well, that's exactly what 102 and 103 are for. That is not the purpose of ­­ of Section 101. And then he uses the example of encryption. I guarantee you if we were arguing about encryption in this case, he would say to me that that's an abstract principle because encryption is a concept that's been around since time immemorial. George Washington used it. Everybody has used encryption. And the question again, that's not the solution to these problems. The question is, how did we go about doing it? And we go beyond the basics of simply saying use a computer, and that's what we ask this Court to focus on and to evaluate. As to the frequent flier program, it's pretty clear to me that even though it was a novel idea in some sense, the concept itself would have been viewed in ­­ in the KSR fashion as quite obvious as a means of improving customer loyalty. There are solutions here. Giving us 101 pass doesn't create a monopoly. It just gets us to the 102 and 103 inquiries that are at the heart of what the patent laws ­­ and 112 that are at the heart of what the patent laws ought to be dealing with. If there are no further questions, Your Honor, thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Kennedy, I think I'd like to start with the first question you asked, which is what ­­ what do we learn essentially from Economics 101. And ­­ but I think the way that you have to think about it is in terms of the actual market that operates in this particular case, which is a wholesale market. It's not a market that covers the entire United States. It covers less than half the States. But it is an important market that was created in order to create a basis for competition. And up to this point, up prior to the demand response initiative that was not adopted by FERC, but was, in fact, pushed by my clients and those we represent in private business, what we were trying to do was to create a demand­side component to that wholesale market. Because trying to regulate exclusively or trying to ­­ to deal exclusively with the supply side wouldn't work, or it's not as effective as it could be, or certainly wouldn't necessarily guarantee you just and reasonable rates. And so tariffs were filed in order to provide a basis for putting in the demand side. And the reason why this is a direct effect on the ­­ on the wholesale rates is because it's an absolute one­to­one relationship. If I put in a unit of ­­ of or reduce a unit of demand, I don't need as much supply, and that affects the price directly. And that's the direct relationship that derives from the economic principles. And ­­ and to my mind, the entirety of ­­ of the Federal Power Act, in 201, 204, 205, asks you in the first instance to look at the wholesale market that exists. And then once you do that, then is this ­­ you know, it's not: Does it affect the retail rate? Clearly it will. The question is: Did what FERC do here in the order directly affect the wholesale rate? And on that score, it seems to me there's no question. Then the issue becomes what ­­",
  "I don't know that it would directly affect the wholesale rate in nearly as exquisite a fashion as the regulation in this case, because again, you're talking about the exact same transactions going on in affecting supply and demand. Nothing can affect the wholesale rates that way. If I make an effort to manipulate the retail rates, maybe eventually it will affect the wholesale rates, but it will do it in ways that are very indirect as we explained in our reply brief. It may go up; they may go down. It's impossible to know. There's no way to doubt that if I reduce supply, that that will in ­­ or if I ­­ yeah. If I reduce supply, that will cause the ­­ the rates, the wholesale rates to drop as a natural consequence.",
  "Well, I mean ­­ I don't know that we define the market. We've allowed the market to be created.",
  "Right. No, I understand that. But the question is what price will allow this ­­ will ­­ will promote this market, to create incentives to allow you to have enough on the supply side ­­ on the demand side, I'm sorry ­­ in order to make this meaningful? And what the FERC said was, when we had experience with one of the regional transmission operations, what happened when they reduced the price? The amount of the demand response dropped precipitously. And as a consequence of that, based on that experience, we now have enough evidence by which to say, wait a second, we need to go back and raise the price in order to bring in more of the demand response, in order to ensure that there is a reasonable balance between the supply and the ­­ and the demand. But all of that's in the wholesale market. This ­­ this doesn't come close to violating the principle of Louisiana Power where this Court said, what is the retail authority that is preserved to the State? And that's to set the rates for retail sales. The State ­­",
  "I'm sorry, Your Honor.",
  "Right. But that all assumes that what ­­ what FERC is trying to do here is to, in fact, directly regulate the rates. That's not ­­ that was never the intention behind this exercise. The intention here is to try to manipulate ­­ not to manipulate, but to control ­­",
  "­­ the wholesale rates in a way that would not ­­",
  "Right. But ­­ but the statute ­­",
  "Well, I ­­ you know, ONEOK sort of says what you intend, what you ­­ what your intent is and what's directed at actually controls in some ways this area, but we're talking about a situation of concurrent jurisdiction between the State and the Federal government in this particular context. And so the fact that there are going to be effects on the retail rates doesn't deprive FERC, which ultimately is the supreme authority here, as long as it operates within the sphere of adopting ­­ of dealing with a practice, regulating a practice that will in fact affect the wholesale rates. And that's precisely what it has tried to do in this particular context. And ­­ and, Justice Kennedy, I don't think there's a problem with respect to the way the rates were set, because again, if you do it in the ­­ in this very sort of fundamental Economics 101 approach, which Dr. Khan is the one who ­­ who was the primary proponent of it, said, look, if you're ­­ if you're taking out demand, if you're ­­ if you're reducing demand, that affects supply directly, and therefore, you should compensate them exactly the same. And FERC looked at that and said, you know, that makes perfect sense to us. That's an appropriate way to go. That will ­­ you know. That's not a ­­ that's not luring people; that's just providing a basis upon which there will be enough of a market in order to allow the wholesale side of the ­­ of the grid system to operate in an efficient way. Not only to reduce the wholesale prices, which is important, but even more fundamentally, Your Honor, to protect the reliability of the grid. That was what prompted, frankly, the initial effort to deal with this entire demand response issue, was to figure out what are we going to do about brownouts? What are we going to do about blackouts? How are we going to be able to ­­ because we can't do it if we just do it on the ­­ on the ­­ on the generation side. We need to reduce the demand in order to ensure that in response to these kinds of crises, there is an answer. This is the answer. Commission has operated exactly the way it ought to have under these circumstances.",
  "Well, most of the private companies on the other side generate electricity and would prefer not to manipulate the supply side because they're ­­ they're ­­ I mean, manipulate the demand side because they like to have all of the supply side going to as far as you can take it.",
  "They're pretty ­­ I mean, there's a substantial number of them. I mean, the vast majority of them on the other side are ­­ are generators, Your Honor.",
  "I'll let him count up his amicus briefs, if he ­­ if he wishes. And ­­ and the last thing I guess I would say is ­­ is I agree with General Verrilli's point, that if at ­­ at all ­­ if all else fails, this is clearly a question ­­ these are both questions that are ­­ in which the Commission deserves deference. It deserves deference on the question of the scope of its jurisdiction, and it assuredly deserves deference, Justice Kennedy, in deciding as between locational marginal price and locational marginal price minus G or minus G plus A, or however you would go about that. If there's any issue upon which this Court ought to say the Commission gets a ­­ gets more than a thumb on the scale, it would be that issue. If there are no further questions, Your Honor. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has made clear that class actions are only appropriate when the plaintiff's proof is tailored to their specific theory of liability in a way that allows class­wide injury to be determined in one stroke, and that the lower courts must engage in a rigorous analysis in order to demonstrate that fact. In this Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, the plaintiffs were allowed to pursue a class of more than 3300 employees who occupied job ­­ more than 400 jobs which required widely differing amounts of time to perform their donning, doffing, and washing tasks.",
  "Well, there ­­ there are a number of answers to that, Justice Ginsburg. First of all, if you ­­ if you just look at the activities that Dr. Mericle specifically testified about, for certain activities, he found some employees who take 30 seconds to get dressed and others who took more than 10 minutes to get dressed ­­",
  "­­ in certain circumstances in ­­",
  "There are a number of questions embedded in there, Justice Kennedy. The ­­ the first one is ­­ and we objected all along to having this class certified on the basis that there were a wide range of ­­",
  "But Justice Kennedy, we don't have to bring forward an expert. What we did in this case is we ­­ we cross­examined both their ­­ the named plaintiffs, the four named plaintiffs who testified, and demonstrated two things about that. One, that in general, they way overestimated their own time; and two, none of their times were remotely the same as Dr. Mericle's time. So we proved that. Second, we cross­examined Dr. Mericle about his testimony and demonstrated again that his methods were completely haphazard and scattered, and therefore couldn't demonstrate. And this notion that you patch over the entirety of these problems simply by averaging all of the times of all of these employees is simply the kind of shortcut this Court has ­­ has rejected in the past in both Comcast and Wal­Mart. I'm sorry, Justice.",
  "Justice Sotomayor, I would ­­ I would ­­ yes. I would categorically reject that, because that's no more different than Employee A coming into court and saying I don't know what I worked, but Employee B, who does vastly different activities ­­",
  "We ­­ we don't have any quarrel with Mt. Clemens the way it was written. The Mt. Clemens made ­­ makes a very clear divide between what needs to be proven, what the plaintiff's burden is to demonstrate that he or she has worked beyond the 40­hour work week, and then what happens if that's proof ­­",
  "Right. But there were a lot of people who didn't work beyond the 40 hours.",
  "And ­­ and the jury rejected Dr. Mericle's averaging of ­­ of 18 ­­ 18 and 20 ­­ 18 and a half and 21 minutes, and we don't know what the impact of that is. What we do know is that Fox calculated that a mere three minutes' departure from Mericle's numbers dropped the damages award by $1.41 million, and dropped the number of plaintiffs out by close to 125. So Justice Kennedy, the small differences make a big difference in ­­ in this particular case.",
  "Right.",
  "And in some ways, Justice Ginsburg, that explains why we didn't bring the Daubert motion that Justice Kennedy asked about because the methodology isn't inherently flawed. The problem with the methodology is it's applied to the theory of liability in this case. It's one thing for an employer to say, look, we're entitled under the Department of Labor regulations to average, as a mechanism for trying to avoid the kind of picayune details and discrepancies that the Court identified in Mt. Clemens and said those can be disregarded as mere trifles, we're allowed to do that. And the effect of what we, in fact, did hear was to round up in order to provide more time to people than they might otherwise have gotten. And indeed, if you go to the pre­2007 period when you're talking about the people who just put on the normal sanitary clothing, they were ­­ they were all given four minutes of K­time when they ­­ it took them all of about 30 seconds to do that. So the idea that we could overcompensate somebody using those kinds of data is one thing, but that's a vast difference from saying that in order to ­­ to maintain as ­­ under a rigorous analysis the idea that this can proceed as a class when all you've got is averaging across the widest imaginable range of ­­ of employees performing different tasks with different requirements, and indeed, although I don't think ­­",
  "No. I would go ­­ I would actually go at it the other way. I would say that the first question is: Can you use this kind of averaging in a ­­ in a run mine­case period under Rule 23? And it seems to me the answer to that has to be no, that this ­­ this simply papers over the problems of the class.",
  "Right. And then the question is ­­",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "That's not what Mt. Clemens says, Justice Kagan. Mt. Clemens says that it's the burden on the employee to demonstrate that he or she worked the requisite hours in order to get past 40. Once you got past 40 in determining exactly what the damages would be, at that point it was reasonable because we hadn't ­­ because ­­ because Mt. Clemens hadn't maintained records to go ahead and give the plaintiff a pass. It's the same ­­ it's the Story parchments test all over again.",
  "I think that's exactly the line the Court drew in Mt. Clemens. It's the line that the Court has consistently drawn in antitrust cases, from parchment.",
  "To be sure. I mean, you can go at it either way. But at the end of the day, obviously, what ­­ as I started ­­ as I started my remarks, is ­­ is that the Court ­­ is that the plaintiffs are obliged to demonstrate that a class works on the basis of the substantive liability that they have to ­­ burden that they have to assume ­­",

  "But see, the problem ­­",
  "The ­­ the problem with this ­­ and this would raise exactly the same Comcast problem ­­ is my guess is your expert testified about the conspiracy that lasted through the entire period.

And it was the plaintiffs' decision to go for the ­­ for the entirety of the claim rather than take a more narrow approach of maybe seeking walking time where the conduct of the individual plaintiffs is much more homogenous.

But, second of all, the ­­ the bifurcation they proposed was that first you were going to decide whether Mericle is right or not, and that means whether 18 and a half and 21 can be averaged across your class. And then the second part was going to be Fox testifying about how to slot that in. Well, that's not ­­ that's not going to ­­ it may help with respect to the ­­ to the uninjured ­­ to the injured class members, but it would not have remotely helped with the more fundamental question of the inadequacy of this as a class action device where you patch over the problems of this ­­ of this class by simply averaging everything together.",
  "Right.",
  "And ­­ and my answer to the Mt. Clemens one, which, obviously, I'm not persuading you on, is that if ­­ the way I read Mt. Clemens, it says, you don't go to fair and reasonable inference on ­­ on the liability phase. You only do that on the damages phase. And I would still argue here that even if you use Mt. ­­ the fair and reasonable inference standard, it won't be satisfied by what Mericle did here, because it's one thing to ­­ to do some kind of sampling. It's another thing to say, I'm going to take wildly different, 30 seconds versus 10 minutes and average everybody across the plant without any effort to be more tailored in our approach than that, Your Honors. I would like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me answer Justice Alito's point and the ­­ and the observation where ­­ I mean, the reality is, is that in the Reich litigation, we were told that the ­­ the ordinary sanitary equipment was not ­­ was not within the donning and doffing requirements, and never a problem. And so as a consequence of that, frankly, we didn't monitor this. That's not a complete defense, but it at least explains the sort of the equities of the ­­ of the situation. Second, my good friend tells you that the district court here found that all of these things are very similar. The reality is, is that at Pet. App. 87A, the first time this issue came up with the class certification, the district court said there are some very big factual differences among all these employees. And the basic ­­ and the only reason the district court didn't agree to certify it at that time was because he thought that the gang­time was somehow the ­­ the tie that binds this all together. Well, the gang­time was nothing in this ­­ in this litigation, and the reality is he made a mistake then, and every time we came back to decertify this class, based on more and more information about the inadequacies of Mericle's evidence as applied by Fox, who was ­­ who was essentially just wiped away, saying, well, this is distinguishable from the Supreme Court's cases here, and it's distinguishable from the Supreme Court's cases there. Justice Kennedy, the answer to your question ­­",
  "Yes, Your Honor, it did.",
  "That's on page 87A of the appendix to the petition. Justice, that's in the first certification decision. Justice Kennedy, to answer your question about how do you write an opinion, and when is it close enough? Averaging is a permissible way of going about it when the evidence is clear that the ­­ that the basic activity is homogenous, and that would have been true for walking time. There was ­­ there was literally no difference ­­",
  "Homogenous. And here when you're talking about 30 seconds and 10 minutes, and we're talking about wildly different activities, what you can't do is just simply say, okay, we're just going to patch over all that and average it.",
  "Yes, and that's why ­­",
  "Right. But my point here is, is that in general, everybody agrees that's a reasonable way to proceed. That's my point. Here we're not talking about homogenized because there are vast differences, and the evidence is absolutely unsalable on that. And with respect to Mt. Clemens, in the first place, I ­­ I don't think Mt. Clemens should be extended to ­­ to make the fair and reasonable inference standard of the presumption apply at the liability phase, and I think the court was extremely clear in not wanting to go down that path. But second, even if you thought the presumption should be applied here, I would argue that the Mericle's evidence, as ­­ as, you know, through cross­examination and examination of others, demonstrates that this is not a fair and reasonable inference. And on that score, it seems to me that there are two quotations I would offer up. One comes from this Court's decision in Wal­Mart, \"when an expert's testimony does nothing to advance a party's case, the Court can safely disregard what he says.\" And then what Judge Posner said in a very similar FLSA case, \"What cannot support an inference about the work time of thousands of employees is evidence of a small, unrepresentative sample of them,\" and that is precisely what we have in this particular case. With respect to remand, we would be happy for a remand to ­­ for allocation if that's permissible, but as I read, the final judgment of the district court is judgment of about $6 million to these named plaintiffs, and that was affirmed. There is nothing in there about how this is going to be allocated under these circumstances. So if the Court believes there's got to be a separate proceeding of allocation, the Court hopefully would order that, although I think there is a more fundamental decision the Court would have to reach. And then finally, with respect to who has the burden of dealing with this problem, it is the plaintiffs' burden to sustain the justification for a class all throughout the proceedings until a final judgment is entered. And we came to the court four times asking them not to certify this. So to come back in at the end and say, well, since we were able to try this without any ability to put forward any of our individual defenses with respect to any of these individual employees, except for the four who actually testified, is exactly what this Court said in Wal­Mart and Comcast is an impermissible way to define the class. The Court should reverse in this case, declare the class decertified. If there are no further questions, Your Honor, thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Before I get into the substance of my argument, one point that seems to me to cry out, at least in response to the characterizations by my ­­ from Mr. Wall where he repeatedly described Zimmer's conduct as copying the invention in this case, what ­­ what the Zimmer Corporation copied was the product itself. The ­­ the patent wasn't released or issued until two years of that initial copying. There's nothing inherently wrong with finding that a competitor has built a new product, not know anything about the patents or any patentability, no evidence of any patents, and think you're going to copy it ­­",
  "­­ and improve on it. I'm sorry?",
  "After 2000, it was marked. But the ­­ but the actions taken by Zimmer at the time were 1998, two years before the patent even issued. I just want to clarify that. I also want to go back to the point that ­­ that ­­",
  "Right. But there was no evidence whatsoever that ­­ that Zimmer at that time had any knowledge of anything in the patent ­­ in the ­­",
  "Yes, it does.",
  "If ­­ no, no, no. It's ­­ all I'm suggesting is that ­­ that it's a mischaracterization of the ­­ of the facts to say that this involves purely copying, beginning from the very outset of the process. That's not to say that there couldn't be an argument somewhere along the line that they ­­ that there ­­ there might have been an argument of willfulness. But this is not a classic copying case. I mean, in a lot of ways this case comes down to sort of trolls versus pirates in terms of how you want to analyze it. And our view is ­­ and ­­ and I thought the example that the Solicitor General's office just offered you tells you everything you should know about this. His ­­ his criticism is that a good lawyer is hired and goes off and searches in the German libraries and finds some basis upon which to challenge legitimately the validity of that patent. Now, if it had turned out that in those German sources they had, in fact, demonstrated that that patent was invalid, the position of the world would be that's great, because this patent should be declared invalid and the monopoly that attaches to it should be declared null and void and unenforceable. The fact that they found it and it turns out not to get you over the hump shouldn't be, by any stretch of the imagination, lead to a ­­ to a standard of the law that discourages us from going out and trying to find both the limits of the metes and bounds of the patent itself as ­­ as defined by the ­­ by the patent holder, and to challenge the invalidity of those patents under all circumstances. And Justice Breyer, I mean, that goes to the core point that you were making. We're not talking about a situation here where it's obvious when something is infringed. There are thousands of patents, hundreds of thousands of patents. There are lots of entities creating new products every day, new services, if you want to go beyond the products and the patent law, and ­­",

  "Well, Professor Lumley has written on the subject repeatedly, and he ­­",
  "Right. But ­­",
  "But there are ­­ but there are two separate issues here. Let's ­­ so, and I'll take those in turn. The first one is, is there empirical evidence that there is a significant amount of activity out there in which patents are asserted in ­­ in more or less specific ways. You'll recall the example given by ­­ by my friend was you receive a letter that identifies the precise claims, identifies exactly how you infringe it, and it's ignored.

  "­­ entity ­­ the circuit's already decided. I think that's ­­",

  "Well, let ­­ let me at least correct one portion of the statement because you said that ­­ enough to put forward that it's not frivolous. I ­­ I don't think that's the appropriate standard. Objective reasonableness is the requirement that the Federal Circuit has looked at, and I think that's more than simply the ability to satisfy Rule 11. I think there has to be a substantial defense. And substantial defenses were put forward in both of these cases. Indeed these were, in both instances, close cases. So I would hope that that's where the Court would ­­ would focus its attention.",
  "Right. But again, I think it's important to look at the ­­ the way the court of appeals analyzed it. And the reality is I think if you ­­ and it's the reason why you have to have an experienced, an expert court of appeals looking at these issues on an objective ­­ on the ­­ on the basis of an objective analysis because they are the ones who have seen these kinds of claim­construction issues, have seen these kinds of infringement issues. They're in the best position to be able to say, this is objectively reasonable and, therefore, not something on which enhanced damages should be added. What I think it's important to put in context, because you're going through the history of this, is to ­­ is, again, to look at the difference between Section 284 as it evolved and the ­­ and the meaning of Section 285. I mean, this Court last term said Section 285 has now ­­ has now ­­ it's not essential or effective. It has completely made the enhanced damages purely punitive because every other piece of conduct goes into the portion that talks about whether you get the attorneys' fees.",
  "That's what makes an extraordinary case. Yes, Your Honor. I'm sorry.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. And ­­",
  "I ­­ I ­­ I understand that, and that's why I think you have to take it one step at a time. First of all, you ­­ you quoted one portion of the language of ­­ of 284. The portion that I focus on particularly is the ­­ you begin with damages adequate to compensate for the infringement. So the ­­ 284 is now ­­ and, you know, since 1952, has been focused exclusively on the infringement. It's not any other kind of ancillary conduct. It's only enhanced damages for the infringement because those are the only ­­ you know, that ­­ those damages are one and the same. Then you get to the point where Seagate says, if we don't have a strong enough standard of recklessness and willfulness and an objective standard that can be examined by us independently, the downside risks and the harm to the economy is ­­ is very substantial. There have been ­­ there are huge numbers of these letters being sent, litigation. It skews every aspect of it. And then Congress comes back in the America Invents Act, and through the process leading up to the America Invents Act, Seagate comes into being, and ­­ and the ­­ and the Federal Circuit takes a very hard look at it. Congress looks at that and says, we're not going to change Section 284 because, in light of Seagate, that willfulness standard, which is the standard the Court was very explicit about, that helped solve the problem that all of us had been concerned about. The Congress didn't just leave it at ­­ at where you have to infer this from silence or inaction by Congress. Congress passed the Section 298. And in Section 298 it talks about opinions of counsel and what role they play in the willfulness determination. It seems to me, in order to give Section 298 any significant meaning, you have to have concluded, then, that 284 necessarily incorporates a standard of willfulness even though, obviously, it's not in the language, but that's ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, the only test in front of it at the point ­­ at that point in time was Seagate because Seagate was the definition of what 284 was about and what the standard of willfulness was about. But I think what's equally important, Justice Kagan, is ­­ I'll ­­ I'll concede that willfulness can have a lot of different meanings, but the meaning that the Seagate court adopted was the ­­ was the meaning this Court adopted in Safeco. And it's interesting because my friends did not ­­ didn't say the word \"Safeco\" at all in their 25 minutes of presentation. But ­­ and this is why it's not such a big jump, Mr. Chief Justice, because what ­­ what Seagate said is what's ­­ what's the best source for trying to come up with a sensible way of applying willfulness? And ­­ and they looked at Safeco, and they said, you know, the ­­ the best way to do it is with a recklessness standard. That's an objective determination. And the fact that there may be subjective, bad ­­ bad intent is off the table. I mean, that's footnote 20 of the Safeco opinion, and the Court said ­­",
  "­­ that's the best way to enforce this statute.",
  "I would ­­ I would desperately ask you not to take out de novo review because it ­­ we're talking about an objective standard; it's really almost ­­ it's essentially a question of law.

  "­­ standard that you can deferentially ­­",
  "Well, the ­­ the clear and convincing standard, I don't think is ­­ is ­­ is particularly relevant to the ­­ how this case got decided. Because at the end of the day, it's not because it was clear and convincing. At the end of the day, it was because there was objectively reasonable defenses that were put forward in both of these cases. In a proper case, obviously you ­­ you'd have to fight that fight. The only thing I can say ­­ well, that's not the only thing. There's two things you can say in defense of clear and convincing. First, it was in existence in 1985. Congress passed The America Invents Act, didn't modify it, and so may have, in that sense, either acquiesced or ratified it under those circumstances. And second, we're talking about punitive damages. And therefore, under normal circumstances, it's certainly not a matter of indifference when you're talking about allowing a plaintiff to go forward and ­­ and just skew completely the entire litigation process as a consequence of having access to treble damages. In that context, some heightened standard might make sense. In this context, it's hard for me to get excited about it one way or the other, because these are not really factual questions.

One, you need to have an objective assessment of whether or not there is a reasonably objective set of circumstances that allow the defendant to say this ­­ either these patents are invalid, or we do not infringe those patents. And two, you have to have that reviewed nondeferentially by the Federal Circuit in order to ensure that the 500 or 400 ­­ I forget how many district court judges there are ­­ do not sort of go off on a tangent and ­­ and that we get the consistent review by the objective and expert body that the Federal Circuit is.",

  "Right. Justice Kagan, the ­­ two basic points I would make to that. First of all, the ­­ I don't remember if it's Mr. Jones or Mr. Smith, but the bad actor, we'll call it ­­ the bad actor in that circumstance obviously has to pay the full compensation for the infringement, which is in some instances, tens of millions of dollars, will almost certainly be subject to attorneys' fees under Section 285. So it's not as though you're getting a pass under that ­­ in that situation. Now, I understand the desire to ­­ to have enhanced damages against that particular bad actor. That's why I say in a lot of ways, this case comes down to what do you worry about more, pirates or trolls? My assessment of this, and I think it's borne out by the way the Federal Circuit has looked at this problem, is that there are not that ­­ there are not very many pirates out there. And if you keep a rule that is designed simply to get the one in a million pirates ­­ I would call them unicorns ­­ but one in a million pirates, you'd end up with a rule that will allow the trolls to go after every legitimate producer of products and services in this country. And that's the price you'd have to pay to get at the ­­ at the really bad actor.",
  "Right.",
  "And I think the answer, at the end of the day, is Congress made the choice, I think ­­",
  "No, no. But it did it against the backdrop of the ­­ of the Seagate standard. Because Seagate clearly made a judgment that as between a raft of claims by nonpracticing entities arising out of a raft of letters and everything that goes with that, between that and the risk of a true pirate out there, that Congress ­­ that it thought the better answer clearly was that we should ­­ we should protect and ­­ and limit the ­­ the scope of the patents and make sure that they are being properly challenged in a ­­",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I think the problem with that is ­­ is that it ­­ unless you come up with ­­ I mean, I ­­ you know, recklessness ­­ I ­­ or egregiousness ­­ I don't know what \"egregiousness\" means, and I don't know how you ­­ how you evaluate that on review. I do know what it means to ­­ to take an objectively reasonable position. More than simply something that's beyond frivolous, it is a substantial argument that either the patent doesn't extend to ­­ to my particular product or the patent itself is invalid. And circumstances where ­­ where that is true, my hope would be that the Court, recognizing the extraordinary importance of limiting patents and the monopolies that flow from there, would drive the legal decision in this context ­­ of the legal standard in this context exactly where the ­­ where the Court adopted it in Seagate. That's the court that has the experience and expertise, and I would hope under these circumstances, in this very unusual situation, because patent law in this context I do think is very different than almost any other tort context, I would hope in the one ­­ in the ­­ in the decidedly one­sided approach that 284 is, where it only gives to the plaintiffs the ability to do what they can do and what they want, that the Court would adopt the kind of rigorous objective standard that allows both for the ­­ both for the determination that the ­­ that the patent is invalid or doesn't infringe, and that that's examined on an objective basis. If there are no further questions, Your Honors, I urge the Court to affirm.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Chief Judge Sentelle observed in his dissent below that there are assignments and there are assignments, and that's essentially going to be the theme of my presentation this morning. It is I think common ground between the parties in this litigation that if you have an assignment which represents the grant of the entirety of both the right and the remedy, that is the complete assignment of the chosen action, then under those circumstances there's no question that the assignee has standing under Article III. By parity of receiving, if all that the assignee receives is a power of attorney, a mere collection agency role, under those circumstances I think it's common ground between the parties that Article III is not satisfied. Two of the data points come from --",
  "I think the second part of the common ground is that if all that the assignee receives is the power of attorney, that is to serve as the lawyer for the assignor, under those circumstances the assignee doesn't -- cannot -- has no common stake than I or my clients do in these particular cases, any more than I do in my client's interest in these particular cases, and there I don't think anybody disputes that Article III is not satisfied. Now, the Court in Vermont Agency sort of identified two additional data points. First of all, it made clear that a 10 percent bounty by itself unattached to anything else is not sufficient, largely I think for the same reasons why the lawyer's claim is insufficient, because that's not tied to the particular right at stake and therefore is inadequate to allow Article III to the satisfied. The second half of it is, though, that if that bounty is coupled with an assignment of the rights and even if that's a partial assignment of the rights, then there is Article III jurisdiction under those circumstances.",
  "Well, I'm not sure I'd be satisfied. I think there's a different -- I think the answer is that might satisfy Article III. The only reason I'm reluctant to say that that's the line that ought to be drawn is because this Court's taxpayer standing cases seems to recognize that there are situations where there is a sufficiently de minimis amount of at stake that under those circumstances Article III won't be satisfied. But clearly the cleanest line to draw is in circumstances where have you no stake in the outcome that clearly is beyond what Article III would ultimately do.",
  "But it is a big deal, not necessarily because of the importance of the article. I think the Article III part of it is still a big deal. I think requiring as a separation of powers matter that there has to be a concrete stake in the party bringing the litigation, that's an important principle and the Court shouldn't abandon it, and that's posed directly in this case. But more fundamentally in terms of the importance of the underlying process, remember here we're talking about an assignee who takes on 1400 different assignor claims involving 400,000 pay phones. And that's the problem, is that when you break this down and you allow just simple assignments to satisfy Article III in its prudential standing concerns, then what you end up with is this mass tort litigation.",
  "Well, and I would -- I would still assert those same prudential objections in the hypothetical you pose. What I'm saying is when you -- when you have an assignment and there is a bounty built into it, however you want to define the bounty, whether it's a penny or 10 percent or 2 percent or whatever, that may satisfy Article III. I understand that. That does not answer the question of whether there's prudential standing under those circumstances. In that --",
  "In that context, Justice Ginsburg, you do have the problems. You don't get the discovery. You don't get to use the efficiency of the counterclaim process, and there are serious questions about whether or not there are res judicata and collateral estoppel effects, and I would argue in that context that there's a very significant claim that those proceedings ought not to be entertained by a Federal court as a prudential matter, not as a matter of Article III.",
  "I mean, there is a long tradition of allowing trustees to bring litigation on behalf of the trust because that's the only way that a trust can in fact enforce its rights.",
  "Well, it is a big deal, because trust relationships carry all kinds of additional legal consequences. What is particularly offensive about this arrangement, Your Honors, is that the assignor gets all of the benefits of being able to bring mass tort litigation with none of the responsibilities.",
  "That's true, but there are additional trust responsibilities that would attach to that process. There's an entire legal regime to deal with that.",
  "Well, again, Justice Souter, I think the answer probably is going to depend on how the Court interprets the prudential standing doctrine. Again, I don't have any quarrel as an Article III matter, because I think it's one of those long-held traditions that trustees are allowed to bring litigation on behalf of the trust and that's understood.",
  "Right. I mean, that's where the claims are, sure.",
  "Well, there are two differentiations. One is that there is this entire legal regime that regulates trusts and that has allowed the courts for 200 years, probably longer than that, to be comfortable to allow litigation to proceed in a particular way. But second of all and the second answer to your first question is the prudential concerns remain just, potentially just as serious. I think the question is do you want to create litigation devices that allow the courts to avoid -- to allow lower courts or, more to the point, allow plaintiffs to avoid the requirements either of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 or the associational standing doctrine. Those are doctrines that are designed to limit mass tort litigation in particularized circumstances --",
  "Because they're not a party to the litigation. I mean, you can get discovery --",
  "But, Justice Stevens, if you sue me, you hail me into court, you put me to the burdens of being a defendant in litigation, the least I ought to get out of that is that I can turn to you and ask you to admit certain facts, I can turn to you and ask you to answer certain interrogatories, and I don't have to go chasing you down, because you've already submitted yourself to the personal jurisdiction of that court.",
  "Well, I can serve them on the aggregator, but I cannot serve them on the party who in fact has the relevant information that I need. I have to use third party subpoena power.",
  "I'm sorry, Justice Stevens?",
  "In some instances it might or it might not. The problem is the aggregator has got to get the information.",
  "And that would help on the affirmative case that they have to put together, but it doesn't help with respect to the counterclaims. The Qwest amicus brief does a very nice job of explaining that there are a lot of situations where the -- where the payphone operators are overpaid and it's very difficult -- first of all, and the aggregator has no idea or any incentive to find out any of that, any of that information. And when Qwest made the requests of the aggregator saying, provide me with the information, the brief quotes in a variety of places comments such as, you know, \"whatever the -- our aggregator says is fine with us,\" or \"I don't care about those claims,\" or answers like that, which, if I sue you -- I mean, if you sue me and I ask for those, you cannot give me back those answers.",
  "Right, but if it's a simple assignee for a debt and nothing more than that, just a power of attorney -- or are you talking about a full assignment?",
  "But in no circumstance --",
  "Right, but at least there he is also responsible for both -- he has the entirety of the right. He has the right and the remedy. So that whatever counterclaims you have operate directly against that particular individual. But even in that context, Justice Kennedy, it seems to me there's a fundamental difference, as a matter of prudence, between dealing with a single assignee back and forth and the disputes that arise there and the difficulty of discovery that would exist there, and the situation we have here where you have 1400 payphone operators --",
  "But, Justice --",
  "Well, there are two elements of the standing problem: The first one is we're all -- let's be clear -- we're talking about a hypothetical that's different from this case because we're talking about a hypothetical where in fact the assignee has a concrete interest in the outcome of this dispute. Here the assignee has no interest in the outcome of this dispute. So the Article III problem arises there. The question is if you have a minor amount at interest, even if it's, you know, concrete but nevertheless approaches de minimis, should you nevertheless entertain that case. And I think the answer to your question, Justice Breyer, is that instead of making this into a Federal court case, where you have 1400 claims like this, what the Court should say is that the better course to follow is in fact for the plaintiffs to take their claims, if they want to, in an aggregate form to the FCC because that's the right institution to deal with it because it doesn't have the limitations of Article III and it doesn't have the limitations of prudential standing to interfere with its ability to provide complete relief. And, indeed, if you read the Respondents' brief, they identify, as the prototype litigation, in which this entire system worked effectively, a claim that was in fact litigated in front of the Federal Communications Commission, not a case that was litigated in front of the Federal court. So, to my mind, the right answer to this case is to take these cases all to the FCC, not as a matter of what we do as primary jurisdiction, but simply as what the plaintiffs do because they don't have the vehicle to bring this to the Federal courts.",
  "Well, I think when the Court is considering the questions of prudence, you know, it can certainly take it into account, and maybe that would argue in the alternative in another case if there weren't such an available vehicle that the Court might be more inclined to entertain it under those circumstances.",
  "I mean, Justice Ginsburg, that is Spiller. That's what the Court said in Spiller, and I think it's a logical outgrowth of what the Court held in ASARCO, which is that, even though a claim doesn't start with Article III jurisdiction because it's not an Article III entity, that when a final determination comes out of that entity that is in fact enforceable as a right that that right is enforceable consistent with Article III notions. And that's true. That is what the Court essentially, without dealing with Article III at all, said in Spiller, and that's clearly what the Court held in ASARCO.",
  "From my perspective or from the plaintiffs' perspective.",
  "Because the -- the plaintiffs here, the payphone operators, get a free pass in this proceeding. They get all of the benefits of being able to go to Federal court and bring litigation with none of the burdens of having to deal with discovery or cross-claims or counterclaims or even necessarily being bound by doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel. So you get all the benefits and none of the disadvantages. That's why it's an advantage for them to go to Federal court.",
  "When --",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I don't know --",
  "Right. Well, I mean, the real question is I don't know why that case is necessarily in Federal court either. I mean, a lot of that --",
  "Right, but most of that's litigated in State courts, in which case there's no serious problem --",
  "Certainly.",
  "No, I don't think so.",
  "I think those exact problems would arise in that context as well. On the other hand, that's a situation that seems to me is largely driven by the exigencies and by accident in Federal court. This is situation that is driven into Federal court by the plaintiffs' choice and by the ability and the preference to be in a position to get the benefits of litigation in Federal court without any of the detriments that might otherwise arise in that context.",
  "I guess I would encourage you to ask counsel on the other side, because personally I would think that they would have a full and fair remedy --",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "I don't know -- well, other than the ones I've already articulated, where I think they get some advantages of being in a Federal court and have --",
  "Well, and that may well be his answer.",
  "Right, there is Article III.",
  "Right. And let's not lose sight of that core question --",
  "Well, that may or may not have happen. But let's be clear, okay. The core question here is whether or not an aggregator who has no claim, who has no stake at all, not a penny's worth, can pursue this litigation. On that it seems to me the answer got -- should be no. There's no benefit to it. The concrete stake is a core requirement of Article III and the Court ought to enforce it as a separation of powers question. The issue that we've been discussing here is what do you do when you get past that, and when you have a kind of a bounty that's been attached to it, and how do you resolve that? In that situation, which is not this case, I still think that there would be grounds for prudential standing to serve as a basis to eliminate this kind of litigation. On the other hand, it may well --",
  "I am sorry, Your Honor.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I mean, the price you pay -- bless you -- is that when you bring Federal court litigation -- is that you have to have -- you have to expose yourself to exactly the burdens that come with it.",
  "Right. Federal courts clearly have an interest in that.",
  "They can join in a single complaint. You know, the court can consider whether or not it thinks joinder is appropriate under those circumstances, but they could unquestionably do that. But then, again, they are then at that point a plaintiff in the litigation having brought this action and, therefore, subject to all of the burdens of being a plaintiff in the litigation, including submitting themselves to the personal jurisdiction of the court. I mean, let's be clear about this. There are 1400 names out of people all over the country that under the -- under the plaintiffs aggregators' theory we have to go chase down in order to obtain discovery, to obtain any of our counterclaims or anything like that. Whereas if they come into this Court and they submit themselves to the jurisdiction, at least the process works as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure --",
  "Well, I don't doubt that the trial court can do that, but the question is: Why do we have to go to the burden of having to chase all of that in the first instance? I mean, the Respondent's brief at page 10 criticizes us for not having brought 1400 third-party complaints, not having sought additional discovery. All of those are burdens that simply arise in this context that otherwise do not exist in an ordinary case where you simply ask the party who has the actual claim to be the plaintiff in front of the court. And that's -- and, again, just to be clear, we are still here dealing with the hypothetical. We're not dealing with the core question of what do you do with a plaintiff who has not one penny at stake in litigation that, as the lawyers describe, is all hard cash.",
  "I think the answer to that is that when you -- when you deal with mass tort litigation, the Rules of Civil Procedure ought to apply in that context as it applies in every other place. And when the courts deviate from the standard paradigm for litigation, they do it expressly, either through the rules or through doctrines that already exist. And so we have Rule 23, which sets out very clear protections for both the courts -- or not only for the courts, but for the plaintiffs and for the absent defendants -- absent, absent plaintiffs and for the defendants, and is a clear mechanism for conducting 1400 claims all once in a particular situation.",
  "It goes directly --",
  "No, to be sure. Again, I don't think that -- I mean, the Article III debate here seems to me to turn solely on the question of there is no stake in the outcome of this case. That's a bedrock requirement of Article III and ought to be a basis for simply reversing. But, you know, to the extent that the Court then goes beyond that and worries about what's the next case going to look like and what are the prudential limitations, which I don't think the Court has to resolve any of this, what I would suggest is the Court should be informed by Rule 23 and associational standing and those doctrines --",
  "I think that's the right answer, is that the Court shouldn't just make it up as it goes along. And if there is a need for this -- look, and the truth is we've been here 200 years. We haven't had to have aggregator standing all of this time. It strikes me that there's no compelling need for a change and that for that reason the Court ought to go back to the paradigm example, plaintiffs sue defendants and you have normal discovery and counterclaims.",
  "That -- I mean the proceeds -- I assume -- do those claims arise out of the relationship between the payphone operators and the aggregator?",
  "It's completely unrelated to that? It's just a garnishment on it?",
  "I assume those moneys could be taken out of the aggregator and then the PSP would have a claim over against the aggregator for breach of contract. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The specific protection is that the courts determine how the settlements will play out. They make sure that all of the requirements of Rule 23 are satisfied before the litigation goes forward. That means that there is a demonstration of commonality, that there -- the predominance issue is resolved, that this is a matter that should be litigated in this forum because it is a more efficient mechanism for litigating it, not because the assignor -- assignee decided that this is more efficient way from the assignee's perspective --",
  "-- to litigate the issue.",
  "Yes, of course, because you don't want to have all this litigation being heaped on a particular defendant under these circumstances. There is an efficiency to this process that the rules anticipate. And I think you're absolutely right, Justice Kennedy. There is simply no reason in the world to say we're going to allow this to be as a substitute for existing doctrines under either Rule 23 --",
  "-- or associational standing.",
  "To be sure, and my answer is --",
  "Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg. We would oppose it. I don't think that this is a proper case for class certification. But it seems to me that that doesn't mean okay, and, therefore, the answer to this is: Come up with some other contrivance in order to litigate this in a way that obviously maximizes the convenience to one side without regard to the protections that are designed both for the defendant and for the court that's embodied in Rule 23.",
  "Well, it's interesting because they -- in one -- in the assignment part of it they say they are bound, but on the -- on the separate set of the agreement it talks about the reasonable discretion of the assignor -- assignee. So the agreement is, to my mind, inherently contradictory as to what are the obligations.",
  "Well, if it's reasonable -- it says reasonable discretion. And so the question is, you know, is this -- was that an exercise of reasonable discretion? And I don't know the answer to that in any given case. And I think part of the -- Justice Kennedy and Justice Breyer, you asked the question about above and beyond discovery, what are the other problems that arise when you go down this -- and the more -- the other one is that being bound by the judgment. If you have a complete assignment of the chosen action, the assignee, then, is completely bound. There is nothing left. The assignor has no rights left. There is nothing left for the assignor to do in that situation; whereas, in these kinds of situations where the assignee receives the right to go forward but the remedy is in another party's hands, the potential for being bound is completely lost."
