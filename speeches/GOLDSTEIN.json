  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I will turn quickly to the mistaken notion that the Washington statute at issue in this case conflicts with ERISA, but I want to explain from the outset exactly what this statute does and why it does it. Washington, like a number of States, as a number of the questions have reflected, recognizes the unsurprising proposition and, Justice Scalia, it is recognized by an increasing number of States very rapidly, that when two people divorce they try to give each other less money, not more. Particularly relevant here, the designation of one spouse as a death beneficiary, whether in a will, and there are will statutes in 49 out of the 50 States, or in some other asset, is premised on the idea that at the time of death the couple will still be married. Applied to this case, and I think it very important that we talk about the facts of this case, the statute rests on the idea that when petitioner sought and received a divorce from David Egelhoff, and after they entered a very detailed divorce decree, to the level of, he got the tan area rug and she got the Exercycle, that he did not walk out of the courthouse thinking, oh, and I want her to get the pension and the life insurance, too.",
  "That is --",
  "Fortunately --",
  "With respect, we can here for two reasons. First, the divorce decree itself explicitly says that he gets the pension. It says so, and there's no doubt that that was the parties' intent. And second, there is a declaration uncontradicted in the record that she basically went around telling people that David would roll over in his grave at the notion that she was going to get this money.",
  "With respect, in terms of just what the parties understood would happen to the money, and in particular, Justice Scalia, what Donna's expectation was, he got the pension benefits. The death benefit is the entirety of the pension benefit, and she could not have an expectation that she would ever get the money, because she knows that he could change it the next day. Moreover, this is a community property State. They had to divide up the marital property, which included the value of the pension at the time of divorce, and she had to get equivalent assets at the time of divorce. This is nothing more than a double recovery in the purest sense.",
  "It is relevant in the sense -- in two senses, Justice Souter. The first is that I'm trying to explain to you the rationale and why it is so rational that Washington did what it did, and second, it goes to the question now speaking to the statute, what the standard is for finding a conflict and finding preemption, and that is that in this area, from cases like Hisquidero on, there must be a clear and manifest conflict. And now let me turn directly to the notion of whether or not there is a conflict.",
  "There are 20 States that have the statute now -- the number has been growing rapidly -- with respect to nonprobate assets. It was --",
  "They do not.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Yes.",
  "They do not --",
  "They do not all say that, but almost all do, because that's in the UPC.",
  "The majority do.",
  "Yes.",
  "Justice Breyer has helpfully just identified three different opt-out provisions that go directly to the question of whether or not there's an actual burden on the plan. Chief Justice Rehnquist --",
  "The courts --",
  "It is a principal criterion. Whether or not there's an --",
  "We do not believe so, and Boggs is an example, that the Court did not reach the question. Four justices of the Court in Justice Breyer's opinion explained that there really wasn't a burden and there wasn't field preemption. The majority said there is conflict preemption here, but it is worth noting that Justice Kennedy's opinion in that case did explain why there would be real administrative trouble if you recognized nonparticipant interest. Chief Justice Rehnquist -- so if I could continue for the moment to focus on the practicalities of what happens to an ERISA plan, turn to the specific alleged conflicts with the statute in just a moment. Chief Justice Rehnquist, you asked how this worked in operation, and I'd like to refer to you -- refer you to the respondent's lodging for a moment. Respondent's lodging at tab 3 has the designation form for the life insurance plan, and it explains that David Egelhoff designated Donna R. Egelhoff, wife -- I apologize. There may be some confusion. This is an 8-1/2 X 11 lodging that may not have come upstairs.",
  "I'm starting at tab 3, Justice Kennedy.",
  "Yes.",
  "That is correct, Justice O'Connor.",
  "We conferred with the Clerk's Office and received permission to file a lodging. Let me explain also that these are materials -- it's particularly important, because this is not something that translates at all well into --",
  "That point is well-taken, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me just specify for the benefit of the Court that the documents that I am about to refer to are part of the record. I understand the point is well-taken that counsel are much preferred at the beginning of the case within the joint appendix to have one consolidated document. It is the case, however, that as the case moves along, for example, after we received the petitioner's brief, other documents become relevant that we want to bring to the Court's attention.",
  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and so let me just be absolutely clear these are not pedagogical devices, anything outside the record. The two documents I'm going to take you now are in the record of the case. Tab 3 is the designation form, and it says that David designated Donna R. Egelhoff, wife. The reason I point to it is that when the administrator receives a claim for death benefits it's common ground that he or she pulls out the designation form. Before paying the benefits, he or she must get the death certificate. We have to be sure that the person is dead. That's common sense. On the death certificate it explains that David Egelhoff died, and on line 14 -- or, excuse me, in cell 14, three lines down, it explains that he was divorced, and that is the sum total of the administrative burden that is put on ERISA plan administrators. They look at the exact same documents.",
  "So far -- I will not represent to the Court that I have been able to identify every State, but I have not been able to find one that hasn't. There was no easy way of identifying every State's death certificate, but yes, because they have to notify next-of-kin, and remember as well, Justice Scalia, that when you try to pay on death the survivor annuity required by ERISA you must make the same inquiry. You have to know if the participant was married at the time of death, and so --",
  "The question for the survivor annuity, Justice Ginsburg, is, at the time of death was the person married. That -- and if so, there must be a mandatory --",
  "Exactly. There are two lines in the death certificate. One is married or divorced and the second is, there is, in fact, a surviving spouse, so -- Now, a number of the questions have focused on whether or not there is a conflict with the terms of ERISA. Justice Scalia, you pointed out that it may well be that there would be preemption even if there was no additional burden. This is -- Congress said, this is how it's going to work. Washington can't say anything different. Justice Souter, earlier you inquired similarly whether or not there might not be conflict preemption, because the statute mandates that you have to pay the benefits to the named beneficiary. The difficulty is that the statute does not say that. The only claimed conflict here is with the term, beneficiary, and with the --",
  "That occurs, with all due respect to my colleagues, because in their briefs there is an ellipsis of an important phrase, and the definition of a beneficiary is -- and I'm going to now refer to 29 U.S.C. 1002 sub (8).",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, it is at the appendix to the petitioner's brief at page 2, and I -- when I refer to statutory section, from henceforth it will always be in that brief.",
  "Yes, Justice Scalia. This is 1002, sub (8). The term, beneficiary, means a person designated by a participant or by the terms of an employee benefit plan who is or may become entitled to a benefit thereunder, and let me explain how Washington law operates here. Washington law at the time of divorce does not say, if you divorce you are no longer a beneficiary, the money instead goes to the children. It instead says that the designation is ineffective and it is up to the terms of the plan to determine who gets the money, and that's exactly what the children were here. They were persons who may become entitled to a benefit thereunder. They have always been, because the plan specified.",
  "I understand. I have both points firmly in mind. The first, Washington law does not say that the children become entitled because of the statute. All that Washington law says is that the designation -- it reflects, again, the common-sense understanding that the meaning of the designation -- I mean, it's fairly obvious here, when it says Donna R. Egelhoff, wife, but --",
  "Becomes disentitled, and then --",
  "No, Justice Souter.",
  "No. The actual conflict, to make it even more specific, the conflict would have to go, if petitioner's position were accepted, ERISA says, pay the beneficiary, which is correct, absent this special --",
  "Well, then we come to your second point, because we have, or may become, because it doesn't say the person who is entitled to receive by that -- under the designation or under the plan. It's, who may become. I agree with you that that is intended to trigger contingent beneficiaries. Our point is that the children are as much contingent beneficiaries in the meaning of that term as is the participant, because --",
  "Well, we are looking --",
  "I will give you an interpretive aid in trying to decide what it means to be, or may become, and that is that it can't be the case that the children -- let me take you to Boggs. Justice Kennedy's opinion for the Court in Boggs explained that there are a class of people that ERISA is intended to protect, participants and beneficiaries. Our position is, is that before the death of David, and before the administrator looked at the alternate beneficiary provisions, the children were protected by ERISA. They were in the class of people who could bring an action and say, look, you're misadministering plan assets, just as much as Donna could. They are within the class of people that ERISA intended to protect, and so if you are going to call them not beneficiaries, they are excluded from the rest of the statute entirely and they receive none of the protections. Our understanding is that if Congress wanted to say -- use more limited language than or may become, it could have. It could have said --",
  "No, but the first class, the group of people who are protected by the statute, are denominated in the statute as beneficiaries.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, there are many times when an ERISA plan pays benefits to someone other than a named beneficiary, so we're going to have to find the conflict somewhere else. ERISA plans pay benefits out under the spousal annuity. ERISA plans pay ERISA benefits out under the QDRO provisions. It is many times not the case that they pay it out directly to the person whose name is on it. In fact, the plan here reserves the right to determine that the individual named is incompetent, and not to pay them then, either.",
  "Let me deal with what I take to be the premise of your point, which is that a conflict with the terms of the plan would be sufficient to cause preemption, if the plan said, you can't do this, and second -- so I'll return to that in just a moment, whether or not that would be sufficient to cause ERISA preemption, but let me deal with it on the facts of this case, and it is important to return to the text of the statute again. With the stroke of a pen, you can write into any nonprobate asset, including an ERISA plan, divorce revocation statutes do not apply. Justice Ginsburg, you asked the petitioner's lawyer, wouldn't there also be the problem you wouldn't know which State law applies. The Attorney General of Washington in her brief at footnote 6 has explained under this statute, you don't have to say, Revised Code 1107010 doesn't apply, Alabama Code, da-da-da. It is, you just say, divorce revocation statutes don't apply. An earlier question also said, and --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, it would in one sense and potentially not in another. The Court is asked to pass on a particular statute with three safe harbors that Justice Breyer has identified. I'm not representing to you that the same rationale would save all of them. I think, though, your point goes more particularly to what does the administrator do in a conflict of laws problem? There's the hypothetical, for example, that someone's from Oregon, someone from Washington, someone from Texas. The plan operates in a multi-State arena. There are two important points. The first is that there is the safe harbor both under the text of ERISA and under this plan -- under this statute, that says, if you have any doubt, don't pay. You don't have to go to court. Just don't do it. Just send a letter to the people who want the money and say to them, come back to us when you have figured it out or a court has told you what to do. And so in terms of getting to the practicalities, Justice Ginsburg, of how is this going to work for administrators --",
  "Justice Scalia, it is frequently the case, in fact, that ERISA plans have some doubt. The Court discussed probably the most obvious cases, slayer statutes, simultaneous death happens actually not infrequently, but there are lots of times -- Justice Stevens, the middle name of all the children is Joseph. There are many times when you don't pay immediately. ERISA provides in its enforcement section, and the circuits uniformly agree, that what the plan should do there is simply put the money aside and wait for the claiming participants to fight it out.",
  "Does -- ERISA does not.",
  "That's correct.",
  "There are many times this happens.",
  "Those --",
  "No, and it is important to understand in terms of what the court is opening the doors to, that the States have been regulating this area for centuries, and that is the -- you know, this is in the area of divorce. There are normal probate areas that they have limited themselves, and if I could just mention one point --",
  "I understand.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's exactly right, because that's a prohibited alienation. That's Boggs, and let me explain why this is not. Congress provided that there are certain people, participants and their beneficiaries, when it's a spousal annuity, who have an expectation that they are going to live off pension benefits, and it specified when an alienation would occur. This is not a situation where the money is taken away from the participant or anyone else who has a mandated right to it and give -- and let me take you to the definition. The alienation definition is not reprinted in the appendix to any brief -- I apologize -- but I will simply read it to you. Well, the statute is, and that is at the appendix to petitioner's brief at page 4, and it simply says, not very helpfully, each pension plan shall provide the benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated. Justice Kennedy's opinion in Boggs looks to the IRS's definition and I will read it to you. This for the record is at 26 C.F.R. section 1.401A-(13)(c)(i) -- (ii). The terms, assignment and alienation, include any direct or indirect arrangement, whether revocable or irrevocable whereby a party acquires from a participant or beneficiary a right or interest enforceable against a plan in or to any or all of the plan benefit payment.",
  "We agree. It's not an alienation. That's our point, and that's the difference from the hypothetical you asked. If there was a divorce decree that said, look -- if the divorce decree here said, Donna Egelhoff is going to get 100 percent of David's pension, if that is not, Justice O'Connor, registered as a QDRO that's an alienation. You can't do it. Now, the petitioner --",
  "Because it takes it from David and gives it to Donna.",
  "I apologize, Justice Scalia. I was focusing on the take it from the person to another. You were focusing on the operation of law. I actually agree with your interpretation of operation of law. Unfortunately, I think it's precluded by Boggs. That was State community property law. I think Justice Breyer might -- some might think he had the better of that argument. That is water under the bridge, and that was community property law.",
  "Remember, the second wife, community property law, took it. She -- the community property law is what gave it to her. So what I'm focusing on, though, is that this does not take it from somebody and give it to somebody else. Now, there was the question put before, well, should this have been a QDRO, and there is the negative inference suggested by petitioner that Congress occupied this field, that really these sorts of things are supposed to be done by QDRO's, and I will explain to you why that's not so. Washington law doesn't intend to say that the kids will get the money. That's the whole point, that the plan will decide who gets the money. Washington law wants David, after the divorce, to decide who will get it. Say there's a third wife. David -- say he's a serial marrier. If there's a third wife, David wants to be able to name her. If there's a QDRO, he can't. If the divorce decree said, the money goes to the kids, he's out of luck. That's a registered decree under Washington State law. All Washington is trying to do here is say, look, when you divorce, the intent is that the spouse, your ex-spouse isn't going to get the money. Go fix the problem some other way, and it says to the plans, or any other nonprobate asset, you don't want to comply, say you're not going to comply. You have any doubts, don't comply. And it says to the participant himself, if you don't want this to be the rule, just say so, either in the divorce decree or even in your designation. There really is nothing going on here that Congress didn't want to happen. There's nobody -- unlike Boggs, where we had the actual spouse who was going to get the spousal annuity, or we had the pension benefits after death in the hands at least of the estate of the pensioner, none of that applies here. We're in a situation where Congress left it up to anybody to name a designee, and unless there's some real practical problem for the ERISA plan, unless something's -- it's just not workable, I could understand a reason to preempt it. But when you're going to take away simultaneous death, slayer statutes -- in the footnote in which they address the issue in their reply brief, petitioner says, Justice Scalia, that it preempts state law definitions of what it is to die, who's a spouse, what's a child, common law issues frequently regulated by the States. I should make one final point, and that is that there is at the very least one alternative narrow holding that I don't understand the answer to for this Court, and that is that we sued petitioner under a provision of State law that lets us just sue her, and if the problem is the practical administration of this rule, that it will cause a burden for ERISA plans, the rule at the least ought to be that that's not preempted. It's a State law conversion suit. We can go after her for the money.",
  "Two points. The first is that, of course, it doesn't operate in such a fashion if there's any contrary expression of intent by any of the parties, be it the plan or the participant. The second is that I do think in these ERISA cases we get the unfortunate sense that this statute is about ERISA plans, and it's not. There's a separate statute, of course, that deals with every form of will. This statute deals with every conceivable form of nonprobate asset. It's really important under State law. Most of the money that is held by individuals now is either in your home or in a life insurance plan or in a pension, whether qualified or not, and you get the situation that you have here, and that is that Donna Egelhoff already got equivalent assets. She's going to come along and recover again. The children are going to be completely out of luck for no sensible purpose at all. If there are no further questions --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Even if the petitioners are correct that the wire tap acts redisclosure prohibition and that's what I'll call it, it's the second, third, fourth person to receive it, even if that prohibition, prophylactically adds some deterrent, as Justice Scalia and the Chief Justice have suggested, and Justice Breyer's concern about privacy identifies, even if it does add some deterrent, that prohibition is too crude a weapon, effectively a thermonuclear bomb of sorts to be sustained in the sensitive area of not property but free speech. It therefore should be invalidated at least under intermediate scrutiny.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, we believe that the solution adopted by the Third Circuit, the narrow approach it took is the one that is appropriate under intermediate scrutiny and that is it left in place by and large the redisclosure prohibition but recognized that when the final disclosure is on a question of public significance, and is by a person completely uninvolved in the illegal interception, then the speech rights outweigh. So when you have only the circumstance where you have speech on a matter of public significance, not just what was happening on the phone, someone came in and just overheard my conversation in my bedroom, they adopted a line -- this a -- a principle that exists in lots of this Court's cases, including in the defamation context, in Pickering balancing, when you're speaking on a matter of public importance, that's when the First Amendment interests are at their highest.",
  "It is a matter of public interest. This Court --",
  "The Court has --",
  "No, because it hasn't been presented, Mr. Chief Justice and I would --",
  "Yes. Mr. Chief Justice, in three lines of cases, the Court has taken -- has drawn the line at public significance and I will identify them specifically. Defamation and libel, the Hustler Magazine case, the Philadelphia Newspaper v. Hepps case and Dun & Bradstreet all turn on whether or not the speech in question is on an issue of public significance. The same is true in the Pickering balancing cases, including particularly the Court's opinion in United States v. National Treasury Employee's Union which, too, was a content-neutral statute. But I need to return to what else we would say, what other strictures we would put on the statute in order to permit it to survive intermediate scrutiny and still fulfill what we agree is an important governmental interest and that is that no one wants people tapping phones and breaking into homes. The difficulty here is that there are a number of respects in which the statute is not tailored whatsoever. And so I want to get to Justice Stevens' point that really this does get to the heart of the matter. The real problem is that this is not a case like the Daily Mail case where it is a one-to-one trade off, we're going to reduce some speech in order to further some other interest. We have here a statute that is so broad that much speech that the Government has no interest or actual intent to stop from being published will in fact be published. The different -- I will identify five distinctions. The first is that it applies equally and I mean all the way down the line in terms of punishment whether or not you can put someone in jail, identical fines to the newspaper that is the 10th party down the line to receive the information as to the intercepting.",
  "That argument is not inconsistent with what I have just said. I will explain why.",
  "The radio station here played the tape in this area of northeastern Pennsylvania, Mr. Chief Justice, the New York Times comes along and listens and says oh, my goodness, look what happened here. They then publish it nationally. Under the Soliciter General's interpretation, that is a violation of the statute because it wasn't known to the people in California.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm in the difficult position that this argument is made in one sentence in the Government's reply brief and so this is my understanding.",
  "Exactly. And as ridiculous as that sounds --",
  "And I -- I agree with you that it's ridiculous but it is what the statute says and it's completely consonant with what Congress was apparently attempting to do here. If you look through the petitioner's brief, time and again, they say each time it gets out it's like a hundred thousand people intercepting the communication.",
  "The plain text of the statute uses a much broader term than is suggested by the Solicitor General and let me continue with the other four problems with tailoring. The second is that it applies to any piece of information about the conversation, not merely the tape. The fact that, and Justice -- there was a question about talking to my neighbor. In this context if you receive innocently a tape recording and merely mention the fact that you have -- you know that there was a tape recording of the conversation, it applies equally because the definition of content is so broad. It's literally any datum about the conversation. The third is that it imposes civil and criminal liability and permits the commencement of litigation even when there has been no injury at all. And the plaintiffs in this case disavowed any claim that they had been actually been hurt. The fourth is that it applies equally no matter whether the information and indeed the conversation in question was even private. And this was Justice O'Connor's first question is that the information that was spoken and was heard and intercepted could have been a completely public fact but the fact that it was said in a conversation would be disclosed, and fifth and this one is the particularly troubling one that I began with, it applies even when the information is of vital public significance. Now, the reason I mentioned these five is that you have to look at someone who is in the position of receiving a piece of information and there is the grave concern that when you get a piece of information notwithstanding the reason to know limitation which is what the Solicitor General points had to saving the statute, you had real doubts about the provenance of information. Because of the great breath of the statute, it's unlike Daily Mail and it's unlike Florida Star. You've got a rape victim's name and you know okay that's prohibited. I'm not going to say that if I followed the statute and its constitutional --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, if that's the case then I don't think that we have a problem. If you are going to have a situation where you attempt to discern the provenance of information, this case -- this statute operates only in the circumstance where the newspaper doesn't know the intercepting party. If the newspaper knows the intercepting party then the statute operates because the newspaper will be subpoenaed and will have to testify about who gave them the interception and that person will be prosecuted. In the situation where you don't know and if the Court's point is that look, it simply won't be published in that instance we don't have a problem because the broader disclosure won't happen.",
  "Let me begin by stepping back to the variant on that question that you asked my colleague. And I do want to specify, that when it comes to things like diaries, the intellectual property laws still apply fully in the same way they did in Cowles, those sorts of copyright laws, and we don't doubt that if it's a diary and it's something that is your personal information, you have written it down, that you can claim that you have stolen something like intellectual property. Your version to me was, can't we try hard to reduce the incentives, and I think Congress is doing that here. There is no record that suggests there is a real problem, but I think we all agree intuitively, it will reduce somewhat the incentive to engage in the interception. Our problem is that it's a purely prophylactic ban on someone and could result in massive punitive damages or jail time on someone who hasn't engaged in the primary wrongdoing. Where the prophylaxis has broken down, my client has no idea who gave him this piece of information. He has it. It's of public significance. It's a legitimate threat on page.",
  "It was an obviously -- it was obviously recorded and very likely recorded by someone who wasn't a party to it.",
  "Because he is not engaged in anything that anyone believes is wrong. He has information, a legitimate threat. The court of appeals, Justice Scalia, on page 26-A of the petition appendix explains that this is not just an idle threat. He says really, truthfully, we're going to have to do some work on these people, blow off --",
  "With respect, that is not correct, particularly as to my client. Independently after receiving it, within a day, he published it, disclosed it in the sense of the statute by giving it to the radio station and notifying the people who were the subject.",
  "He did.",
  "I think that there is something to be said of warning the public. But I agree --",
  "When he gave it to the radio station, yes, we were.",
  "That is correct. Our point is that when you have a piece of information and the prophylactic goals of the statute have broken down and it is a matter of public significance, you are not involved in anything that Congress attempted to stop. It is speech of the highest interest. When you have a limited holding like the third circuit did here under intermediate scrutiny, if it is only speech on matters of public significance and by someone who had nothing to do with the interception, has no idea who was, that speech is protected.",
  "Has reason to know.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Justice Souter, if I said this wasn't what Congress was trying to do, I misspoke.",
  "We agreed that that was Congress' goal. Our point in that respect is twofold, is that neither the Congress nor the plaintiffs or the Government have attempted to develop any record that that was a series problem. And second is that --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, they had the opportunity to develop a record in this case and the other two cases that have come before you, that are the Peavey case and the Baynor case have gone through the courts and no one has suggested that they are going to develop any kind of record.",
  "They did not attempt in this case to put forward any record regarding the efficacy of the statute.",
  "I think maybe you I, Justice Ginsburg, are speaking about two slightly different things. The first is a point you identified to my colleague before which is, is it really difficult to identify people and stop them when they are doing these kinds of interceptions. I think this Court can assume that to be the case. The point that I am making is that Congress when it legislated here did not operate on an understanding or any evidence that there was a problem.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: This is a case about the right to take an appeal. Over Petitioner's objections, the district court confirmed a class action settlement that substantially reduces Petitioner's individual pension. The Fourth Circuit held that Petitioner nonetheless may not appeal to argue that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting his objections. Our principal submission is that, as Justice Kennedy explained in oral argument in the Felzen case, Rule 23 class members such as Petitioner are bound by the district court's judgment and thus are parties to that judgment with the right to appeal from it. Because the Government, although seated at the opposite side of the table, actually agrees with us that class members are bound by the judgment, that objector appeals identify important legal errors, and that they also deter collusive settlements, I will leave to the Solicitor General's representative any arguments to the contrary that my friend Mr. Gold may make.",
  "Justice Scalia, I think it depends on what we mean by bound. There are different, more expansive notions of collateral estoppel and res judicata. What I'm talking about here is that the judgment operates directly upon the class member. And let me be clear that our position is not to move beyond that. Our position is not that it's sufficient to be a party, but that it is a necessary condition. It is also necessary, and this is an important point for the distinction between appealing from an approved settlement and for appealing a litigated judgment.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, the difference is that while you can have an application of collateral estoppel or res judicata that extinguishes a right to pursue an action, what I'm talking about here and let me put it in very practical terms. The Petitioner had a pension and that pension went down 40 percent when the district court in this case approved a settlement that said the COLA provisions of the pension plan are null and void, and that's the kind of direct operation I'm talking about. Now, there is an unsettled area of the law stretching to precedents dating from the 1850s, the so-called quasi-party cases. We don't think it's necessary to apply those here because unlike a Rule 23.1 class member in the context of a derivative action, we are directly bound by the action. We are not talking about extinguishing a right of ours, for example, to sue on behalf of a corporation.",
  "Well, that's a good entry into the purpose and function of Rule 23(e). What happens is that at the point that it's acknowledged by the Respondents here that at the point settlement is agreed to, the class representative and be opposing named parties joined forces to oppose objections, and that continued at the stage of the case where you have to decide whether or not to take an appeal.",
  "23(e).",
  "That would be in the appendix of the Council of Institutional Investors, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "No, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "(A)(4) of the appendix to that brief.",
  "And I'll read it very briefly for the Court's benefit. A class action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of the class in such manner as the court directs. Now, let me detour for just a moment. The Court will notice it noticed in the Felzen case that this rule doesn't actually explicitly provide for objections. The advisory committee notes make clear that that was the intent of this provision, and in fact amended Rule 23(e) which will go into effect next year explicitly provides for the right to state objections. To return to Justice Ginsburg's question, what happens is that this rule recognizes that the class representative is not speaking on behalf of the objectors at the point an objection is taken. They in fact litigate actively for the settlement. Mr. Gold here is on behalf of the class representative in this case and goodness knows, he will argue that we have no right to take an appeal. The rule, 23(e), provides an opportunity for us to come in, advise the district court of a problem with the settlement. Our point is that nothing in these rules contemplates that the objector's role would be extinguished at the district court, that someone uniquely in the context of a class action, who is bound directly by the judgment and participates as of right in the district court, would only participate at the district court.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, we say we do not have to do that, that there is nothing about this Court's precedents --",
  "Well, let me, there are two parts to the question. The first is, is it open under the rules and second, why wouldn't it be a good idea to adopt it if it were? As to the first, it is not open under the rules, and let me take you again to the particular rule in question. That would be, it's suggested, rule 23(d)(2), and this rule says that the district court may in appropriate circumstances --",
  "I'm going to read from (a)(3) in the carryover to (a)(4) of the same appendix of the Council --",
  "At the bottom of the page D, orders and conduct of actions. Your Honors, it says in the conduct of actions to which this rule applies, the court may make appropriate orders and then I'm going to jump to 2. This is the suggestion of the other side: requiring for the protection of the members of a class or otherwise for fair conduct of the action that notice be given. So there is a suggestion, where it follows, notice be given, and then there is a class that says -- I'll just continue to read it: In such matters the court may direct to some or all members, of any step in the action or of the proposed extent of the judgment, or of -- and this becomes critical -- the opportunity of members to signify whether they consider the representation fair and adequate. And then the clause: to intervene and present claims or defenses or otherwise come into the action. Our point is as follows, or is several fold. The first is that this is a different notice from the 23(e) notice. This is a discretionary notice that courts can employ in some cases, and I think it deserves to be emphasized that in the 35 years since 1966, not a single court has read this provision in the way that's suggested by the other side, that it's mandatory that there be an intervention for a screening function. The particular reason is that this (d)(2) notice refers to intervening to present claims or defenses, and that the not what an objector seeks to do. An objector says there is a settlement on the table, I have a legal objection to it, it's either unlawful, as in Amchem, or it's unfair as in this case, and so it's a different kind of intervention. So I don't think it's open and no court has ever suggested that it's how the rule should be interpreted. Now, assume the Court disagrees with me, Justice Breyer, why isn't it a good idea? It doesn't accomplish anything. What happens is this. You move to intervene, the intervention motion is denied, so you appeal that, so you haven't really gained anything. What you have done is turn the objection into the application of the abuse of discretion standard. You just added another layer on top of it because then the court of appeals has to decide well, did the judge get the intervention motion wrong? If that was an abuse of discretion, then we'll reach the merits.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, then you haven't accomplished anything either. All you have done is permitted an appeal that under our theory would be permitted anyway.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. I had taken an implicit premise to Justice Breyer's question that I'll come back to. This case will illustrate your point, Justice Ginsburg. In this case, we objected to the settlement. We moved to intervene. That intervention was denied. It is perfectly clear that if that intervention is properly denied, and as to our attempt to come in and take discovery, disqualify class counsel, that's not within the question presented. It's not here at the court. We would not have that power as an objector. As an objector, we have only the right to pursue our individual objections, which is the distinction I take it you are drawing. Justice Breyer, I took the implicit premise of his question to be well, why don't we intervene for that limited purpose? And that's I think what I took Justice Breyer to be getting at. He is saying what's the big deal. Can't the district judge maybe help us out in some cases where we might have a lot of different objectors and give you a limited intervention right. That is akin to the rule that is applied by the Seventh Circuit, and that is preserved by the question presented within the petition. Now, the Government adds a patina on top of that that Justice Breyer referred to, and that is don't merely have pro forma intervention, but allow the district judge to actually do something and screen out the people we don't want appealing. So I came back to Justice Breyer and I said I don't think it will actually --",
  "Justice Breyer, let me draw a distinction. My point is not that in an extraordinary case, that a district judge is faced with dozens upon dozens of objectors; the case has become completely unmanageable; this is an important settlement to implement immediately; that a district court couldn't in that case exercise discretion under the broad language of subsection 23(d). My point is that in the mine run of class actions, in every case, we don't need to be doing this.",
  "Well, I believe that under the language of the rule --",
  "Of subsection D, and let me return to the introductory clause, Mr. Chief Justice. There is a, sort of the broad phrasing because we have all kinds of class actions. Justice Ginsburg pointed out we don't have opt outs here but in D 3 cases we might. Just in the broad phrasing in the conduct of actions to which the rule applies, the court may make appropriate orders. And I think the court of appeals would be very sympathetic to a district judge faced with an extraordinary circumstance of lots of adverse objectors. But I think --",
  "I apologize, Mr. Chief Justice. No. What I'm reacting to is Justice Breyer's suggestion that if there are actually a lot of objectors in the case, and it's become a mess, we have a district judge who says look, what in the world is going to happen with this case on appeal. I'm going to try and help the court of appeals out. My point is that I do believe that the district judge in that circumstance would have the discretion to say to the intervenors -- excuse me, the objectors, say to the objectors, look, if you all are going to take an appeal, we are going to have to handle this here and try and create some organization.",
  "I apologize, Mr. Chief Justice. They are parties. This is a rule 23 class action under Sosna vs. Iowa. At the point of class certification, they have come, they are both bound by the judgment and they have availed themselves of the court by appearing and making an objection.",
  "Well, no. I think the judge clearly is going to hear objections from everyone. The question is is the district judge going to exercise some gatekeeping determination about who goes up on appeal. But Justice Souter, I could not agree more.",
  "Justice Souter, that is our fundamental point, is that, let me just distinguish again with the Court whose position is what. We don't agree with this suggestion. It wasn't employed here. We think it's entirely unnecessary. I'm trying to achieve --",
  "Justice Souter, I agree with you. I don't know exactly how this is supposed to work. It has never come up in 35 years since the rule was amended fundamentally in 1966. So far as we can tell, neither a federal district judge for a state trial court decided that he or she was presented with such an extraordinary case. I don't endorse this proposal --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I didn't focus on that word in Justice Souter's question.",
  "And so that's quite right. Now, let me just put on the table, Your Honors, the fact that we, here at the Supreme Court, the brief suggests oh, this will be so easy. District judges will always allow these sorts of interventions. This Court's opinion in Crown, Cork & Seal makes quite clear that isn't true. This judge said look, here's what's happening. And this is Chief Judge Motz in our case, said, I'm not going to let you intervene but if I'm wrong in rejecting your objections, you have got an appeal. That's how it has worked in several circuits without any difficulty at all, with the court of appeals having been confronted with any need for the district judges to act as a gatekeeper. And let me pick up, Justice Souter, if I might, on the specific problem that you identified and that is the district judge picking out one appellant versus another. There is the grave difficulty that in one appellant goes up and the others are not permitted to intervene in appeal, what happens when that person dismisses their appeal? This is an entirely untested rule.",
  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "But it has never happened. The courts -- that there would be that many separate briefs, for example, or separate appeals. Let me tell you how the courts of appeals deal with this problem. They deal with it here like they do in all multiparty litigation. They require consolidation. For example, in the Second Circuit, there can only be one appellant's brief. The people have to get together. In addition, the Rules Advisory Committee has made a very specific point that I would like to draw to the Court's attention with respect to the amended rule 23(e) that will come into place in 2003, and the court says that once -- and I apologize: The advisory committee note, Mr. Chief Justice, this isn't reproduced anywhere, because it's a new rule that will come into play next year. But the advisory committee writes, once an objector appeals, control of the proceeding lies in the court of appeals. The court of appeals may undertake review and approval of a settlement with the objector perhaps as part of the appeal settlement procedures or may remand to the district court to take advantage of the district court's familiarity with the action in the settlement. There is a great deal of flexibility built into the process.",
  "In excess of several decades, Your Honor, and it stretches in the Ninth Circuit back to 1979, for example. And so let me point to the Court the language that is quoted against us from another court of appeals is the Guthrie decision from the Eleventh Circuit, 1985, in which that court predicted that there would be administrative difficulties, Mr. Chief Justice, with a system that allowed objectors to appeal. But it has been the rule in those other courts that Justice Ginsburg identified for several decades, and they have not complained a whit about this.",
  "No, Justice Kennedy. This court's rule as I understand it is that you had to have been a party in the court of appeal, and so the failure to pursue your individual objection in the court of appeals would require, would mean that you drop out.",
  "You are a party to the case, to the district court's judgment. That's correct. But this Court's cert proceedings turn on not whether you are a party in the district court but whether you are a party in the court of appeals, and I can --",
  "No, Justice Kennedy. Our point is this. When you appeal as an objector, as opposed to the class representative, you appeal in your individual capacity to pursue your individual objections. That is our position why the Fourth Circuit had it wrong in saying that we were going to take over the case, usurp the role of the class representative. That's not correct. We come into the court of appeals, Mr. Devlin does, on behalf of himself and when his, he is the only objector appellant that was in the court. It is true that he represents an organization, but his individual objections are the only ones that are in the court of appeals.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's right. That's what rule 23 sets up. It gives him a formal and important role in the process. And it's important not to let go of the reason that exists, and that is that the Rules Advisory Committee notes that, and, understood that these objections are an important part of the process of identifying legal errors as in Amchem; deterring collusive settlements is another important role that they further. Let me identify an additional difficulty and a reason why you should not have an intervention rule, and it applies, I'm trying to advise the court about rules that intersect its decision and rules that are going to come into place in 2003. In 2003, assuming the rules as proposed to be amended are actually implemented, there is going to be a real problem with the Respondent's suggestion and opt-outs. Right now, in a (b)(3) class action, we don't have the right to opt out, which I think is a point in our favor, as Justice Ginsburg noted, but in a (b)(3) class action you can opt out at the point of class certification. Under the amended rule, there is going to be a second opt-out opportunity at the point of settlement. Our concern is that if you tell an objector, your role in the case may be cut off, if the district judge makes a terrible legal error, and the district judge then is a screen and gets to decide whether or not you are going to get to appeal, all that person is going to do is get out of the case and go litigate on their own by opting out. The one thing this Court I would hope doesn't want is to spread out all the parties. The point really is to keep everybody within the individual judgment. The premise of the Respondent's position, it seems to me, is fundamentally that we want a class action to be settled and over with, just the way a lawsuit of me against another person would be over. With respect, I think that asks too much of rule 23. We, this is a case involving hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of people, and it's not surprising that it can't just be settled by one person or another.",
  "Because the judge already knows that. The only people contemplated by the Government's intervention proposal and screening function are those who have already stated objections at the fairness hearing, and we know who those people are. If they weren't members of the class and they weren't proper appellants, we would argue no. My point about all the different hypotheticals spun in a couple of pages in the government's brief where it discusses the screening function is that it doesn't actually add value and it does create collateral litigation. There will be a motion to intervene; there will be mandatory disclosures; there will be the opposition to the motion to intervene; it will be litigated and then it will appeal. I could see, if the courts of appeals were actually experiencing a problem, that the advisory committee would revisit this issue and would interpose the district judges as a screen, but that hasn't happened.",
  "It actually could. And it hasn't. The amended rule the advisory committee notes, note the circuit split, and suggest --",
  "I think there is one good reason and that is that the advisory committee goes through, in cycles, of course, it revisits particular rules. Rule 23, rule 24. Rule 23 we believe has no role to play, as Justice Souter suggested, in screening appellants. That's the rules of appellate procedure and so it's not surprising in amended rule 23 that they didn't take this on. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. If I could make four points, please, about the Government's proposal starting with its applications to this case, because Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg wanted to know whether we do here, assuming what happened in the district court, assuming we were going to adopt the Government's position, the Government does not press, so far as I understand, any further whether or not it's presented in this court. We have the cert petition identifying the motion to intervene, the discussion of the Seventh Circuit's position. The question is what we did in the district court. The argument, as I understand it, the textual basis for the Government's rule is that under subsection (d)(2) of rule 23 you move to intervene, and the language of the rule is that the district court can condition your right to intervene. And Justice Ginsburg, if you would adopt the Government's suggestion, I think that's what you would have to say was the appropriate result in this case, that the district judge should have seen our intervention motion and because he clearly did believe we had the right to take an appeal, he should have conditioned it. So my principal point is that whatever the Court does in terms of its rule, we prevail.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, let me explain why I disagree. There are, the cert petition, and I need to distinguish between intervention for all purposes and intervention for purposes of taking an appeal. In the cert petition, the question presented flags the fact that we move to intervene and discusses at some length the Seventh Circuit's role which we are discussing here both in the petition and in the required brief, and to that extent it clearly --",
  "Justice Kennedy, the reason we used that formulation is because it's the formulation that the Fourth Circuit used. It's just picked up from the court of --",
  "I understand. The only other point, I would make, Mr. Chief Justice, about what's fairly included in the question presented is I ask the court to look at the question as the Government frames it, which it only could do if it believed our position was --",
  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. Now, the second is, I'd like to address, Justice Ginsburg, with respect, I don't think that you got a comforting answer on the question of whether or not this has been a problem in the Second or Third circuits, i.e., is there a problem out there that requires the rules to be construed --",
  "But they don't, Justice Breyer. Our point is that no circuit applies the Government's rule. It's a little unfair to say that I can't identify a problem with their rule, since no court has ever adopted or even suggested it. Now, it is a problem to the extent that there are circuits that require full party intervention. That you have to come in, you have to be a litigant in order to take an appeal. The problem is not an administrative one so much as that it cuts off appeals, appeals that are perfectly legitimate. The rule as we understand it under this Court's precedents is not that only named parties can take an appeal. That's why someone who sanctions can appeal and that's why it's uncontested that the denial of our motion to intervene gives us a right to appeal. It is persons who are directly affected by the judgment, directly bound by something that the district court did, and then what they can do is they can appeal to the extent that the arguments that they properly presented to the district court. Now, someday, will there be unusual class actions that require a further screen? Perhaps. Our point is that in an appropriate case a district court could employ the Government's suggestion, but why we would want to add the burden of this intervention requirement in every single class action in order to avoid the hypothetical possibility, that again has never been suggested by any court, State or Federal, so far as we or the Government have been able to identify. The other point I would like to make, just to, although again we believe we prevail under the Government's suggestion, is to take you back to the text that's supposed to require this intervention, and I think a fair reading of the text is otherwise. There are two different provisions for notice that we are talking about. The one is the D provision that I quoted midway through the argument, and the other is E, which is the settlement notice. The point to recognize is that under (d)(2), which talks about intervening to present claims or defenses, there is no intervention requirement when it comes to presenting objections. And we are not intervening to present any claims or defenses. There is just no textual hook here. To the extent the Court did want to look at subsection D, with respect, we think it's the end of that clause that says intervene to present claims or defenses or otherwise to come into the case. There is nothing in the text of the rule, there is nothing in the advisory committee notes that indicates that anyone contemplated the intervention to appeal.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress, in section 925(c), provided individuals like Respondent Tommy Bean two rights vis a vis the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America. Individuals may apply to, quote, unquote, \"the Secretary\" for relief from firearms disabilities and, if the Secretary denies that application, they may secure judicial review. The obvious flaw in the Government's position this morning, as several of the later questions identified, is that Congress has never, expressly or impliedly repealed those rights vis a vis the Secretary. The appropriations statutes that are before you address only the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Congress has set aside a separate and special budget for the Department of the Treasury generally, which is under the control of the Secretary, it's for $123 million, and the right to proceed before the Secretary is unaffected.",
  "Yes. Page 27 of the joint appendix is the application. It's directed to the Secretary of the Treasury, care of BATF. We went, as the statute directs, to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury told Tommy Bean that he was not going to restore firearms rights.",
  "We don't have his number. That's right. We wrote him a letter, as the statute requires.",
  "And that --",
  "With respect, the premise and the conclusion are not -- of your question are not correct. The ATF on behalf of the Secretary said, I'm not going to grant you this relief. The definition of denial -- the statute does not say, denial on the merits. The definition of denial is a refusal to grant the requested relief. That's --",
  "Can I address both the question of whether there are other examples of the scheme we've described, which is to say, the agency head does it, and then the question of whether or not, if this were a novel scheme, it would matter? The premise that there aren't parallels for this is not correct. I can give you three examples. The Attorney General is required to personally certify any person who's going to be subject to the Federal death penalty. That's 42 U.S.C. -- 18 U.S.C. 3593. Under the Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act, which is 42 U.S.C. 1997(a), the Attorney General is required to personally certify a prosecution, and there are various Federal criminal prosecutions for civil rights violations, which are at 18 U.S.C. 245.",
  "It's the two in combination. 925(c) says the Secretary. 921(a)(17) defines the Secretary to mean that individual or the delegate. Then, what Congress did is, it came along in the appropriations action, act and said, we recognize -- well, I'll give -- the literal language is that the ATF may not investigate or act upon --",
  "I apologize.",
  "Yes.",
  "They generally say, the Attorney General shall certify, and the courts have interpreted that -- I believe there is an example that says, personally.",
  "We definitely do not have here, but we have the equivalent, and then I'll get to Justice, the underlying question of Justice Ginsburg's, and that is, does it matter if this is done in a different way. We have here the parallel, because what happened is that Congress defined the Secretary to be that individual or the delegate, and in the appropriations laws has told ATF, as the delegate, that they may not act on anything else, and the parallel provision that Mr. Kneedler pointed to, which is that the Secretary may not transfer to any other division or agency. What Congress did not say -- and this is extraordinarily important. It's the key to the entire case. Congress did not say that no funds in this or any other act, or no funds in the subsection dealing with the budget of the Secretary of the Treasury, may be used. Now, it is that --",
  "Maybe --",
  "It may be, but what --",
  "No, and that's the underlying point to Justice Ginsburg's questions. This Court --",
  "And let me explain why. The 27 C.F.R. 178144(a), which has never been repealed, required us to send it to ATF. We had no choice. There's a regulation on the books that says we have to submit it to the Director. We didn't have a choice, but to make perfectly clear that it was directed to the Secretary we say, we send it to the Secretary care of ATF. But I need to return to Justice Souter's question, which is, is it good enough in this case, as in many other instances of statutory construction, to say, we get the general sense of what Congress was trying to do? The answer is no. In this area of law uniquely, Congress has to turn square corners. The relevant text of any statute is section 925(c). It's never been repealed. It says --",
  "No, Mr. Chief Justice, and let me get to that point, and that is, I agree with you that it would be foolish to say that the appropriations acts are completely ineffective, and if our interpretation were to deprive them of any value, we agree it would be highly questionable. It is not. The scheme that results is clearly one under which the Secretary will grant only those applications where the right to relief is perfectly clear. Where, as in this case, it is --",
  "Because, Mr. Chief Justice, what Congress did is, it created a system under which the subdivisions underneath the Secretary may not investigate or act. It's left to the Secretary, and now it is --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, with respect, we -- well, first of all, the text of the statute we think is enough on its face, but on the question of whether or not it makes sense, we think it does, because -- and I will point you to several other examples in Federal firearms law where Congress has adopted categorical rules allowing felons to have their rights restored. We believe this is a safety valve. We're not saying that the Secretary has to grant any particular application. What we're saying is that Congress recognized that there would be extraordinary cases. What Congress was faced with was that ATF had spent $20 million granting 3,000 applications, and that's what the legislative history shows that Congress was trying to cut off. What we are describing is a very different animal. It is an animal that's in the text of the statute, and that is, the Secretary is still empowered to grant relief. Now, Justice Ginsburg, one of the premises of your question was that there's a delegation here. The delegation here is not exclusive. The delegation here provides that -- and this was in 19 -- when the BATF was created, the Secretary provided that the Director shall act under the general supervision of the Secretary and under -- excuse me, and under the supervision of the Assistant Secretary. The parallel that's drawn by the Solicitor General is to United States v. Nixon and to the Accardi case, and those were exclusive delegations. In United States v. Nixon this Court said -- and this is at page 695 of the opinion -- that the special prosecutor had plenary authority, and the regulation provided that the Attorney General shall not interfere with the special prosecutor's decision, and in Accardi, and this is at page 266, the Court said that -- the scheme in Accardi was that the Attorney General would act only after the Bureau of Immigration Affairs, and that clearly contemplated that the AG would stay out of the process. In any event, not only is this not an exclusive delegation, but our fundamental point is that it's an illegal delegation.",
  "No, Justice Ginsburg. Here's how it works. The statute contemplates when there's a denial, and we will take up, probably, the question further of whether or not there's a denial here, but to focus only on the judicial review aspect, when there's a denial, you file a petition with the Federal district court. What happens in all the cases would be what happened here, and that is that the district judge orders the United States and the Secretary made the party defendant. They come into the case, and they have the opportunity to put on evidence, to examine the witnesses -- that happened here --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, you are correct what we asked for. You are, with respect, not correct about what the Government said in this case. The Government did not come in and say, our hands are tied. The Government did press its argument that there wasn't jurisdiction, but it absolutely did participate on the factual side of the case. I can give you examples. J.A. 51 is the examination of Tommy Bean, and then the cross-examination by the Assistant United States Attorney. J.A. 55 is the opportunity given to the United States to cross-examine the chief of police. We --",
  "No. Precisely the opposite. J.A. 37 is the United --",
  "What happened is, they came in -- I'm -- I've confused you with the timing. On January 20, 199 -- on 2000, there was a hearing held before the Federal district judge, Judge Fisher. The United States participated. It did not say, we are prohibited from participating. They had been given the opportunity to take witnesses, and let me detour very briefly, and that is to say that while the appropriations statutes prohibit ATF from acting on applications, we are now talking about, as you've pointed us to, the petition, and there is nothing -- and that's the distinction drawn in section 925(c). ATF is not disabled from participating in the district court. To return. There was this hearing on January 20. The United States was given the opportunity to put on evidence and cross-examine witnesses, as I was just describing. Immediately afterwards, the Respondent Bean submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law after that adversary proceeding. At J.A. --",
  "I'm almost there. There was. J.A. 37 is the United States' response to our proposed findings of fact, and they conclude at J.A. 37 that our proposed findings of fact are supported by the evidence. Finding of fact 27 is that petitioner -- that -- he -- we were the petitioner there. Petitioner, based on the circumstances of his disability and based on his record and reputation, would not represent a threat to the public safety, and finding of fact 28 that they conceded was that granting petitioner the relief he requested would not be contrary to the public interest. What happened here is that the evidence was so overwhelming. We had six chiefs of --",
  "Because, Justice Kennedy, nothing in the appropriations rider prohibits either of the two following things: First, the United States Attorney showing up and representing the United States, relatedly the Secretary of the Treasury showing up; or the ATF participating at the petition stage, as opposed to the application stage. I think it's very important to recognize here that this case has proceeded up until today on the understanding of the parties that the evidence about Mr. Bean's entitlement to relief was overwhelming. Six chiefs of police, a priest, a local --",
  "Right.",
  "No.",
  "Our position is --",
  "Right.",
  "Justice Breyer, you have several questions. Let me deal with them in the following terms: was there a denial here, second, does it matter whether there was a denial here, and third, is it sufficient that the Government's position and interpretation is reasonable, as opposed to compelled by the statutory language? The plain meaning of the word denial is a refusal to grant the relief requested. Our position is that when ATF turns around and sends us a letter saying, we're not going to act, that is -- it's not a failure to act, it's a refusal to act. That is a denial, and I can point to their own regulation that means it must be so. Under subsection (i)(1)(3) of the governing regulation, which unfortunately is not reproduced in any of the documents -- we do cite it, I apologize, but it is not quoted in any of the appendices. Under that provision, ATF said that any person who is a firearms licensee -- let me briefly draw the distinction here, and that is, there are people who are allowed to have firearms under State law, but there are federally licensed dealers, importers, collectors. In the latter class, any person who submits an application to ATF is allowed to continue operating for 30 days, until 30 days after the denial. If the Government is -- and that's a quote, of the denial of the application. If the Government is correct here, it would make the profoundly -- have the profoundly illogical consequence that no licensed collector has ever been denied, and they all have the right to continue operating.",
  "Oh, no, just the reverse, Justice Souter. Let me be clear. The regulation says that you get to keep operating under your license until 30 days after the denial. What I'm saying is, if you accept Mr. Kneedler's premise that all these letters that ATF has been sending out are not denials --",
  "Justice Souter, if the Government is correct -- and I won't belabor this point. If the Government is correct that the ATF letters don't count as denials, then every licensed dealer in the United States can continue operating indefinitely.",
  "I'll move on, then. I respectfully disagree, but I -- and I think the language will track in our direction, but let me move on, because Justice Breyer had two subsidiary questions.",
  "I don't know the answer to that question.",
  "Well, my impression --",
  "My impression is that it's a form letter that goes out to everyone.",
  "Now, you -- I had promised to come back to the question of whether, in this case, it matters that we didn't get what this Court would conclude to be a technical denial letter, notwithstanding if you accept the rest of our argument that we have the right to compel the Secretary to give us one, So to play this out, our position is that the Secretary had the duty to act. The question back to us is, well, maybe the Secretary didn't act here. My point is, that doesn't matter. The question presented by -- before this Court, if I could take you to it, is that -- is fundamentally, and this is the text of it, whether a Federal district court has the authority to grant relief. The Government has never contended, again, in the district court that there was an insufficient premise for us to be in district court. The question before this Court is whether or not the right -- excuse me, the provision for judicial review in section 925(c) has been repealed, and that takes us back to your third question, Justice Breyer, or third subsidiary one, and that is, is it enough -- and this is Justice Souter's point. Isn't it enough for us to recognize basically what Congress was after here, and I will turn to the answer. It is no. TVA v. Hill, Will, Robertson, many other, Dickerson, of this Court's precedents make perfectly clear, and this was the question that Justice Scalia started out with, that an appropriations repeal has to be categorical. The conflict between the two statutes, section 925(c) and the appropriations law, have to be irreconcilable, and that is not the case here.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, then I will take you to TVA v. Hill, which does address this issue. The Court has made perfectly clear that the kind of legislative history here is the kind of legislative history that would draw Justice Souter and possibly Justice Breyer to the conclusion that we know basically what Congress was trying to do. Those are Appropriations Committee reports, and this Court could not have been more clear that those are not an accurate indicia of congressional intent. There are --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, let me -- can I start at the end of what I think is the consequence of several of these questions, and then come back to the difference between administrative review and judicial review, and whether this would just be unknown to American law? The very best we think that the Government can get out of this argument is a judgment of this Court that says we were entitled to a remand to the Secretary. When we came to Federal district court and asked for relief, the best the Government could do was an order that says, no, you should have acted. What can't be the case, we believe, is that the Secretary would be able to just let these things pile up on his desk and say, I've never denied them, tough. Now, the -- what we take --",
  "Right, and if we conclude that's not a denial, we can't get into court. The Government's answer, I think, if we move down the road, will be that we should file another lawsuit, an APA lawsuit that says, to compel agency action unreasonably withheld, and if you take that position, if you conclude that this is agency inaction instead of an agency refusal to act, the surreply to that, the answer is that you should treat this as an APA action. The provision that Mr. Kneedler is quoting to you, 5 U.S.C. 703, says that the form of an action under the APA shall be the special review provision provided by statute, and that's section 925(c). If we were required to file under the APA we did. That's --",
  "The answer --",
  "Well, the answer to the question is no, and let me explain why.",
  "Mr. Kneedler -- thankfully. Mr. Kneedler framed the question as whether or not the Secretary abused his discretion by not withdrawing the delegation, by saying, I knew what Congress was up to, this is my agency, I know how this thing works. The answer is that this is not a question of abuse of discretion. It is a question of a clear statutory command. Section 925(c) says, we can apply to the Secretary, and clearly contemplates that the Secretary will act on these things. It's not an option.",
  "The right to apply to the Secretary would remain. We think it's clear that the Secretary, once his obligation to act is recognized, will set up standards. He'll say things like, I'm only going to grant relief if it's an -- the legislative history refers to a technical or unintentional violation where there are sworn statements in front of me that make perfectly clear this person is no threat whatsoever. That will be up to the Secretary. The Secretary will get to decide, and if he's granting too many applications, Congress will come along and say, no funding under this or any other act shall be expended to investigate or act on appropriation, on 925(c) applications. The critical thing, and the -- is that the Government does not dispute that this appropriations rider ever since 1993 is in the subdivision that applies only to ATF. If you want to talk about Congress working, they need clear instructions. We can't have the executive branch out here saying, I don't really like this statute, and so I'm going to infer that it's been repealed, and we can't have the courts doing that, too. It will take no effort whatsoever, if this is what Congress really intends, to strip away the statute and to do it in appropriations law.",
  "Okay. We have a, now, I think, a different question of administrative law, and that is the fundamental principle, in the APA context or a parallel like 925(c), is it only the court that can enter the order saying, you have a right to relief? Or does -- where's the proper order, send it to the Secretary and saying, it would be an abuse of discretion, it's absolutely clear under the statute you're entitled to it. Now, the court here did the latter. If this Court decided that was technically incorrect, it could reverse on that ground and say, no, no, no, the correct technical judgment is to put it back in the hands of the Secretary.",
  "And neither did the Government.",
  "Mr. Justice Scalia, they gave us what we asked for. I apologize for that. If --",
  "If they should have --",
  "If they should have done something else, then this Court can tell it so, but we -- I don't think it's fair to hold us to the position that the Government did not object, that only the Secretary -- in this case, when you go through the district court record, that the only proper remedy is an order to the Secretary to grant us relief, as opposed to granting us relief personally. Remember, as I quoted to you from the findings of fact, the Government left the playing field here. It admitted that with all of the evidence we had, no one could reasonably dispute that Tommy Bean was perfectly entitled and represented no threat. The only question -- they participated on the fact side of the case. Their only argument that they attempted to advance was that the district court was powerless to do anything at all. With respect, we did what we were supposed to do to get relief here, and if the Court decides that it only should have gone to the Secretary, that's a minor change in the judgment.",
  "Justice Kennedy, let me be clear on what money was spent, because there were technical questions about this. The United States Attorney's Office participated here, not --",
  "With respect, there was one agent who was one witness. The appropriations statute says you may not investigate, which was not what he was doing, and you may not act upon, which was not what he was doing, upon applications, which this was not. It was a petition under section 925(c). There was no prohibition, and the ATF agent did not object that I'm not allowed to be there. We did -- we put the witnesses on that we were supposed to.",
  "He can. What he can do is, he can take and is required to take up into his own hands, as the three examples I gave to Justice Ginsburg, the responsibility. He can detail. He has a budget of $123 million, $141,000, and he can take them up into his hands and say, look, I've got these sworn statements, and he could require, I want 10 sworn statements. He could require, I want 20, and he can have someone confirm that that's the right person. But what we do think, and this goes back to the Chief Justice's question, is that we do not think that Congress contemplated that the Secretary would spend $20 million granting 3,000 applications. If he decided --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Paragraph 6 of section 2255 provides that, quote, a 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section. The limitation period shall run from the latest of -- and it identifies four events, the first of which is, quote, the date on which the judgment of conviction became final. Congress did not define or otherwise explicate when the judgment becomes final in that provision, and the question presented by this case is that, given that final can mean many different things in different contexts, when does it -- judgment become final here? Petitioner agrees with the clear majority of circuits and the United States that the judgment becomes final upon the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of time for seeking such review. As applied to this case, petitioner's time to seek 2255 relief began to run when his time to seek certiorari in this Court expired. Congress most likely intended that interpretation for two reasons. First, it is the one that this Court has consistently used in the most analogous context, and that is the dividing line between direct and collateral review; and, second --",
  "Not merely retro --",
  "Those included, Mr. Chief Justice, but also cases like Barefoot versus Estelle, dealing with the presumption of correctness, and also Bell versus Maryland, which addresses the question of when a statute is repealed, when does that repeal affect -- what -- what convictions does it affect?",
  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and that is, in effect, our point. Those -- most of those contexts, however, do deal with the dividing line between direct and collateral review. The amicus quite rightly points out that there are other meanings of final. We do believe, however, that they don't -- they aren't as close as this one, and they aren't the one that Congress most naturally looked to, and since Congress didn't tell this Court what it meant, you would look to the dividing line between direct and collateral review, because that's the point of this provision in section 2255. I mentioned there was a second reason that I'll come to, and that is that the -- the minority rule doesn't work textually and would produce anomalous results. The -- as I mentioned, the Court has picked up the notion of final -- the judgment of conviction becoming final, and that language appears almost verbatim in Linkletter, in contexts like Teague, Barefoot, and Bell.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, but I think the point still would favor us. You're absolutely right, because although the Court has changed the line for retroactivity and changed the test, it has never changed the definition of what is final, and so for 40 years plus the Court has consistently included the time to seek certiorari, and that's a perfectly sensible result, as it would be applied in this case. The -- the minority rule, by contrast, would produce anomalous results. It would mean, for example, that in the couple of months after the mandate issues in the court of appeals, a judgment of conviction would be both final and non-final at the same time, because you wouldn't -- although the statute refers to the judgment of conviction becoming final, you wouldn't actually know at that point.",
  "I understand. Justice Breyer, that is exactly what has caused the Fourth and Seventh Circuits to scratch their head. It's a conceivable inference. We don't dispute that. Of course, the majority of courts have applied another canon of construction here, and that is that when Congress uses the same phrase in a statute, it's interpreted generally, absent some strong contrary indication, to have the same meaning.",
  "Ah, but he wouldn't, and here's the reason, and let -- let me just take you very carefully through this, and for anyone who wants to look it up, it's the blue brief on page 1 would be the different statutory provisions. 2255 says, the limitation period shall run from the latest of the date on which the judgment of conviction became final. According to the amicus, that means the date on which the mandate issues. 2244(d)(1) says -- has the -- has that, and it has some more, and that's your point. The limitation period shall run from the latest of the date on which the judgment became final, and then he gives that -- that same phrase, judgment became final, a different meaning in the same statute. He reads that to mean either review in this Court, or the expiration of time to seek cert, so it does -- it would have actually a -- that phrase, judgment became final, would have a different meaning in 22 --",
  "That's right, so what we have, Mr. Chief Justice, is 2244, Congress explicates a phrase. 2255, it doesn't explicate it at all, and our --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, it is correct that we think it would mean the same thing even if it weren't there, but it's not surplusage. It does have a role, and so I have several reasons to articulate to the Court why there's no negative pregnant -- our view is, and this Court has said, not every silence is pregnant. What we have in 2255 is silent. My point, Justice Ginsburg, is that the inference that the minority of courts draw, that Congress was doing something special in 2244, and therefore impliedly didn't intend to do the same thing in 2255, is not correct, and I have several points. The first one goes to yours, Justice Ginsburg, and that is, it's reasonable for this Court to ask, okay, why did it put it in 2244 and it didn't put it in 2255? It would have been easier, obviously, if it had put it in 2255. The reason we think they put it in 2244 is not to specify which among the Federal interpretations of \"judgment becomes final\" applies, but to say that it's the Federal one, not the State one. That's the real difference of force between 2244 instead of 2255. 2244 cases come out of the State courts, and State courts define finality differently, and so what Congress did there in 44 was make quite clear that they were applying the Federal rule. That was very important in particular, because State proceedings have the added complication of not just State direct review, but State post-conviction review, and so Federal habeas courts could be terribly confused on when the judgment and --",
  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and that is our point, and that is that Congress really needed to do a better -- a very good job, as -- as good as they did in AEDPA in any context, but they needed to do a good job in telling Federal habeas cases in the 20 -- courts in the 2244 context when the judgment of conviction became final, because if 20 --",
  "Justice Kennedy, this is the second point on the question of do -- does this Court have some reason to believe that the presence in 24 -- excuse me, 44 but not 55 creates a negative inference, the sort of Russello presumption, and I agree with you that it would rest on a view that this interpretation in 44(d)(1) is unusual, and our point is that it's not unusual. You are correct that the -- the -- as they said in Melconian, for example, that the term of art, final judgment, does generally mean the judgment of the district court, but everyone agrees that that's not the interpretation here. In fact, it's very clear that the -- the phrase here, if I could again take you back to -- take you back to it in 2255, is judgment of conviction becomes final. That phrase, judgment of conviction, picks up Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. Judgment of conviction includes the conviction, the judgment of conviction and the sentence, and it is by necessity already final and appealable. If this Court were to say that the baseline rule is final judgment in the sense of a district court, that would mean in the 2255 context that, although your -- your direct appeal could be sitting here in the Seventh Circuit for 2 years, after the first year, you need to be back in the district court on 2255, because the judgment of conviction would have become final when it was entered by the district court, and no one thinks that's sensible. In fact, the -- the notes to rule 5 of the -- of the 2255 rules make quite clear you're not supposed to be in on your 2255 until the direct review process is over, so that -- my point was that the -- what you're describing as the normal background rule of when a judgment of conviction becomes final actually describes the term \"final judgment,\" which couldn't apply here.",
  "In this -- in -- in our view, under 2255, Mr. Chief Justice, or --",
  "It -- it does not become final, in our view. What happens is, if you did not appeal, it would -- the judgment of conviction would become final after the 10 days --",
  "Well, Mr. -- Justice Kennedy, I do agree with you that that's the amicus's view. Our point is that it doesn't pick up what you're describing as the normal rule of final judgment. That wouldn't be the normal process. Our point is that the most --",
  "Justice Kennedy, as a matter of -- for example, Melconian, if we go back to what this Court has described as the normal background understanding, the normal background understanding is that just when it's entered by the district court; but if, again if I could come back to my basic point, and that is, we all agree final can mean a lot of things, and the closest one, it seems perfectly clear, is the one that divides direct and collateral review, because that's what this provision does. I won't deny to you, Justice Kennedy, that it could mean different things. But no one -- and my third point I wanted to make, Justice Ginsburg, about why you shouldn't draw negative inferences, nobody's got a good reason. Nobody's got a reason to think that Congress would have wanted this time to be available to State prisoners, but not to Federal prisoners. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. If I could address first the question of whether or not there is a background understanding of when a judgment of conviction becomes final, because conceivably that would give rise to the negative inference that Congress was doing something special in 2244 that it didn't intend in 2255. The amicus points the Court to the pre-amendment Rule 33, and I think it's important to play out exactly what finality means there, because in the pre-amendment Rule 33, there wasn't agreement on whether or not finality attaches upon the issuance of a mandate.",
  "Before the 1998 amendment, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "I apologize, to criminal procedure.",
  "I do apologize. Under -- before it was amended, some courts said it was the judgment. Some courts said it was the mandate. That's discussed in the advisory committee notes to the amendment. In addition, most things under Rule 33, those other than newly discovered evidence, ran from the entry of the judgment in the district court, and perhaps most important of all, it's settled under Rule 33, and this is the Cook case from the Ninth Circuit that's cited in the amicus brief, that under Rule 33 if a cert petition was filed, that didn't stop the time.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, there were no contrary cases, you're quite right. This Court never passed on it, and there's no contrary authority. And so my point is this. Even under Rule 33, it could mean a lot of different things, and I do think it's perfectly clear that among all the analogies, the closest one is this Court's collateral review precedents. I do want to pick up on Justice Breyer's and -- and the Chief Justice's question about, well, didn't they explicate something in 2244 that they didn't in 2255, and if I could give a contrary -- give a hypothetical where I think that reasoning would apply, if 2255 said, when the judgment of conviction becomes final by the expiration of direct -- by the conclusion of direct review, it would be very difficult for a 2255 petitioner to say, \"and that includes the time for seeking cert,\" because then you would have a real contrast with 2244. You would have one of the phrases in 55, but both in 44, and there you could have a genuine inference. Here we don't have anything, and my point is that this silence is not pregnant. You don't draw the inference that Congress meant nothing at all, or that Congress meant -- as Justice Scalia points out, an even narrower universe. The final point I want to make is about --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, no, his -- the amicus's point would have to be that 2255 means some subset, or some smaller interpretation, or some shorter time.",
  "I apologize. You're quite right. Justice Scalia's point is that look, if you use the word by, it could either mean it's explicating things, or more naturally it means, we've picked a subset, and so you don't have the subset here. That's Russello. Interest versus interest in an enterprise. Interest in an enterprise is a -- a smaller part of the bigger ball. The final point is about policy reasons. There really is no reason Congress would have intended this period of time, the time when you could have sought cert but didn't, to be available to a State prisoner versus a -- a Federal prisoner. There's no explanation given by amicus that makes any sense. For example, GVRs apply only when a cert petition is filed. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The parties to this case agree on one thing, and that is that section 330(a) of the Bankruptcy Code contains a mistake of some kind. Now, we disagree about what the mistake is, but there clearly is one. The United States Trustee, for all of its rhetoric about the statute's plain text, actually says that the statute contains two errors in two different places, but the list of compensable providers inadvertently includes a reference to the attorney and that the statute's so-called payees' list inadvertently omits the necessary conjunction or. We say there was a different mistake, that the payees' list inadvertently omits the reference to the debtor's attorney, and our reading of the two is the superior one. It is the one that's most consistent with the -- the structure of the statute as a whole, with the past bankruptcy practice, with the legislative history, and frankly, with common sense.",
  "That would be an attorney who's retained by a trustee, and according to the U.S. Trustee, it would also be an attorney retained by a debtor in possession in a chapter 11 case. The --",
  "That's correct. The reason -- and let me take you through the statutory scheme, and perhaps I should take you -- everyone to the text, and it's in the blue brief at page 2a of the appendix.",
  "According to the U.S. Trustee, no. Let me, if I could, just step back and put this in context. This is a converted case, just like, for example, the Hartford Underwriters case this Court had a few terms ago. And so I take it the question might be, look, if they were a debtor's attorney at one point -- and we all agree that for the chapter 11 proceedings, they clearly were authorized to be paid under 330(a) -- could that authorization have continued? And I think the answer is no because at some point there will be a fee application and the fee application will be under 330(a), and what will happen is exactly what happened in this case. The U.S. Trustee or the objector will say, look, for the period that it was a chapter 7, there's a -- a gap in the statute.",
  "Oh, no, no, no. Our position is to the contrary. The U.S. Trustee's position is that it -- they're without power. I think it's an important point. We view the structure of the statute to operate just as it has for -- the Bankruptcy Code has for 100 years, and that is, that the bankruptcy court is a gatekeeper. It has to decide, in what are now the literal terms of the statute, whether the services of the debtor's attorney are both necessary and beneficial to the estate. The position of the U.S. Trustee is that even when the services are both necessary and beneficial to the estate -- that is to say, even when they produce more money for the creditors, which is the whole point, after all -- you still can't perform the services and be compensable --",
  "Because there are things that the Bankruptcy Code assigns as responsibility to the debtor, not the trustee. And second, the provision that -- and so let me -- let me separate --",
  "Yes. Let me take you to the relevant statutory provision. This one is in the gray brief in the appendix. That's 327(e). There is a passing suggestion in the Government's brief -- and, Mr. Chief Justice, that is at 1a of the gray brief. It's at the bottom. There is a suggestion by the U.S. Trustee that if the debtor's attorney really needs to do something, the trustee's lawyer will hire the debtor's lawyer, and so it all will work out in the end, and I take it that's a point you're picking up. The statute is much more limited than that. It says the trustee, with the court's approval, may employ for a specified special purpose, other than to represent the trustee, and it goes on to say, an attorney that has represented the debtor. The way this works -- and we have tried very hard to find out how often this happens. Mr. Lamie's firm, for example, has been doing bankruptcy for 23 years and has represented the debtor in more than 4,000 cases. In that entire time, the trustee has hired the debtor's counsel two times.",
  "Well, we know that that's not the case, Justice Souter, because the Bankruptcy Code does, as Justice Kennedy has suggested, give important responsibilities to the debtor qua debtor, not that are distinct from the duties of the trustee. And let me give you an example of that. And so those are jobs that can't be handled by the trustee. They're the responsibility of the debtor.",
  "Yes, actually there is. The -- the problem is that the debtor and the trustee sometimes have divergent interests. That's why the legislative history to 327(e) says we want to limit the times that the trustee will hire the debtor's lawyer. But --",
  "An exemption fight.",
  "An exemption fight.",
  "When you're trying to -- to decide whether or not the debtor gets to claim an exemption. And so let me give you a couple more examples just about how this operates.",
  "Yes, but the fact that in relative terms, in terms of the percentage of chapter 7's, it's not that big a deal does not mean in absolute terms it's not. We know, for example, that there are at least 40,000 asset cases. In particular, we have complicated business cases. Hartford Underwriters, which you all had as a case, is an example.",
  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. There are a lot of converted business cases. Generally when we believe there's going to be an asset, they are pursued as a 11's, but lots of times the ability to keep up with the creditors breaks down and they can get converted to 7's. And --",
  "In all candor, Justice O'Connor, I think that's a point in their favor. It's just not one that's going to overcome the other indications of Congress' intent. So let me speak to that and then what the other --",
  "Yes, and then I will come back to Justice O'Connor. The point here is that there are a number of cases -- and we cite these in our brief -- that the expressio unius canon, on which you're -- to which you're adverting --",
  "Well --",
  "Justice Breyer, let me explain to why I think you are, and then you can tell me why I'm misguided, I'm sure.",
  "United States v. Wilson.",
  "United States v. Wilson, and then I'll come back to why I think their argument is an expressio unius one, and then I'll explain to you U.S. v. Wilson. It's on page 10 of the yellow brief that we discuss it. The statute says that the court may award to a trustee, an examiner, or professional person employed under section 327. I'm back on 2a of the blue brief. It has a list. It doesn't say only, and there are many cases. There are legions of cases in which a list is not regarded as exclusive when -- I think there's a presumption of exclusivity, but when the contrary indications in the text or the history of the drafting or something else tells you that Congress didn't intend the list to be exclusive, and this is such a case. The reason I cite U.S. v. Wilson to you is that's a case in which the statute referred specifically to the Attorney General. The Attorney General, before the statute was revised, was supposed to compute the amount of time that is given as credit from pretrial detention. Congress, as it did with section 330, rewrote the statute entirely, and this Court said, look, we admit that the reference to the Attorney General is gone, but it looks like it just got lost in the shuffle if we look at the other indications of Congress' intent. Now, let me just make one other important --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, this Court has never really taken that view of subsequent legislative history, Justice O'Connor, but let me turn to the events. In 1997, there were two bills that were proposed in the Congress that were a part of general correction legislation that had a variety of different provisions, including one fix for this one. I think the important point is that at that time, the only case in the circuits interpreting the statute as it then stood went our way. It was the 1996 decision of the Second Circuit in Ames. And so I don't think you can infer from the fact that Congress didn't change the statute to confirm the rule in the circuits means that they intended to reject it.",
  "It is, but Justice Ginsburg -- so now we have not just the failure to enact legislation exists, but the U.S. Trustee is relying on the failure to enact legislation that doesn't even exist. The point, I think, is that, look, if you read the statute, if you look at it right now, it's simply ambiguous. There's a reference to the attorney that's in there, and a reference to the attorney that's missing. This is not a case -- and this is absolutely critical -- in which there was a reference to the attorney, there was only one, and it disappeared, and we're asking you to read it back in. Our position is that the statute, as written, stands essentially in equipoise. The two references to the attorney in the 1978 version of the statute were inextricably intertwined, and so if you look at the text right now, the fact that Congress hasn't changed it doesn't tell you anything about whether or not they intend it to be in there or not to be in there because the split is almost even. There's one --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I agree, and I -- I'm obviously not making this point well enough. What I'm saying is that the inference that would be normally drawn from the failure to fix a statutory error doesn't cut in either direction here because, as I began in the introduction, both sides believes there -- believes that there's an error. But we both think there's a mistake in the statute. The fact that Congress hasn't corrected the mistake doesn't tell us anything about what the mistake was.",
  "We -- yes.",
  "Justice Stevens, let me put that series of events in slightly more context, and that is that in the House, when the bill was not pending there, there was a hearing, and there is one line in a 718-page record of just written materials submitted that says there is an inadvertent omission. The -- the one canon of construction that runs through this Court's bankruptcy cases --",
  "It is important to note, of course, that when the Department of Justice and the U.S. Trustee commented on the bill at the time, they did not say that this would be the result of the statute or that they proposed it. But I don't -- Justice Stevens, I don't think that when someone says there's a mistaken omission -- and remember, it's of course at the time when the U.S. Trustee says language is mistakenly included at the same time. When someone says there's a mistake, that's a very different thing from Congress -- let's engage in all of the false assumptions that people actually read this thing in the Senate and people paid attention -- that Congress actually acknowledged, yes, we're changing bankruptcy policy. The standards for changing bankruptcy policy, particularly a policy as settled as this one, are much higher --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, the indications in this Court's precedents -- the answer to that question is yes.",

  "That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think that the relevant answer would be that Cohen v. de la Cruz, which deals with a much more minor revision of the Bankruptcy Code than even this one, the 1984 revision applies the same principle and that is this Court has recognized that the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code are incredibly interrelated. There's a longstanding practice that has built up over time, and that Congress doesn't lightly change it. And let me talk about why this would have to be the --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay. I think I'm responding to --",
  "I -- I think -- I think we have a new thread. Perhaps the best answer to your point is Green v. the Bach Laundry, which is not a case that's discussed in the -- in the briefs, but I will explain how this arises. And that is, Federal Rule of Evidence 609 said, look, if there's going to be -- if you're going to impeach a defendant, you get to use prior convictions, and the Court looked at it and said, really, it says defendants, and we acknowledge it means all -- you know, the plain language of that is all defendants, and the Court inserted the word criminal and said from the --",
  "Inserted the word criminal. It said that rule 609 would only apply to criminal defendants.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "All right. Justice Breyer, I think that I probably am not going to have a case that satisfies you, but I think that I can dispute successfully the premise, and that is, I do believe that your premise is that expressio unius applies. I promised I would come back to that point. And the text says, the court may award to a trustee, an examiner, or professional person. It doesn't say to only those people. What I'm telling you is that the other -- the remaining indications of Congress' intent indicate that Congress did not intend to limit the payment to go to those people. And second, this is not a case in which only we have a textual problem. Remember that the U.S. Trustee, just as you say we have to read in a -- a word, they have to read out a word.",
  "I think you and Justice Breyer may be making a similar point here, and that is, look, if we had the text and all we had was the text, it would do less violence you say, and I think I can concede it would do less violence to read in the -- the word rather than to render the other one superfluous or read it out. But I don't think that's the question before you because you don't just have the text. If you -- this was all that there was, you could apply a canon like that one. It would do less harm, you know, the principle of sort of do no harm. But what I'm telling you is that there is an ambiguity in the statute, that the provisions of the payees' and the providers' lists are inextricably intertwined, that the trustee can be paid for the services of the trustee, the examiner for services of the examiner, the professional person for services of the professional person. And then there's this gap for services of the attorney. There's an ambiguity. And so just like any other case in which you have to resolve a statutory ambiguity, you look to other things.",
  "I don't think that we have to get down to the number of words or syllables or anything like that. I think perhaps a more fair -- if we're -- again, in the world of tie-breakers looking only at the text, it's that the U.S. Trustee's position requires you to conclude that there are mistakes in two different places, in both the payees' list, the missing conjunction or, and the providers' list, the inadvertent --",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I don't think there's any greater canon that says we find errors presumptively in second provisions rather than first ones. There are much greater indications of Congress' intent than that. We have a lot more to work with. I do think I need to make two points. The first is Justice O'Connor has, to some extent, focused on what happened here, you know, what did Congress know. I think it's important to recognize, as I started to say, this would be a change without any consideration by Congress at all. This statute started --",
  "Right, Justice Stevens, let me distinguish two different periods of time. I was about to talk about -- and we'll come back to when this -- the words got dropped out. You're focusing later, and so let me answer your question with -- try and answer it in a somewhat different way, and that is, the only thing that was pointed out to them was that there was a mistake. And if you look at the text, you don't know what Congress' intent was. Was it to leave the language in or to delete it? Because there are two parallel, intertwined references to the attorney. I had said that I would come back to the '84 -- the '94 change. This is what the Fourth Circuit thought was so important. That is, it mistakenly thought --",
  "That is the reference in -- I'm on 2a of the blue brief, 11 U.S.C. 330(a), subsection (1)(A), what we've called the providers' list. And this providers' list parallels the one in section 331.",
  "Reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services rendered by the trustee, examiner, professional person, or attorney. So what happened is that --",
  "Well, it -- as has been suggested, literally it could. You could render it surplusage or you could say it's the attorney of the trustee. But a few things about that. We know it really is surplusage because there's already a reference to the attorney of the trustee. That's the professional person. This was one of the first questions --",
  "It is, Justice Souter. The reference in this line to a professional person is the professional person employed under section 327. That's the trustee's attorney. The -- and the United States doesn't dispute this. It acknowledges that it is surplusage.",
  "Ah.",
  "I apologize. The trustee is not empowered to -- I -- I think I may have confused you back at the beginning of this. The trustee is not empowered to hire a person to represent the debtor.",
  "No.",
  "Okay. If so, we win.",
  "And there will be an explanation to follow.",
  "Yes.",
  "We all should assume that all -- the answer to all the questions, if so, we win, because what would happen is that, remember, literally the debtor's attorney may be -- provides compensable services, and then the ambiguity that Justice Breyer has focused on and then you have is that we have the question of, okay, who -- who gets the money. Does it go to the trustee, the examiner, or the professional person? So if the trustee gets paid for the services of the debtor's attorney -- remember, this is a case in which Mr. Lamie acted at the request of the trustee -- then the trustee has to turn the money over. The money actually belongs to Mr. Lamie. He provided the services. That's how it would all work together. And that is, in a case like this one, where the debtor's attorney acts at the request of the trustee -- this case is your hypothetical. The money goes to the trustee who then obviously has to turn it over the attorney. That's who would have the equitable interest in it. If I could retain the balance of my time.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, the reason that the U.S. Trustees are not finding that this ambiguity creates a problem is that there has been a shift in practice in those courts like the Fourth Circuit that hold that you can't be compensated as a chapter 7 debtor's attorney under 330, and that is people in bigger cases are getting bigger and bigger retainers. What's happening is the scenario that Justice Stevens described, and that is, people are saying I'm not going to be paid on an ongoing basis, so I've got to get more money up front. That can't be a result that Congress contemplated under the U.S. Trustees' vision of what Congress was up to --",
  "Precisely, precisely. But that's my point. What results is the 329 fees are subject to a Lessing standard. They just have to be reasonable. They aren't subjected to all the laundry list of 330. So the result of this change, if there was a change, would only have been to decrease judicial oversight. Retainers are subject to less judicial scrutiny. The second point I should make is that don't come away from the argument that this -- believing that this case is limited to chapter 7. It applies equally to chapter 11 debtor out of possession cases and chapter 12 and 13 cases for services that are beneficial to the estate, but not the debtor. The U.S. Trustee has always pitched this as somehow a case limited to chapter 7, but that's not accurate. And the Pro-Snax case from the Fifth Circuit, for example, is a chapter 11 debtor out of possession case. Third, Justice Souter, I still don't understand what the answer is to your reading of the statute. Justice Breyer, Justice Souter said, okay, there are a list of three people who can get the check: the trustee, the examiner, the professional person. Fine. But we also know, as Justice Stevens has said, that the statute's reference to the attorney has always been to the attorney, the same reference to the attorney in 331 is a reference to the attorney. 321 says a chapter 7 attorney can get a retainer. Justice Souter has said isn't the literal language, if we're going to follow the literal language, that the money can go to the trustee, to which I said, and that's -- you know, the trustee directed Mr. Lamie to do these things, and therefore the trustee just owes the money back to the debtor's attorney. That rationalizes all of the text. The important thing then in deciding whether to follow the literal text is, is there anything to support? Is there a whit -- a whit -- of indication in the history of the statute that Congress intended to do what the U.S. Trustee has hypothesized? Is there a word that from 1898 to 1994 Congress decided to make this choice to eliminate fees that are both necessary and beneficial? Those are the only fees we're talking about, those that benefit the creditors. Did Congress intend to eliminate them? Is there any indication of that? And the answer to that question is no. And that's important because the U.S. Trustee is not correct to say that when a chapter 7 is initiated or if the case is converted, that the debtor and the debtor's attorney leaves the field. There are ongoing duties. There's the 341 hearing, the meeting with the creditors. There is the duty of the debtor's attorney to transfer the materials to the trustee, to cooperate with the trustee. Here, there was an adversary proceeding. The trustee wasn't substituted as counsel for 8 months, and somebody had to tell the trustee about that. There are real responsibilities. And we're not talking about, in any particular case, a ton of money, but it is important.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is an ERISA pension case. The petitioner is a multiemployer pension plan. The respondent plaintiffs are two plan participants. Each accrued a pension and took early retirement at age 39, and each claimed a full pension in the form of a life annuity. At issue in the case is a plan amendment. It authorizes the suspension of retirees' benefit payments during the time that they choose to go back to work as construction supervisors. Before the amendment, suspension was triggered only by work as a construction laborer. The change gives rise to an important, albeit highly technical, question about the relationship between two provisions of ERISA. The question is: may such an amended employment suspension provision apply to previously accrued benefits? The plan says the answer is yes; the participants say the answer is no. The expert agencies charged by Congress with administering ERISA have also spoken to the question. They say that ERISA does authorize such an amendment, and they reached that conclusion by construing the two ERISA provisions in para materia. Countless pension plans around the Nation, in turn, have relied on the agencies' guidance in shaping their plan amendments for decades, and that is the principal reason that the case is so important.",
  "It has, not in formal guidance. The process is that you can -­",
  "There -- there are a couple of layers of it. The first is that the IRS publishes guidance ahead of time. For about 2 decades, there has been something called the LRM, the List of Required Government's brief in particular. And that said to plans, if you're going to adopt a plan or revise a plan, here's what you can do.",
  "Then there's a second. The second step is that more recently they have published what's known as to IRM, the Internal Revenue Manual, and that's guidance for IRS employees. And then there's a third level, and that is plans can submit their plan provisions and amendments to the IRS for what are known as determination letters on which the IRS signs off. And so all three of those exist.",
  "We don't. I don't think that the IRS was able to come up with a particular number, but they did say that their consistent practice for decades has been to approve this particular -­",
  "We get that from, I guess, two sources. The first is that there is the document -- the Required Modifications, that has guided the plans for a couple of decades, and it does not restrain plans in its amendments, and it doesn't say that you can only apply it a suspension provision to benefit payments that accrue in the future. Beyond that, when it comes to, you know, what the IRS does day in and day out, we just have their representation.",
  "No, it doesn't. There --",
  "It -- it -- literally in its text it does, but as a practical matter it doesn't because, as I was saying to Justice Ginsburg, the LRM's have addressed revisions to plans and to amendments, and they haven't restrained in any way the ability to apply it to previous -­",
  "It's true, but the -- the way these documents work, as I understand them, is that if there's a restriction, something you can't do, they say it expressly. When you -- remember, the default rule under ERISA, of course, is that you are allowed to adopt a plan particular restrictions -­",
  "It is --",
  "That would be prohibited.",
  "No, it wouldn't because it would violate the vesting rules. Let me continue. There are two parts in ERISA, and this is set out in your Alessi opinion in 1981. You have to accrue a benefit and then you vest in the benefit. The accrual is when you've earned the benefit. They earned the benefit. They earned their pension. Then they had to vest in it; that is, though they've earned it, they have what Alessi calls a non-forfeitable right to claim it. And what a suspension provision does it says your benefit still exists. Their benefit is a life annuity. It exists. There is an available stream of payments. There's a stream of payments that is available every single month. That's the accrual rule. Then you have to vest. You have to have a right to claim it, and that's what a suspension provision does.",
  "It is your claim to it that vests, Mr. Chief Justice. If I could give you the language -­",
  "I apologize. What I had intended to say is that your claim to it vests. There is a benefit out there, this life annuity. And the question is: do you have the right to claim it in any particular month? That's the structure of section 203 versus section 204. And what a suspension provision does -- and let me just pause to say the court of appeals acknowledged, the plaintiffs acknowledged, that when we suspend their benefit payments, we are not decreasing their benefit. What we're doing is that they have sacrificed their claim to a particular benefit in any given month. That's why Congress used the different language, suspension of benefit payments versus the actual decrease in the benefit.",
  "Well, they conceded -­",
  "No, but the concession is, nonetheless -­",
  "Well, it is we think, Justice Souter. Here's why. What I think Justice Scalia was focusing on -- and I may be mistaken -- is that, look, when you withhold that benefit payment, sort of give me a break. They're not getting the money. You're decreasing their benefit. And in the terminology of ERISA, that is actually not correct.",
  "Fair enough.",
  "And here is why it does not. The real-world value, the sense that, look, this is more desirable. I would rather have a benefit that has less suspension provisions than one that has more. For example, hey, it's more likely I'm going to get the money. That is not a benefit within the meaning of ERISA. The benefit is the life annuity. It's a -- this is -- the -­ ERISA is, of course, as you've often said, a highly reticulated statute. There are 3,978 pages of regulations implementing it in about 6-point font. The terms of art are highly, highly technical, and the benefit is the life annuity. It's not just the sense that I like it more. And I can give you an example. Justice, that is reproduced in the yellow brief. I don't think it will be necessary for the Court to track it, but it is at the bottom of 4a and 5a. This is a -- of the yellow brief. And this is a provision under which plans are authorized to change their vesting schedules. And so, take an example. There are two ways you can vest under ERISA. One if over the course of 7 years in individual steps. Another is so-called cliff vesting, and that is, you've got your benefit. You've earned it, but until you've been in service for 5 years, you don't have any legal claim to it notwithstanding that it's out there. Plans under section 203(c) are allowed to change their vesting rules so that if someone had earned 2 years of vesting credit, the plan can, nonetheless, change to a 5-year cliff vesting provision. Now, that's all very complicated, but the bottom line is that it makes it less valuable in the real-world sense for the plan participants.",
  "Unquestionably, yes.",
  "Absolutely, yes, without any -­ any doubt whatsoever.",
  "That is section 203(c). Section 203(c) explains that if you have less than 3 years of service, you are not allowed to object to the change in vesting conditions. There are rules under ERISA that say that even though you've vested, you can, in effect, be divested. That's why it is a very strange structure of the -­",
  "No. That's why this is in 1053. There are two sets of restrictions. That provision that I've just been describing would not -- and I don't think there's anybody who really contends it would -- violate 1054, what we've been calling 204. It would violate 1053. You have -­",
  "It would violate the beginning of 1053, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me take you to 1a of the places -­",
  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. The beginning of (2) says, except as provided in paragraph 4, which is not relevant, a plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if it satisfies the requirements of subparagraphs (A) or (B). And subparagraphs (A) or (B) which I'll read, give you that 5-year cliff vesting option or instead over the course of 7 years. A plan satisfies the requirements of this subparagraph if an employee who has completed at least 5 years service has a non­ forfeitable right to 100 percent of the employee's accrued benefit derived from employer contributions. And then (B) is the other option, the 7 years. Now, I have spoken and I've tried to emphasize the difference between a benefit and the suspension of benefit payments, but it is also important to deal with the two other reasons that the Government -­",
  "No.",
  "No, Justice Stevens. You would acquire the accrued benefit under 1054 as it accrued over time. What you would not do is vest in that benefit, your right to the benefit is not present.",
  "That's exactly right.",
  "Yes. Let me just step back.",
  "I apologize. Let me just step back and explain it then. There are two things that you have to do in order to be able to collect your benefit under ERISA. It has to accrue. You have to earn it under 1054.",
  "And you also have to vest in it under 1053. Justice Scalia, you had intimated a hypothetical. Well, look, couldn't the plan just say, hey, we're suspending your benefit payments and wouldn't that violate 1054 because you lessened the value of the benefit. The answer to that question is no. You couldn't do it, but -- because it would violate 1053. Someone would have vested in the benefit and you would be divesting them of it. Let me also take you -- because we do contend that we are entitled to -­",
  "Sorry.",
  "Yes.",
  "Let me -­",
  "No is the -- is the short answer and here's the longer answer. You cannot decrease the benefit even if it has not yet vested. Let's be perfectly clear. If I -- they have a life annuity and I were to say instead of paying you $1,650 a month, I'm going to pay you $1,400 a month, notwithstanding that they haven't vested in it, it still violates the accrual rule. But when you come to the question of the suspension of benefit payments, which throughout ERISA is a different concept than a decrease in benefits, when you come to a suspension -- that is, your -- your claim to the benefit payment each month -- I'm taking that away from you -- that's covered by 1053. And our point is that this plan amendment is -- and the Government agrees -- is authorized by 1053. I had said that I was also going to go beyond the -- move from the text to the purposes underlying the statute and the protection of participants' legitimate expectations. But before doing that, I do want to point to the regulation, Justice Scalia, that addresses our understanding of what it is to decrease, and we contend that the regulation, which is published after notice and is reproduced on page 8a of the yellow brief, and I will just -- it's quoted in our brief as well. And it explains that a decrease in a benefit is something that changes the computation of the benefit. This does not change the computation of the benefit. It's not just a rhetorical device. It is a theme that runs throughout the provisions of ERISA. Briefly, with respect to the purpose of the statute and plan's expectations, the critical point is that the suspension rule cannot work if it -- this is section 203(a)(3)(B), the 1053 provision -- cannot work if it does not apply to already accrued benefits. The point of the statute is to get people to move in and out of the workforce. And if you are not allowed to apply your suspension provision to existing retirees, you cannot influence them in response to current financial conditions, the shape of the construction labor market, the shape of the current trucking market. You have to be able to influence their decision whether or not to work or not to work.",
  "It does -­",
  "Well, I think the critical point is that Congress in section 1053, in 203, carefully limited the power of the plans; that is, it's -- the right here is to receive your pension. That right is completely in the control of the participants. They can choose not to go back to work or to go back to work. They will receive their benefits. In addition, the plan is only allowed to limit the receipt of the benefit payment during periods of reemployment in the same industry, trade, or craft in the same geographic region only if they work more than 40 hours of -- a month, and a variety of other restrictions. And those showed that Congress was cabining the authority of plans so that they didn't unduly restrict the ability of plan participants to go back to work. But it is, I think, absolutely critical, to return to the point, that 1053(a)(3)(B), the suspension rule, cannot function as Congress intended and that is what the IRS concluded if it does not apply to already accrued benefits. We could not encourage or discourage the plan participants to go back to work or not to go back to work and thus calibrate the pension payments that are provision did not apply to their benefits. If I could reserve the remainder of the time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I have four points. The first deals with what kind of promises we can make to participants that they can enforce. The promise can only go in one direction. That is, if we promise them we will not change the suspension rules, if they -- trustees put that provision in and the to -- to change that would violate the plan and they would have a right under 502 to enforce it. But, Justice Scalia, there is no way that there's a middle ground under which the plans flag for the participants, hey, this is open to a change because 204(g) -- if they win, they'll win under 204(g). 204(g) is categorical. You can't reduce benefits even if you say you're going to. It's just no way you can do it. And therefore, the only middle ground is under our provision. If participants and the trustees want a plan provision, making it a concrete promise, we won't change the rules. If that's in the plan, it would be enforceable against us. But it isn't. Second -­",
  "It could have, although I would say that the provisions cited by the Assistant to the Solicitor General talks about telling a person who is in retirement about a material change in the suspension rules, and that's -- that's pretty clear to my mind. But it's true. It could have gone -- we could have been even more clear, but this is a right, a statutory right, that we have. Justice O'Connor, Justice Ginsburg, what does 203 cover? It covers a normal retirement benefit, and usually what we think of as an early retirement benefit, that is, the unsubsidized portion of an -- of a early retirement benefit. absolutely right about the purpose of this provision. We want to be able to adjust to current labor conditions. And Justice Souter, the statute recognizes that. 203(a) has a special rule for multiemployer plans. They cover things like construction and labor where the markets change a lot, and they have a much narrower provision in 203 for single employer plans. But ultimately, I think that this is fairly characterized as ambiguous. The agency here has an enormous amount of experience in balancing the purposes of these different statutes and knowing what's different between a decrease and a suspension.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Breyer, I will come to your question in just a moment. The petitioners are more than 20 U.S. companies and their foreign affiliates who were caught red-handed perpetrating the most damaging anti-competitive conspiracy in the history of -­",
  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but not because the FTAIA applies. We have to prove that we would have had a claim before the Sherman Act, before the '82 Act was adopted, and we intend to do so. I do know -- do, however, think that the '82 Act is illuminating because it eliminated claims of other people and not ours, and that would be the victims of a U.S. export cartel. Now, the reason our position is critical is the one identified by Justice Kennedy, and that is that the conspirators' cartel encompassed a worldwide market for bulk vitamins and the worldwide market is relevant because geographic boundaries don't have any meaning here. A conspiracy limited to U.S. commerce would have collapsed as U.S. purchasers bought abroad, as Justice Scalia has said, and there is a critical fact about the nature of the worldwide market and how the United States enforces the antitrust laws that has not been touched on in the first half hour, and that is that U.S. antitrust law -- and Mr. Chief Justice, this is prior to the 1982 Act -- deems their conspiracy -- Justice Breyer, it's not the individual transactions, it's the entire conspiracy -­ illegal, lock, stock, and barrel. The U.S. Government in this case prosecuted the petitioners not for price fixing in the United States and not for market allocation in the United States, but price fixing and market allocation in the United States and abroad. If the petitioners are right about what the Sherman Act means, including after the 1982 Act, then it will be the prosecutions of the United States that fall along with our position.",
  "Justice Breyer, I'm going to answer it in three parts that will explain why it is that you can't separate the civil and the criminal liability. As you know much better than me, what's good for goose is good for the gander. Section 4 of the Clayton Act says if it's illegal and it can be prosecuted, then there's a civil right of action for it. So here are my three parts. The first is the case law. American Tobacco, National Lead, Timken Roller Bearing, these are the three principal cartel cases that are discussed in our brief. Those cases do not say that the quinine cartel was illegal insofar as it hurt us. It's -­",
  "It's illegal, including the sales in Ecuador and in Holland. Justice Breyer, I -- I urge you to go to the indictment in this case, which is at the rollover between pages 1 and 2 of our red brief. In this case, the Federal Government prosecuted Mr. Shapiro's clients for price fixing and market allocation in the United States and abroad. That is, we don't care that Ecuador likes price fixing. I will come to the fact that they don't, but it doesn't matter. The Section 1 of the Sherman Act reaches the conspiracy and this Court's precedents reach every bit, as I said, lock, stock, and barrel. Now, let me give you the reason why. That was your question. Okay, assume -- you wanted to know why Congress made that choice, and it made that choice because, as Justice Scalia explained, we can't separate what happens in Ecuador from what happens in U.S. commerce. It doesn't make, in terms of protecting our consumers and our economy, it makes no difference at all whether the sale was between Holland and Holland, New Jersey, or instead Holland and Ecuador, because the cartel gets sustained, and that's also the point of Pfizer. So Congress recognized that and it made the cartel -­",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, we accept that as correct, but -­",
  "And it -- and we accept it.",
  "With good reason, I think. Mr. Chief Justice, our point is that the rationale -- I don't want to -­",
  "Yes.",
  "The answer is that the -- let me take you to the text of Section 4 of the Clayton Act, which I know you know, but it can't hurt to come to it, and that's at the page 1a of the red brief. The Section 4 of the Clayton Act says, any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws has the cause of action, and that's what Congress said. It's not, Justice Breyer, merely that we say, we think you shouldn't do this in Ecuador. It is, you may not do it in Ecuador in order to defeat the cartel on the whole.",
  "Okay, but -­",
  "Justice Scalia, let me tell you why I think that is contrary to settled precedents, and Mr. Chief Justice, these are precedents just like Rose v. Lundy that Congress would have had in mind in the 1982 act. So I want to talk, Justice Scalia, about pre-1982 law on whether or not the Sherman Act actually made the transactions, if we were to focus on them, illegal. And then, Justice Breyer, I want to come to whether or not the '82 act changes that. Justice Scalia, the decree in National Lead affirmed by this Court, which is at pages 330 to 331 of the Court's opinion, cancelled contracts that were in purely foreign commerce. To read from the opinion that ­ - that established the decree, several agreements relating to manufacture and trade, we deem the European markets are but some of the links in the chain which was designed to enthrall the entire commerce in titanium. Timken Roller Bearing did the exact same thing, and the Solicitor General argued in Timken that acts would have -- that those acts would have violated the Sherman Act even if they had related solely to the commerce of the foreign nations. Those precedents, Justice Scalia, if you look at them, do say that the underlying activities that are in the overt acts, if you will, in furtherance of the conspiracy, are illegal under U.S. law, and that's for a good reason. That is, if we don't go after them, the conspiracy itself will be sustained. You have to attack the conspiracy and what the conspirators are actually doing.",
  "Absolutely, Justice Souter. I have to take this -- there are -- there are three parts to the equation, and let me just, at each stage, because it can get very complicated, talk about where we are in the logic. There is the question, does the Sherman Act apply? There is the second question, okay, is there a private right of action? And, Justice Souter, you identified the third part to it. What does comity have to say about it? What do we do, assuming even if nominally the statute applies and they can sue, but it nonetheless would bring us into conflict with our trading partners. So I was answering, Justice Scalia, on the first. Justice Breyer and you have taken me to the second, and that is, is there a private right of action, particularly after the 1982 Act? Two facts about the 1982 Act. First, it has nothing to do with this case. Its purpose, and it's reflected in the introductory clause, and let me take you to -­",
  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "It did in the sense of saying -­",
  "It did in a particular sense, yes. I'm not trying to quibble. It said that the -­",
  "It said that the FTAIA, the '82 Act didn't bar our claim. We think that's right for two reasons, the first it doesn't apply at all, and the second is that clause 2, which is what gave rise to the split in the circuits, doesn't require that the person's injury, that the person's injury arise from an effect on U.S. commerce. It accepted the second of those propositions, and so I'll start with it, and Mr. Chief Justice, the text is at page 1a of the red brief. I think it's helpful to go there. This is a limit, by the way, of course, on both private rights of actions and the actions by the Government, and so what happens to us is going to happen to Federal prosecutors. It says, it's the second statute listed, Sections 1 to 7 of this title, that is the Sherman Act, shall not apply to conduct. It's focusing there on the conspiracy, all agree here that the conduct covered by the FTAIA is the illegal conspiracy. So conduct involving trade or commerce other than import trade or import commerce with foreign national unless two conditions are satisfied. The one is the substantial effect on U.S. commerce, and they admit they sold billions of dollars of vitamins in the United States as part of the worldwide market. And second, such effect -- and so the effect here is the effect of the conspiracy on U.S. commerce -- gives rise to a claim under provision -- under the provisions of Sections 1 to 7 of this title, i.e, under the Sherman Act. What that statute does is determines whether the conspiracy itself falls within the Sherman Act. It is not -- and as its structure indicates, it's not about whether a particular individual's claim comes within it. Remember the structure is, this conduct, the conspiracy, is illegal or not depending on whether or not these two criteria are met. Now, this is -- our reading of it is the one that was adopted by the United States when the act was adopted, by every single antitrust treatise, every single article interpreting the FTAIA at the time. They all recognized that what clause 2 does is requires that the effect required by clause 1, that is, the effect on U.S. commerce, be an anti-competitive effect.",
  "We do, Mr. Chief Justice, in its bottom line. You asked a question in the first minute, how in the world are we going to tell if some other person has a claim, and that -- we agree with you, that is not what Congress had in mind. As between the two sort of reticulated versions of clause 2, the Second Circuit is the -- is the reading of the statute. It comes out the exact same way, but it's the analysis of the Second Circuit that's right. The Second Circuit said, before the 1982 Act was adopted there was a split. We didn't know if in order to trigger the Sherman Act, the effect that was required on U.S. commerce had to be pro-competitive or anti­ competitive. There was a rule of the Second Circuit in a case called National Bank of Canada that says, look, it's not good enough to bring in the Sherman Act if there's an increase in exports or more jobs. No, no, no, no, no. It has to be anti-competitive here. And so that -- the ABA submitted comments on the original version of the 1982 bill, and it said, look, in order for the Sherman Act to apply, there's got to be a problem in our country, and so they added clause 2, and that's, as I said, the United States said so in 1982, in 1983, every treatise did, every antitrust commentator. So that's what clause 2 does. It says, look, we are concerned when our economy is being hurt, and that's a limit on us, and in the antitrust guidelines, the Government says that's a limit on them too.",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you. Let me put us in the analytical framework again, and that is, we understand, let's -- we're assuming the Sherman Act applies and that there is a right to sue in theory. Now, are there other limitations? Let me be very clear on the fact that these are three separate issues and then apply the third prong. This was settled in Hartford Fire. Mr. Shapiro is relying on the dissent in Hartford Fire for the proposition that comity concerns are built into the definition in the Sherman Act. That is the position that the majority rejected. And although he says the issue is nonetheless here, his page -- page 41, note 16 of their brief in the court of appeals expressly acknowledged that the question is different from the question of comity presented in Hartford Fire. So that -­",
  "I understand. Justice Kennedy, the courts of appeals leading up to Hartford Fire were unanimous and then Hartford Fire cites with approval, for example, a case called Mannington Mills, and that is that the courts of appeals had always understood up to the point of Hartford Fire, and then Hartford Fire applied the same analysis, that comity is a restriction on the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by the Sherman Act, and so Hartford Fire endorses it. And then subsequent to Hartford Fire -- and Justice Breyer, I am coming back to the substance of the comity analysis -- but let me just say that subsequent to Hartford Fire, the courts of appeals have applied comity robustly. Let me just cite two cases for you, Metro Industries, which is 82 F.3d 839, and Nippon Paper, 109 F.3d 1. They have continued to look at all of the different considerations. And so, just to return to structure and then to substance, the district court and the court of appeals had no cause to consider whether or not this case would interfere with international relations. Now, that analysis in the case of monopolization or unfair trade practices would preclude the exercise of U.S. antitrust jurisdictions for several reasons. The first is, here in our case we have an international norm. Everybody hates price fixing. Our brief details -­",
  "Yes. So Justice Breyer, I'm going to put on the table for a second whether or not our law applies at all. In detour, Justice Ginsburg, if we were to agree with that, if we were to say that our choice of treble damages and their choice of single damages represented a true conflict, and that is we were undercutting a policy judgment by them, the solution would not be to eliminate the jurisdiction that Congress conferred in the Sherman Act. It would be to say you can't get greater damages here than single damages, because that's the norm. That would be the solution. If the position is that comity, Congress intended comity to carve back, what you would say is that Congress would have intended in this instance not to allow the foreigners to get treble damages.",
  "Absolutely. There's no question that -- I just cannot remind you enough times that the petitioners are attempting to seriously jump the gun. There was no forum non conveniens argument below, there was no comity argument below, there was no conflict of laws argument. All of those -- for example, if there is a legit -- and in fact I can give you an illustration. There is a private class action ongoing in Australia. We have already had one of our claimants drop out of the case and go to Australia, because everyone recognizes that's where your remedy is at. We have, however, a dilemma that Congress recognized, and that is, as Justice Scalia said, with respect to the great majority of the world, and we cite in our brief the OECD's formal report on cartels, the seminal report to the Attorney General on international antitrust, a source after source after source that says there is grave under enforcement of cartels, and I can illustrate it here with two facts. The first is, with respect to more than half of the volume of commerce in bulk vitamins, more than half of it, they are going to get away with it. And that leads to the second fact, because there's no enforcement, public or private, that leads to the second fact, and that is, if they win here, they will net from activities that are per se illegal under the Sherman Act, net, net, net, $13 billion. That is not a message of deterrence. So, Justice Ginsburg, that's quite right. There are mechanisms for dealing with the fact that there are other remedies. I would just put back on the table the one that says, look Congress would not have intended -­",
  "It -- it's the judgment that Congress made, Justice Breyer, in the worldwide markets that Justice Kennedy referenced in the first half hour, and that is that we will be hurt, unless we go after them. But it doesn't mean, Justice Breyer, that we go after them for every Section 1 or every Section 2 violation. So let me come all the way back to your original question, and that is, okay, why is the comity analysis different here and there? Justice Ginsburg pointed to one argument that I was making, that's this is per se illegal. It is -- the second point is that there are disagreements, it's related, there are disagreements about whether the primary conduct is illegal in that instance. They don't think a monopoly is a bad thing. But what we do know is that everyone agrees that price fixing is bad. It is not an infringement on their ability to regulate primary conduct. If, for example, there was a country that said, we love price fixing, I mean, we just think it's so much better if things are expensive, well, then that might be a different case and there might be a forum non motion, but there are no such countries. So it is a very, very, very different -­",
  "Yes, Justice Kennedy, I -- I think that's right. I think that it is not sufficient for me just to say, look, there'll be a comity analysis later in the day. But I would say that we are articulating a rule, and it is a rule that is limited to -­",
  "Okay.",
  "The rule, Justice Kennedy, is that the Sherman Act applies, but unless there is a worldwide market, so that we can say that the injury to the person abroad is inextricably intertwined with the injury to the person here, that claim lacks antitrust standing because it will not directly advance U.S. interests. It is not necessary to advance the protection of U.S. -­",
  "No, we're -- Justice Kennedy, let me relate this to your question. That is, Justice Breyer is saying, look, the first argument in the red brief is this, this is a case in which the effects in the United States -- and I will come to your Illinois Brick objection, Justice Scalia -- the -- the effects in the United States did give rise to our claims. He says, accept what they say, accept the Fifth Circuit's rule. Look, if the cartel had not operated in this country, it would have collapsed, he doesn't need a Nobel Prize, we have one in case you did, and that means that our people were injured. We accept that. It's the first argument in our brief. It means that the -- it limits out all of the cases that you were worried about, Justice Breyer, because in a monopolization case that won't be true, unfair trade practices, that won't be true. And then, Justice Ginsburg, notwithstanding that we have a narrow field of cartel cases, there are only six that have been filed, there are still other options on the table for limiting the claim in the instance that there is an available foreign remedy. So that's how it would work. We would accept their argument, we would say there's a narrow class of cases that, Justice Kennedy, are a true worldwide market where Congress recognized that, in cases like American Tobacco that it had in mind in the 1982 Act, and then we say, look, that's it, that's the full ball of wax, we don't become an imperial source of law for the world. That's how we would analyze the case. Now, we think that that too addresses any concerns about manageability -­",
  "We would reject claims from places like Australia and Canada and the like, that's right. If they have any sort of regime that they have decided to build up, if they've enacted into law, and it's a viable regime for vindicating interests, so that the client being here isn't necessary -­",

  "Mr. Chief Justice, those factors are relevant. I think that a principle factor in the forum non analysis would be, could you go somewhere else and vindicate your claim? I think maybe that should be a very important part of the analysis.",

  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "I then misspoke, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Yes. I then misspoke. If you ­ - I think there's an extremely strong argument that if you can go somewhere else, if there's some substantial remedy available in another country, then you can go somewhere else. But they didn't file that motion because they're trying to get rid of the case with respect to the majority of bulk vitamins commerce and with respect to most of the commerce in these worldwide markets for which there is no remedy. That's just a fact.",
  "Yes.",
  "There are three answers, Justice Scalia. The first two relate to the technical requirements of Illinois Brick and the third explains why you shouldn't read Illinois Brick to bar such claims. The first is that we're not merely talking about arbitragers. We're talking about, there are companies in the United States that made vitamins and they would have sold to our clients absent the cartel. The intermediary isn't a necessary part of the picture. The second is that even though you buy from an intermediary, under Illinois Brick you still have a claim, and that is you have a right to bring an action for an injunction. The third is that, look, our reading, the one that says, and that Justice Breyer has hypothesized, accept what they're saying and allow the claim only if the injury is tied into a worldwide market. That's a reading that protects U.S. interests. To say that Congress set up the structure, whereas -- that would allow you to look at the foreigners through clause 2, but eliminate all of their claims on Illinois Brick grounds, would render the statute and its -- its provisions against cartels ineffectual.",
  "Two answers, Justice Scalia. The first is, I disagree. They do not concede that. They regard that as a hypothetical purchase, to use Mr. Shapiro's words, it didn't happen. And the second is, and this goes back, Justice Ginsburg, to a question you asked in the first half hour, the reason we don't have -- thank you.",
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Petitioners submit that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act prohibits an employment practice that has a significant disparate impact on older workers if that practice lacks any reasonable business justification. The ADEA embodies Congress' determination that age discrimination seriously impedes older Americans' ability to participate fairly in the American work force.",
  "Justice Stevens, there is not a clear answer to that question in all candor. It is not before the Court. I will tell you that the lower courts uniformly in the ADEA disparate impact context apply Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion in Watson and the Wards Cove rule rather than the post-1991 Civil Rights Act rule. That is a debatable proposition because, as your question suggests, in subsection (f)(1) of the statute where this provision comes from -- and let me just take us to the language. It would probably be most useful. In the blue book, the -- the blue petitioners' brief at page 1 are the relevant provisions. (a)(2) we'll come back to. That's the parallel language to Griggs. The reasonable factor other than age provision is (f)(1), and it says: it shall not be unlawful for an -- this is at the bottom of the page. It shall not be unlawful for an employer to take any action otherwise prohibited -- and I'm going to come back and focus on that -- under subsection (a) where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age. The fact that it says otherwise prohibited seems to suggest that this is setting up an employer defense, as your question indicates. And the Court in the -- the Western Air Lines case in 1986 said that the BFOQ provision, which is in (f)(1) as well, is an affirmative defense. So I -­",
  "I can tell you.",
  "The answer is that you should recognize, as does the commission, which has delegated rulemaking authority under the act, that business necessity, which is the term of art that they used in the regulation -- and we'll come back to it. It's at page 2 of the blue brief -- means different things in different contexts. And so I want to take you to the specific citations where the EEOC has recognized the common sense principle. We know that more things that are legitimate employer practices correlate with age than they do with race and gender. It is -­",
  "Yes. Our position relies only on the statute. We embrace the text of the statute. (f)(1) says that the employer's conduct merely has to be reasonable. We agree with that. The point I would then take you to is that in -­ if the Court were interested in the regulation -- we don't think it's necessary to get to the regulation, but if it were, the EEOC has said that it too recognizes that the phrase, business necessity, in the context of the Age Act does not mean essential to the business. Let me tell you why it used the language it did, business necessity, in the regulation just to clear it up. And that is when this Court first used the words, business necessity, in Griggs and then subsequently in Wards Cove, it didn't have all the connotations that it does now as being quite a high employer burden. If I could just read to you two things from Griggs. Griggs said, the touchstone is business necessity. If the employment practice cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited. It simply required related to job performance. That's the backdrop on which the EEOC used the word.",
  "My point is only terminological, and that is, when the EEOC used those words, it did not do so against a backdrop in which they carried a connotation that was necessarily very strict, and it has said several times -- and they are quoted in our brief -- that the standard -- and this is just the bottom line. I think it's a very important bottom line.",

They said -- and this is the block quote. When an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the grounds that it is a factor other than age, and such practice has an adverse impact on individuals. That's the reference to disparate impact. The regulatory materials cite to Griggs. But in all events, I do want to come back to the bottom line, and that is the EEOC recognizes, we recognize that it's easier to prove either a defense or to put the burden on the plaintiff's case. It's a -- you have a higher hurdle -­",
  "Yes.",
  "No.",
  "Well, let me take you to the lines of cases that I think might concern you. There were a set of cases before this Court's decision in Hazen Paper that involved two rules, Justice Breyer, and I will tell you that you referred to in the Adams oral argument when this case -- this issue came to you before. And so I want to refer to a very specific set of cases. There were a set of cases before 1993 in which there was some correlation. High salary correlated with age. And the courts of appeals, the Third -- the Second Circuit in the Geller case and the Eighth Circuit in the Leftwich case treated that as effectively a disparate treatment -- disparate treatment case because of the high level of correlation. The more recent cases reject that result and we embrace the more recent cases. And I want to cite them to you so you could look them up if you wanted. The Evers case, which is 241 F.3d 948; the Williams case, which is 112 F.Supp.2d 267; and the last one is Newport Mesa, 893 F.Supp 927. These cases recognized that cost is a perfectly legitimate business justification, and they put a single burden on the employer. Now, let me just -- just to say, most impact cases aren't cost cases, but I know it's a concern. They say, look, if you want to cut your costs and get rid of your more expensive work force, we're only going to ask you to do one thing, and that is allow your more senior workers to take a pay cut. They do not say, as did the older cases, that it causes disparate impact and you lose your case. And so we don't -­",

And the city's explanation what -­ for this policy, which was to give the line cops more money but not the rest of the cops who happen to all be over 40, was that they wanted to bring the salary up to a -- a regional average.

  "No.",
  "That is not the facts here. That's right. They -- they did not say we are going to give pay raises to the people who have lesser years of service because we're concerned about their pay. To the contrary. Let me take you to one piece of the record that I think will be helpful. Although again the cases presents the legal question, the lower court on remand can resolve the case. But at page 15 of the joint appendix, there is the pay plan itself, and the first sentence is that -- they -- explains the purpose.

There are other tests: applications procedures, strength tests, and the like. That's what the EEOC believes is still very essential. So while we don't impose a big burden on employers in the cost context for the reasons that you and Justice Stevens have been exploring, that doesn't mean our position is somehow worthless.

  "The view of the commission -- it's one I share, but a particular court might not -- is that that is not a good -- a reasonable work place judgment. One could disagree with it. But the -- those employees will be very valuable. And it's not that they will retire, I should make clear. It's that they're eligible to retire. It -- it may well be a different case if you could say, I asked the person. They said they're leaving in a year. The rule challenged there was mere eligibility to retire, and they did give the other examples. I didn't finish with the court cases. They are Klein, which is 807 F.Supp. 1517, which is a hiring test I think by the FAA in that case that -- that happened to exclude all of the people, I think, over the age of 55. And there are other cases that are, in the line of cases that I was discussing with Justice Breyer, in which the employer doesn't say -- doesn't give the person who gets the higher pay the option of taking a pay cut before being fired. So the statute, both in the non-cost context and the cost context, has very important applications. I did want to return to your correct premise, however, Justice Ginsburg. You said there aren't many cases. I think it's important to recognize that the -­ the important, legitimate cases, by and large, are conciliated by the EEOC. Remember, it goes through an administrative process first. The EEOC found a violation here, gave us a right to sue letter. The -- the city just declined to settle with us. There have been -- and I have checked. There have been 74 disparate impact cases in the history of the statute that are reported in the Federal courts, and I think that is a good answer to the idea of the respondents that this will impose a huge burden on employers, the idea that there will be a massive amount of litigation. Remember -­",
  "It's possible it would expand some, but I do think we're right to say not much because -­",
  "Well, there are two fears I think the respondents have articulated, neither of which are borne out by actual experience because, Justice O'Connor, the EEOC has recognized these claims for a quarter century. Until 1993, every single circuit agreed with us, and right now three circuits agree with us. So I -- there is a large body of experience that suggests -­ and that's where those 74 cases come from. So, Justice Breyer, they have two concerns. One is the mere notion of the possibility of liability will -­ and the prospect of how expensive litigation would be -­ would be deterring valuable employment practices. That's not borne out by experience. Your point is, well, what if the liability threshold is too high? And experience suggests and the rules endorsed by the commission and the lower courts are that the liability threshold is not too high. I did also want to say that it is the liability threshold that is the key for deciding how to accommodate the respondents' concerns. Justice O'Connor's Watson plurality opinion explains that the evidentiary standards that apply in these disparate impact cases should serve as adequate safeguards. The precise, same argument was made by the business community in Watson, saying, look, we're going to have to adopt quotas. This will be entirely unmanageable. Before I sit down and reserve the remainder of my time, I did want to say we have a really good case, to refer back to my last argument, and that's Griggs, which is about the exact same statutory text. And then we have a line, a wall that is uninterrupted of this Court's authority. Six straight decisions say when the statute -­ title VII says something and the ADEA says the same thing, they have the parallel construction. And in our view the respondents' arguments aren't good enough to overcome the double hurdle of stare decisis and Chevron deference. If I could reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens. I want to start with our affirmative case which is one of stare decisis and then go to what I think is the thing that might concern the Court and that's the practicalities of implementing our rule. Our stare decisis case I think is fairly decisive. The language of title VII was the model for the ADEA. It runs all the way through the same in subsection (a)(2). This Court construed the text of the statute to give rise to disparate impact liability, and there are six cases of this Court that say when the language is the same, because one was derived from the other, we give them the same meaning. Now, I take it that the respondents have three answers to that. The first is they attempt to rewrite the rationale of Griggs and say Griggs really isn't so much about the text of the statute. It's what Congress was getting after, and this Court in Griggs was principally concerned with the fact that, look, in the context of age and sex discrimination, there's no legitimate correlation between an -- a disparate impact and a legitimate employer policy. That is not, in fact, what the rationale of Griggs is. The rationale of Griggs is that it doesn't matter to the employee if you are purposefully discriminated against or accidentally discriminated against. Congress was concerned with the effects of discrimination. And this Court reached that conclusion based on the text of the statute. If I could read from Griggs, quote, the objective of Congress in the enactment of title VII is plain from the language of the statute. That's the same language as in our statute. The thrust of section 703(a)(2) was to address, quote, the consequences of employment practices, not simply the motivation. This Court subsequently reiterated twice that disparate impact comes from the text of the statute, not from the air. Those two cases are quoted at page 9 of our reply brief and they resolve all doubts about commas and because of or anything like that. The Court in both Connecticut v. Teal and Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court in Watson tied it directly to the statute. If I could just read the Watson example. Again, they're quoted in full. In disparate impact cases, quote, the employer's practices may be said to, quote, adversely affect an individual's status as an employee because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Now, the second argument they have -- and this was the Fifth Circuit's argument -- is the RFOA provision exists in the ADEA, not in title VII. I do not understand how the RFOA provision -- if it means anything, it doesn't help us. Again, let me take you back to the text. It's on page 1 of the blue brief. It's in a few other places, but it's there. It shall not be unlawful for an employer to take any action otherwise prohibited under subsection (a) where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age. The necessary premise of that provision is that something will be otherwise unlawful when it's based on something other than age. It can't be talking about disparate treatment. The only kind of liability that involves factors other than age is impact. And then on top of that, Congress required that the employer's conduct be reasonable.",
  "Because the statute refers to something otherwise unlawful, it can't be talking about Price Waterhouse mixed motive. Price Waterhouse mixed motive cases establish liability; i.e., you're not liable if you had another reason for doing it. But the premise of (f)(1) is that it's already otherwise unlawful, this is a defense to that. The third thing that they say is that in Hazen Paper this Court construed the because of language in (a)(1) not to refer to impact. The critical difference is that the (a)(1) language does not include the -- the clause that refers to the impact on the employee that Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer talked about with Mr. Nager. They're structured very differently. As to the practicalities, let me just say this has been the rule for a quarter century of the EEOC. It was the rule in every circuit until 1993. It is still the rule in three circuits. The notion that there is a big problem with administering it and that the EEOC can't recognize the -- as it has in all the examples we cite, that it's easier for an employer to prevail in the ADEA context is not accurate. I also want to just agree with Justice Breyer, that an important part of impact liability is just making employers think about it. And that comes from Justice Kennedy's opinion in McKennon where he said that disparate impact, quote, acts as a spur or catalyst to cause employers to self-examine and self-evaluate their employment practices to endeavor to eliminate, so far as possible, the last vestiges of discrimination.",
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The petitioners in this case are American citizens who took cruises to and from this country on tickets bought here that call for the application of U.S. law. They were subject to discrimination by respondent, a U.S.-based company on the land, in the ports, and in the waters of the United States. The question presented is whether the Americans With Disabilities Act applies or instead whether respondent's conduct is lawful because the case is controlled by Bahamian law, which freely permits cruise lines to discriminate against persons with disabilities.",
  "Justice O'Connor, our research does not reveal that the question has arisen in the EU. I can, however, provide you some information, and that is that -- two points I think. The first is they subscribe -- the members of the EU subscribe to the same conventions and to UNCLOS just the way we do, which gives the port state plenary authority within its ports and internal waters. And I have a couple of case citations for you on this issue. In the ECJ, the Diva Navigation case, 1992, ECR I-6019, and the Mateo Peralta case, 1994, ECR I-3453. It has not arisen in the EU, but it has arisen in Australia. Australia has a disability law. It applies that law to cruise ships, and the rule in Australia is that the port state law applies rather than the flag state law. And the citation for that is the Union Shipping case, 2002, NSWCA 124 CA 40379/01. I don't know what those numbers mean.",
  "No, and you have put your finger on the point, and that is that there are no conflicts. We know that for a couple of reasons. The first is that there has been a detailed rulemaking underway in which the regulatory authorities charged by Congress with implementing the ADA have spent quite some time. They have produced this single-spaced, half-inch thick document that is dedicated to making - -",
  "They are not, but in terms of whether or not the statute, when it's applied, would conflict, you would look to this document and they took as their regulatory mission to make sure there were no such conflicts. What they did -- let me take your example specifically and then put -- place it within the statutory framework. Within the ADA and a question of the combings, what they said is, that's right. In certain cases SOLAS requires that the coamings be a certain height. If the coamings are below the bulkhead level, where you would be worried about water coming in below, that is not an accessible route, and so you don't have to worry about it at all. Above there, you ramp up to the coaming and ramp down, unless that's structurally infeasible. So they - - what they did is they -- and this is the broader point. they applied the rule of the ADA that a change to the structure of the vessel only has to be implemented if it's readily achievable. And what the regulatory authorities determined is that if there is any conflict with SOLAS at all, that change need not be made. Now, you -- Justice O'Connor, you also focused on the fact that there are some of our claims that implicate the structure of the ship. They are, however, a distinct minority, and we ought not lose sight of this because I don't think the other side has any good argument at all, under international law or anything else, that would explain why they can charge a person with a disability double.",
  "I would think on the question of the charging double, the answer to that question would be no because it would present a traditional, not unique to the ADA, choice-of-law question, and that is, if you're in England and you buy a ticket in England, your ticket is going to be subject to English common -- in that case, the English disability law. There is an English disability law. It doesn't discuss cruise ships. It's -- but it's broadly written. But with respect to the structure of the ship, I think that English passenger with a disability -- say that you come across to the United States and you want to get off in New York. I think that Congress clearly intended that that person would be able to come off a -- off the dock in a wheelchair, back onto the dock on the wheelchair; while you were in U.S. ports and you're staying in your cabin, that you would be able to, in your accessible -- your accessible rest room, have grab bars. We are -- and -- and let me not pass too quickly by the fact that even when we talk about some structural changes in the ship, by and large we're talking about things that have nothing to do with -- Justice O'Connor, you focused the name of the treaty is the Safety of Life at Sea. Whether the bathroom doors swing in and out has nothing to do with that. Whether there is - -",
  "I think your formulation is exactly right, Justice Ginsburg. It doesn't matter to us where the cruise is centered. We do, however, and this Court's precedents do, however, leave room for a highly unusual cruise that I'm not aware exists. Take, for example, a situation in which a cruise comes from England to the United States. It doesn't pick up any passengers here. They just visit. They stop in 15 other countries. They stop here. The same passengers get up on the ship and leave. This Court's precedents involving maritime choice of law leave room for the conclusion that says, look, we just don't think - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, we disagree with the characterization that the U.S. rules the world, of course. We're talking about the fact that Congress exercised its sovereign authority to control vessels in its ports and internal waters, just as in -- take the Cunard example. In the Cunard case, there were countries -- and I understand it didn't involve the structure of the ship, but the principle is the same. There were countries that required alcoholic beverages to be on those vessels, and - -",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I actually disagree with your characterization and would like to point you to a couple of precedents. The Benz and McCulloch cases, which are very important to the respondents, were very important to the Fifth Circuit, embody the principle that you just described, to some extent, and that is that when you have a foreign ship in our waters, we will not apply the NLRA to the labor contract between the foreign crew and the foreign vessel. But when Americans are involved, we do apply the NLRA, and that's the Ariadne precedent that the -- and -- and in fact, Ariadne is the most on-point case because it - -",
  "It was longshoremen working on the ship complaining about safety conditions on the ship.",
  "Based on shore, but so are the passengers.",
  "But it is a different situation, but I think it's more analogous. Not only were the -- the protests in Ariadne directed at the safety conditions on the foreign-flagged vessel, but they were directed at the passengers. If I could - -",
  "The -- well, that -- the definition -- we would have to return to the ADA. If a merchant ship has a few passengers, it would not be a specified form of public transportation or a public accommodation.",
  "I'm not aware of -- of - -",
  "Yes.",
  "If -- let me - -",
  "Okay. Let me first say -- and just to -- to lock the point down in that cost is accounted for in the definition of what is readily achievable. But let's go to the definition of specified public transportation because this will tell us what's going to be covered by the ADA. And just for the transcript, the citation is -- this is section 12181(110). It's -- it's very short, but it's at the middle of page 12 of the blue brief. Specified public transportation means transportation by bus, rail, or any other conveyance other than by aircraft, which has its own statute, that provides the general public with general or special service on a regular and continuing basis. That too would be covered. And only the public places on the ship would be covered by it. Can I just return briefly to my Ariadne point? Because I just wanted -- that's a case where the -- the NLRA was applied. And let me just read to you what the protest was that the NLRA was applied to because it fits perfectly with this case. And again, for the transcript, this is in the lower court opinion at 215 So.2d 53. This was the handbill. Warning. Is your cruise ship a floating death trap? Can a substandard foreign-flagged cruise ship turn your holiday into a Holocaust? They were very illiterate. If thousands of unsuspecting Americans continue to place their lives in jeopardy every day on cruises aboard foreign-flagged floating fire traps. And that -- that was a foreign-flagged ship. They we're concerned about the passengers. Justice Scalia, you also gave the example of the Jones Act, but remember that the Rhoditis case and the Uravic case, which involved injuries in the United States, then the Jones Act did apply. And that was -- and Rhoditis was a case in which someone was on the ship and a chain broke and they were injured as a result of it, and U.S. law applied. This is a situation in which millions of people in the United States are spending billions of dollars on cruises, and it seems - -",

  "It -- it is in the sense that it makes this the recurring scenario that Congress would have been aware of when it enacted the ADA in - -",
  "That's true. In the very rare case, which I am not aware of, in which a cruise ship comes to the United States, doesn't pick up passengers, then it's possible that the -- that the ADA would not apply.",
  "It would in -- in U.S. territory. That's right.",
  "Let me tell you what I know, and that is that the other side has not identified any problems of this -- this type. My research has not revealed some situation where we have a lot of these ships. I did carefully study the -- the itineraries of the major cruise lines, and 95 percent-plus of all of their trips go out from the United States and come back to the United States.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, here I think is the difference, and that is, that while U.S. law may have an extraterritorial consequence, just like our maritime tort law and the like, you cannot in Europe enforce the ADA. The fact that the structural changes - -",
  "That's right. But Justice - - Justice Ginsburg's point -- I take it to be a more particular one. It's true that our law will have consequences abroad, but it is not the case that the U.S. rules the world.",
  "Justice -- Justice Souter, I - - I simply disagree, and that is, when you talk about the U.S. ruling the world, in a -- in the context, say, of ARAMCO, we talked about the enforceability of U.S. law abroad. When the United States has tort standards or vehicle manufacturing standards and the like, all of those have consequences abroad for how devices are made and brought into the country. But that doesn't mean that - - what's going on is the plenary authority of the United States to enforce its laws in its ports and in its internal waters. That very rule always will have extraterritorial consequences.",
  "Justice Scalia, we disagree, and let me just take you to your cases. I did that, I think, in the Jones Act and the NLRA context. But let's just state the rule, and that is, from the Wildenhus's Case and that's at page 12. Foreign law governs matters of discipline and all things done on board which affected only the vessel and those belonging to her and did not involve the peace or dignity of the country or the tranquility of the port. And what we're talking - -",

  "That is right, although we have -- we would win the case on the internal waters and the territorial waters, and we haven't asserted in this Court a claim relating to the high seas. If I could reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg, our position is the one that can accommodate your concerns. Theirs cannot. Just like in Empagran, where this Court built in comity considerations, relying on cases like Lauritzen that involved foreign-flagged ships, it said, look, even if the text of the Sherman Act or the FTAIA could literally reach it, in these cases that we don't think Congress could have conceived of, we're not going to apply the statute. But here, we have a situation in which this company has 95 percent of its cruises going in and out from the United States. Millions of people, and billions of dollars in commerce are affected by this statute and Americans that Congress had to have in mind.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court will want to have handy, I think, the red brief of the Respondents Earthlink, et al., because I will repeatedly take you to the text of the statute, which is reproduced at the appendix to that brief. Mr. Chief Justice, cable modem service refers to the bundled sale, purely for marketing reasons, of two different things: highspeed telecommunications over cable wires, and computer software, like e-mail, that you can access over that highspeed telecommunications. The Commission admits -- and it is a critical admission -­ that the standalone sale of the telecommunications piece is a telecommunications service, notwithstanding that it is on cable wires rather than telephone wires. The Ninth Circuit correctly held that it makes no difference that cable companies market the telecommunications with e-mail and the like. Congress cannot have intended to empower carriers to deregulate themselves through the nicety of adding some further feature to their common carriage. And I think we can demonstrate that through the text of the statute. I'd like to take you to two provisions at the outset. The first one is on 2a of the appendix, and it goes, Justice Souter, to the question of whether there's some difference that Congress has adopted between telephone wires and cable wires. And the answer to that question is, no. Subparagraph 46, the definition of \"telecommunications service,\" this is the provision that leads to common-carrier regulation. The term \"telecommunications service\" means \"the offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public\" -- and here is the critical clause -- \"regardless of the facilities used.\" Congress made quite clear it was not drawing any distinction based on cable wire versus telephone. I'd like to point you to two other provisions. They are not reproduced, because they're in the cable -­ separate cable provisions, but they will be relevant to your question. That is 47 USC 541(d) and 522. Those specifically contemplate that cable companies will be common carriers. Now, that's the answer to the question, Is there a difference between a cable wire and a telephone wire? Let me now step back to what the FCC said in its ruling. The FCC backed into its decision here, and it will turn on the definition of \"information service,\" which will be on 1a of the appendix. It said this. Look, cable modem service fits within the definition of an \"information service.\" It's this bundled thing. And we construe the definition of an \"information service\" to be mutually exclusive of a telecommunications service. And that is legal error. And let me take you through the definition. Subparagraph 20, information service. The term \"information service\" means the offering of a capability for, in a variety of things -- generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information -- via telecommunications. That is not language of exclusivity; it is language of dependence. There has to be telecommunications involved. If you all came to the court today via car, or I came via metro, there was a car or a train involved. Now, I want to contrast that with another series of statutory provisions. And what these provisions do is demonstrate, beyond peradventure, that Congress address the problem you are now facing. It said, \"We recognize that there are definitional provisions that might otherwise fall within the definition of 'common carriage.' And if we don't want it to be a common carrier, we will tell you expressly.\" There are four of them. They are reproduced. Again at 1A, the definition of a \"common carrier.\" It's the exclusion that appears at the bottom of the definition, three lines from the bottom, \"But a person engaged in radio broadcasting shall not, insofar as such person is so engaged, be deemed a common carrier.\" There's nothing like that for \"information services.\" There's going to be one specific table that I think will be particularly illustrative. The next one, the definition of a \"telecommunications carrier.\" It's at 2a. There's a specific exclusion. Telecommunications carrier, these are the people that are common carriers. The term \"telecommunications carrier\" means \"any provider of telecommunications services except\" -- so Congress drew this out -- \"except that such term does not include aggregators of telecommunications services.\" The next two, and they are the final two, are at 8a, one that deals with private mobile services -- it's denoted subparagraph 2 -- \"A person engaged in the provision of a service that is a private mobile service shall not, insofar as such person is so engaged, be treated as a common carrier for any purposes under this Act.\" There's a definitional category of \"private mobile service.\" We don't want it to be common carriage. And the final one is the cable one, and I think it's very illustrative -- right below that, subparagraph c -- \"Any cable system shall not be subject to regulation as a common carrier or utility by reason of providing any cable service.\" Nothing at all about an information service. Justice Scalia, you are quite right, this is a case about a statute, and the language has none of the indications that the Commission is relying on here.",
  "No.",
  "All right, let me take you through both parts. Telecommunications -- we're going to talk about the definition of \"telecommunications\" and what it is to \"offer.\" They are wrong in suggesting that there is not telecommunications here, and I can prove it two ways. The first is, remember, \"telecommunications\" is the phrase in the definition of \"information service,\" as well. Let me take you back to it.",
  "\"Information service\" -- I apologize -- is at 1a. The term \"information service\" means \"the offering of a capability for (inaudible) via telecommunications.\" They're categorizing this thing as an information service, so they have to be acknowledging there's telecommunications involved. So, obviously, cable modem service -­",
  "Let me explain why I answered them separately. Because the Commission's argument -- if this -- Chenery -- you have to review a Commission decision -- the Commission's argument was that there was no telecommunications involved. This is a different argument from the fact that there is no offering. That appears in the Solicitor General's reply brief. So I wanted to bracket, set aside. It says, \"That can't be right. The Commission is ruling based on a pure legal error.\" Let me turn to \"offering.\" We're the only ones that have provided a straightforward dictionary definition of \"offering.\" An \"offering\" is to make something available. And you say, \"All right, is the bundle making available the telecommunications?\" The answer to that question is, yes. At the very least, it's yes in the context of this statute, which is a common-carriage statute. Imagine the following hypotheticals, Justice Breyer. Pick any form of common carriage you want. If someone said, \"I'm not just giving you the railroad bridge, but I'm also selling you -- you have to buy from me the train that's running on it and the grain that's in the train.\" You couldn't avoid common carriage by forcing your customers to buy the unified package together. The second point is that, remember, the great, great, great majority of communications have nothing to do with their information services. I have cable modem service. Lots of people do. What do I do? I get up in the morning, and I go to newyorktimes.com, I go to supremecourtus.gov. You'll be pleased. I -­",
  "And that has nothing to do with what they're offering. I have cable modem service. I don't use the e-mail program that's offered to me by Star Power. I have my own e-mail program. It's true, they've given me some extra stuff, but one thing that you know for sure is that doesn't deny that they have given me, fundamentally, the capability to send the information back and forth. Nothing changes. And I can illustrate this for you. Remember the concession that I started with. They admit that if they sell it alone, then that's a telecommunications service. They say it makes it different -- a difference that you market them together. But if I get one bill for that or two bills for that, it works just the same. I send the information back and forth, over and over again. There is absolutely no difference. Now, Justice Souter, I want to come back to history, because that's -- seems to me the leg that they hope that they have to stand on. I certainly don't think they have a textual leg to stand on. Let me make some points about the history. The context for this is the Computer Inquiries and the modified final judgement under AT&T, and they are simply misdescribing the history. And I will take you to the actual quotes for what happened. First, let me take you to the definition of a \"basic service\" and an \"enhanced service\" under the Computer Inquiries, and that is reproduced at 23 of our brief. And the point I'm going to make through this is -­ what the Commission said over and over and over again under the Computer Inquiries -- is this, if you have a telecommunications piece, we're going to call it a \"basic service.\" If you add information processing on top of that, we're going to call the whole thing an \"enhanced service.\" So far, everybody's on the same page. But the piece that they're leaving out is that they made different decisions, policy decisions, Justice Scalia, about how, ultimately, to regulate them, but the definition never changed. If you added the enhancement on it, just like you add the e-mail on top of it, you still had the basic service. So here's the quote. It's at 23 of our brief. \"We find that basic service is limited to the common­ carrier offering\" -- they're picking -- Congress is picking up precisely the words in the Computer Inquiries -- \"of transmission capacity for the movement of information; whereas, enhanced service combines basic service with computer-processing applications.\" The basic service remained. And then the Commission and the D.C. Circuit confronted just the problem you are. What happened is that providers, under the Computer Inquiries and under the modified final judgement, tried to combine the two things and say, \"We're no longer regulated.\" They said, \"Yeah, I know we had telecommunications, but now we want to add something onto it.\" And I can take you to what the courts said and what the Commission said, and that is at pages 24 to 25. And I think it's exactly what Congress would think if it were confronted with this problem under the plain definitions. The second block quote on 24. This is when the Commission was confronted with this problem. It said that the argument that they're accepting now would allow circumvention of the Computer II and Computer III basic enhanced framework. AT&T would be able to avoid Computer II and Computer III, unbundling -­",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, on this question, the answer is, no, because Mr. Hungar has conceded, and the Commission conceded below, that Congress was adopting a definitional framework. I agree, Mr. Chief Justice, that the Commission can change its policy judgement about how it wants to regulate within the definitional framework that Congress adopted. So you've pointed me to a critical point, and that is to reinforce -­",
  "-- and that is to reinforce this. Our position is that the Computer Inquiries and the AT&T MFJ had definitions: What's a basic service? What's an enhanced service? Congress adopted those for the purposes of the definition of a \"telecommunications service\" and an \"information service.\" Now, you can make policy judgements about how to regulate, although you're going to have to do it under the forbearance regime adopted in a response to Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court in MCI. But, nonetheless, the definitions are what they are. This is a statute that's being interpreted. So, let me come back. So, what did the Commission say under those definitions? AT&T would be able to avoid Computer II and Computer III unbundling and tariff requirements for any basic service that it could combine with an enhanced service. You know, we've got the telecommunications, like we're going to tack e-mail onto it. This is obviously an undesirable and unintended result. The D.C. Circuit, faced with precisely the same question under the framework that Congress intended to adopt, that is on the next page, on page 25, right below the block quote. The block quote sets up the problem. The D.C. Circuit, however, rejected that conclusion, the one that's being proposed here by the Commission, as a strained interpretation of the language of the decree that could not have been intended because it would allow the BOCs to, quote, \"create an enormous loophole\" in the core restriction of the decree. So, Justice O'Connor, this comes back to your point in the first half of the argument, and that is, it becomes completely circular. If the point is that you will only be subject to common-carrier regulation when you decide to provide telecommunications service, nobody ever will. Everybody will always bundle.",
  "I agree. There are five (inaudible) where the Solicitor General, sort of, pulls the ripcord here.",
  "First, they have a Chenery problem; and that is, this doesn't appear anywhere in the Commission's ruling. What they said in the Commission's ruling is that they could take a Title I information service and regulate it as common carriage. This is an entirely different animal. This is -­",
  "I still this is covered by Chenery, but let's go to that. And so, here's the proposition. The proposition is that the Commission has the untethered authority to force someone to provide a telecommunications service. And my question back to the other side is, Where in the world in the statute is that? There is no textural foundation for it whatsoever.",
  "Yes.",
  "Let me deal with the premise that Congress threw this into the lap of the FCC, and also how it is they propose to deal with it, on that assumption. The answer is, they did not throw it into the lap of the FCC. The '96 Act enacted these definitions, which are very carefully calibrated, for which there is no text -- textual support. I will come back to \"offering.\" But Congress did enact a specific provision in MCI versus AT&T. It addressed not only the concern of the majority, but also the concerns of the dissenters, that the Commission needed some flexibility. And it told the Commission how to address this problem. It said, in the forbearance procedures, \"Here are the rules that you will apply in deciding to lift regulation.\" They're quite detailed. They're -- now, let me take you to them again -- they're at the end of our -- I'm sorry, they are at -­ in our appendix, at 3a. This is what Congress said. Congress said, \"We recognize the Commission needs some flexibility, but there are going to be rules, and there are going to be rules so courts can, for example, review, later on, whether or not you're actually applying what we -- doing what you want -- what we wanted you to do.\" And here's what the Commission has to do, according to Congress. And it's what the Commission did not do here. I'm going to start with the indented paragraphs, 1, 2, and 3, and then subparagraph b. It told the Commission to look at whether or not the former regulation is not necessary to ensure that the charges -­ and skipping again -- are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. Paragraph 2, they have to make sure it's not necessary for the protection of consumers, that it's in the public interest, and that the competitive effects will be positive rather than negative. The Commission did none of this, notwithstanding that Congress specifically directed them to. Now, let me then turn to the question of whether or not this is a reasonable interpretation of \"offering.\" Now, in different contexts, I admit, it's conceivable to come up with different meanings of \"offerings,\" but this is a context, and I think if you take any example where Congress actually -- I've given you the common carrier. I don't think the railroad could ever get away with saying it. I gave you the examples of the Computer Inquiries and the AT&T MFJ, which are on point. But take anything that Congress regulates. Take, for example, the fact that we regulate offering of cigarettes to children. Now, a merchandiser couldn't come along and say, \"I'm not offering cigarettes. What I've done is, I've created a smoking service. I've taken the cigarettes, and I've put a lighter in it, and you've just got one bill that you have to pay for it.\" The idea that that would evade what Congress is concerned about is loopy. Think about what Congress is concerned about with common-carriage regulations. There are three principal consequences to being a telecommunications service. And imagine if any of them changed a whit, except to favor us, when you bundle the e-mail with it. First, nondiscrimination. Would Congress want you to have to charge just and reasonable rates to a competitor any less when you're selling e-mail with the telecommunications than the telecommunications alone? No. Interconnection. Would Congress want a cable modem service network to be less interconnected with all the other networks simply because it has e-mail or a Web browser on it? I don't know why, I suppose Congress would want to be more sure, because there are more messages.",
  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it's a fair point, and it is basically -- aside for the, sort of, nod at history, it -- Mr. Hungar started with that. And our point is that Congress told them how to deregulate, and that -­",
  "It did that, but with a critical concession. It said -­",
  "I think it's a very fair comparison. But also, Justice Breyer, I think -- you know, I think we're all on the same page about what Congress intended, and that is, first of all, Congress was aware of cable modem service. That's said expressly in the Court's opinion in Gulf Power. It was emphasized by the cable industry in Gulf Power itself. There is -­ there are several statutory provisions that refer to cable companies being common carriage. But, Justice Breyer, what they said is this, \"We have broad encompassing definitions, and that is, it's not going to make a difference if you combine two things together. But, Commission, you go make those\" -- Justice Breyer, all the findings you're talking about are listed in the section 10 forbearance proceedings. Now, imagine the world as the Commission sees it. It says that forbearance applies to telecommunications service. But when it comes to things that aren't telecommunications service, it's \"Katie bar the door.\" We don't have any rules. What kind of logical regulatory scheme is that? And that is that the Commission is constrained with respect to its expertise. But things that are information services that are outside telecommunications, it can do whatever it wants. Justice Breyer, I did want to make one additional point, and that is, again, there is a statutory provision here that addresses their claim that they can force you to provide telecommunications service, and that is the definition of a \"telecommunications carrier.\" And it is on 2a. I read the exception, so now I'm dealing with the second sentence of the definition, \"A telecommunications carrier shall be treated as a common carrier under this Act only to the extent that it is engaged in providing telecommunications services.\" This lines up perfectly with this Court's decision in Midwest Video. There was a constraint on what it -- what regulation you could impose on broadcasters. This one says, \"You are only going to be a common carrier if you're providing a telecommunications service.\" But the FCC has this vision that it can, sort of, solve all the problems through its raw discretion and to force someone to provide common carriage. But the statute's very clear, if you are not providing a telecommunications service, you are not going to be a telecommunications carrier; and, therefore, you are not going to be providing common carriage. And, as I've said, I don't understand how it is, even if one looked at this particular context, you could decide that Congress thought the bundle made regulation less regulated -- less necessary, rather than more regulated -- more necessary. I want, next, if I could, to talk about the notion that you can self-deregulate, and how utterly implausible this is, how is it that the Commission could imagine that Congress created the following regime. And that is, if you want to provide common carriage, you'll be subject to this regulation; but if you don't feel like it, well, that's okay. That will render the definition of \"telecommunications service\" -- if you just want to tack e-mail onto the thing, that will render the definition of \"telecommunications service\" -- in the Internet, you're a dead letter, because who in the world would ever do it? If it's up to the regulated entity, why in the world would anyone provide common carriage? I think this has, actually, a remarkable parallel to the Court's decision in the Oneida Indian Nation case, where the Court rejected the suggestion that what you could do is -- that it would be up to the Indians to decide whether or not they would be able to get property back. This is what the Court said, \"If OIN may unilaterally reassert sovereign control and remove those parcels from the local tax rolls, little would prevent the tribe from initiating a new generation of litigation to free the parcels\" -- remember, they're free from all regulation at all -- \"free the parcels from land zone -­ local zoning or other regulatory controls that protect all landowners in the area.\" And then, Justice Ginsburg, the opinion goes on to talk about section 465, which is exactly like section 10 forbearance, \"Recognizing these practical concerns, Congress has provided a mechanism for the acquisition of the lands. The regulations implementing section 465 are sensitive to the complex interjurisdictional concerns that arise when the tribe seeks to retain -- regain sovereign control over territory. The Secretary must consider\" -­ and it lists a whole series of things. And the parallel, I think, is exact. You can't have Congress enacting a scheme that tells you how to do it. Now, let me return to, then, Mr. Cappuccio's suggestion, Justice Scalia, that this is an ingredient, it's not a product. The straightforward answer is, there's no mention of ingredients or products in the statute. It says \"telecommunications service.\" And the question under the definition of \"telecommunications service\" is, Are you providing telecommunications? Yeah, the information's going back and forth. Is it to the public? Sure, anybody can buy it. Is there a fee? You bet, it's kind of expensive, actually. And that's all that Congress cared about. Now, this is not a question of whether or not there's butter in a cake, because you -- it -- there are two reasons. The first is, fundamentally, the telecommunications is the same; it hasn't been \"cooked\" into something else. And the second -­",
  "Right. The second is, the reason all those hypotheticals are -- wheels and cars and those sorts of things -- don't make any sense here is that they assume a few things. The first is, they're assuming a first sale that gets regulated. Somebody buys the butter, somebody buys the tires and gets regulated. But under their rules it's never regulated at all. The telecommunications just, poof, escapes all regulation. And the second is that, in the car example, it's because there's -- the reason it has intuitive appeal is that there's a regulatory scheme about cars. So Congress has decided how all the inputs will be regulated together. But, again, remember the consequence of sticking this into the unregulated \"information services\" box is, it's all gone. There's no regulation of it whatsoever. It's just not a scheme that makes any sense. If there are no further questions -­",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the previous questioning suggests, the outcome of this case follows directly from Steiner. The Portal Act, by its terms, applies only to activities that occur before the commencement of -- before the commencement of, or after the conclusion of, the employees' principal activities. Steiner holds that donning and doffing, such as in this case, is \"part of\" -- that's a quote -- the employees' principal activities, and it, therefore, follows that the Portal Act applies only to activities either prior to, or after, that donning and doffing.",
  "Because -- and this is the language that Mr. Phillips is referring to in Steiner -- 4(a)(1) itself makes clear that a walk will not be the first principal activity, including on the theory that it's integral and indispensable. The first principal activity has to be something other than a walk, and that's what happens in this case. As in Steiner, there is donning at the beginning of the day. That's part of the principal activities -­",
  "Two reasons, Justice Scalia. The first is the one that I gave, and that is, the Steiner Court concluded that -- and that was the end of the sentence, where it said, \"except as excluded by 4(a)(1),\" that Congress made clear in 4(a)(1) -- that the initial walk wouldn't be the first principal activity. Second, the walk won't be integral and indispensable. The test for whether or not something is integral and indispensable is whether it's work that's required and closely related to the productive activities. And simply walking to the donning station is not. That's in contradistinction to putting on the clothes that are required here, required as a matter of law in order to do your job. That's the line that the statute draws.",
  "The dog cases, Justice Kennedy -- and I -- let me make sure we're -- I have your hypothetical, and that is, the police officer at home grooms the dog -­",
  "-- then comes into the office. That is part of their principal activities. The subsequent commute is not compensable, on the ground that it is a break and a commute. That's covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Portal Act is concerned with something else -- that is, before the beginning and after the end of your day. The dog cases are, of course, also entirely different from this one. You have -- you have arrived at the place of the performance of your principal activity. Steiner said that occurred, quote/unquote, \"on or off the production floor.\" And so, you're at the plant, and your workday has started. Justice Scalia, you made the point, and I simply want to reinforce it, that the reference in -- to \"principal activities\" in 4(a)(2) is the same as the reference to \"principal activities\" in 4(a)(1), but it's also the reference to principal activities in the concluding clause of section 4. If I could just take the Court to that. The statute is obviously reproduced in a variety of places, but it's also at page 3 of our brief. And so, after 4(a)(1) and 4(a)(2), there's this concluding clause, and the text frames the workday. And it says that the Portal Act, 4(a)(1) and (2), will apply to activities which occur -- I'm quoting now -- \"which occur either prior to the time on any particular workday at which such employee commences, or subsequent to the time on any particular workday at which he ceases, such principal activity or activities.\" And it simply follows, as a matter of the plain text, that when Steiner held that those activities, \"such principal activities,\" include the donning and the doffing, that everything that happens between those two events is not encompassed by the Portal Act.",
  "Well, the -- both the donning and the doffing and the walking in between and the wait for the equipment, which is the bulk of the time in all these cases, would be compensable. The Department of Labor has regulations -­",
  "Yes. I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. There -- the donning and doffing in the Alvarez case, by and large, happens in one place: in a locker room. In the Tum case, by contrast, the employees show up at a cage, they wait for things, they walk, they pick up something else, they wait, they pick up something else. And so, there's a body of time that I refer to as the donning and doffing process. All of that would clearly be compensable, even in your hypothetical. Your hypothetical would address the final piece of time, and that is, you get your last piece of clothing on, and you have to go to the floor, and the employer could say, \"Take a 15 minute break,\" in there. I suppose that's hypothetically possible. I think the reason it doesn't happen in these cases and in the other cases I've studied is that the employer has an incentive, when they're forced to compensate, to do things efficiently. What happens is, the employer will say, \"All right, your shift is going to start at 6:30 in the morning; therefore, you can clock in and start donning at 6:23.\" That's a 7-minute window, and that forces the employees to do everything efficiently. They don't insert artificial breaks.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I -- all I have in -- before me that I can rely on is the statute that Congress enacted. Your point would cover, of course, equally, the donning and doffing in Steiner itself. Congress made some choices about things that were going to be compensable. It's worth noting that Congress drew a line about whether -- in terms of whether there was a collective bargaining agreement involved, because under section 203(o) of the statute, in workplaces covered by a collective bargaining agreement, you can negotiate out of at least clothes changing. But I think within the framework of the statute that we do have, I am actually quite correct, and that is, right now, today, the employers have no incentive to adopt an efficient scheme for arranging donning and doffing. They can put things in different buildings if they like. The employees here are required to spend 10 or 20 minutes waiting for different clothing at different times, depending on how long the lines are. It is a workable scheme that Congress designed that said, \"We're going to have a workday.\" And the employer is in charge of deciding when the workday begins or ends, but, during that workday, they're going to have to pay. I did want to -­",
  "Justice Ginsburg, it is an unsettled question, is the answer. I will give you the best answer I can. 203(o) allows for the negotiation away of clothes changing time. The question whether clothes- changing time includes safety equipment is a matter in dispute. The ninth circuit held that it didn't. This Court denied certiorari on that question. The further question, if you did negotiate away the clothes changing time, whether that would negotiate away the walking and waiting time has not been confronted by a court, so far as I am aware. It might be said to logically follow, but it hasn't been decided. It's not presented by this case, because cert was denied. And so, I haven't thought very much -­",

  "The line that has been drawn by the Department of Labor, is where I will start, and the Department of Labor -- and let me give you some citations -- says that the line is between whether the employer requires you to do the donning and doffing on the plant or not. The citations for that are section 785.24(c) of the regulations, 790, note 65. And then it contrasts clothes- changing that's by your own choice, in 790.7(g). I think that's a sensible line, but it's not presented by this case. Justice Breyer, it goes to your characterization of the final sentence of footnote 49, and that is: sometimes. The reason I think it's sensible to draw the line that the Department has in required clothes changing is that the employer will only require you to do it onsite if it is truly integral and indispensable to your job; otherwise, it'll be optional, or they'll let you do it at --",

The other side hasn't made any argument that it doesn't include the first wait, I think, because you're told that you have to don, it's part of your principal activity. Let me also say, this, I think, is a somewhat academic question when it comes to -- and nothing against academics, but the -- it's a somewhat academic question when it comes to actual workplaces, because what happens is what I described before, the employers, under employers that are following our rule, do set up a time clock, and they say, \"Show up at 6:23, and that's when you can clock in.\" They have computerized swipe cards, and the computer won't recognize them until 6:23.

  "That's right. The reason for that is, there isn't a predonning wait in the Alvarez case, where the plaintiffs won, and the Tum plaintiffs lost on an unrelated theory that the actual donning and doffing couldn't start the workday.",

  "Justice Scalia, my answer, I think, is that -- you had it right in the first half hour, and that is, that phrase -­",
  "-- \"not necessarily,\" can mean one of two things; i.e., we're denying that it follows a fortiori, or we're simply not deciding the question. The agency itself, which -- the Secretary wrote this guidance -- the agency explains that it meant that we're simply not deciding it. That's actually perfectly intelligible and a correct understanding of the history. Remember, the Portal Act gets enacted, and, right afterwards, the Secretary issues this guidance that then gets put in the CFR. This was their first reaction to the Act. Subsequently, after several years, these are -- what you're referring to is something in the -- what are known as the Part 790 guidance. Later on, the Secretary issued what's called the Part 785 guidance. And, in 785.3, it said, anything that, in 785, contradicts 790, controls. And 785.38 is the relevant citation. And there they say, \"If you show up at the beginning of the day and you're given instructions, or you show up at the beginning of the day and you get a set of tools, what follows after that, in terms of travel time, is compensable.\" Can I answer two -- make two other very quick points? Justice Ginsburg, you asked about mootness. I would refer you to the Deposit Guarantee case, 445 U.S. 326, which talks about collateral estoppel effects. There is ongoing litigation against this defendant on this question, a case called Chavez, in the district court. The citation for the proposition that it will collaterally estop them is the restatement section of judgments, section -­",
  "It's true, you could dig the case. My only point is that it is not moot. And perhaps the variety of workplaces shown in the two cases would illustrate things for the lower courts. I suspect that may have been why the Court granted cert. I also wanted to respond to the suggestion that this is a surprise to industry, with just a couple of citations. Walking and waiting time has been held compensable since at least 1961. The Mitchell case, 286 F.2d 721, the Barrentine case, 750 F.2d 47. There was a meatpacking plant at least seven years ago, 127 F.3d 959. And this has been the agency's enforcement position at least since the late 1980s. It's sufficiently settled that the court of appeals here held that IBP's failure to pay for this time was a willful violation of the statute. If there are no further questions.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court should hold that it is not reasonable for officers to conduct a consent search when a person with an equivalent interest in the premises expressly objects.",
  "It is, Mr. Chief Justice, although not on the theory of third-party consent. The analog to your hypothetical, which is this Court's decision in Lopez, is Justice Thomas' reference to Coolidge versus New Hampshire -- to the New Hampshire case. And what happens there is, this -- Mrs. Randolph could take the cocaine and give it to the officer. She was participating in giving an item to them. It is not the same, I think, when she authorizes the police to conduct a generalized search of the premises. It would be as if --",
  "But -- yes, Mr. Chief Justice. I do think that Lopez and White, in that line of cases, established that other things that people do consent to can expose us to intrusions on our property. What I think, however, is, it doesn't follow that she can authorize the -- them to conduct a generalized search of the premises. It's as if she were saying, \"You can listen in on\" --",
  "-- \"all the phone calls\" --",
  "-- \"in the house.\"",
  "You do --",
  "-- Justice Souter.",
  "That is --",
  "-- correct. But, Justice Souter, I think the thing that is important -- and I want to get to your line of questioning about exactly what the nature of the State's argument is -- is that he had a distinct individual right to privacy at the core of the home, as opposed to, for example, information privacy.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, that's why I finished off on that. Let me just focus on the important part of my statement. And that is, we are talking about a search of the home, at the core of the Fourth Amendment. This Court's doctrines are quite different about situations in which you share information with third parties. Let me step back and do the case before Lopez, and then explain how it was extended to Lopez. Cases like White say, \"If you give information to someone else, you -- they can give it to the police without conducting a search of you.\" This is a very different situation. The police are clearly conducting a search of a premises that I think, Justice Souter, it has to be agreed, he has a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to. Now, Justice Souter, it is absolutely right that there are instances in which people have expectations of privacy, and yet searches occur, notwithstanding those. And there is an argument to be made here that says, \"Look, he has a reasonable expectation of privacy, but the police came in for a different reason.\" That would be true, for example, if there was a warrant; they would come in, notwithstanding his reasonable expectation. That would be true if there were exigent circumstances. But the theory of consent is very different. Schneckloth, Zap, all of the Court's precedents --",
  "Good guess.",
  "Exactly --",
  "-- right.",

  "Yes. Okay. I have, and I can. Since 1974, when this Court decided Matlock, the Federal and State courts, combined, have considered this question. And so, there was a finding of evidence, and it led to a suppression hearing. That's the best that I can do. Fifteen times, all the Federal and State courts, once every two years. It is the case that in that -- in -- last year alone, there were 200,000 domestic disputes that were reported. But that's just the city of Chicago. What we're considering here is the situation in which there is no real need for the police to --",

  "Yes.",
  "All right. Let me answer this on several different levels. First, there is no serious argument that we interfere with investigating abuse claims. The conversation can happen. It may not happen, arguably, in a place that he has a right to privacy, but it can happen outside. It happens outside all the time. If there is any suggestion that a reasonable officer would believe that there was an ongoing crime, there was abuse going on right then, then it's clear that exigent circumstances would authorize the --",
  "Justice Breyer, I am not an expert in spousal abuse; and so, I'm not -- which I think is a very serious issue. I do know one thing about my rule, and that is that, under our rule, and under the rule that the Georgia Supreme Court articulated, they are allowed to speak with her, including speaking to her outside. It's true, there may be some sacrifice. And you have identified a sacrifice. And that is, she can't take them into a room in which he has a constitutional expectation of privacy. I will concede that if he says, \"I don't want you in the bedroom,\" that will be a sacrifice. But what I am saying is that there is no serious argument that they can't have the conversation in a place where she feels secure. That's on the porch, that's in a police car. If she says, \"I need you to come up,\" and there's been abuse, then what would have happened in this case -- let me explain what happened in this case. The officers asked Mr. Randolph first. He said no. They found out -- had found out from her that there was drug paraphernalia on the premises. What they had to do in order to conduct this search -- if they wanted to search, rather than having her bring the materials out -- is to pick up the phone and get a telephonic warrant, which would have taken less than 5 minutes. The real reason I bring to your attention the 200,000 domestic disturbances is that what you should be concerned about, I think, is not the 15 cases, which is not a serious intrusion on law enforcement interests over 30 years, but it's the many times in which our family relationships ebb and flow. We are concerned here with the person -- the Fourth Amendment is -- it's not the person who has the drugs or the abuser. Consent searches involve a situation in which the police come to the door, and they say, \"Can we search?\" Because they do as much as they are permitted to do. And the person just says, \"Sure,\" perhaps completely ignorant of her rights. There's no reason to believe anything is going on. And what the State's position is, is that, despite the fact that this is the home, and that the core of the constitutional right to privacy in the text of the Fourth Amendment is that the only thing he can do to be secure in the language of the Constitution is not live with someone else. Remember, the theory --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I do think you've put your finger on it. And I just want to say, Justice Souter, that I do think that the other side's argument inevitably does revolve around this notion of an expectation of privacy. And, Mr. Chief Justice, I think the expectation is -- and this is what the Court said in Minnesota versus Carter -- that, while it's technically possible that the people -- Minnesota versus Olson, I'm sorry -- the people that we live with will admit others over our objection, our expectation about what -- about what will happen, our reasonable expectation, is different. And I also want to take --",
  "Justice Souter, that's why I, sort of, paused and came to you. And that is, I do think that the other side's argument -- I want to say two things. One is that it inevitably reduces to the idea that we have a lessened expectation of --",
  "-- privacy --",
  "Okay.",
  "Well --",
  "But --",
  "Justice Souter, I think it is. I will only say, in my defense, that their brief articulates it in the manner that I was describing it, I think, with the Chief Justice. But let me --",
  "-- let me --",
  "Okay. All right.",
  "Yes.",
  "All right. Let me look at it through the other lens. And that is from the perspective of a reasonable police officer. I think there are two points to make. The first is, I -- the common ground between the sides in the case is, you look at it from the perspective of the person who arrives at the house, and you ask what is reasonable. And if someone arrives at the house, it is a different matter entirely if, as in Matlock or in Rodriguez, someone says, \"Come on in,\" and they -- you believe they have authority over the premises, versus you come to the house and someone with authority over the premises says, \"Come on in,\" and the other person says, \"No, stay out.\"",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, the Government has argued successfully in this Court that we don't make any assumptions about whether people will consent or not. There are innumerable cases in the lower courts --",
  "No, Justice Souter. And that is, the Government has argued, and this Court has accepted, again -- and this is a different point; and that is, you have to have a clear line for police officers that is administrable. And the line that is reflected in Matlock and Rodriguez is: If you get consent to come into the house from someone who has the common authority to do so, that will be sufficient, but that doesn't mean that if some -- and so, you don't have to go around and -- finding other people and asking other people. It's just as if you showed up at a house, and you were invited in. You wouldn't say, \"Well, let me check with everybody else\" --",
  "-- \"who lives here.\"",
  "It's true, Justice Souter, there are a lot of possible clear lines. What I'm describing to you is why the difference between Matlock and this case is one in kind, and that is that Matlock, I think, reflects an administrable rule, and that is, if you do have permission from someone who has the authority to admit you, you don't have to go ask anybody else.",
  "But that --",
  "Justice Souter, I don't think they're silly cases. I think that it is an important rule that the police show up and they are able to rely -- if they only hear from one person, they're able to rely on that person. I don't -- the ­ - I'm not claiming that our rule has great administrative advantages over the other side's. What I'm saying is that it is not necessary to sacrifice the individual's privacy who lives in the house -- as you say, has an expectation of privacy. And so, let me return --",
  "Justice Breyer, I think that's why it's important that our rule is not that the police should go away. We call for a balance here, and --",
  "Justice Breyer, the Court has precedent on this very point, and that is -- and, Justice Souter, he is asking about reasonable expectations of privacy -- Minnesota versus Olson. The Court considered this and said the very reason that person had standing and could -- had a Fourth Amendment right is because they did have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the premises, that, even though they had no property rights to keep any -- this is the overnight guest -- had no property rights to keep anybody out at all, their expectation -- their reasonable expectation of privacy for Fourth Amendment purposes -- is that if somebody wanted to come in, to which they objected, that objection would be honored. Now, I don't want to lose sight of the fact that our position is the balance; and that is, we don't tell the police to go away. We say, \"Look, if she tells you that there's contraband in the house, she can bring it out.\" That's the Coolidge case. And I do think, Justice Thomas, that there is a difference in kind, not degree, in giving something to someone and then having -- versus having a uncabined search of a house. The complaint --",
  "Yes, because that's not a search.",
  "Justice --",
  "Justice Thomas, it's how it played out, because they stopped the search then, because she withdrew her consent. But what she authorized was something very different. She --",
  "Yes, Justice Thomas, that's absolutely correct. My point, instead, is that what happened here, in terms of the consent, and what the State's rule of law would authorize, and what Matlock and Rodriguez authorize if they're extended to this point, is not, \"Take me to the drugs,\" which is an interesting proposition, but, instead, \"Go ahead and search the whole house.\" So, our point, Justice Breyer is, \"Look, don't leave. Get a telephonic warrant. It takes 5 minutes. If you know there's something in the house, bring it out. If you have anything to -- any reason to believe there's ongoing criminality, seal the house.\"",
  "Of --",
  "Sorry.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes.",
  "Justice Kennedy, I don't think that it does. Our view of the law is that the question is, When the property rights are -- and their -- their control over the property, I should say; I don't mean to invoke the common law -- when the control over the property is equivalent, then, in that tie, if you will, the Fourth Amendment controls. If ­ - there are doctrines designed to protect against situations in which you have concerns about ongoing criminality and protecting people. But that's --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, the straightforward rule that I have argued for today is that if you have an equivalent interest in the premises -- it is, of course, the State's rule that, if nine people object, Matlock says that any one of them can let them in, and an individual can override the objections of everybody else in the house. What I'm saying, I think, just to return to the basics, is, I do think --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "I don't think that has to follow from our rule. It's true, we have articulated one broad rule that would allow the Fourth Amendment to control, but I think if we analogize to the social situation -- if you said to yourself, \"What do you expect will happen if nine people that you live with want to let in someone and you're the only one who's going to object?\" -- I think it would be perfectly reasonable to say to -- that individual expects the -- them to come in. Justice Souter, let me return -- I want to make sure I --",
  "Justice Souter, I honestly don't think that's true. I think that Illinois versus Rodriguez, on this question, which is assessing the degree of the authority over the premises, does call for a \"totality of the circumstances\" inquiry. I also don't know that I fully answered your point, that we look at this question from the perspective of the officer and the reasonableness of the search. And let me just say that, in Matlock and in Rodriguez, the Court's analysis was that it's reasonable, because the person whose privacy is intruded on has assumed some risk. The Court does look to the privacy interests of the person who is ultimately the defendant. That's a -- an element of the reasonableness inquiry. And our point, fundamentally, is that it cannot be the case that when the framers enacted the Fourth Amendment so that you could live with other people and have a private space away from the Government, that you, merely by living with your family, assume the risk that your privacy will be lost. That assumption of the risk --",
  "On our broadest rule, the husband would control, although it doesn't follow, from our -- that, to affirm the judgment, you have to say that, because I think you could say that, reasonably, the person realizes they would be outvoted. But I do think the children is an important point.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. And what --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, when -- I agree with you objectively. This Court didn't, for example, in Matlock and Rodriguez, look at the particular family dynamics at that time. It looks to broader social understandings. I did want to return to your \"children\" point. Remember -- and I think this is a vital point -- and that is, the Courts of Appeals uniformly conclude, after Matlock and Rodriguez, that children are residents, which is the inquiry in Illinois versus Rodriguez, and they can give consent to search a home. It necessarily follows that if you extend that rule, Matlock and Rodriguez, to this case, that children, because they have the authority to admit the police -- minor children, 12, 14, 15 -- can then authorize the search, notwithstanding the objection of the parents. Now, if everyone agrees, \"That can't be right, it's the parents' home,\" that's because we are assessing --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, that question hasn't been confronted by any court we've checked. But what I -- what the Courts of Appeals have confronted repeatedly, and uniformly agree -- and it's in our brief -- is that children satisfy the Matlock and Rodriguez --",
  "-- standard.",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, that's right, but, of course, that's not the inquiry under Matlock and Rodriguez. If we take your point, then we are definitely moving beyond Matlock and Rodriguez. We're going to have to look to more. And my point is that, if we do look to more than simply the fact that the officers have found someone, however ignorant, has the ability to consent in their own right, if we're going to assess the other factors, the rule should look -- the Court should look to what the ordinary social understandings and --",
  "The -- I do not believe, as a matter of doctrine, that it does. I do think, however, that it informs this Court's analysis of reasonableness, in the sense that the Court, in Schneckloth, said, \"We are not going to allow consent to circumvent the requirements of getting a warrant.\" And it is the case -- we have to inescapably agree, I think, that this is simply a way of getting around the warrant requirement. They wanted to find out something about him. He had a privacy interest in the premises. He said, \"No.\" The Constitution says, \"You have somebody who's cooperating with you. Let them tell you what's going on in the house.\" And Illinois versus McArthur says, \"Seal off the premises.\" In fact, Illinois versus McArthur is -- the very point of the Court in that case was that it's much better to seal the premises and get a warrant, which will define --",
  "Oh, Justice --",
  "Justice Breyer --",
  "-- she said, \"I think you should\" -- she said --",
  "Okay. She said, \"I think you should go in there and get it.\"",
  "But, inescapably, what's going on, there are -- I think that this is not a case that follows, necessarily, from Matlock and Rodriguez. And there is a bright line to be drawn, and that is, you are going to have to not live with your family, which is precisely what the Fourth Amendment is about, in order not to assume the risk of the police coming in. The reasonableness determination is a balancing of law enforcement and privacy interests. The privacy interests are very high. The police can easily get a telephonic warrant or have the materials brought out to them. It is not necessary to take this case, when so rarely has it been that the police have needed to use this authority. If there are no further questions.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think the Court will want to have available to it the red brief and also this big, which is the supplemental joint appendix which has some of the patents in it, and I'm going to quote from both of them. I think you can't understand what motivation means and what the whole test that the Federal Circuit is employing means - -",
  "-- without - -",
  "-- without starting from the statute itself. And so I want to start with the statutory text and use that as the jumping off point like the Court of Appeals has for the inquiry that it's asking. It's reproduced at page 21 of the red brief. And Congress said it's the first blocked quote, that a patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described, as set forth in Section 102 of this title. Those are the other requirements for giving a patent. If the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art. So the term of art here is obvious, and the plain meaning of obvious, if you understand that the outcome of this case is obvious or if you think that the, what the Federal Circuit means by its test is not obvious, is something that's either apparent or not apparent, and that's what the Federal Circuit is asking. It says look, take the invention and see whether or not it was apparent or not apparent, and what the Federal -- to a person of ordinary skill at the time of the invention. And what the Federal Circuit says is, we want to be inclusive. The other side takes these words, teaching, suggestion, motivation, as if they were words of limitation rather than these words of inclusion. And what the Federal Circuit has said is what we mean by teaching a suggestion or a motivation, and it can be explicit or implicit, is anything that would have made this invention apparent to a practitioner at the time. That's what it's after. It wants to know, look, was it apparent to someone else, a practitioner at the time of the invention of Engelgau to take Asano and put the electronic throttle control on pin - -",
  "They do say that.",
  "I understand. Can I take you to their, the Federal Circuit's answer? It's two pages before the quote that I just gave you, page 19, there's another blocked quote. The Federal Circuit has explained what it's talking about when it means a motivation. They say that they have repeatedly held that there is an implicit motivation to combine. It exists not only when a suggestion may be gleaned from the prior art as a whole, that's a teaching, but when the improvement is technology independent and the combination of references results in a product or process. And these are common motivations. You would do it because it's more desirable because it's stronger, cheaper, faster, lighter, smaller, more durable, more efficient.",
  "For a practitioner, yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "No. Justice Breyer, you don't understand.",
  "The question is not -- I can illustrate it with this case. The question is not do you want more efficient pedals. If that's the test, then everything is obvious because we always want more efficient pedals, Justice, and I'll come back to this. It's always going to be the case that if your test is capability, every patent including the first three claims of this one is going to be obvious, because you're always capable of assembling a pedal. What it says, what the Federal Circuit says, is there a motivation to make this invention? Was there motivation, and this was the heart of the Federal Circuit's ruling in this case, their theory is that Asano renders our patent obvious. And the Federal Circuit said all right, what's the motivation to take Asano and take the electronic throttle control and make it responsive - -",
  "In a particular place, yes, that's correct. Justice Scalia, the reason these Federal Circuit judges were right notwithstanding your correct point which is, just to be clear, our invention is not limited to Asano. Our invention takes any fixed pivot adjustable pedal and any electronic throttle control and says combine it in a particular way. The Federal Circuit's point is their motion rests on Asano. The other side's theory is, we've got this invention, Engelgau. As has been pointed out, nobody did anything like this for 10 years. The other side comes back and says yes, that it would have been obvious to somebody who had an Asano to do the same thing basically. And so the Federal Circuit said okay, show us. If this isn't going to be hindsight, where we just give you the invention and you just say oh, I could have done that, they say give us any evidence that someone would have done what you say, which is take Asano, it's their argument, Asano - -",
  "You'll have to ask them, Justice Scalia. They filed a motion that it was obvious.",
  "Justice Scalia, the patent examiner gave us a patent, initially rejected this patent as obvious, decided that it wasn't after considering all of these things, a statutory presumption of validity attached under Section 282. So we have what we say is clear and convincing evidence, the question isn't presented here, but whatever. The other side comes in and tries to knock our patent out. They file a motion, and the motion rests on a piece of prior art. And so what the Federal Circuit said is, if we're not going to knock all of these patents out by hindsight, all we want to know is one thing and you know, on remand, they may well be able to prove it. We don't think they can. But all it's asking for is for the district court to make a finding that says the other side is right, that it would have been obvious to take Asano, which is their only example, and combine it with electronic throttle control in this way. That is what's so - -",
  "Okay. Let me answer it in a few different ways because I want to again specify and make clear what it is that the Federal Circuit says is included within teaching, suggestions, motivations. Then I want to turn to our invention and the affidavits in the case. The Federal Circuit has said, and I'll just -- you can come back to it for future reference. It's recorded at the bottom of page 19 of our brief. Common sense, common knowledge, common understandings are all included within teaching, suggestions or motivations.",
  "Yes, it did.",
  "If I could just clarify, Dystar - -",
  "Justice Kennedy, I agree that you have to distinguish two things rightly. The first is the state of the law as it exists now, and that's what we ask you to affirm. And that is, the Federal Circuit has made quite clear that its test is inclusive, and we think that that establishes that it's not necessary to add some new sort of undetermined test of - -",
  "Justice Scalia, I disagree for the following reasons, and that is: What the Federal Circuit is saying is that any amount of evidence, any form of evidence is relevant to answer a particular question. We have a question that we want answered. They have a question they want answered. Their question, the petitioner at least, I'm not sure about the Solicitor General, the petitioner's standard is, was somebody capable of doing this? We have a different question. Would it have been apparent to, and that's what we think the text requires, would it have been apparent to one skilled in the art? And so the Federal Circuit is saying whatever evidence you want to bring to bear - -",
  "No, I don't.",
  "Yes, that's right. And what the Federal Circuit is saying, you have -- what it's saying is, if you just look to capability, and that is, could you put Asano together on pin 54, you will miss the most important part of invention. And that is, invention isn't at the end when you put the two things together. Invention is finding the problem, deciding what pieces of the prior art to use, and deciding how to put them together. Everybody is always capable of, it will always be the case, I think, that a practitioner of the art can put them together. Remember the very point of a patent, when you look at our patent at the end of the case, we were required to explain it in great detail.",
  "Justice Kennedy, that's not - -",
  "Justice Kennedy, with respect, that is not a fair description of the Federal Circuit's test, and I will take you to the language that addressed this claim. It's at the bottom of page 18 of our brief and also at the top of 19, and we quote the Solicitor General's brief. The Solicitor General asserts to the contrary, that Federal Circuit precedent focuses attention exclusively on a search for teaching, suggestions and motivations in the prior art. That is not accurate. That was a quote from their brief. Here is a quote from the Solicitor General. It is from a new opinion of the Federal Circuit, but it is quoting, it is citing a series of old opinions from the Federal Circuit. Under our nonrigid motivation, suggestion, teaching test, a suggestion to combine need not be found in the prior art. And then there is the blocked quote that I read to Justice Breyer about making things cheaper, faster, lighter, common knowledge and common sense.",
  "Well, all that it adds is an analytical framework. It's an elaboration. The word \"obvious\" - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, the reason that the Federal Circuit disagrees and over 30 years this special court has elaborated this problem - - these judges alone, for example, have heard 300 cases on nonobviousness -- is that we need a guidance, we need guidance for the lower courts. We need to focus them on the right question, and for patent examiners and patent practitioners, and the right question is not is -- was someone merely capable of putting the two together. The right question is is there any reason to believe that it would have been apparent at the time of the invention to create this invention whether it's through a teaching, a suggestion, a motivation.",
  "Or anything else.",
  "They have.",
  "Justice Scalia, I this it would be surprising for this experienced Court and all of the patent bar -- remember, every single major patent bar association in the country has filed on our side - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, it turns out that actually is not accurate.",
  "Justice Scalia, that is not the point of these bar associations' either. These bar associations, including the American Bar Association, the American Intellectual Property Law Association, have lawyers on both sides of all these cases. They're looking for a test that has balance and that is what the Federal Circuit has done. Now, let me just say - -",
  "Justice Breyer, there is a big debate over whether or not there is too much patenting in this country and Congress is involved in the debate. What I don't think that there is that much debate about is whether a properly applied test that the Federal Circuit has articulated strikes the right balance, because that is why all of the patent bar associations have filed on our side, I think, and that is it takes account of the interests of both sides and that is it says, you're right, we have to be concerned about overpatenting, it says on the other hand we have to be very concerned about hindsight determinations of obviousness. But I do want to just step back and make a point about judicial administration. If the ultimate conclusion of this Court is that teaching, suggestion, motivation just boils down into an inquiry into obviousness, I still think that an opinion that says that and says that it, that this Court believes that it is embracing the bottom line of what the Federal Circuit has been doing, is the one that will be much better for the patent system and for the courts, because we have a real concern and that was articulated -- asked about at least by Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia, and that is if you purport to change the rules unnecessarily, if you say we're going off in a different direction, this test has -- underlies 160,000 patents issued every year. There is no rhyme or reason to applying a presumption of validity if you're saying the patent examiner applied the wrong test. And it will create genuine dramatic instability. The question I think is if you think instead that the teaching, suggestion, motivation test is incomplete, what is it that you want to add on top of it, and that's really what I didn't understand from the first half-hour. If it's going to be - -",
  "Justice Breyer, I think that's the dilemma that the Federal Circuit has been facing and is in answer to the criticism of Justice Scalia and that is the Federal Circuit isn't trying to articulate every single possible thing that can show you that it is obvious. What it's trying to do is focus you on the right question. It's trying to say, here's the process of invention: We have to figure out there's a problem. We have to figure out what prior art you're going to use. You have to figure out how you're going to combine it, and then you actually combine it. The act of invention, the thing that is the discovery that we want to encourage, is there in the middle. It's picking out the prior art and deciding how to put it together.",
  "No.",
  "Justice Kennedy, that's absolutely right, and I just want to focus you on why it is you now think I lose. We don't lose because that's not our invention. The Federal Circuit's point was that that this invention, claim 4, does not put an electronic throttle control together with an adjustable pedal. It's do it in a particular way. And let me take you in summary judgment in this case to the declarations and explain why it is that the experts here said you would not have done this. And I just have to urge the Court to cross the t's and dot the i's here and pay particular attention to exactly what it is that we claimed and exactly what it is that they said rendered our patent obvious.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, if I can take you to the big book that I asked you to - -",
  "Page 8, exactly. And that is, there are six different pieces to claim 4 and I'm going to take you to the relevant one. And they are the last two paragraphs here. We claim an electronic control attached to the support, so we specify where the electronic control is going to be. And then we say where, what that electronic control is going to be responsive to, and that's the next paragraph: Said apparatus characterized by said electronic control being responsive to said pivot, and that said pivot is defined above to be a fixed pivot. So here is the design. Let me take you to a picture if I could, and that's going to be at the back of the red brief. Engelgau is the third foldout page. It looks like this. What we say is there is going to be a fixed pivot. It's the red pivot in our picture, and there's going to be an electronic throttle control. That's actually on the - - you can't see it because you're looking straight at the device. That's on the next page. It's in green. There's going to be an electronic throttle control and it's going to respond to that pivot. So we specify where we're going to put the electronic throttle, on the support. That's what the Federal Circuit recognized was our invention. Now - -",
  "All right. Let me, Justice Breyer. The experts say it's not obvious and the reason nobody did it for 12 years and the reason that Asano was never combined with an electronic throttle control is explained in the record in this case and it's twofold. The first is, and I have to take you now to the picture of Asano because that's what the claim that is supposed to make our invention obvious is. They say you would have done this with Asano. What the experts say is this Asano thing, no one would ever use it at all.",
  "You get - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, we got a Ph.D. and somebody who had worked in pedal design for 25 years.",
  "And people who actually know this industry. And they, there are two things that come from the record in this case. The first is all of the experts and Engelgau himself testified not simply, no, this is not obvious, but you would have never used Asano to solve this or any other problem with an electronic throttle control.",
  "Justice Scalia, the way these cases are litigated, and properly so, is the other side says this would be obvious in light of a particular piece or collection of prior art. You may have a nonprior art motivation to combine them, but you're going to say something else already exists. They say it's Asano, and you're going to combine it with something else. This is their motion. Their argument, the argument that was presented to the Federal Circuit, was that you would take Asano. That's why - -",
  "Well, that is not -- we did not stick it on Asano. Nobody stuck it on Asano. They picked Asano because it was the prior art of adjustable pedal designs. Justice Scalia, you - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, that's not correct. Even under a capability standard, even under an extraordinary innovation standard, you are going to compare something to prior art. You're going to take what exists now and compare it to what existed before, no matter what standard you're employing. And what they did is they compared it to the prior art, which is Asano, and the Federal Circuit said, all right, you want to say it will come from Asano. It would not come from Asano for either of two reasons. The first is you would never use Asano. That's the expert testimony. The second is the reason given by the PTO in its brief in this case and that is you wouldn't put it on the pin that would render Engelgau obvious. You would put it somewhere else. They say that you would put it attached to a lever up high. What I want to make clear is two things. The first is, though the Federal Circuit has in recent opinions been quite emphatic about how inclusive its test is, it has consistently cited earlier Federal Circuit precedent and said that the other side and the people who claimed that their standard is too narrow and misguided are mischaracterizing it. And the second is, the judgment in this case quite explicitly acknowledges and implies the implicit teaching, suggestion, motivation standard. So I don't want you to have the mistaken impression that there has been some radical change in Federal Circuit law. But no matter what one thinks about the differential between Federal Circuit law today and Federal Circuit law a year ago or two years ago, there is a quite considerable cost by articulating a desire to head off in a new direction, because there will be dramatic instability in the patent system, the incalculable investments that underlie current patents. There is nothing fundamentally not functional about how the Federal Circuit is approaching this question. It has had decades to look at this to try and elaborate a standard. This court in cases like Sakraida and - -",
  "Justice Scalia, if you actually believe that, then you just don't believe the judges in the Federal Circuit because in each of these opinions they say quite explicitly we are not changing it.",
  "I do think that you can find outliers. I think that's fair. These judges as I said have heard 300 of these cases. There are mistakes in the Patent Office; there are mistakes by judges. The Federal Circuit explains in Dembiczak what it was actually looking for is an explanation. It wasn't saying that you had to use the prior art, and it has tried to make quite clear that the law is not that you have to have prior art. Or that those decisions here today. You can't take, in a system that produces so many patents, and say ah, look at this side swing patent, or the garbage bags, and draw from that the conclusion that the system is fundamentally broken. Justice Breyer, I meant to come back to that. We can look through the studies, we cite a series of empirical studies in our brief that have looked at this problem, the rhetorical claim that the obviousness rule is leading to gross over-patenting.",
  "Two things. The first is - - and they do arise from the other side's motion under Asano. First you wouldn't have chosen Asano. The second is the Federal Circuit explained -- excuse me, the Solicitor General explains that you would have put the electronic throttle control somewhere else, technically on what's called pivot 60, which would not, would have rendered, would have not have rendered Engelgau obvious.",
  "That is the extent of the entire invention.",
  "An adjustable pedal that has a nonmoving pivot, yes.",
  "Yes it does. It does. I promise.",
  "On the support - -",
  "And then a particular kind of adjustable pedal. That's the state of the record so far.",
  "Does the pivot turn?",
  "Yes.",
  "The pivot rotates, but it doesn't -- the difference is that the pivot doesn't move with the adjustment of the pedal. It spins around, of course, you have to have something that you can -- but the prior art, almost all that involved a pivot that when the pedal moved out, the electronic throttle control would go with it.",
  "That would be a motivation. That's absolutely right, why you would want to improve on the part. The Federal Circuit said that you would never do it in the way that was described here. You may be able to prove it some other way on a remand. This was a very specific motion, and the Federal Circuit faithfully addressed the claim of obviousness that was presented to it.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The notion that the proud men who framed the Constitution would believe it reasonable to go out and arrest someone for a non-arrestable offense and not only do that, but having committed that trespass at common law, to further search them, is I think an extreme proposition and one that they would not have accepted.",
  "Your Honor, I do - -",
  "No, Your Honor, I disagree, for the reason that -- and there are obviously -- I'm not here to tell the Court what its own precedents mean. But Atwater makes quite clear that at common law this was something that was subject to legislate ive override, and that's what was reasonable at common law when the Constitution was framed. And that is, legislatures sometimes said that you could arrest and sometimes said that you couldn't. But two things were undisputable, I think, and that is when you did arrest illegally that was unreasonable - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "For a few reasons. First, Virginia does take this quite seriously. The officer can be fired for violating the statute. That's no small thing. The second is I wouldn't assume that Virginia believes and the Virginia legislature believed that the evidence would not be suppressed, because for reasons that I'll explain in a minute the Virginia legislature was triggering a long line of its court cases that say if you arrest someone for a non-arrestable offense, the Fourth Amendment is violated, and the application of the exclusionary rule has never been questioned in that context.",
  "That's right. I don't question its application, but neither does Virginia, Your Honor.",
  "That's -- I think that that's right. That also happened in California v. Greenwood, you may recall, Mr. Chief Justice, where there was some discussion at oral argument about would we believe the exclusionary rule should be applied here. That question had not been preserved. That case is on remand in the California Supreme Court.",
  "Whren is different in several different ways. The first is that that was a challenge to the stop, not the search incident to arrest. The claim was that the officers under a local D.C. Government regulation did not have the power to make a traffic stop because there was a local regulation that said if you're not in uniform and if you're not in a police car, a marked car, you shouldn't make those traffic stops. So, it's different on a couple of different actions. The nature of the constitutional challenge, the nature of the law that's being evoked, the local regulation rather than legislation, I think, are the principal ones. Here we're dealing with something quite fundamental, and I haven't gotten to this Court's precedents applying the common law rule that I described at the beginning, so if I could do and then compare Whren. Post -- define the common law, every since Weeks, which is the first case of this Court to recognize the search incident arrest exception, all the way through Di Re, Miller, Johnson, Ker, DeFillippo, those are five cases that confront the question in this case, I believe that genuinely confront it; is not dictum, it is holding. Those cases confront the question: Can you have a constitutional search incident to an illegal arrest? Illegal there not being unconstitutional, but a violation of State law.",
  "The court hasn't ever confronted that question. The places -- the line of cases that I described were one of two things, Positive State legislation enacted by the legislature or common law. It has never dealt with the locality question. Whren suggests that maybe a local police regulation is too variable. We would win under either rule. The -- I think the core reason you would draw the line at legislation is because this -- the Fourth Amendment is not just an instrumental thing designed to do good. It is, as designed, to apply common law concepts of reasonableness, which was the foundation - -",
  "That's right. And your question, Justice Alito, is designed to test what I mean by unlawful in terms of what sources -- the State constitution, legislation, local police practices.",
  "If I have conveyed that impression, I am sorry. I did not intend to. Our rule is that if it's unlawful. All I'm saying is the Court could conclude that local police regulations, for example, are too variable to -- and Whren calls them \"trivialities,\" so we won't pick them up.",
  "As are the laws of whether it's a crime at all, as are under Indianapolis v. Edmund and lots of other cases where the court - -",
  "No, as Justice Ginsburg suggests, you have to have probable cases to arrest. Cases like Berkemer, Seth - -",
  "I'm sorry. By that phrase I mean there is a constitutional component. Part of the constitutional floor is that you have to have sufficient cause. That's a guarantee of the Fourth Amendment. This Court's cases make clear you can't go below - -",
  "That is necessary but not a sufficient condition, Mr. Chief Justice. There's obviously a -- the constitutional floor includes the element of the -- the degree of proof that's required by this Court precedents.",
  "I view those as the same thing. We may be just having - -",
  "In that sense, absolutely. I just wanted to make sure I understood the terminology. That's correct. But let me make quite clear that we are discussing in the first half hour and the second half hour I think two slightly different things. The first half hour focused on the constitutionality of the arrest vel non, which is at issue in Atwater, for example, and at issue -- not even in Whren, which is just a traffic stop. I am focusing on the somewhat different point. There is a line of cases that deals with the constitutionality of the search incident to arrest and it says because at common law you could not search someone pursuant to an arrest that was a trespass, the search itself is unconstitutional. So if at the time of the framing a Federal officer, a Federal marshal, at the time of the framing had the power to arrest them for State law offenses, as they still do under the OLC opinions. If a Federal marshal had gone up to someone who's committing a completely trivial offense, Atwater recognizes there are offenses at common law that are not arrestable. That would be a trespass and to search the person incident to that arrest would have violated the Fourth Amendment, we believe. It would have been unreasonable. When Mapp applies the Fourth Amendment to the States, it would have been - -",
  "That's right. At common law and under the Fourth Amendment, that's right. You look to the positive source of authority, which is State law authority to arrest or a common law authority to arrest. That would not be unconstitutional. That -- that rule also make sense as a question of the structure of our democracy. Remember, it puts in the hands of the legislature, which can be held responsible for the decision to make a trivial offense - -",
  "No. There are times - -",
  "That's right. That is - - there are traditions that are rooted in the common law, that the search incident to arrest here was pursuant to a trespass at common law that was completely unreasonable.",
  "This is I think the hardest question for us, and so if I could have the time to give you a couple of answers. The first is remember your instrumental point is that the officer has the person, they need to protect themselves. We know that is not itself -- and I'm going to give you a couple of answers -- that is not itself to make the search constitutional because everyone agrees that if the arrest was unconstitutional, then the search, notwithstanding the exigencies that exist under Chimel and like cases all the way back, exist. So it's not enough that the officer has to protect himself. The reason - -",
  "Yes. I understand this. Justice Souter, I understand. I was just trying to get to your -- what I think is the greatest sort of logical force: The officer need to protect himself. Now, to get to the harder case, which is yours, and that is accept that the arrest is constitutional. We of course don't do that. We believe that there isn't a sufficient interest to make it reasonable, but you posit otherwise. The reason is given by Justice Powell's concurrence in Robinson, which is the fundamental search and seizure arrest case, and he says when the person is lawfully arrested they have engaged in conduct that they know can subject them to arrest, they have a reduced expectation of privacy. So while it's the case that the governmental interest remains the same -- protect the officer, find the evidence -- the other side of the Fourth Amendment balance is fundamentally different, because when a person has engaged in conduct which they know does not subject them to arrest they do not have a reduced expectation of privacy. This individual had every reason to believe dating back to the traditions of common law, to positive State law, that they would not be searched incident to arrest.",
  "Can I just correct one thing? And that is it does not depend on Justice Powell's use of the word unlawful. I believe to rule against us, Justice Souter, that you will have to overrule the line of cases from Di Re to DeFillipo. Those are on point. Now you may decide - -",
  "No, Justice Kennedy, and that's why I focused so much on searches incident to arrest. There are times when State law is incorporated into the Fourth Amendment, and everybody agrees that regulatory searches are; inventory searches are, there are times when it isn't. And California v Greenwood is not one and there's a logical reason for it. And that is that the premise of when you were deciding in a -- in a trash search, this Court's document looked at two things. The first is, is there a reasonable expectation of privacy, and if there is do we balance the interest? California v Greenwood says there was no reasonable expectation of privacy because that's evaluated as a societal matter. I'm focusing on a very narrow question that doesn't disturb any other doctrines.",
  "I think Cooper v California is a very good case for us, because Cooper and all its progeny say that State law has to authorize and determine the validity of the inventory search. If you violate the State regulations on when you conduct an inventory search, you violated the Fourth Amendment.",
  "Well, I think it is a terribly difficult rule to administer when you try to decide, well if this is a law that sometimes allows arrest and sometimes does not. It is an infinitely more administrable rule on our side, where we say to the police officers, you have the power to arrest or not and that's what determines - -",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, remember, we have one standard for an officer on the street, and that is, look -- do, if you're allowed to arrest, you can arrest, and that's what will determine the constitutionality of the search incident to arrest. The Government posits two different standards that govern the officer's conduct: a Federal one and State one. But let me also get to your point, Justice Kennedy, that you are worried that are all kinds of these State laws. There's -- you know, are you out of your jurisdiction , are you wearing a uniform? What we think that the common law was concerned with, and this line -- this Court's court line of cases from Di Re to DeFillipo is a more fundamental judgment. It's like the judgment whether it's a crime at all. The police power of the State is most fundamentally, is this a crime, can we arrest for it, someone for it, so that we will hold them? And those are the judgments: is its arrestable or not? And not these other little things that - -",
  "This is a very -- just as a court note, there's no other State that has one of these statutes. Just in terms of your thinking about whether this is a common practice, we haven't been able to find any others, and even in Virginia, it's only to a small body of offenses. But even taking as a given - - Justice Stevens, I think doctrinally, as Justice Powell says in Robinson, the notion is that people go out into the world and engage in conduct, and we expect them to know the law. Sometimes that's an unreasonable expectation, but it's the only premise that this Court --",
  "Chief Justice Roberts, I do disagree. Post-Cooper, in South Dakota v. Opperman, even if the police officers label it an inventory search -- the person says, oh, we were just trying to keep track of everything, so nobody doubts they were really inventorying things -- the Court has said it's the - - the practice is, the State practice is - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I disagree. This Court has said many times, and indeed squarely held in Johnson, where the evidence was suppressed, that it has to be an arrest that is lawful under State law.",
  "Yes.",
  "Not -- I don't think that language is relevant for the following reason: What the Court said in Cooper was that the seizure of the car, which is analogous to the arrest here, right? They seized my client's person; they seized the car. The Court said because the seizure of the car was lawful under State law, then the search incident to was. And let me just read to you from Coolidge versus - -",
  "The State law did not speak to it either way, but -- it didn't speak to it either way.",
  "Justice Scalia, I disagree. In any event, post-Cooper, South Dakota v. Opperman, as the conversation between the Chief Justice and I was just explaining, is perfectly clear that the inventory search has to be authorized pursuant to State regulation. If after Cooper this is perfectly settled, there really isn't - -",
  "Assuming the Court decides that the question was not waived because it wasn't briefed, the reason is that this Court's exclusionary rule precedents look to something else, and that is: Did the evidence follow directly from the unconstitutional conduct? And here it did.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I think that illustrates the point I am willing to accept, and that is there are times that State law is relevant under this Court's doctrines; there are times it isn't. Welsh v. Wisconsin, for example, is another example where the Court looks squarely to the State law of whether and how serious the offense is. My point is that there is a very particular doctrine that is in play here that deals with searches incident to arrest.",
  "I don't know. That is the true answer, because no State has such a law. It would depend, I think, on whether the arrest itself satisfied constitutional - -",
  "The reason is I think the one -- that the Court has never looked to the State law remedies in Di Re, Miller, Johnson, Ker, and DeFillippo, and that it looks to what the common law would look to, which is: Is the arrest legal or not? I also would repeat what I said to Justice Breyer, and that is I would not assume that Virginia believes that the exclusionary rule wouldn't apply because those precedents trigger the Fourth Amendment. But, Justice Breyer, I do want to come back to your question about, okay, Whren. The important differences are: Remember Whren didn't just say that things about whether people can be arrested are trivialities. It's at the core of the Fourth Amendment. The Court would never say that arrest is a triviality. What it's talking about is what concerned Justice Kennedy, and that is the kind of rule in Whren, which is the guy had to be in a police uniform and driving around in a marked police cruiser, which could vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the Court felt that was more of a triviality. This is a much more fundamental statement - -",
  "Justice Kennedy, I don't - -",
  "We have proposed two alternative rules. Fundamentally, that's right. And that is - -",
  "I'm sorry. You're right: On our core condition, the evidence would not be suppressed. The reason is that we think the most fundamental State judgment here is whether this offense is arrestable. Alternatively, the Court could apply a rule that just says State officers, if they're allowed to arrest lawfully, then that will generate a constitutional search incident to arrest. We would win under either either rule. I think the core of our case is a much simpler rule that simply says if the State has decided this thing is not arrestable, it obviously doesn't have an interest in the arrest that would outweigh the individual's expectation of privacy -- remember search incident to arrest is an exigency. There is no - -",
  "To -- that's correct. If we are going to follow the common law and the rule that is articulated, I think, in every single search-incident-to-arrest case, that it has to be a lawful arrest, that's right. It will take up all of State arrest law. I'm not trying to hide from that fact. But the Court has never had a problem with that. In all of those cases all through time, it has never had any problem with administerability or anything else with a rule that simply says to the police officer: If you're allowed to arrest him, arrest him; if you're not, you're not, and you can't search him constitutionally. That is - -",
  "I do when it comes to the search-incident-to-arrest cases. I think two things. This is my understanding of the Court's precedents. The Court has said if you have probable cause, you can arrest. In every case that it has said that, it has been lawful at State law to arrest -- to arrest. So the Court has confronted this question when it comes to the constitutionality of the arrest vel non. There is a second line of cases that deals specifically with this search-incident-to-arrest doctrine, and in every one of those, it has both said it has to be a lawful arrest. And then in five separate cases, it has explained what it meant by a \"lawful arrest.\" And it can't be dictum. The evidence in Johnson versus the United States was suppressed. It has to have been the holding of the court. We think that that is a sensible rule for two reasons: It is what Framers meant. It cannot be the case that a Federal marshal, at the time of the framing, could go and just arrest somebody for a completely trivial offense -- that was a trespass -- and then search them. And, second, Justice Powell's concurrence in Robinson makes a lot of sense. But if you engage in constitutional - -",
  "That is not what the Court said. The Court was quite clear on this, Justice Alito. I just don't think there's two ways about it. It was quite on all five of these cases. I'm not saying the Court couldn't have decided the case otherwise. That's true. I think the Court could have had a different rationale, but the point is it didn't. All of these cases cite each other. It's a uniform line of authority. It's not an accident. It's not - -",
  "Well, then -- I don't know how you pronounce it either, but I do know that Johnson, Ker, and DeFillippo are cases that are against the State. They are not supervisory authority cases.",
  "Well, I disagree.",
  "Yes.",
  "May I? There is no claim of good faith here which could be raised to a Fourth Amendment argument in a later case. There's absolutely no mistake. And we don't want to encourage officers to conduct illegal arrests and search people.",
  "That's it.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When the Texas courts in this case reinstated the Petitioner's direct appeal, the Texas Court of Appeals decided that appeal like it would decide any other case on direct review. We filed a petition for discretionary review in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which was denied, and it was considered like any other appeal would be. The question presented by this case is whether the final judgment that indisputably results from those rulings triggers the one-year statute of limitations to file a Federal habeas corpus application. The statute that governs that question is reproduced in the blue brief at page 1. Section 2244(d)(1)(A) prescribes \"a 1-year period of limitation that shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of the State court. The limitation period shall run from the latest of -- and it identifies four dates, the first of which is \"the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of time for seeking such review.\"",
  "That's right, Justice Kennedy. Subsection (A) resolves this case by its plain terms. Now, the Fifth Circuit decided this case - - this issue, I'm sorry -- in 2004 in a case called Salinas, and it thought that the factual scenario of the case was more logically covered by subsection (d)(2) of the statute, which is on page 2 of the blue brief. And that provision is the tolling provision, and it says: \"The time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under the subsection.\" And the Fifth Circuit's view in that Salinas case was that the better way of looking at this is that when the State post-conviction court awarded relief of further direct review, all of that should be regarded as part of the post-conviction process. But four years after -- three years after the Fifth Circuit decided Salinas, this Court decided Lawrence v. Florida, and Lawrence disposes of the Fifth Circuit's logic in Salinas, because Lawrence says that when the post-conviction court, here the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, issues its mandate the application for post-conviction review is no longer pending. And so there isn't any reason to believe that Congress thought this factual scenario was covered by the tolling provisions of (d)(2).",
  "It doesn't depend on it, Mr. Chief Justice. We don't have to reach that question because, as I have said in answer to Justice Kennedy's question, you can resolve this under (d)(1). But I was just trying to explain why the Fifth Circuit, which struggled with how to handle this scenario, was wrong in thinking it was governed by the tolling provision.",
  "In many cases, but not all, including this one. The difference is that if you regard this as governed by tolling, that the second - - what we will call for purposes of the argument, just so we know, the second appeal, so the appeal that's granted by the post-conviction report, if you regard the proper way of reading 2244 to be you have to regard that as being tolled and the start date is the dismissal of the original appeal, if the State Petitioner seeks post-conviction review more than one year after the dismissal of the first appeal, his Federal time is done. So, this - -",
  "It is -- it is the case that Congress wanted it done within one year. The question presented by this case is one year of what?",
  "So, there are four different possible start dates. We know that the Fifth Circuit was wrong in the Salinas case when it said that Congress envisioned only a linear time period stopped only by tolling that would run from the first disposition of the case, because 2244(d)(1)(B), (C), and (D) are all provisions under which the time can expire and then be restarted. So, what we think Congress wanted when it was picking start dates and the start date in (d)(1)(A), the one that usually applies, is it wanted the State courts on direct review to be done with the case, finish it off. Then the State petitioner will have one year to start the State post-conviction process and when that's done go on to Federal court. The reason we think Congress wanted to include the second appeal, the conclusion of the second appeal, as the trigger is that what's going on in the Federal district court is you are trying to decide if the State court's disposition of the case is contrary to clearly established law as established by this Court. And you won't know that, you won't even know what the Federal district court is supposed to be reviewing, until the conclusion of the second appeal. If I could just illustrate that, in the joint appendix at page 43, is the State court opinion in this case. The Texas Court of Appeals decided this case and resolved his, the Petitioner's, Federal constitutional claims. And it only did that in the second appeal. And that's what Congress was concerned with the Federal district court's reviewing. It's - - when this opinion is issued and then the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which is their highest court in criminal cases, denies review, then it's logical for the time period to start.",
  "Okay, can I answer that question, Justice Ginsburg, in two parts? First most directly, I want to explain our position with respect to (B) and (D) and then I want to discuss the broad thematic concern that's raised by our case. Here's the troubling fact by our case, and that is the prospect that multiple State defendants will take more than a year, and I would like to deal with that thematic point and explain why I don't think that's a concern. But to start directly with your point, (B) and (D), assuming that they apply for a moment, will only accomplish the following -- and then I want to explain why I don't think they would apply. But even if they apply, what they would do is defer the start date of the one year. So on the facts in this case, one year after -- 11 months or so after the Texas Court of Appeals erroneously dismissed the Petitioner's first direct appeal without giving him the opportunity to file a pro se brief, he found out. On the State's view, the one-year Federal habeas corpus time would be deferred for 11 months, and that is a very generous defendant-favoring position for Texas to take in this Court. If it then starts, it doesn't -- that reading does not accomplish what Congress wanted in 2244, because the State prisoner, though the time will have been deferred for a year, will still have to file for Federal habeas corpus within a year, notwithstanding the fact that he will get a second direct appeal. So he will be proceeding in both courts. His start date will have been deferred for 11 months, but he nonetheless one year later must appear in a Federal district court in Texas, even though on post-conviction review in the State courts he is sent back to direct review.",
  "That's correct. And that's the argument about Lawrence. That argument is not sustainable in light of Lawrence. Just to say that you have their argument exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice, the State's position is, as the Fifth Circuit held in the Salinas case, that when you get relief on post-conviction review and you are sent back to the State system, (d)(2) continues to apply, but that is not correct. The tolling stops, and that is because, as Lawrence held, the application which is his post-conviction application in the State court, saying that I was deprived of my right to appeal, is no longer pending. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has issued its mandate. So that's why this anomaly arises under the application of (B) or (D) that we don't think Congress could have intended. Now, Justice Ginsburg, there is a second part to my answer, and that is the specific point about whether (B) and (D) do by their terms apply; and here we are in the anomalous position that if, again, Texas is arguing very defendant-favoring readings of (B) and (D) and I, representing the habeas Petitioner, am in the unusual role of questioning whether these later start dates apply. But here our -- the lower courts I think it is clear would say that (B) and (D) don't apply. To take you to the textual -- the text of the statute, again, (B) appears at the bottom of page 1 of the blue brief; and that has a start date of the date on which the impediment for filing an application created by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by such State action. And the lower courts, as we explained in our brief, pretty uniformly conclude that the failure to give a defendant notice that his appeal has been dismissed is not an impediment created by State action to him filing a Federal habeas corpus application. And so their attempt to grapple with our unusual facts has -- would substantially broaden the application of subsection (B).",
  "It's just -- it's not regarded as an impediment. The -- the courts -- the lower courts take quite literally that there has to be an impediment. The lower court decisions grappling with what an impediment is deal with the situation where a prison warden, for example, does not allow you access to the prison mails or somehow access to the legal resources you in order to be able to file it. He won't deliver the habeas corpus application. (D) is even easier, I think, and that is the deadline starts from the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence. And the reason the State is not right about that provision and does not even really seriously argue it is that the claims referenced in (D) are the claims that are presented in the Federal habeas corpus application. Here that's the claim that he had ineffective assistance of trial counsel and that the judge was biased against him. They are not the claim that he received -- that he was denied the right to an appeal. And so it just - - there is no textual basis to say that the later start date would apply under (D).",
  "No, sir. We think that you have to look at substance. As -- the language that we use in a footnote in our reply brief addressing this is whether the proceeding has the hallmarks of direct review. There are two States that do have a procedure, South Carolina and Delaware, in which you can raise your claim on post-conviction review that you were deprived of your right to a direct appeal. And the post-conviction court has the power to decide that on post-conviction review. We haven't found a case in which they actual exercised the power, but it appears that 48 of the 50 States deal with this problem the way Texas does, and that is the relief that you get is that you are sent back into the direct review system. And then we think it's covered quite plainly by the text of (d)(1). When that direct review is over, direct review concludes by its plain terms. Now, Justice Ginsburg, I had said that I wanted to come back and deal with the thematic problem that might concern the Court about our case, and that is the prospect that we will have defendants filing State post-conviction applications more than a year late, which could trouble the Court. As the Chief Justice indicated, Congress had a concern with moving this process along. In addition just to the plain text of the statute which we think is controlling, there are I think three points. The first is there are State limitations principles that get these State prisoners to file their applications in a timely way. Now, in the great majority of States that's set by a number of years. In some States like Texas it's applied by the principle of laches. And the important point and the reason we are here today is that Texas, for whatever reason -- and the time limitations are intended to protect Texas here - - decided not to assert that his State post-conviction application was untimely. It didn't object to the granting of relief to the Petitioner at all. The second reason, in addition to the State's own limitations period, is that the AEDPA one-year limitations period has real force. In the great majority of cases in which a State defendant is going to allege that he was deprived of his right to an appeal and raise that claim on State post-conviction review, he's going to lose that claim. The -- the States don't give this stuff out like candy, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is not, you know, constantly reinstating defendant's appeals. And defendants know that. And unless you prevail on this claim, you are stuck with the one-year AEDPA time that runs from the dismissal of your first appeal. And so you have every incentive in the world to get into State court quickly. And the third is just the general notion that defendants in non-capital cases don't have a real incentive to just delay before instituting a State post-conviction review. And - -",
  "I -- can I just ask one point of clarification? If he instituted it more than a year after the dismissal of the first proceeding, he is out of time, because there is only one final judgment, and that is the original dismissal.",
  "Okay. If he instituted it -- can I just say six months? So six months' after the first dismissal, the Petitioner appears in the Texas post-conviction court. At that point (d)(2) starts to apply, because he has a properly filed application for State post-conviction relief. The State court -- the State post-conviction court takes three months to dispose of it, a year to dispose of it; it doesn't matter. When the State post-conviction court is done and in your hypothetical denies him relief, he has six months left to go to federal district court. (d)(2) operates as it should. While the case is sitting in the State post-conviction court - -",
  "That is correct, because he has not exhausted his claim. When the claim is that you were denied your right to a direct appeal, the only place that you can raise that claim is State post-conviction review. Federal habeas corpus requires you to exhaust your available State remedies. Your available State remedy for that is State post-conviction review. He may not appear in Federal district court. The district court I think would abuse its discretion in staying a plainly unexhausted claim. That wouldn't be good cause, as this Court has said, for it.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, the State, as I said, did not raise this argument in the place where we think it's appropriate, and that no record was built on laches. It does -- it does have that feel. I do think that the Court's opinion could make clear that this anomaly arises from the fact that, despite the fact that the Texas courts have made clear that there are laches principles and limitations - -",
  "It is for the State to raise, and we cite our Texas authority for that in our reply brief, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "Justice Kennedy, that is section 11 -- article 11.07.",
  "I do not believe you do. And the reason is that article 11.07 is just the general Texas post-conviction regime. The procedure that is used for reinstating direct appeals is developed through caselaw, not by statute. Justice Scalia, there was a final point that I was about to make when I said, look, defendants in non-capital cases have every incentive, if they want to get relief, to move their cases along. The Court may be concerned about capital cases where there is the opposite concern, that defendants will try and keep their cases alive, if you will. And Texas recognizes this point and has a deadline by statute that is quite short for instituting post-conviction relief in capital cases. They simply recognize that laches is the way to handle the prospect of delay in non-capital cases. We don't think there is any reason for this Court to override that determination, to second guess the judgment of the Texas court that the judgment is not final until the reinstated appeal concludes.",
  "I have to ask one question, sir, because the answer is it depends.",
  "The question is, when he files for Federal habeas corpus the first time in your hypothetical, I take it he doesn't raise the claim - -",
  "He raises a substantive claim, like the judge was biased against him and the like?",
  "That is regarded as a first habeas application, because the claim did not -- I think the judgment did not arise until later. I don't believe a case like that has arisen. I think - -",
  "The strange thing is that it is an exhausted set of claims. So it is a proper Federal habeas corpus application, because he went to - -",
  "It's proper in terms of it being exhausted. It would be dismissed, to be clear. So his appeal was denied, right? He doesn't file an appeal in the hypothetical. So when he shows up in Federal district court, it's an exhausted -- it is -- he would be dismissed for failure to exhaust, in fact, because he didn't pursue his - -",
  "But he -- but he was - -",
  "Your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, I took it to be - -",
  "I think, though, I can tell you this with some confidence. The way that this thing happened in Texas is the way that it happens in the States, and the way it happens in Federal courts as well under 2255. You file a post-conviction application. You say: I was denied entirely my right of appeal by something the court did or something my lawyer did, and then you get to pursue your appeal. And that's what Congress wanted the Federal district court on habeas corpus to review. So logically, the one year begins to run after that's done.",
  "Well, in many cases, Mr. Chief Justice, of course, the State appeals can take 20 years to go up and down and back and forth from State post-conviction review. We also have the rather commonplace case in which a defendant doesn't file a notice of appeal at all, as in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, but the court of appeal says, you know, for good cause we are going to let you file this appeal late. And it's quite clear in that scenario, so your appeal is reinstated there, too, because you were 20 days late, 30 days late on the filing deadline. It's quite clear and I think agreed in all of those situations that, while Congress did want you to move expeditiously, the question is move expeditiously from when. And it's from the State court's direct review, finishing the conclusion of direct review. And we know that Congress recognized that that wouldn't always be one year from the end of the case the first time around from the structure of (B), (C), and (D); and the fact that if there were a tie-breaker at all, it is that the statute shall -- the limitation period shall run from the latest of several days. So Congress quite clearly contemplated that there would be multiple possible start dates.",
  "I'm not sure I understand the -- the hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice. If -- if you lose your post-conviction application for it?",
  "Well, he is challenging his original -- Federal habeas corpus is reviewing the judgment in his case. He has, since there was only one conclusion of direct review in his case, one year measured from the first dismissal, tolled only during the period of pending post-conviction application.",
  "He is challenging the fact that he was denied a direct appeal, which is a challenge to his actual conviction. That is a constitutional flaw in his conviction. And so it runs from the conclusion of the direct review, not from anything related to post-conviction review.",
  "The fact that the State post-conviction court did not remedy a violation of his constitutional rights on direct review does not create a new constitutional violation. The constitutional violation in your hypothetical arises on direct review.",
  "I don't think so. And if I could just explain -- give an analogy. Say he could make the same allegation about ineffective assistance of trial counsel. You can always try and recharacterize your claim as the post-conviction court violated my constitutional rights by not vindicating my original constitutional rights, my right to constitutionally effective counsel at trial or on appeal. And the Federal habeas courts uniformly reject those efforts to recharacterize. The constitutional violation arises in the original criminal case.",
  "I understand, Mr. Chief Justice. I think that body of cases is relatively narrow as it arises, and it also isn't implicated here. If the Court has no further questions, I will reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you, sir. A few short points. Justice Stevens, if later on you have an opportunity to look at footnote 15 on page 42 of the blue brief, we cite eight cases, and there are more, in which these out-of-time appeals really did find meritorious claims. And I -- so I don't want the Court to be left with the impression that this is much ado about nothing. The rule of law will actually be quite significant. Two small corrections to things my friend inadvertently said or impressions he may have inadvertently left. He says there are 19 States that have no statute of limitations, but that omits the very many of those States that apply laches, and the fact that the State of Texas here did not assert the untimeliness of the State post-conviction proceeding is pretty much I think why we are ultimately here. He also said that there is only one State opinion finding laches, as if, I think, to create the impression that Texas courts don't take laches seriously. Most of these are disposed of without opinions. But the more relevant important is that there aren't Texas State opinions rejecting claims of laches. What the Texas courts have made is that the Texas A.G.'s office has to assert the defense of laches, as is true everywhere and is true in this Court's jurisprudence as well. The final two points I wanted to make are about (d)(1)(B) and (d)(2), all of which, I think honestly reduced to Justice Kennedy's point, is that the relevant provision is (d)(1), whatever else is going on in the case. But Justice Scalia and the Chief Justice came back to the point about whether this is an impediment, and my friend kept answering it is State action, and the Court would say, but is it an impediment? And at page 20 of our reply brief we must cite eight or ten cases, three of which notably are from Texas; there were litigated by the Texas Attorney General's office, that make it clear that the failure to give the notice of the opinion is not an impediment to filing post-conviction review, and the Court would be rewriting a lot of habeas corpus law to rule for the State of Texas here.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As this case comes to the Court, two things I think are uncontested. The first is that at this trial, the prosecution suppressed all of the evidence in its files that went to the single most important contested issue of the case, and that's whether the defendant was a drug addict and committed the crimes in an amphetamine psychosis. And the second is that as soon as the Petitioner found out about the suppression, he presented his Brady claim to the State courts. In this - -",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there are a couple issues that you've raised. Can I first address the question of whether it's encompassed within the question presented on the merits, because the question is, well, is this all just an academic exercise because the procedural default holding wouldn't change the ultimate outcome in the case? The answer is that it is, we think, fairly encompassed within the question presented, and I can explain why, including with respect to the text of the question presented. The court of appeals in this case disavowed deciding the merits of the Brady claim. And let me take you to the petition appendix, and that is at page 22a and again at 24a. So I'm just trying to walk you through what the court of appeals said at the very top of 22a: \"We, therefore, will not disturb our decision that Cone's Brady claims are procedurally defaulted and not before this court.\" And then on 24a, at the bottom of the first full paragraph, the last sentence: \"We again find that Cone's claims are procedurally defaulted and we reject Cone's request to reconsider his Brady claims.\"",
  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. I was not going to stop, and I was going to just point out the dilemma that I faced when I wrote the cert petition. So, on the one hand, they disavowed deciding it, and then quite clearly there are some -- there are a couple paragraphs there, you've start -- you've stated one, the next paragraph says the same thing -- talking about the merits of the Brady claim. So here's the dilemma that I faced in writing the cert petition. They say they're not deciding the Brady claim, but then they talk quite clearly about it. So I expressed - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I disagree, and let me explain why. If you go to the cert petition, of course, which you have in front of you, starting on page 26 - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and I - - the document, of course -- let's -- let's talk about the text of the question presented, and then I'll give my explanation. So, the question presented it says is \"Whether Petitioner is entitled to Federal habeas review of his claim that the State suppressed material evidence in violation of Brady v. Maryland?\" We thought - -",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I have explained why it is, and if I can then take you to the rest of the body of the cert petition. The doctrine that I'm going to rely on is the question -- the issue is, is it fairly encompassed within the question presented? So the dilemma I have described to you is the one I faced. The court of appeals said it wasn't deciding the Brady claim, then it talked about it. Then -- so, in the body of the cert petition, which you all looked to in my experience in determining what's fairly encompassed, there are two headings for the reasons for granting the writ. The one is the procedural one. Then starting on page 26, we present the merits question of the merits of the Brady claim.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, can I -- can I answer the -- finish answering my question about the body of the cert petition and then come to this? I'm glad to do it in whichever order. I do have a couple of important points to make on your very understandable question about what's fairly encompassed within the question presented. The particular place that I want to point the Court to, so starting on 26, we lay out our argument about the merits, and then footnote 6 explains quite clearly to the Court -- the Court sometimes has a concern that parties are smuggling questions into the case in front of it, and that's clearly what did not happen here. We explain our dilemma about the Sixth Circuit saying it wasn't deciding the merits, and then footnote 6, because the panel -- this is on page - -",
  "Footnote 6 at page 30 of the cert petition, sir. \"Because the panel disavowed deciding the merits of Petitioner's Brady claim in the language that I quoted you to, and discussed the question only in dictum, Petitioner's counsel have concluded that it would not be permissible to state that issue as a distinct question presented.\"",
  "Sir, the -- but it was disavowing it, I think, as an alternate holding. The court of appeals opinion is not clear. It disclaims the power even to decide the Brady claim. And if I can just finish the footnote, it really is only two sentences long: \"This Court could, of course, reach the issue either by directing the parties to brief it or by recognizing that it is fairly encompassed within the question as described in the petition.\" Then the brief in opposition to cert is only about the merits of the claim, and our reply brief on cert, if you go to page 4 of the cert reply brief, then clearly identifies this question for the Court again.",
  "Well, I agree it was perfectly fair for them. But the question that I'm trying to address, and I apologize if I've misunderstood the question, is did we sufficiently identify for you all in the question that we presented the Court what the issues were, and so that you were agreeing to decide the procedural question, the merits question, and - -",
  "In 1980, August of 1980.",
  "Yes.",
  "Very soon thereafter, within a couple of years. This -- let me answer that and make sure that I've resolved - -",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "He's around 50 years old now.",
  "Yes. In the Woodall case, 12 years after the crime, Justice Scalia, so all the evidence was suppressed.",
  "In 1992.",
  "In 1992 he was granted access to the files. He immediately stated, right away - it's uncontested -- his Brady claim. And then Justice Scalia, the case went on - -",
  "Yes, sir. So there's no question about timeliness. Justice Scalia, your frustration about how long in this case is perfectly understandable, how long they take. But let me just be clear that this - -",
  "Well, I took Justice Kennedy's question to be that this has been in the case all along and hasn't been finally resolved, there isn't a final judgment. You're quite right that, as the Chief Justice pointed out, there is language in the court of appeals' very first opinion in the case. There is unfortunately only one sentence, but to be fair there is a sentence in the first opinion saying that it's not - - that Brady evidence is not material. But I -- I did want to come back to why this has been in the courts for so long. When he presented it immediately, Justice Kennedy, to the State courts, the State told the State courts that it had been previously determined. It -- it no longer defends that. It just wasn't true. And that caused the whole thing to go off the rails, because we have been trying ever since the day that we got access to the materials to get one full adjudication of the claim.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right. So, Mr. Chief Justice, it seems to me, though you and I might disagree on what's fairly encompassed, we might have one piece of common ground, and that is it's time to bring this all to a close; that there really isn't a big benefit to having Cone 4 and 5, and that's actually what we have asked the Court to do. Now we are not - -",
  "We -- we do do that. We also say, however, that if the Court believes that the Sixth Circuit has reached the merits, then this Court should address what are the undefended -- the -- what the Sixth -- the State does not contest are legal errors in its assessment of the merits. The Kyles - -",
  "Well, first of all, Mr. Chief Justice, there -- we have two different sets of errors that we think exist with respect to the Brady claim. I'm not avoiding the question of whether it's encompassed, and I'll come back to it. But to your first point, we do identify what we think are clear legal mistakes by the lower courts in -- whether it's a holding or dictum, not to get into -- enter into that debate, we explain that the Sixth Circuit avowedly split the evidence into sort of four different silos or categories, and we think inconsistently with Kyles v Whitley, and we think the lower courts were wrong not to hold an evidentiary hearing. Now, those aren't fact-bound points; those are questions of law, so we believe that it would be perfectly appropriate for this Court to decide the procedural question. The procedural holding of the Sixth Circuit is not defended here, the idea that previous determination amounts to a procedural default. And then on the question of the merits, the Court could decide those two limited legal questions and leave it to the lower courts to decide the more fact-bound questions. But we do think that the Court -- it is actually quite sensible for this Court to not justify the procedural question, given that it's a very weak - - call it holding, call it dictum -- the Sixth Circuit has sent strong signals about what it views regarding the merits of the Brady claim.",
  "Yes, sir, that -- that is something that the Court can do. We explained in the preceding pages what would happen in the district court, and that is we think that there needs to be an evidentiary hearing and that the -- the Court should point out the Kyles error. But in all events, that would still be a sufficient ground for reversal. But I think we could all agree - -",
  "Yes.",
  "I would have, although I would have -- I understand your concern about whether it was fully elaborated and sufficiently so. This of course was not the procedural default theory that has been argued in this case before now.",
  "Insofar as the defendant, Mr. Cone, told the court of appeals as to paragraph 35 and 41, the court of appeals should look at the affidavit. It did not say what the contents of the affidavit was as to the Brady claim. Now, I will point you to one particular point, Justice Alito, on the question of whether we fairly preserved this in the State Court of Criminal Appeals -- I guess two points that hopefully will give you some comfort there. The first is that in the entire long course of this litigation, the State has never before made this argument; and the second is in the Tennessee Supreme Court -- the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals decides the case. We take the Brady claim up to the Tennessee Supreme Court. And even there the State doesn't say that it was insufficiently preserved. They file a response to our application and they address it as to its substance. They never made this argument even in the State courts. So I think it -- it could have been better briefed. The reason -- by the way, let me just explain to you why - -",
  "The -- it -- I don't think there were - -",
  "The -- but when we got to my point in the Tennessee Supreme Court, there was much less action in the case. The Brady claim was point three, there was a lot less that was presented in the case. Look, I don't think -- my point is not to say that the State, you know, inexplicably behaved horribly here. There could have been better briefing on both sides of this thing. What I'm saying here, though, is that the Petitioner right away presented what is a very serious Brady claim to the State courts. He didn't abandon it; he fully presented it; and what he wants is one shot. There is a footnote in the district court's opinion. There are two, three sentences in the second opinion and one sentence in the first opinion of the Sixth Circuit. But nobody has sat down and done this and disposed of the merits of this claim as anything other than a -- an aside, and it is a very serious claim.",
  "Uh - -",
  "Well, this is, I think, similar to the Bell v. Kelly question, the case that the Court did on when you present a Brady claim and the State courts evaluate the merits of that Brady claim, and then you find out other material later, and the question becomes, how much deference you owe to the State courts the first go-around. This is a very different case. The -- all of this evidence in the file appeared at one time. There weren't -- it wasn't split, and the only time a Brady claim was disposed of was at the time this Brady claim was disposed of. After the Woodall files that you mentioned became available to the Petitioner, right then and there, he added -- there was paragraph 35 and paragraph 41 of his post-conviction application that were added within a couple months of each other. The State court right away, at the urging of the State, said, oh, that's been previously determined, and I won't consider the merits. So this is not a case in which the State court has assessed a Brady claim and said we don't think there's any Brady issue here.",
  "I don't know that he made a concrete proposal. I think he would prefer -- I think the court system would prefer it, and I think everyone would prefer it. The dilemma is that it can't happen. As we explain in footnote 3 at page 26 of our reply brief, there is no window of opportunity to send the State -- the case back to the State. It's been dismissed there. The statute of limitations has run. And in a case called Harris v. State, the Tennessee Supreme Court said that you couldn't reopen it. And so we -- we're not saying we want a Federal judge rather than a State judge. We're just saying we want a judge, and our problem is that, understanding that there has been some discussion of the merits, it has been very thin - -",
  "Yes, it did. And so we have -- we did try to present it to the Sixth Circuit. The Sixth Circuit accepted a finding of procedural default that is undefended in this court, and I did want to -- I had just started to get to this - -",
  "It wasn't a friendly question - -",
  "Right.",
  "It wasn't a friendly question, but it was an honest answer.",
  "And we did present the question to the court of appeals. We think when it said we don't have the power, it was disavowing it. But even -- Mr. Chief Justice, even assuming that the court of appeals had a whole section in its opinion saying, we're deciding the merits of the Brady claim, my constraint was, in framing the question presented, as I explained in that footnote in the cert petition -- and I would also encourage you to read, I didn't get to the language in it, in our reply brief. We have a whole paragraph that explains -- this is at page 4 -- \"First, even if this Court were to conclude that the court of appeals had reached the merits of Petitioner's Brady claim, notwithstanding the Sixth Circuit's own repeated disavowals of doing so, then the merits of that Brady claim ruling would be properly before this Court, not immunized from review. Indeed, the Brady issue, as encompassed within the questions presented, would be properly briefed by the parties if certiorari were granted.\"",
  "It's -- I don't think, pejorative or not, that it's fair to accuse us of smuggling it. There's a big section in the cert petition about it. It's not -- it was not hidden from -- I don't -- I don't purport to tell the Court what it was thinking when it granted cert in this case, but I tried to be as clear as absolutely possible. I was turning to the question of whether we have a serious Brady claim and so the Court should have some concerns here, and I really do think that we do and that the passing observations about the lower courts don't fulfill the duty to assess the merits of the Brady claim fairly. There was one -- the action in this case, the whole reason that there was effectively a trial, was the question of whether the defendant committed these acts in an amphetamine psychosis. He had two experts that explained, because of his post-traumatic stress disorder and his very heavy drug issue, that he did not understand the consequences of his action. He was completely paranoid. And the State went after those experts by saying he is not a drug user at all; he's a drug dealer; when all the while in their files, there were -- Justice Kennedy, to distinguish the hypothetical you gave -- FBI teletypes, police reports, witness statements from before the day of the robbery, soon thereafter in Florida, explaining that he was not just a heavy drug user, but was acting -- the witness was asked, Did he act like he was on drugs? And the witness said, yes, he did. That that really would have made a difference in at the very least the sentencing phase in this case to at least - -",
  "Justice Ginsburg, this is in the yellow brief, our merits reply brief. It starts at the very bottom of 21, but you can just start at the top of 22. And as to this question -- so we're talking here about the evidence, not just that he was a drug user, which, I think, would have been relevant to the jury, but that he actually was on drugs in August of 1980 at the time all this was happening. There's a robbery -- there are two robberies here that precede these killings, and there's a -- the first one, there's a statement about the robbery right before the murders confirming that the Petitioner -- he was asked, Did he appear to be drunk or high? And the witness said, yes, he did because \"he acted real weird.\" The next one is that the day of the -- at the jewelry store robbery that immediately preceded the killings, that the Petitioner looked wild-eyed, and then soon thereafter a police officer reports in Florida that he looks \"agitated\" and \"looking about in a frenzied manner.\"",
  "Well, I don't doubt for a second that that's exactly the argument that the prosecution would have made. The question is whether a juror, in the context of the expert testimony and the evidence about drug addiction, could have also found that it was consistent with the idea that he was high on drugs, whether you can have confidence in saying now - - particularly if you'll give me the first statement. And all the FBI teletypes and the police reports that said -- remember this is not just a case about suppression of evidence. This is a case where the prosecution, with all this stuff in its files, goes after the experts and argues to the jury that he's a drug dealer, not a drug user.",
  "There are key witness statements, and there are a series of police reports and",
  "Two points, Justice Alito. The first is that we say at the very least the Court should make the Kyles point and the evidentiary hearing point. And the second is, I think to be fair to us, given your point about this is so complicated, there is a lot of evidence here, one ought to compare that in fairness to what the Sixth Circuit did, and the one footnote that the Chief Justice has talked about with the district court and whether they really did take a hard look at the claim. I think it would be fair to us to say, look, there are some legal errors here that this Court can correct, and then the district court would be the proper place, if it decides to have an evidentiary hearing, to resolve the remainder of the claim.",
  "Deliberately suppressed, although it doesn't matter under Brady. There was - - they turned over almost nothing, and this was the heart of our case. They knew that we were conceding that the acts had been committed, and our defense was one of insanity, and it was our only argument in mitigation of the death penalty. If I could - -",
  "It -- it could, and that's why I think it's very important that our defense was amphetamine psychosis brought on by post traumatic stress disorder from honorable service in Vietnam, not just that he was a target. If I could reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Kennedy, he has been on death row; he is not in solitary confinement. Here's the dilemma I think about how the Court needs to dispose of the case. On the one hand, we have the State, which is unapologetic about having suppressed a whole bunch of evidence and about having misstated the procedural history to the State court and then to the Sixth Circuit. On the other hand, the Court's business is usually not to get into the weeds, things like fact-bound Brady claims, and I think that the Court can accommodate both the concern of the signal that it would send in affirming the judgment in this case and also the -- the bad precedent it might set by getting into the Johnson pitfalls of this witness statement and that witness statement, by resolving the case as follows: On page 22 and 24a of the petition appendix, the court of appeals says the claim was procedurally defaulted because it was previously determined. That's wrong. That is the argument that was passed upon by the court of appeals, and that should be reversed on procedural grounds. On the Brady claim, it seems to me that the court of appeals, when it did discuss the claim, made a couple of big mistakes the Court could identify and send the case back. The first is, when it talked about the merits, it said we don't think this evidence would have mattered because there was a lot of evidence at trial that he was a drug user. But as has been discussed, I think in detail, the court of appeals, because its assessment was kind of passing here, misunderstood that when the experts said that, when the prosecutor turned around and completely discredited that. And so I think that colors the Sixth Circuit's assessment incorrectly. The second is the Kyles point, and the third is the possibility that we're entitled to an evidentiary hearing. And so I think an opinion of this Court that simply dealt with the undefended procedural default ruling and then went to the merits and only made those three points and then left it to the lower courts to resolve the Brady claim ultimately would balance the concern about the Court's institutional interests in not sending a signal of affirming this judgment in light of what the State has done here and not getting into the weeds of the claim.",
  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. We point out that the court of appeals twice said, \"We consider the four different categories of Brady evidence separately.\" And then when it did discuss them -- it's very hard to tell, its discussion is so passing here - - but it does go through this kind of evidence, say, the FBI files or the police teletypes from Agent Roby, and it says that wouldn't have been persuasive, and then it turns to the witness statements. But I would also say that its overarching point - -",
  "On page 57a. \"We take\" - - \"We will take up each category of documents separately and discuss whether they are\" - -",
  "No. The -- in the 2007 opinion, that discussion happens at 25a, and here is their explanation. It goes to my first point. And they do sort of then turn around and treat them more generally. \"It would not have been news to the jurors that Cone was a drug user. They had already heard substantial direct evidence that he was a drug user, including the opinion of the two expert witnesses, Cone's mother, the drugs found in Cone's car, and photographic evidence.\" And that's our point, that that was discredited because it came out of his mouth.",
  "There was one photo. It actually points in the opposite direction. The State cites it in its merit brief. They have a picture of Cone as not having any needle marks, to your point, Justice Scalia, that they tried to prove he wasn't a drug user at all.",
  "Thank you very much.",
  "Yes.",
  "I can tell that you quickly, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court will want to have available to it the blue brief for the Petitioners and Joint Appendix Volume 2, which together reproduce the statutes that are relevant to this case. And I do want to talk about the text of the statutes. And the point that I'm going to make from the text of the statutes is that the Solicitor General just correctly described to you what it was that Congress was trying to accomplish when he said that the structure of 1605 -- 1605(a)(7) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act says if you are the victim of torture by a nation designated as a state sponsor of terror and that designation changes so that you are no longer on that list, then you still have a cause of action under the FSIA. The fact that the country changes its ways and gets de-designated doesn't change that result. Now, what the Solicitor General says is that Congress changed that rule in 1503 and that's the debate in this case: Did Congress when it said that the President may make inapplicable various statutes which they say include section 1605(a)(7), did it change the basic rule about what the effect of a designation and a rescindment of a designation was, or instead was it giving the President a special power to remove the designation? If all it was doing was giving the power to the President to immediately rescind Iraq's designation as a terrorist state, if it was a more modest power rather than effectively writing into 1605(a)(7) \"except for Iraq,\" if it's just a power about rescindment, then the rule of 1605(a)(7) that the Solicitor General just cited to you, that changing somebody's designation doesn't affect their liability, would apply here. So just put it in terms - -",
  "Let's -- let me take you to the reason, and that is in Joint Appendix Volume 2. Section 620A of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is reproduced at 344. And this is the way that a country -- that a statute relating to torture and terrorism is made applicable and made inapplicable under ordinary processes to a nation. So to explain it to you, right now Syria, Iran, and Sudan, this statute applies to them. It is inapplicable to Libya and North Korea. And the reason is that Libya and North Korea were originally designated --",
  "I am going to take you straight to the text. I am giving you the overview right now. So, they were de-designated. It works in two parts. A is the prohibition. This is how you get designated. Prohibition. The United States shall not - -",
  "Sorry. I'm at 344, and I'm in A, prohibition.",
  "Okay, this is how you get designated: \"Prohibition. The United States shall not provide any assistance under this Act\" -- this is our principal foreign aid statute -- \"the Agricultural Trade, Development, and Assistance Act of 1954, the Peace Corps Act, or the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to any country\" -- and here's how you get designated \"if the Secretary of State determines that the government of that country has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.\" So we've designated Syria, Iran, Sudan. Now, that designation can be rescinded and that's usually what happens. But there are important restrictions on the rescindment that gave rise to the enactment of section 1503, and they are in C, recision. The Congress limited the President's ability to immediately rescind the designation: \"A determination made by the Secretary of State under subsection A not - - may not be rescinded unless\" -- and there are two rules. It can happen in one of two ways. The first is you get a new government: \"A, there has been a fundamental change in the leadership and policies of the government concerned.\" Or number 2, the old government changes its",
  "Yes. But, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm making a very particular point, and that is that the President lacked the power under this statute that I have just cited to you, 620A -- and it is also the statute that is cited in 1503 -- the President lacked the power at that time because there was no new government and there wasn't a change in policy in the old government.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Exactly right - -",
  "I couldn't agree with you more, Justice Kennedy. And here's the relevant point. In the spring of 2003 when Congress enacted this statute, we had not recognized a new Iraqi government. We did that in June of 2004. So my point is, and I think this is very clear from the history, Congress enacted section 1503 of the EWSAA because the President was powerless under the existing state of the law to rescind Iraq's designation as a terrorist state. That's what - -",
  "Okay. Well, let's go to the text, if we could. And that is in the blue brief. It's in the appendix to the blue brief. And it's at 4A. And it's the second proviso, of course, and it appears seven lines down. \"Provided further, that the President may make inapplicable\" -- that's the language that we are going to focus on, Justice Souter -- \"make inapplicable with respect to Iraq\" -- and then it identifies the statute -- \"section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or any provision of law that applies to countries that have supported terrorism.\" Now, we are putting aside the debate of whether section 1605(a)(7) is such a law. We are assuming it is and you say it, Justice Souter, but he is given the power to make inapplicable section 1605(a)(7). He isn't just given the power to rescind the designation. And the question just -- the term \"make inapplicable\" doesn't appear in this context anywhere else in the U.S. Code. We have to figure out what it means. And the way that laws that apply to countries that have supported terrorism apply or are rendered inapplicable, there is a method in the U.S. Code for how they are made applicable and inapplicable. So, to return to my examples. If you were to ask the United States or Mr. Franklin -- so this statutory scheme of laws -- sanctions that apply to nations that support terrorism applies to Syria, to Iran, it applies to Sudan. It is inapplicable to Libya, North Korea, Guinea-Bissau, Britain, France. How is it that they apply to some and not others? It's through designation. That's the process for taking something that applies and make it inapplicable. And I can give you a lot of other - -",
  "Yes, the de-designation becomes effective immediately. What -- the distinction that I am drawing is that there is a strong version of the words \"make inapplicable,\" and there is a more modest version of the words \"make inapplicable.\" Iraq and the United States say that when he made it inapplicable he in effect essentially wrote it out of the U.S. Code or wrote in the exception that says \"except for Iraq.\" We say that \"make inapplicable\" in this context is a term of art that deals with designation and rescindment. And that process is all that Congress was trying to do, was to allow the President to immediately - -",
  "Yes.",
  "I would say, no, because that regime, as was indicated in the first 30 minutes, has been profoundly changed by the enactment of the FSIA. We adopted a different - -",
  "Okay. Well, I do want to come to whether we are in equipoise in just a second. I do think the fact that Congress changed the model so that we don't use, in effect, the Tape Memorandum model. Second, remember, Justice Souter, that this isn't a return to that model. What used to happen before the FSIA is the President would come into court and say I think that this nation has immunity and the court would decide on the basis of that case by case. But it was the President making the determination, case by case. This is something unknown. This is very different, if I could just explain how on their - -",
  "Well, fine, and if that is espousal power continues to exist, then the President can attempt to exercise it.",
  "Okay. So the -- two reasons, the first is this is not an attempt at espousal, unlike Dames & Moore and cases like that. Remember the President hasn't set up some sort of mechanism for resolving these claims. He is simply saying that they are - -",
  "Justice Souter, it wouldn't work like that. If the President were engaging in an act of espousal then he would have set up some mechanism for resolving the claims.",
  "So can I - -",
  "Well, the President purported to do that nine -- excuse me, five or six years ago and if he were going to set up a mechanism, I think he would have. But can I just then just come to the premise of whether we are - -",
  "Okay. So let's -- if I could accept the premise that -- and not try to combat the premise of what we would do in the case of equipoise, let me turn to the question of what statute really means and why we shouldn't be in equipoise. The Court generally has not assumed that emergency appropriations measures issues, particular their provisos, changed the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, much less give the President the power to change the jurisdiction of the Federal courts. And it has in related context taken language like \"any provision\" and said well, we are looking for a clear statement of law by Congress to make sure it has confronted this situation. When it attempts to -- when the argument on the other side is that the Congress has passed a law that shifts the balance of power between Congress and the legislature and the executive in cases like Atascadero, in cases like Raygor, Will, these are all cases that had said statutes that said \"any,\" and the Court said well, because this a -- a relatively strange thing to provide in the proviso to an appropriations measure, for example, we would ask that there be a clear statement. So that would be one reason that we are not in equipoise.",
  "Because this -- well, because what Congress was doing was confronting an emergency. There is not a breath, in either the President's transmittal of the statute, the legislative history of the statute, or anything else that says that Congress was dealing with the sort of medium to long-term health of the Iraqi population or the Iraqi government or the Iraqi economy. It didn't -- one thing you would have expected if that was Congress's intent is that Congress would have dealt with Iraq's debts, Saddam Hussein's debts, and would you also suspect that this wouldn't sunset, which is the eighth proviso that hasn't been discussed never much.",
  "Well - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Oh, Justice Souter, I don't think that that -- let me, if I could take the two points in turn. In cases like Atascadero, Will, Raygor, it's the same language; it's \"any.\" And the Court has said we require a plain statement when Congress is going to do something that would change the balance in the relationship between the branches of the government or between the Federal and State governments. And Justice Souter, we don't deny it goes beyond section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act; it goes to other things that involve aid to the Iraqi government. What it doesn't do is reach pending - -",
  "I actually do disagree and believe you can logically look at the statute -- in the sense that the word \"any\" means \"every,\" that is true. But if you look at what Congress was trying to accomplish, it was much more focused on questions of the immediate economic impact of the need to begin reconstruction in Iraq right away.",
  "I am saying that except for those that relate to jurisdiction, because that is the kind of thing that you would expect Congress to deal with correctly. The answer to Justice Ginsburg's question in the first 30 minutes is has this Court ever confronted a statute and construed it to remove the jurisdiction of the Federal courts without expressly saying so, is no.",
  "If it's anything, it would be the export of military hardware. In the immediate wake of the fall of Baghdad, when there is no new government, right? There is no replacement regime. If you read \"any\" to mean literally \"every\" then you could ship munitions, nuclear materials and the like when there is no state there and it's silly to think that Congress intended that. Its reasons for enacting the statute had to be - -",
  "Yes.",
  "We don't have a new government.",
  "Well, it's not -- it's not entirely clear there is still a government in Iraq.",
  "No.",
  "I think -- I think - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, in - - the same point was made in cases like Atascadero and Raygor. \"Any\" means \"every\" except for the States. In that example. But can I just make quite clear, we have two lines of argument. And I think it's important to recognize that. We have the debate over what any other means and does that include section 1605(a)(7). That's what we have been discussing here, and the idea that any means every, and Congress spoke broadly and so that's what we have. But we have the other incredibly important arguments of what it means to make a sanction inapplicable. Which is separate and independent of that point, and the question of whether the statutes sunset as the Acree court did. And I want to return First to those point of what it is to make inapplicable a statute that applies to nations that have supported terrorism. And I want to return to the statutory text and explain why our more modest reading of \"make inapplicable\" is the right one. So the statutory text again is at 4a. Here are, I think, the strong statutory indications that we are right, that what Congress was trying to do was to allow the President to immediately de-designate Iraq as a terrorist state. First, there is a direct parallel between the language \"a statute that applies to countries that have supported terrorism\" and the directive that the President can make it inapplicable. That tells you, look at how it is that these statutes apply in the first place, and the linguistic term of art is to do the reverse. Take something that applies and make it inapplicable. And something that applies to an -- statutes apply to countries that have supported terrorism under American law only in one way, through designation. And what happens is that the President was allowed to rescind it. The second textual reason for our more modest reading of make inapplicable is reference to section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act. So we know one thing: even if we debate and disagree, Justice Breyer, about what any means in this context, we know the Congress told the President he could immediately make inapplicable section 620A.",
  "That's exactly right, but that's the point. When I took you to the text of 620A, which was at 344 of the joint appendix volume 2, Justice Souter, he didn't have the power to do it right away. Remember, Baghdad falls; there is no new government; and the old government hasn't changed its ways. So he lacks the power to remove the designation. And I can prove that to you. It wasn't until there was a new government that the President actually did formally rescind the designation pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act. It wasn't until 2004. After - -",
  "I -- I disagree, but we will accept that. Mr. Chief Justice, my point isn't, hey, look, he himself acknowledged that he needed to exercise his de-designation power. My point is different, and that is the fact that he didn't do this under the Foreign Assistance Act until 2004 is a strong indication that he couldn't do it before. If he could have done it before, he would have.",
  "I -- I don't understand, Justice Souter, why he would in 2004, after a new government is recognized, suddenly decide to de-designate Iraq. There wasn't any -- the only - -",
  "Well, it -- I agree it would be consistent with the assumption that he had the authority here. That's -- I'm not trying to negative that. What I'm trying to say is that the authority under 620A -- the fact that he exercised it in 2004 is a strong indication that that's -- it's not the only possible reading, but it's a strong indication that that's when he thought he got the power. The - -",
  "The Solicitor General has it right. Post-Acree, these claims -- these types of claims were pleaded principally as State-law claims, and that has been recognized as providing a substantive cause of action.",
  "The State law generally of the home State of the plaintiffs.",
  "Well, that is clear -- well, in -- in terms of whether or not a foreign country would look to our law and say, well, we're just doing the same thing as you do, that would arise from -- also from new section 1605A.",
  "Yes, I understand, Justice Ginsburg. Section -- for example, section 1605A, the statute that's created by the 2008 NDAA, creates an affirmative U.S. cause of action. There is always going to be an underlying domestic cause of action that underlies the FSIA, whether it's State law or instead it's Federal law. That is a -- a debate about whether the FSIA is a good statute or not, but it's one that Congress has resolved - -",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, the - - the source of the underlying cause of action is not presented by this case. The D.C. Circuit has resolved that question in our favor.",
  "Sure - -",
  "Okay. I'm here to talk about what you want to talk about, and all I'm - -",
  "All right.",
  "Okay. Maybe I can finish it. The -- the -- I had said that I also wanted to continue with the text, on the question of what it is to \"make inapplicable.\" I pointed out how it is that all of these statutes are applied and made inapplicable. I also want to draw the contrast between the two operative powers that are given to the President. At the beginning, the statute says the President may suspend the application of any provision of the Iraq Sanctions Act, which is the kind of power that they are talking about, essentially to lift the statute; whereas, the term of art, we think, \"make inapplicable\" in the context of these statutes is the narrow power to de-designate the state as a state sponsor of terror. But let me just return, if I can - -",
  "Yes.",
  "I don't think the question is presented here. It could have been an argument that was made, but I don't believe it's presented by this case.",
  "I agree he has that argument; he just hasn't made it in -- in this case - - in his -- in the Iraq's -- Iraq hasn't made it in the cert petition, I should say, in the question on this Court -- on which this Court granted certiorari. I think to decide the debate, Justice Souter, of whether we're in equipoise here and the debate about whether or not the power was grand or instead more modest, we have to resolve the -- the question of what it is that Congress intended to do in this proviso to this emergency appropriations measure. Was it confronting a very specific moment in time at which Baghdad had just fallen and we needed to get emergency -- emergency aid to Iraq? Or was it, instead, fundamentally changing our policy, making Iraq an ally despite the fact that there wasn't even an Iraqi government there? Was he given -- was Congress giving the power to the President to immunize Iraq permanently from liability under the FSIA, which doesn't even exist with respect to our closest allies, Britain and France? That is a significant over-reading of what - -",
  "Because - -",
  "I don't understand how, Justice Souter. The -- the powers of the President expired. This statute sunset. Their whole point is - -",
  "That's fine while it was in effect, but it's not anymore. Their point is that they permanently made the FSIA -- the -- section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act in 2008 and 2009 inapplicable, and that would be incredibly unusual. Why would we give that power with respect to Iraq when we don't to our very closest allies? Remember the statute expired, and they say it's still in effect. That's their answer to the sunset. It makes no sense at all. The only thing that makes sense is to read it in its context of being a modest attempt to deal with an immediate problem. And section 1605(a)(7) says what happens when you deal with that immediate problem. If you change the designation of a state -- if they become an ally, if they change their ways -- they are still liable for the acts of torture they committed while they were designated.",
  "I don't understand - -",
  "Yes.",
  "No. That -- that entire provision was waived with respect to Iraq. And we're - - take section 620A - -",
  "I have no -- I'm not aware of any provision of the 2008 NDAA that would have given the President any such power. They say that on the day the President exercised his -- his powers that the Foreign Assistance Act, section 620A, became inapplicable to Iraq, that sanction, and that that inapplicability survived the sunset of the statute in 2005. How it would come back -- how it would come back and continue to apply in Iraq in the case of a regime change in Iraq, I have no idea at all.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court, I think, has the parties' arguments very well in hand. I think the -- the one point that I can hopefully address, and it is I think the hardest part of our case, is to address the issue that Justice Alito raised, and that is, is there an anomaly in the fact that in BAPCPA Congress added the 6-month period, which would suggest perhaps that Congress was trying to lock in a particular period that we would look at. And the answer to that question is no, and I want to take you to the relevant statutory provisions. Everything is going to be in the cert petition. I am going to start in the petition appendix at 91, which is 1325, which is the operative provision here. And 1325(b)(1) tells us that if the trustee or a creditor objects, then as of the effective date of the plan it's only going to be confirmed in subsection (b), which is the third full paragraph on page 91 is going to control. The plan has to provide that all of the debtor's projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period beginning on the date the first payment is due under the plan will be applied to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan. And the thing to note first about that provision is that it, too, sets a timetable. It's not just projected disposable income, but it's projected disposable income of a very particular type, to be received in the applicable commitment period. So unless there is something particularly strange about the definition of \"disposable income,\" Congress specified a period that the income is going to be measured in, and that's over the course of the plan; the word \"projected\" tells us to get a realistic estimation of what that amount of money's going to be. Now, my friend makes the point that disposable income after BAPCPA is a defined term; the definition comes in the next paragraph; it's subsection (2), 1325(b)(2). For purposes of this subsection the term \"disposable income\" means current monthly income received by the debtor subject to some deductions and then the expenses. So then we have to go to the definition of \"current monthly income.\" Current monthly income is in 101; it's at page 83. That's where we get the 6-month period. And it tells us that current monthly income is the average monthly income from all sources, so it's very encompassing, without regard to whether such income is taxable income derived during the 6-month period. So, my friend's argument is that, well, Congress said 6 months. The answer to that point is a couple fold. First, as was suggested in the first half-hour, Congress was addressing a very specific problem there. Before BAPCPA courts didn't know what the -- didn't agree on what the baseline was for determining someone's income. Some courts would say, all right, you are a Chapter 13 debtor, right away I'm going to look at the latest month. Some courts said 6 months. We have a court in our brief that said 4 years. So, we have to have a starting point to project from. But the second point is that this term \"current monthly income\" isn't principally a Chapter 13 term at all. So, my friend's argument is that Congress stuck this 6-month period into Chapter 13, so it would be very anomalous if we could just -- in effect, he says we are throwing it out, we are giving the district judges discretion. It's not quite right. The place to look is in section 707, which is two pages later. 707 is a Chapter 7 provision. And my friend started out by saying the problem with our position is that we were not following the Chapter 7 means test. That's the key. This term is really a -­ borrowed from Chapter 7. So 707(b)(2)(A)(i) is at the beginning of page 85 of the appendix. And, so, we are in a Chapter 7 case here. And this is the means test. It tells us that: \"In considering under paragraph 1,\" so we are trying to figure out if there is a presumption of abuse under Chapter 7 -- \"whether the granting of relief would be an abuse of the provisions of this chapter, the court shall presume abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly income, reduced by the amounts determined under clauses 2, 3, and 4\" -- those are expense clauses -- \"and multiplied by 60 is not less than\" a certain amount. So what happened is Congress in BAPCPA created this presumption of abuse in Chapter 7 and it then borrowed that concept, as my friend pointed out, in Chapter 13. So that 6-month period has real force and effect in the Bankruptcy Code in Chapter 7. So it's not like Congress in Chapter 13 fixed the 6-month period, which would give -- have a sort of a gravitational pull. You wouldn't want to throw that out too lightly. Justice Sotomayor, I do agree that we ought to be pretty -- we ought to stick to it. It indicates Congress is concerned with the 6-month period. But it's not like Congress added to Chapter 13 this 6-month concept. It added it to Chapter 7, where it's in full force and effect. Can I make one other point about that language, just to repeat it again? That the courts are -­",
  "Okay.",
  "Sure. It's back. We have to go back two pages.",
  "Okay. Sure. I'm sorry. The term is \"current monthly income.\" So we are in Chapter 7, so four lines down\". \"The court shall presume abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly income\" -- that's the 6 months, current monthly income. That's the 6-month period of income.",
  "See, that's mostly where it matters. Then Congress borrowed it in Chapter 13. But it didn't get rid of, as was pointed out before, the term -- \"projected\"; it didn't get rid of the period, the commitment period. But I do want to point out something very particular about this language. Here's the phrase: \"Current monthly income, reduced by the amounts determined under clauses 2, 3, and 4\" -- those are expenses -- \"and multiplied by 60.\" That's what my friend says the phrase \"projected disposable income to be received over the applicable commitment period\" is. Our point is that if Congress intended that mechanical formulation, it would have used the exact words that I have just read from you in Chapter 7, because that's mechanical.",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "That's exactly. They used \"multiplied.\" And Congress did that several times in BAPCPA and before BAPCPA. When Congress wanted, look, we are going to have a mathematical formula, it used a mathematical formula.",
  "Sure. Let me make a few points about that, sir. So I'll again read the language again. So we are on 83. It says that -- little (ii) is going to be -- it's going to be \"6 months ending on the date on which current income is determined by the court for purposes of this title if the debtor does not file the schedule of current income.\" A couple OF points about that. Justice Alito, you were right, this is a one-way pro­ debtor ratchet, right. The creditor and the trustee, if the debtor a month before confirmation gets a new job or their expenses go down -- let's say you had a car, but you know that the car payments are going to be done. Under the trustee's view, then you still get to count the car payments which are totally pretend, or if you got a much higher paying job. In fact, in this case she did get a higher paying job. Towards the end of the period, she got a raise. And we say that has to be counted, too. We have to have a debtor and creditor-neutral provision. In a statute that's designed to make sure the debtor pays a much as possible to her creditors, it's very strange to put this entirely in the debtor's hands.",
  "The contrast between 1325 and 1329. What I tried to do in my brief, and I have laid it out at the beginning of the argument section. That's where we try to articulate our rule. What we have done is we have looked at the cases. As you pointed out, this is pre-BAPCPA practice. Courts have set a pretty high bar, both in terms of the level of certainty and the degree of deviation. And courts have said -- I will give you an example that will illustrate the difference perhaps. You have times when someone expects to get a raise. They don't know that they are going to get it, or they expect to get a promotion. And courts will say, even if that's pretty likely, until you have actually got it we are not going to count it for purposes of 1325(b); come back under 1329. And we point out in our merits brief that in fact, it's not quite on point, but she got a settlement post-confirmation here, and under 1329 that money was applied. So, Justice Scalia, there are post-confirmation events, but if you know ahead of time -- and this case is a perfect example, it -- we know she is not going to get another buyout from Payless Shoe Stores. When it's known or virtually certain, we think that is sufficient -- akin to Justice Sotomayor's point about, you know, making it hard. Let me make one other point. I wanted to finish off my answer to the Chief Justice about 101. This provision has taken on greater significance in the oral argument and the reply brief of the Petitioner. I did want to point out to the Court a provision that is not reproduced in the parties' briefs, but if the Court were to go this route it would want to be aware of, and that's 521(i). And 521(i) tells us that you do have to file the forms at the beginning or you have to file them within 45 days, but upon request of the debtor made within 45 days after the date of filing the petition, the court may allow the debtor an additional period of not to exceed 45 days. So it does seem to constrain the power of the bankruptcy court to shift this period all around. So, I have made two points. One is it's a one-way ratchet for the debtor; second, it's not unlimited. The third is it just doesn't make any sense. Why would Congress design a system that would have all of these machinations. If we agree that Congress wants -- it seems my friend and I agree that Congress believes that she shouldn't have to make the payments that would be required under the trustee's reading of \"projected disposable income.\" The question is how we get there. The trustee's answer is that you are required by the text; I'm sorry, Congress took this option away. And I think that, as I have explained, the term \"projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period\" really is not language that you would ordinarily construe to ignore changes that -­",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "And that is exactly, Mr. Chief Justice, why I started with the definition of \"current monthly income in the 6-month period.\" I agree that it is an important point. It is their strongest argument. My only point is that I have explained, I think, why Congress put the 6-month period in for purposes of Chapter 7 and also to have the starting point. If I -- to give you an example, take inflation. If we were to define inflation as the amount in the rise in prices over the previous 6 months, if Congress did that in a statute and then told us to look at projected inflation, we would still not ignore things that will tell us that there are going to be -- there has been an oil price spike or an increase in health care costs. It would take a pretty firm, firm period that told us to only look into the past and not look into the future, particularly when the whole point of the statute is to make sure that the money goes into the creditor's hands that the debtor is able to pay. On the point of discretion, I should also say BAPCPA as a whole was intended to reduce discretion. And, so, it's kind of odd to say that the answer to our position is to turn to all of these other discretionary provisions -­",
  "I -- I -- I would use the language that Congress did in 707. Remember, the current monthly income reduced by the amounts determined under clauses 2, 3, and 4 and multiplied by 60.",
  "Multiply. And Congress did that a bunch of times. Projected -- if we try to project something, we try and make the -- and everybody agrees on the definition, so really, it's not an unusual term. It is: You make your best estimate of the future based on the data you have now. My friend is right. One piece of data we have now is her previous 6 months' income. Another piece of data is we know that she's not going to have the same income in the future. If there are no further questions.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, good morning: You will want to have available you to the red brief of IMS Health, Incorporated, which in its appendix reproduces the statutes and findings. And the reason we have to look at the statutes and findings in this argument is because the case can't be decided as a matter of absolutes. We know that statutes like HIPAA do protect private information in third parties' hands and they are constitutional. On the other hand, we also know that a governmental restriction on the use of information could be used to distort the marketplace of ideas. So the case is going to have to be decided somewhere in the middle. And in order to do that, we're going to have to figure out where in the middle Vermont ended up. Now, in doing that I want to clarify I think three things in the questioning of the first half hour. They are about what the practice are -- practices are at issue here; what this statute does, actually what's the rule; and why is it that Vermont did it. So as to Justice Ginsburg's question, are there other sales, the State gave you the correct answer that the pharmacy companies don't sell to researchers, but that's somewhat misleading. They sell to us, and we sell to the researchers, we sell to the government, the intermediaries like IMS Health. That's because we're the aggregator. So it is not correct to say that the only sale is for pharmaceutical marketing. Second, on the important question of what this statute -­",
  "Yes, and I said the State gave you the accurate answer. But the implication of the answer I think was not quite correct, because there are sales for purposes other than for marketing.",
  "It would not, because the point would then -- and I'll come to the statute in a minute, because all the exemptions -- right? So there's -- there's a debate that Justice Alito focused on about what does the statute mean, and I do want to turn to that in a second. But to jump ahead to your question, Justice Kagan, assume that it's a general sale prohibition. Then there are all the exemptions and the exemptions take all of these other uses out from the sale prohibition: for academic research, to go to the government, and for clinical trials, for health care research. Those are all exempted from the general sale prohibition. So let's do turn, if you don't mind, to what it is the statute actually does. It is an important point. First, I am going to come to our brief, but I just want to read something. For your later reference I'm going to have been reading from page 42 of PhRMA's brief, and this is what -- what the State told the Second Circuit, quote: \"Data vendors may continue to acquire, edit, and sell this information to whomever they choose so long as that person does not use the information for detailing.\" In turn, the Second Circuit -­",
  "Sorry. That's going to be from the PhRMA brief, the other red brief at page 42, at the top of the page. So, to whomever they choose, so long as that person does not use the information for detailing. The Second Circuit said: Okay, you're the State; here's how we understand the statute. The statute only imposed -­ quoting again, this is from 22A, it's the language that Justice Alito quoted -- the statute only imposes \"restrictions on the sale or use of such data for marketing or promoting a prescription drug.\" So that's what they understood the statute to do. Now, then the question becomes why did they do it? This was -- Justice Scalia, you tried really hard to get them just to admit, let's just acknowledge what the point is here. And the State tries to deny that the purpose here is to limit the information getting into the hands of the doctor. We don't have to rely on the State's lawyers. The State legislature was very helpful here. So if we go to the appendix of the IMS brief now, page 1a, okay. Right at the top, the State says their goal is -- this is finding number 1 at the bottom of it -- containing health care costs. Then in finding number 2 they explain why they did it: \"There is a strong link between pharmaceutical marketing activities, health care spending and the health of Vermonters.\" Then finding number 3: \"The goals of marketing programs are often in conflict with the goals of the State.\" And my favorite, obviously, is number 4: \"The marketplace for ideas on medicine safety, the State determined, was operating in conflict with the goals of the State.\" They didn't like the marketplace of ideas. Now, it is true, we acknowledge, that another thing the State wanted to do was to give the doctors some more control. It's in -- it's in -- there is an opt-out option. But can I just take you to how the State explained what it was doing? That's just going to be on page 7. Now, the State's lawyer and the Solicitor General have explained to you that they believe that doctors were concerned only with marketing and only with marketing to them. That's not true. Finding 29. We have to go all the way to number 29 to get to this goal of the State: \"Health care professionals in Vermont\" -­ I'm on page 7: \"Health care professionals in Vermont who write prescriptions for their patients have a reasonable expectation that the information in that prescription, including their own identity and that of the patient, will not be used for purposes other than the filling and processing of the payment for that prescription.\" It's not just about pharmaceutical marketing. The doctors say -- we all love this; there's stuff about us in our daily lives that we wish was entirely private. The doctors here said: Hey, it would be great for us if this information, we had complete control over it. Doctors also would love if medical malpractice judgments weren't broadly known. There are all kinds of government records they would prefer not to be out into the public sphere. But then we ask ourselves, all right -- and that's why I asked you to have this brief available -­ what did the State do? Did the State in fact enact a general privacy provision? Is it like HIPAA or instead is all that the State did here target the use for marketing, while it allows the use of the same data for the opposite message by insurers and also by the government? So here's the statute. It appears on page 9 of the appendix. I want to start with subsection A because the State helpfully reiterates its goals here. The second half of this paragraph: \"The State sought to ensure costs are contained in the private health care sector, as well as for State purchasers of prescription drugs, through the promotion of less costly drugs and ensuring prescribers received unbiased information.\" That's what they're trying to do. They're trying to say: We would like the drug companies to have a harder time finding the doctors while the insurance companies and the State have an easy time finding the doctors.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Sure.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Oh, I apologize. We're allowed to do it before and after the statute, is my point. Remember, what the statute does is -- and this was the debate that Justice Alito tried to point us to about what the statute actually does and the Second Circuit, what it understood the statute to mean. And I should also say the cert petition didn't say that there was a problem with that. Vermont picked out one thing. It said: Look, when drug companies can find the doctors easily, they can persuade the doctors to use more expensive drugs. We pay a lot for drugs. We would prefer that not happen, so we're going to make it harder. And the State will have its counter-detailing program, it will have its drug utilization review program, and insurers will advocate for less expensive drugs. All the other uses are still permitted. If Vermont were serious about protecting the doctors' privacy, as opposed to kind of a, a right of publicity, a control over information about them, it wouldn't have all these exemptions; it would have a provision that says this is private information.",

  "No, it's a case about restricting true advertising. Justice Breyer, can I just make one point really quick? And that is, you dissented in Thompson v. Western States and your dissent in that case says these are drugs, the compounded drugs that have not been approved by the FDA, and I'm very concerned that you're evading the FDA regulatory requirements about truthful advertising. These are the opposite drugs. These are the drugs that all the messages that are being conveyed here have been preapproved by the FDA. This is truthful and accurate speech, and the State only wants one side of the debate to get out.",
  "Okay.",
  "That's why it's called a hypothetical.",
  "Yes.",
  "Sure.",
  "Sure. A couple of things about that. First, as I said, these are messages that have been cleared by the experts. The FDA has to review all the detailing communications. Second, the doctors do get to say: I don't want you to come visit me. They do that all the time. My dad's a doctor; he doesn't visit with detailers. This is instead a rule about whether you can talk about -- about someone, not talk to someone. The drug companies and the intermediaries are talking about drug -- about prescriber practices, and you can decide who you want to try and approach. There's nothing alleged to be false or misleading. Third, the way the First Amendment works in the marketplace of ideas that so upsets Vermont is that both sides get to tell their story, right? The thing that is supposed to be biased here is that the drug companies have too much money. That is not a basis for restricting speech. The way it works is if the message is accurate, as the FDA has determined it to be, the drug companies can go make their pitch. Vermont can come along and make the opposite pitch. Terrific. So can insurance companies. But what you can't do is have a rule that says one side is going to have a much harder time getting to their audience.",
  "It can. And let me explain why it is that that rule -- and let me typify it for you. There is a pending bill in the Congress called the McCain-Kerry Consumer Protection Act and it does what you're talking about. It says we're not just going to leave it to the industry; we're going to have a set of governmental rules. Let me distinguish that bill from what goes on under Act 80. What that says is that if you are a consumer and you engage in a transaction, you have the right to opt out of any unauthorized uses, because it's just between you and the business, right? So there are three differences between that and this. The first is the structure of the statute. That's not what this statute does. This statute says every use of the information is just fine, except this one, this one that allows one speaker who we don't really like to go out and convey its message. The second difference is the public importance of the speech involved. What that consumer information would be used for is to make some random consumer pitch to you or about you. This is information about lifesaving medications where the detailer goes in and talks about double blind scientific studies that are responsible for the development of drugs that have caused 40 percent of the increase in the lifespan of the American public. So there's a tremendous difference in the public importance. The third is the fundamentally different nature of the privacy interest. Unlike your consumer transaction over the Internet, this is a doctor. You can call up any doctor's office and find out what their prescribing practice is. It's part of their business. Imagine the following conversation, if you will, and that is, and -- and if you want to look for a place in the common law where this comes from, it would be section 652D of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, what things are private and what aren't. It asks whether a reasonable person would be outraged. If one doctor were to say to another one, you know what, Dr. Smith told people that three out of four times I prescribe Aciphex for -- as a proton pump inhibitor, would anybody be outraged about that? No. But if you knew that the -- the company that you bought from on the Internet was selling that information or if they were giving away private medical information, you would genuinely be outraged. So, Justice Sotomayor, the reason I started this argument about it has to end up in the middle is we know that statutes like that have to be constitutional. At the same time, we know that the government can use controls over information to really distort speech. So the question is, what happens in this statute? And this statute has a structure that's not intended to protect privacy. It would look totally different.",
  "Well -­",
  "Sure. A couple of things. Remember, the patients have nothing to do with this. The State doesn't give any control to the patient. That would be true before or after. So we're talking about the doctors. I -- I did concede, when I read you finding 29 at page 7 of the appendix, that this does give a little bit more control to the doctor. I mean, it just does.",
  "Yes.",
  "I agree, Justice Ginsburg. Justice Sotomayor in her question to me said, why don't I read this as giving -- she said that they aren't giving patients options about what happens with this prescription information. My only point was this statute doesn't change it. You're quite right that our -- our position is no threat to the protection of private health information, which is reasonably regarded as extremely confidential. So, on the question of whether it give some greater control, it does. But what -- the thing you have to focus on here is the line that it draws in when it gives greater control is a line that's intended to discriminate against a speaker. You have to look, take -- I'll give you an example of this, Cincinnati v. Discovery Network. The City of Cincinnati came to you and said, look, we've eliminated the commercial news racks, and these people who want to sell their commercial stuff should use something other than news racks. We're targeting the blight that comes from commercial news racks. This Court said: Look, you can't redefine your interests to reflect your statute. You can't -­",
  "Sure.",
  "Yes. That's LAPD v. United Reporting.",
  "Because the key point in LAPD v. United Reporting is that it's in the hands of the government. Let me -- the fact -­",
  "That's what they say. They're just not right. The -­",
  "This information -- I would direct you to the amicus brief -- you don't have to pull it out right now, but for later. The brief of the National Association of Chain Drugstores, if you just make a reference, on pages 10 to 11 collects the history of how this information has been gathered. And they make the point that the Court did in the first 30 minutes, that of course the doctor is going to put his name on the prescription. We have to be able to call the doctor and say: I can't read your handwriting.",
  "Yes.",
  "That would be LAPD. If the -- it would be almost LAPD.",
  "Right.",
  "Sure. If it's in the hands of the -- so let me just make sure I am on the same page. I am going to answer your question directly. The pharmacy can't disclose it directly to anyone else. The government gets a copy of it. That does not make it LAPD. If the pharmacy was government­ owned, that would be LAPD. Now, let me answer your hypothetical. Right? LAPD, it was an arrest record, it was in the hands only of the State. The Court said: Look, this is the State's information. Justice Ginsburg's concurrence says: It's like a subsidy, the decision whether to give it out or not. Now, in your hypothetical, which is it is in a private hand, but it is banned for any other use -­ that would be a real privacy statute. I think that it would still be unconstitutional, but it would be much closer. The reason it might be unconstitutional is twofold. First, that the privacy interest in it I think is not very significant, because it's how the doctor runs his or her business, and second it would still allow the discrimination. If you were convinced in your hypothetical that what Vermont was trying to do is what it said it was doing here in its findings, and that is, to make it harder for the drug companies to reach the audience and make it easier for the insurance company and the government to reach their audience, Greater New Orleans Broadcasting, which involves a ban on private casino speech but not tribal and governmental speech, says discriminating against speakers like that is very troubling. So that's I think how your hypothetical -­",
  "I am saying that that's unconstitutional. I am also saying that the reason is very specific to this kind of information, that is that it would allow speaker discrimination, and I am also saying most emphatically that is not this case. That would be a much closer case. It would look much more like a real privacy statute. What I would take from the hypothetical is not the lesson we should lose -- and you should never take that lesson -­",
  "-- but the -- but instead the lesson that that's what's so different about this statute. This statute, as in all the language quoted earlier, says Katie bar the door, do whatever you want to do with this stuff, just don't do something we disagree with when it comes to the message.",
  "I am -­",
  "That is a principal part of our argument. I did say before in describing the Kerry-McCain bill, that there were three things, not just the discrimination, but the greater public interest of the -- the detailer speech and the lower privacy interest, so I wouldn't throw those out. Now can I just preempt an argument that my friend from the Vermont -- State of Vermont is going to say in her rebuttal? And that, is she's going to come and say that, look, the insurance companies are actually paying for the drugs. All their -- this exception is not one that's about advocacy, and I just want to make sure we all know ahead of time because I don't get a surrebuttal, that that's not accurate. So if -- if you still have the IMS brief with you at page 53 this time, so at page 53 the first paragraph is about the State's own use of this information for a variety of purposes. There is -- the reply brief for the State introduces a debate about today whether they are using the NPI data for counter-detailing. There is no dispute that they use it for other State programs, like the drug utilization program -- that's the quotes in the first paragraph. But the better paragraph is going to be -- it's the second paragraph, it starts, the State -- \"the statute's parallel formulary compliance exemption.\" And this paragraph talks about advocacy by the insurance companies. So it's not just that the drug -- insurance company says to the doctor, I'll pay for -- $5 for this drug, but the insurance companies take PI data under the exemption in the statute, go to doctors and say we really think this cheaper drug would be better. That is straight-out speaker discrimination. So we quote Kolassa: \"Insurance companies are using physician-identifiable information to call physicians to try to get them to comply with formularies, to try to get them to change their prescribing in a way that may or may not be in the patient's best interests. In just\" -- this is a further quote -- \"In just the last couple of years there has been an amazing increase in the amount of information provided by payers, insurers that will send scientific documents to physicians\" -- I've rolled over to page 53 -- \"will call when physicians are prescribing too much or too little of a product and provide them with information.\" It goes on and on -- \"virtually several times a day.\" So that is the message that I would take away from the argument, and that is we are emphatically in favor of the constitutionality of HIPAA, of the McCain-Kerry bill, the things that concerned you. You have to decide this case in the middle about what Vermont actually did, and it was unbelievably candid about what it was trying to do. It said the marketplace of ideas doesn't work for us, and so it designed a statute -- and you can decide this case very narrowly on the ground that what Vermont did is it went too far is in just saying we're not actually trying to protect privacy; what we're trying to do is give the doctors control when it suits our own best interests. I do want to preempt one other last argument, and that is the suggestion that this isn't paternalistic at all. Right? We just let the doctors decide. But the State's goal, what the State is trying to do, is paternalistic. The reason the State picked this one exemption, the reason it picked between these speakers, is because it doesn't want this message to get to the doctors. And if you can keep -­",
  "Yes.",
  "Sure.",
  "Sure, right.",
  "I -- I thankfully am not. Here are the -- here are the cases. This was the argument that was made and rejected in Virginia Board of Pharmacy which was about a pharmacy rule. They said that it would be unprofessional. Then the Solicitor General in the person of Mr. Kneedler came you to in Thompson v. Western States and said we need to stop this compounded drug marketing because this is heavily regulated; this is a closed market, and the Court said, I'm sorry, no. The nature of a marketplace of ideas is you get to say your piece and the other side gets to say their piece. The FDA heavily regulates this area, the information is perfectly accurate and it's incredibly valuable.",
  "We would have much less of an objection, and that's no accident. Let me just say this is not a flaw in the drafting. The State really wanted to push its counter message, and thankfully so. This government has a real interest here. Insurers have a real interest here, but so does the other side of the debate, and what the State doesn't get to do is just pick sides and prevent the debate from happening.",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "Sure. Sure.",
  "You would take Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, and I don't think the Court has to confront whether such a statute would be constitutional because it would be very different.",
  "Sure. He said the rule is the pharmacy can't give it to anybody.",
  "I don't -- I don't understand why that protects privacy. That protects against commercialization, but I don't think the government has nearly as much interest in commercialization as it does in actual privacy. Section 652D of the restatement of torts doesn't talk about the outrage of being able to use -- we have a capitalist economy, and we sell newspapers and books and that sort of thing. Commercialization isn't a bad thing. It's a question of whether privacy is genuinely protected.",
  "You look to -- yes, we win -- Thompson v. Western States. Remember what the government's argument there was: If you allow the marketing of compounded drugs that are not FDA approved you will evade the very important FDA regulatory program. That was a perfectly important rationale, and the Court said but it also has the purpose of keeping information out of the hands of doctors. It's unconstitutional. I'll give you another example. Grosjean, Minneapolis Star and -- Raglan -- those are cases about taxing the instruments of communication. So a tax on newsprint, a tax on ink; and the Court said we're not worried about your bad motive, you have a very important rationale in trying to raise revenue, that's a perfectly valid purpose; but what you're also doing is you're picking out the press and you're making it harder to speak; it's unconstitutional.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Oh, okay. Two pieces to the puzzle. The first is why can't I demand it from the IRS? Okay? And second is going to be why can't the accountant give it away? The first one is LAPD, and it's the same true -- the same thing is true of campaign finance reports. The government has plenary authority; when you give information to the government, what the government then does with the information. The important lesson to be derived from LAPD is that nine members of the Court seemingly agreed -­ and I defended the statute in that case -- nine members of the court in that case agreed that if this had been private reports rather than the government's reports, then the statute would have been unconstitutional. The reason your tax preparer can't give it away, the reason I can't give away attorney-client secrets, the reason that the government is going to be able to tell Internet companies that they can't give await the consumer information is that it's really private. But what if, instead, the government had a rule that says tax preparers can't give out tax information when it will encourage people to protest against their taxes? But if it will encourage people to comply with their taxes, it's perfectly fine. You can't draw lines that are intended to discriminate against speakers. That's the main principle of our case. Thank you very much.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: We ask this Court to hold that a jail may strip search an arrestee in cases of reasonable suspicion. That is the rule that was applied throughout almost the entire country in the three decades after Bell v. Wolfish, without either administrative difficulty or any apparent increase in smuggling. We're here today, of course, because both the Burlington Jail and the Essex County Jail require every arrestee to stand 2 feet in front of a correctional officer and strip naked.",
  "We do apply it to all arrestees. The Respondents and the U.S. Bureau of Prisons do draw a line at major versus minor offenders. I think they do that because they think that people who commit more serious crimes might be inclined to greater criminality. But our rule is one of reasonable suspicion. Our question presented draws a line at minor offenders because this class definition is only people who were arrested for minor offenses.",

  "Yes. Yes, and, in fact -­",
  "The category -- there is a categorical rule, and that is -- that was adopted by these Respondents, by the Bureau of Prisons, and four court of appeals, that says if you were arrested for a more serious offense, categorically there exists reasonable suspicion. Our case-by-case rule, it's true, applies with respect to minor offenders. And, again, that's the class that was defined here.",

  "Yes.",
  "If the jail made that judgment, we would think that a court would not overturn that judgment.

  "Right.",
  "Well, a couple of points, Justice Kennedy. I think it's an incredibly important issue. They don't have a blanket rule. Remember, the Respondents apply a reasonable suspicion standard. They do strip everyone naked, but if they're going to look for contraband -- that is, look at the person's mouth, look at their anus -- they apply a reasonable suspicion standard. Now, to your very serious concern that maybe we are inviting discrimination or at least an appearance of discrimination, remember that their rule is going to produce more of that problem than ours, because their rule is not that they have to strip search -- they have to strip search everyone for contraband, but their rule is they can. They can make a choice. This Court in the Fourth -- they say we -­",

  "Yes.",

  "Showering in the presence of officers is not something that requires reasonable suspicion. The courts have uniformly concluded that if you are just generally in an area in which you're being monitored by the officers, that's not a Fourth Amendment search that violates a reasonable expectation of privacy. This is different.",
  "There are two different scenarios. One is a common room where everyone is standing around, and for jail security purposes -­",
  "A common room, a common shower area. And, of course, for security purposes. This is different, Justice Ginsburg. You asked what's prohibited in the absence of reasonable suspicion. What's prohibited is standing 2 feet away from the person -­",

What the courts of appeals have uniformly recognized, in the lower Federal courts, what the literature recognizes and really what I think concerned this Court in the Safford case is that when you are standing so close to the person inspecting their genitals, looking directly at their most private parts of their bodies, that is a direct intrusion on their individual privacy -­",

  "Okay.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "You can. So, let me just say -- let me just try and close off my answer to the question of the 5 versus 10 feet and then turn immediately to this visual body cavity search. Remember, this is -- the Court will recall that this is a reprise of the argument in the Safford case, where the schools there argued that, well, there's an observation of these students in gym class, they shower together naked, they undress naked. And the Court said it's quite different when you're standing right there looking over the student. Now, as to -- and said that's what implicates a Fourth Amendment right of privacy, and the distinction did make sense. As to your question, yes, there is a material difference, we think, although we think both should be covered by our rule. But a visual body cavity inspection as occurred in the Essex facility here, where you require someone to bend over and cough, which is what the testimony is in this case -­",
  "That's correct. That -- the second jail had a slightly different search protocol, in which the testimony is that he was required to bend over and cough and expose his anus for inspection. And the Respondents themselves regard that as a more significant intrusion, and they apply a reasonable suspicion standard themselves to that.",
  "We don't believe that the premise is correct. If you read history differently than me, I'm not going to be able to persuade you. But our understanding of the history is that the closest they can come to is two things: First, that people were strip searched upon arrest, and that's certainly not the rule under the Fourth Amendment; and that in certain jails at the time of the founding, other inmates in a process of ablution, what is almost kind of a ritual cleansing, would strip search new inmates. It had nothing to do with the jail officials themselves or trying to intercept contraband.",
  "It's just a -­",
  "Well, first, it wasn't a nearly -- the nearly uniform practice that I think your question assumes. And it's just a different kettle of fish entirely, that -- we don't believe, obviously, that that historical lesson obtains today, that the prisoners can strip search new inmates as they -- new arrestees as they come in. I do agree with the basic premise of your question that it's -- our position can't just be that, hey, I've got a reasonable rule. I do have to, in either under the terms of Bell v. Wolfish or Turner v. Safley, establish that this is an exaggerated response, that this is much more, materially more than is necessary to accomplish their goals.",
  "No, Justice Ginsburg, we disagree with that. At least as to the second search, we think that there is no difference between the degree of intrusion here and in Bell. But there is another significant reason that this -- not just in the nature of the search, but a big difference between this case and Bell is that the inmates in that case made a voluntary choice. They decided to have the contact visits that was -­",

The Burlington County -- the only evidence about a conclusion of the jail about reasonable suspicion is that the Burlington County intake officer filled out a form saying there is no reasonable suspicion here.

  "I do with respect to the Essex -- I apologize -- no. What happened here is that Essex, after this search occurred -- and this is described in the Essex brief in opposition, in case you want to look at it later, at 3 in note 1. Essex, after the search in this case, changed its policy.",

There is nothing about that the jail would have had any information suggesting that he had some charge involving a deadly weapon. And that's why they themselves certified that there was no reasonable suspicion.",
  "Sure. First, that is not the view of the jails in this case. Remember, they apply a reasonable suspicion standard. They did not find any concern in their own policies, neither does the Marshals Service, ICE, with this prospect of some prior offense. As to what the rule is and how common it is and whether this works in practice, the jail here did look him up in the New Jersey Criminal Justice Information System. That's in the record. They're required by New Jersey law to do that. It's a -- every single one of these jails has computer access to the NJ CJIS, and also to the NCIC; they just type in his identifying information. They were able to pull him up without any difficulty, and they have not complained that they didn't have enough information about him. They filled out a form saying there is no reasonable suspicion here. And remember, our rule only operates in a system, Justice Kennedy, in which the jail does have enough information. When -- our point is this: If the jail has the facts, as it did here, to affirmatively determine that there is no reasonable suspicion, which is what they decided about Mr. Florence, then it is an extraordinary intrusion on dignity and autonomy to strip him naked -­",
  "-- when they have no reason to do so.",
  "Sure. There is because they do this already. They -- it is not an administrative problem. They apply our rule today. Remember, Mr. Chief Justice, when he arrived at the Burlington County Jail, they did an assessment of him and determined that there was no reasonable suspicion. The jails in this case did pull up his prior criminal history, and they have no problem doing that. They apply our standard today. It is not a difficult one. But -­",

  "Yes, I believe that that's -- I think that's a fair statement of the law. I do have a second point, though, and that is that the principal reason underlying Bell v. Wolfish's holding that those searches were reasonable is that it was essential to deter smuggling, and that deterrence rationale has much more of an attenuated relationship to this case. Remember that the inmate in that case was having a planned meeting with someone, and the representation of the government is that our problem is if you plan to have somebody come visit you and you're going to have a contact visit, you can plan for them to try and sneak something to you. This Court has set -­",
  "Well, can I just read to you what the Court said about that? Just so -- the Court did have a slightly different take, I think. And this is from page 559 of the Court's opinion: \"That there has been only one instance where an MCC inmate was discovered attempting to smuggle contraband into the institution on his person may be more a testament to the effectiveness of the search technique as a deterrent than to any lack of interest on the part of the inmate to secrete and import such items when the opportunity arises.\" And our point is that that -- when you have an unexpected arrest here -- remember, Mr. Florence showed the paperwork that he was not wanted for arrest.

  "Okay.",

The courts have said that that is not itself a -- because of the prospect of handling that problem with shampoo, which is what these jails do, that that's not a sufficient -- a sufficient justification to require the person to strip naked. The only other point that I did want to make is that this is the rule, not just at Burlington and Essex, but also of the U.S. Marshals Service, which has the intake of 220,000 inmates every year, and also of the Bureau of Immigration Customs Enforcement, which intakes 384,000 a year.",
  "That's not correct. That is only the policy of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, which has an intake of minor offenders of only a few thousand people a year. For the Marshals Service and for ICE, which have a combined 600,000 people every year, they do not have that separate housing rule. If I could reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Yes.",
  "We -- if the -- we do, because they still have to stand naked directly in front of the correctional officer under the superseding policy. What the superseding policy is, which is Burlington's policy throughout this, is that they will not search the person for contraband, which is their supposed interest here, for contraband, in the absence of reasonable suspicion. Both jails at the time of this search and also now will still require the person to strip naked, supposedly for contraband, even though their own policy says we won't search for -- we won't engage in the depth of search that's required, we won't look at the anus, we won't look in the person's mouth, in the absence of reasonable suspicion.",
  "That is the current policy.",
  "We do have -- I -­",
  "That's correct.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's right.",
  "Thank you, sir. I have three points to make: The first is that my friend from the United States says defer to the experts. But the point that the United States consistently omits is that there are 600,000 offenders that go into the Federal system every year. I don't understand the claim that -- this only involves 1 percent of Federal offenders. The Marshals Service and ICE admit 600,000 offenders every year under our standard. They are not kept in separate housing. These are cited in our brief. Six hundred thousand people, is their expert judgment, are subject to a reasonable suspicion standard when they're admitted to jail. The second point, about numbers, Justice Breyer, there is a significant empirical study, and that is the County of Orange case. The district judge there did an unbelievably detailed job going through the record of 26,000 admissions into the system and was able to identify only a single instance where contraband would have gotten in under a reasonable suspicion standard. There is also evidence in this case, and it is the evidence, to my surprise, that my friends keep pointing to. There's a memorandum from the Essex jail system. It's at page 70a to 71a of the joint appendix. And it tells you two really relevant things. It says every year they admit 25,175 people into this jail, and that they only found 14 instances of contraband. And they don't even make the claim that those 14 instances out of 25,000 would not have been found under a reasonable suspicion standard. So, you have evidence in this record about this particular case. Third, a couple of points have been made about whether -- Justice Breyer, you asked whether someone who's high on drugs. The uniform rule -- and this is not just the ABA but the expert standard of the American Correctional Association. What they say is that essentially almost anything will do. What will not amount to reasonable suspicion is when you have a minor offender -- and we do have -- there are 700,000 people in jail in the United States every year for misdemeanor offenses. This is -- this is a lot of people who are having a very significant intrusion on privacy. And the expert standard, the rule that was applied under Bell v. Wolfish, is that when you have people who come in on a minor offense -- they don't have any drug history. They are not high on drugs. There was no opportunity to hide a weapon. I'm not sure where they think the gun is going to be hidden that's not going to show up in the very close manual pat down that they do of every one of these people that isn't going to show up in -­",
  "Well, first, there are real categories that are overinclusive in favor of the jails, like if it's a serious offense or if they have any drug history. And then on top of that, if there's any individualized basis that the jails can articulate, that will do as well. We are not saying that categorically people will be excluded from being searched. We're saying that there are entire categories that will automatically be searchable. We're just saying don't throw the baby out with the bath water. When somebody is pulled over like Mr. Florence, and there's just -- it's laugh-out-loud funny to think he's smuggling in -- something into this jail; that it's too much of an intrusion to put him under the direct, you know, 2 feet away, I'm going to look at your genitals, as opposed to the ordinary intrusion of saying we're going to oversee the showers. There is no evidence when it comes to that group of people, and there are a lot of them, that they represent anything like a material threat of smuggling. And this is a very significant intrusion on individual privacy and individual dignity. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: In the Fair Labor Standards Act, Congress directed the Secretary of Labor to quote/unquote \"define and delimit\" the statute's outside salesman exemption. By regulation, the Secretary provided that an outside salesman is one who makes sales rather than promoting sales by others. In further guidance, the Secretary elaborated that nonexempt promotion includes either, one, a conversation where there can be no commitment or, two, one where there will be no exchange with the employer. Now, everyone agrees that a pharmaceutical detailer engages in promotion. They tout drugs to doctors. Everyone agrees that there can't be a commitment to issue a prescription. Everyone agrees that a prescription is not an exchange with a pharmaceutical company. But nonetheless, the Respondent argues that pharmaceutical detailers sell drugs directly to doctors as a matter of law. They say that follows from the fact that the Secretary's regulation incorporates the definition of \"sale\" in the FLSA, which is in the blue brief in the appendix at page 1. That definition, which is section 203(k), provides -- it's the second provision on the page -- \"'sale' or 'sell' includes any sale, exchange, contract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.\" And what you will not find in that language is anything that contradicts the two points the Secretary has made, which is that there has to be a commitment or that, at the very least, there has to be an exchange with the employer.",
  "It is an arrangement for transfer of title, and that's why it's critical that it says a consignment for sale, the sale being the transfer of title. But in all events, this case is not a fight about transferring title or some lesser form of exchange, because there's no exchange between the doctor and the --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "There is an agreement for a transfer of title, and I believe there --",
  "I apologize. There is not a transfer of title, but there is an agreement for a transfer of title. They -- just to be clear, the Government says the definition of \"sale\" includes a transfer of title. And so, all I'm pointing out, if I could just go back to the definition -- I apologize for not answering --",
  "Oh, no --",
  "Sure. Well, I apologize if I've created some --",
  "Yes.",
  "There is --",
  "Yes. I believe -- I will allow you -- I apologize saying \"I will allow you.\" The --",
  "It would be -- you can do, I know, whatever you want. The Government can explain it --",
  "Yes. All right. It is -- the statute refers to a consignment for sale. I believe they're defining a sale in that phrase. But in all events, the debate over whether it includes or is limited to a transfer of title is not at issue in this case, because what the -- because all the statute requires is that there, at the very least, be some exchange of some part. There's going to be an -- a binding agreement, a commitment, and that commitment will involve an exchange with the employer. What happens in pharmaceutical detailing is that there can't be any commitment to issue a prescription at all --",
  "I'm sorry. So, your premise is that they are exempt to begin with? There -- I can tell you that there are a large number of employees who do work outside the workplace and are substantially more autonomous than are pharmaceutical detailers, who have to operate from very strict scripts. There are -- it's literally --",
  "Sure. Well, you can have emergency service workers that are working outside. There are lots of people -- so, for example, you may well --",
  "I apologize.",
  "A police officer or a fireman, an ambulance driver. They are constantly outside the office. You can also have lots of different kinds of promotion --",
  "Well, that -- my --",
  "That is not quite right, Justice Scalia. They are expected -- the joint appendix explains -- to be in the doctors' offices between 8:30 and 5:00 p.m. They work additional time. The fact that --",
  "That's -- but that is when they are supposed to be in the doctors' offices. That's dictated by the company.",
  "Well, a couple things about that, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "There actually are very strict restrictions. That kind of activity is under the PhRMA Code, which is trying to interpret Federal law, is actually very heavily restricted. But whatever it is that the employee is doing to further the employment relationship is going to be hours on duty. It is really important I think that while it is true that a pharmaceutical detailer has many of the characteristics of an outside salesman, the one they don't have is selling. And that is the line that Congress drew. It --",
  "Sure.",
  "Sure.",
  "Sure. Another example would be insurance adjusters. There are people who are outside cleaning people that are not -- that don't have any --",
  "Yes. Yes, Justice Kennedy, they absolutely are.",
  "I would, but they would all be one of two things. They would either fall within the administrative exemption, which is, Justice Ginsburg, what is -- Congress was talking about when it talked about people who have a lot of autonomy, and which is not true of detailers -- or some other exemption. So, to give an example, certain outside buyers are exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act. A good -- that's a good example, because if you're an outside buyer of poultry, then you are exempt, but if you are an outside buyer of meat, you aren't. It is one of a lot of different places -- there are 50-some exemptions from the Fair Labor Standards Act. And Congress drew incredibly fine lines.",
  "Yes.",
  "That is a sale, but the difference here is that there's neither a commitment -- remember, the commitment is illegal as a matter of law.",
  "Justice Scalia, if that is the commitment, then all of promotion I think is going to be a sale, because every promoter who walks up to you on the street saying will you try my product, will you go into the store, is trying to get you to say I'll go in. And that is much more of a direct commitment than you saying I'll consider it in an appropriate circumstance. The commitment by a doctor is precatory at most. They do not make any commitment in any instance that can be binding in any way that they will prescribe a drug for anyone. And remember, there is the second -- the second distinction. So, that's one. But the second is that -- remember, there is a purchase in your hypothetical of framing, a purchase from the framing store. But the second part of the Secretary's guidance is that when the doctor decides to issue a prescription, they're not exchanging anything with the drug company. There -- nothing is acquired from the drug company. That is a very significant difference.",
  "Well, there are two things. The first is the commitment, and they are not selling anything to the doctor. Remember, just to frame this industry, the pharmaceutical company sells its products; it sells them to pharmaceutical wholesalers, which sell them to pharmacies -- pardon me -- which sell them to customers, which have a relationship with a doctor, who may or may not have met with a detailer. There is a sale here in this industry, but it is to a pharmaceutical detailer, and that is a very significant difference. The critical point as well for purposes of --",
  "Those are not, but the example that I gave to Justice Kennedy would be, which is that there are outside buyers who do receive commissions. And remember, of course, that there are outside salesmen who do not receive commissions but are nonetheless exempt. Congress didn't write an exemption about commissions; it wrote them about whether it's an outside person who engages in sales. And the other point I was trying to make is that -- and Justice Scalia echoed it to some extent -- and that is that the FLSA draws very fine lines. If you work for a movie theater you are exempt, but not a playhouse. If you work for a small newspaper but not a small magazine, you're exempt. If you care for the elderly but not the young, you're exempt. And what Congress said is that there has to be -- you are an outside salesman and that -- it is true that this is a peculiar industry, but the peculiarity of it is that you don't make sales. If I could reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Three quick points. First, if you read the transcript, you will see that my friend says that the nature of this job has changed. And that is an essential part of understanding this case. And there is an entire amicus brief in addition to our submission on behalf of pharmaceutical representatives, which explains how very much the requirements of pharmaceutical detailers and the restrictions on them have changed dramatically over the last couple of decades in particular. And that's why the continued references to 70 years are wrong. The other important point about the FLSA in particular is that there is a statute on this issue, and it says that an employer can request guidance from the agency; and if it doesn't do that, it is not -- it has no defense. Its job is to ask for guidance. And there are 50 different exemptions from the FLSA that cover hundreds of different categories of employees. And if the rule you are going to announce -- because Mr. Clement's view is you shouldn't be bound by any precedent. If the rule you are going to now announce is that there has to be rulemaking with respect to all of those, it's going to be an administrative nightmare. Two quick further points. The Department of Labor's position is that there has to be an actual commitment, not a precatory commitment. And Mr. Clement says, well, that's contrary to the definition of \"sale\" in 3(k). Please read the definition again, and if you find something in there, something that is not a commitment -- it can be an exchange; it can be a commitment that is even a consignment; it can be a traditional sale. Every one of those things is commitment. It is impossible to find in the definition of \"commitment\" a rule that says -- excuse me, in the definition of \"sale\" --",
  "There are two different parts to it. One is that they -- as explained by Mr. Stewart, their view of transfer of title, but the Weiss Report says repeatedly that there has to be a commitment to buy. That is --",
  "You have to agree --",
  "You have to --",
  "It is the agreement to transfer title. There are two parts to it.",
  "But there has to be the agreement, a firm agreement. It's repeated in the 2004 preamble to the regulations as well. Now, the last critical point I want to make is that Mr. Clement says there are commissions on sales in the sales territory. And what he is not talking about is any commitment by a physician. When you go look at the transcript and he talks about sales in the sales territory, he is talking about the sales by the pharmacy. That's where the sale occurs in this industry. It's to the wholesaler and to the pharmacy and to the customer. He is not talking about a sale in the sense of getting a commitment to have --",
  "That -- Mr. Justice Kennedy, I don't believe that you can fairly describe that as a finding of fact. That is the judge -- his view of the summary judgment record. It is --",
  "Two -- two things about that. First is that a detailer doesn't get a commitment to a prescription. And then in addition, it's clear that there are numerous influences on what a doctor does. There's all the advertising --",
  "It is an important point. It is a different point, but it is --",
  "Justice Scalia, the point that I will make at bottom is that you have to have a firm commitment. That's what the Department says. And there is nothing in the definition in 3(k) that contradicts that.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, thank you very much. May it please the Court: Today's undercard is an immigration case. Adrian Moncrieffe was convicted of possession with intent to distribute marijuana, under Georgia law, the question in the case is whether he was thereby convicted of a controlled substances offense, which is a deportable offense, but also an aggravated felony of illicit trafficking in drugs, which would mean that the Attorney General has no discretion to cancel his removal. Now, everyone agrees that, under the Georgia statute, there is going to be some conduct that would be a Federal felony, but it's also undisputed that the Georgia statute regularly involves prosecutions that would be Federal misdemeanors. So - -",
  "They were not. We do not - - we attempted very hard to collect them. This is the information I can give you about Federal and State prosecutions of marijuana cases in the United States. In the State system, the most recent available data -- it was published by the Department of Justice in 2006, but we have no reason to believe that it's changed materially -- in 2006, there were roughly 750,000 prosecutions in the States for marijuana offenses. By contrast, in the Federal system, we have data from 2010. And we have two different kinds of data here that's a little bit more granular, and that is, for prosecutions under 841(b)(1), which is the trafficking provision, there were 6,200 cases. For prosecutions under 841(b)(4) -- which is the provision we say you ought to look at here -- and 844 -- which is the possession provision -- combined, there were only 93 prosecutions in 2010. And what we think that illustrates is that there is a massive amount of activity in the States doing things that show that this -- and this case is perfectly commonplace, we think. It's consistent with the other cases that we've seen published by the BIA. Adrian Moncrieffe possessed - -",
  "Yeah. I apologize. Yes, Justice Kennedy, that's right. The Georgia statute, which just refers to possession with intent to distribute, contemplates both social sharing of marijuana -- this case, for example, 1.3 grams of marijuana, which is less than - -",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg, although this is -- we believe the case is proceeding under the categorical approach, the answer to your question is yes. So let me take you to two places. One is going to be at the back of the blue brief, where we have the chemist's report, so page 19. This is from the - - the record in the immigration proceedings. And on page 19 of the appendix to our blue brief -- we just agreed because there was so little record material, that we wouldn't have a joint appendix in the case. We just published it at the end of our brief -- it says, \"Material weight less than 1 ounce. Approximate weight is 1.3 grams.\" And for those of us who've been fortunate enough not to experience the drug laws a lot, that's less than half the weight of this penny. So it's -- I think everybody agrees, a small amount. Now, on the question of no remuneration, what I have to offer you is the Georgia statute - -",
  "Sorry.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yeah. 1.3 grams. 1.3. That's -- that's very, very, very, very little. So then, on the question of remuneration - - and I should just step back and explain, the reason we're talking about this is that the Federal misdemeanor provision, 841(b)(4), says that it's not a felony, and thus, it wouldn't be an aggravated felony, if it's a small amount and no remuneration. And Justice Ginsburg asked about the -- what's in the record about that. Now, there isn't record evidence about no remuneration, but there is one significant fact. And to know that fact, you have to look at the Georgia statute, which is also at the end of our brief. It's on page 9 of our appendix. This is the statute he was prosecuted under. It's the second provision, Section 16-13-30(j)(1). And I'll just read it. \"It is unlawful for any person to possess, have under his control, manufacture, deliver, distribute, dispense, administer, purchase, sell\" - - sell -- \"or possess with intent to distribute marijuana.\" And he was not charged with and he was not convicted of selling. And so we think that should negative any indication -- any implication that he might have gotten remuneration for this.",
  "Under our rule, the plea colloquy is irrelevant, but we would win under a rule in which it was relevant. So, to start with the former, we say that the categorical rule applies. There's no -- the only reason that you would look at the modified categorical approach here is to know that it was a possession with intent to distribute conviction, rather than a sale conviction, but that evidence would still come in. It would be highly relevant. It's the basis that this Court explained in Carachuri-Rosendo, that the immigration judge would deny cancellation of removal. Right? That factor would still be highly relevant. The Attorney General would exercise his discretion in such a case. Now - -",
  "Oh, this -- you said still felons. We - -",
  "But that's exactly right.",
  "Right.",
  "So -- you know, lawyers often try and avoid the strength of the other side's case. And so let me just confront what I think is a big argument of theirs. They say our position is underinclusive because the Georgia statute does include conduct that would be a felony. You just gave an example of it. But our point is that our underinclusivity is a problem, but it's not a big problem, it's not as big as their problem, because, as this Court explained in Carachuri-Rosendo, the offense still is removable, and the Attorney General will just deny cancellation of removal. Now, the reason they have a much bigger practical problem is that their rule is overinclusive. It treats, as felonies, some convictions that should be misdemeanors.",
  "Okay.",
  "Because I don't think anybody would believe me if I went to an immigration judge and I said, judge, I promise, I promise that the fact that this isn't a possession with intent to distribute case means that there are never cases in - -",
  "Right. We -- I think - -",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes.",
  "We have not read this Court's cases to suggest that we call the State attorneys. We have read the Court's cases to engage in ordinary statutory construction, and sell means sell - -",
  "Yeah.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Sure. Because the government's position is -- and the Eleventh Circuit has agreed with it -- and just to -- just to make sure everyone is on the same page, and that is, the Federal statute is triggered by a conviction. Justice Breyer has just made the point that, as a matter of State law, he was not even convicted because he got first offender treatment here, which is a point in our favor. It does show that it was a small and non-serious offense. The reason is that there is a Federal definition of convicted that's independent of the State definition of convicted.",
  "That's exactly right.",
  "Yes. That's correct. And it's an even stronger point in our favor because worse than interviewing four district attorneys is having a fact-bound inquiry into every one of these immigration cases. Remember - -",
  "Yeah.",
  "Yes.",
  "That is one way of looking at it. We disagree, for reasons I'll explain. I will note in our favor that the Attorney General doesn't even defend that position anymore. Remember, that they do not argue that you can just look at the conviction. They want to have the fact-bound inquiry into every one of these cases. And the reason is that, if you apply the categorical approach to - -",
  "No, they want to do it in - - in every single case at the beginning. So I can just make clear everybody's position. There really - -",
  "Sorry.",
  "In every case at the beginning. So I'll - -",
  "No, in the middle -- at the beginning of the immigration proceedings.",
  "So let me - -",
  "Yes. So let me explain.",
  "So our position is it is a controlled substances offense, and you take account of the seriousness of the offense in cancellation. Their position is that it is presumptively, but only presumptively, an aggravated felony. And in every single immigration proceeding, when you have a case like this, the noncitizen can come forward with fact-found evidence, not limited to the record of conviction - -",
  "That's correct.",
  "Well, let me just say first, I do want to make -- just want to focus on what the parties' positions are. And they do have this fact-found inquiry in every one, so I do want to turn to what I think is probably their second best argument. I was talking about the underinclusiveness as the first one. Their second one is they want to draw an analogy between this and what would happen in a criminal case. So they say, take the conviction and imagine that the conviction is all the facts that you had in a Federal criminal prosecution, and then you would have a burden on the defendant to -- to prove that he was subject to the misdemeanor. We have several points about that. The first is this is not a Federal criminal prosecution. The Federal statute involved is the Immigration and Naturalization Act, and it tells you that you are supposed to look at the conviction itself and determine whether it corresponds to a Federal felony. This further proceeding doesn't exist, and it's exactly the argument that was rejected in Carachuri-Rosendo. And let me talk about why - -",
  "No, we disagree. What the Court said in -- I agree with the beginning of how you characterize the Carachuri case. What the Court said is we don't go beyond the -- the conviction itself. We -- And it's true that, in that case, the government wanted to go beyond the record to go up. But here, what they're saying is that you should go beyond the record to figure out if you should go down. And what the Court said is, no, you look at the conviction itself.",
  "Okay.",
  "Yes.",
  "It is what you are convicted of. So here, he was convicted of possession with intent to distribute. The other side's argument is, well, if I had just possession with intent to distribute, that would be a Federal felony. So we acknowledge the strength of that point. But our - -",
  "As I was -- I mentioned very briefly to Justice Sotomayor, when you have a divisible statute like this, that includes possession with intent to distribute, sell, possess, all of those things, you use the modified categorical approach to figure out which one applies. And so we know he was convicted of possession with intent to distribute, and that's common ground between the parties. It's not the whole statute. It's just the - -",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "I hope we will.",
  "Well, two reasons. First, they don't have a real solution; and, second, Congress solved our problem. And this is what Carachuri-Rosendo says, and that is when you have an underinclusiveness problem just like ours, the statute fixes it because the statute treats the conviction as a controlled substances offense. The statute provides the backstop. You don't have to make one up, which, I -- I suggest to you, is the difficulty with their position.",
  "Okay.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "I agree with - -",
  "That is our problem. I agree with that problem.",
  "Okay. That's the part we disagree with, Justice Ginsburg. Maybe I can just read to you what this Court said about this exact issue in Carachuri-Rosendo. It said that, when you have a very -- this very underinclusiveness problem, it is solved by the statute because the attorney -- all that happens under our rule -- it's still a deportable offense, and the Attorney General denies cancellation of removal. So if could just read, very briefly -- and this is from the Supreme Court Reporter, at page 2589. \"We note that whether a noncitizen has committed an aggravated felony is relevant, inter alia, to the type of relief he may obtain from a removal order, but not to whether he is, in fact, removable. \"In other words, to the extent that our rejection of the government's broad understanding of the scope of aggravated felony may have any practical effect on policing our Nation's borders, it is a limited one. Carachuri-Rosendo and others in his position may now seek cancellation of removal and thereby avoid the harsh consequence of mandatory removal, but he will not avoid the fact that his conviction makes him\" - -",
  "No, Justice Ginsburg, it does not. I promise you it does not. The upshot of our position is that Mr. Moncrieffe has committed a controlled substances offense, and anyone else in his position has committed one. And if there is a serious drug amount, the Attorney General will deny him cancellation of removal. I have - -",
  "We -- it's an interesting question that I have puzzled about at length. I think the answer is no for a very particular reason, however, and that is the Attorney General has no such categorical rules. We think it's a point in our favor that the Attorney General, in the application starting with 212(c) before the 1996 Act, which is discussed in St. - - this Court's decision in St. Cyr, through the present has instead applied a holistic look at all of the circumstances. What he certainly can do is direct the immigration judges to place special weight -- and this was the rule before 1996, by the way. If you had a serious offense, you had to show special equities that would justify your not being removed from the country. And so we think that's the most likely outcome. A per se categorical rule would be very unlike what we understand the Attorney General to do in any other circumstance.",
  "I think - -",
  "Well, we think we would win, so I wouldn't be back for this client. But I think there would be a substantial argument that it would be arbitrary and capricious because it would be so unlike anything the Attorney General does in other circumstances. But they would have - -",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "To treat all of these cases as barring cancellation of removal. To get us on the back end, as it were, and that is - -",
  "Yes. To get - -",
  "Right.",
  "And I think our argument that it's arbitrary would be supported by the fact that this Court would have ruled that he couldn't do the identical thing on the front end. But it's an open question, and it's not presented here. I had said that there were two flaws in the -- sort of their characterization of the over and underinclusiveness problem. The second one is they don't have a real solution. This is a big problem. Under these State convictions in which the amount of drugs and whether there was remuneration are irrelevant, it's going to be extremely difficult for uncounseled noncitizens who are in jail, who don't have access to tools of communication, to prove to an immigration judge this fact-bound inquiry, which they are inserting into every single case, that their offense actually corresponds to a misdemeanor. So while you say that they have provided the solution, I don't know where it comes from in the statute, but we think it is not a practical solution. And that problem is even worse in the many contexts that are not just straight removal. We said in our opening brief, and the government's response ignores, that there are many cases in which immigration officials have to make these decisions about whether it's an aggravated felony much more on the fly, without the opportunity to call everybody in and - -",
  "We don't. We tried. I'm sorry. We were unable to do it. The Department of Justice has better relationships with prosecutors, and so maybe it -- it will have that information for you. But, I can say -- it's possible. But I can say that the -- it is absolutely commonplace, from looking at the case law, for the States to tackle this small social sharing of a couple of marijuana cigarettes. This is -- that's the distinction between 93 prosecutions under -- or convictions under (b)(4) and possession in the -- in the Federal system and 750,000 in the States. Federal prosecutors leave these to the States. Which brings me back to my other answer to Justice Ginsburg's pointing out the government's argument about a parallel between this and a Federal criminal prosecution. And the reason they want to do that, Justice Ginsburg, is that in a Federal -- actual Federal criminal prosecution, the burden of proof never matters, including because Federal prosecutors almost never bring these cases. So here's what we tried to do: This statute, (b)(4), was enacted in 1970, some 42 years ago. We tried to identify one case in 42 years in which the burden of proof in the Federal case made any difference at all, and we were unable to. And I would be really interested to know if my friend is able to identify one case in 42 years, which it actually made a difference. And the reason is, in an actual Federal prosecution, the FBI agent would come in and say, here are the drugs, and they were trying to sell it to an undercover officer. It's never the case that it actually -- the defendant is in a position of trying to prove that it was a misdemeanor. But what they are trying to do is to take that rule, which is derived from Apprendi, that there is a burden of proof so that the government doesn't have to indict that it wasn't a (b)(4) offense, and take the silence of the State record, where these facts are completely irrelevant, the quantity and remuneration, and transpose them into the Federal system and take great advantage of the fact that the record is silent.",
  "Yes.",
  "Sure.",
  "Yeah.",
  "There are about 15 of those States, and in those States, if you weren't convicted under the small one, then you would infer it wasn't a small amount and no remuneration, and the person would have committed an aggravated felony. Our issue arises only when you have a situation in which the State is prosecuting people under the statute that would be a Federal misdemeanor. If the State - -",
  "No. If the State has a different system, as a material number of States do, in which they track the Federal system, and they have a small provision or a remuneration provision -- which another nine States have a remuneration provision -- in those situations, if you have a conviction that isn't under that social sharing provision, it's an aggravated felony.",
  "Well, I have one really good example of a prosecution for a small amount. It's this case. And we don't deny that there are - - Mr. Chief Justice, please do not misunderstand me to be arguing that every Georgia conviction or that 80 or 90 percent of them are the small ones. What I'm trying to tell you is that a lot of them are just like this one, and I think the data bears that out. And the question before you is, under a categorical approach, is it fair to presume that they're all felonies? Is it fair to presume that what Congress recognized here is that there would be a correspondence between a conviction under this statute and the Federal aggravated felony of illicit trafficking in drugs, to strip the Attorney General of the United States of any opportunity whatsoever to consider the circumstances of the case? We think that is not the best reading of the statute.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I told you I was going to acknowledge the strengths of the other side's case. And I want to just recognize that you can conceivably read the statute their way. But the question is, if you actually adopt their statutory construction argument and you say we're going to look at the elements and it's an aggravated felony, we're comparing two different ways of reading it. And they admit that their way of reading the statute comes up with an answer that Congress couldn't possibly have intended by treating all these misdemeanants as aggravated felons. Now, their solution is to add a whole 'nother proceeding that isn't in the statute. Another solution is just to recognize their reading is wrong. If it produces this ridiculous result that Congress couldn't have intended, and our reading is perfectly sensible and not only do you have the solution of the removal proceedings, but also Justice Kennedy's suggestion of the Attorney General's ability to issue an order, Justice Sotomayor's solution of being able to look at the plea allocution, questions that aren't presented here, but lots of ways of addressing any adverse consequences of our rule. What in statutory construction allows us just to add this procedure that - -",
  "Okay. But I don't think that's actually what they're doing because Mr. Shah did not deny Justice Kagan's questions about, yeah, it would produce this ridiculous result, and so we're going to add this other proceeding. When they say -- what they do with punishable is they say look at only the elements of the Federal offense. And that's how they say that any Georgia conviction, even though, Justice Ginsburg, lots of these convictions will just be equivalents to Federal misdemeanors because they are the equivalent of - - because they involve possession with intent to distribute, those are the only elements of the offense, then they're all punishable as felonies, even if they would be a misdemeanor. So I don't think punishable helps them. And they don't seem to argue on the basis of punishable. So my base point to you is that why, in choosing between these two readings, we have strengths, they have strengths. Their argument starts from the proposition that theirs produces a result that Congress couldn't have intended. And, Mr. Chief Justice, they did start out with the hardcore position. I can give you the example. It's our case. Remember, even though this is 1.3 grams, even though he was not convicted of selling, they ordered him mandatorily deportable without an inquiry into the underlying facts. They recognize that can't be right. And so they are trying to tack something on to the statute that doesn't appear in the statute. The last point that I want to address is actually a very small one. And that's about Justice Thomas' dissent in the Lopez case on whether you should look to the State definition of whether this is a felony or instead, the Federal one, because the government cites it in a footnote in their brief. And we would only say that the government is not relying on the Lopez dissent. It invokes Lopez repeatedly in the Federal courts. And so this is a situation in which the Court's decision in Lopez should take hold as a matter of statutory -- stare decisis, and what matters here is the Federal treatment of it. When you don't know if the Georgia conviction is a felony or a misdemeanor under Federal law, you don't know which one it is, what the categorical rule says is that the State conviction doesn't necessarily establish it's a Federal offense, the Federal felony here, and therefore, you don't treat it that way. The -- the arguments that my friend ended with -- ended with about, hey, this is going to be applied in Federal sentencing and lots of other contexts, makes it worse, not better. How in the world are we going to have these others Castro-Rodriguez proceedings, these other intermediate proceedings about determining the facts of the offense in Federal sentencing? It gets vastly more complicated. Our rule addresses the core concern of Congress. It gets the right people deported. Their rule, because it's overinclusive, there will be noncitizens who can't prove their offense was a misdemeanor, and they shouldn't be removed. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, thank you very much, may it please the Court: You will want to have available to you the cert petition and the small volume of the Joint Appendix. In our submission, the Court needs to adopt a rule that has balance to it, and that is there -- it has to be possible to resolve one of these cases through a covenant not to sue of appropriate breadth, but it also has to be the case that a covenant not to sue can't just always eliminate the other side's injury. And so it's going to depend on the covenant and it's going to depend on what the other side says about its plans. And our point in this case is that you should adopt the following rule: And that is, if you have a covenant not to sue and it covers everything that the other side alleges an intent to produce, then there is no more injury. If it doesn't cover that, then there may well be injury. And our point --",
  "Absolutely. So one thing that's very important to recognize -- two things about trademark practice. First is that, in all of these cases -- remember, most of the time the question of trademark or patent validity will just be a suit for invalidity. It might be a counterclaim. This happens all the time. And in all of these cases, including this case, there is a protective order, and there is one in this case. And the protective order says that a party can designate its material, so that it's lawyers' eyes only, and so that no businessperson from the other side is entitled to see it. So that, Justice Kennedy, with respect, it's actually not true that this is an unusual situation or that we would get some special advantage. In every single patent or trademark invalidity case, after this Court's decision in MedImmune, the party alleging invalidity, in order to show its standing, has to say, we intend to make a product that is regarded as potentially infringing.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. The answer to your question is going to be yes, but it has two parts to it. The first is -- because I really want to focus on precisely what you said. You said first, what did they simply say? Now, if they were to simply say it, there could be a factual inquiry into whether they're telling the truth or not. We could debate -- we could have a fight about the actual evidence. But let's assume they could prove it, and that is, the district judge was told by Already, or whatever other competitor, we want to make a counterfeit. In that case, unquestionably -- unquestionably -- there would be a continuing Article III injury. And let's then go to your understanding of what the declaration in this case actually says. So, first, let me start with how the case came to you, and that is the court of appeals, what it understood the record -- and the district court understood the record to be, and that is going to be in the petition appendix at page --",
  "Yes.",
  "That's absolutely right. And we accept, for present purposes, that there is going to be a reduced requirement under the voluntary cessation doctrine. We briefed why we don't think that's true, but I assume, for the purposes of these answers, that the Court is going to apply the heightened burden on us to show that the case is over. And we believe that we showed beyond peradventure -- that we really resolved this case, when we didn't just dismiss our claim with prejudice, but we affirmatively granted them a covenant not to sue that covered not only their existing products. But, Justice Kennedy, their future products -- and I'm glad to take you to the language of the covenant -- because they are the colorable imitations of their current products.",
  "It does not. And if the other side had said, in the district court, we have an intention -- and this is Justice Sotomayor's point -- we have an intention, we have a desire to make a copy of your shoe, then there would be a case or controversy. And it's in -­",
  "Yes, because although the cert petition says that it doesn't, we have quite stridently pointed out, in our briefing, that that was completely inaccurate. And I'll just -- let's go to the covenant. I don't think this is really that hard or that controversial. So if we go to the Joint Appendix, at pages 96 to 97, and so -- and -- and I remind you that the -- the question presented is -- is exactly what you're saying, Justice Kennedy. I'll read it, so you don't have to turn back to the cert petition. And its premise was that the registrant promises not to assert its mark against the party's then existing commercial activities. So now, I'm in the covenant itself, on page 97A, and this is what we promised not to sue them about. We have -- we have promised not to sue them, and I'm five lines down from the top, on account of any possible action based on or involving trademark infringement, unfair competition or dilution, under state or Federal law, based on the appearance of Already's current -- okay, that's not future -- or previous footwear product designs and any colorable imitations. And that's what -- and that's what --",
  "Colorable.",
  "That's exactly right.",
  "That are not colorable imitations of --",
  "That's exactly right.",
  "Justice Kennedy, I -- I may have confused things. This is the situation with the covenant: Our covenant not to sue covers everything they have made in the past, everything they were making at the time and every future product of theirs that is a colorable imitation. Our point is not that it covers every future shoe of theirs. We're on the same page in that respect. You are absolutely right, Justice Kennedy, that there are shoes that they could make in the future that would not be covered by the covenant. There could be an injury about that. And so my point about the record in the case and how the case was developed and how we might have modified the covenant, if they had told us anything, suggesting -- suggested anything outside the covenant they might want to make, is let's look at what they actually told the district court and the court of appeals about what their intentions were.",
  "Yes. It is not a deficiency in the pleading. It's a deficiency in the proof. So my point about this -- it's very important for the Court to understand that this case was not dismissed just on the pleadings. It wasn't just an insufficiency in their allegation. And they said, well, actually, we have more that we want to say, because we actually can explain to the courts that we want to make other shoes. The case was decided on a fully developed record. We moved to dismiss. They submitted five declarations in response that described their intentions precisely.",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay. So I do -- I would love to return to what actually happened. But in that hypothetical, what would happen is that our motion to dismiss would be denied, unless and until we could prove that what they were saying wasn't true because it is absolutely the case -- and it is a strong point in our favor -- that you can't evade an attempt to invalidate your trademark through a covenant not to sue because you can't give a covenant not to sue over a counterfeit because you are in real risk of being deemed to have abandoned the mark because you're just --",
  "That's correct.",
  "Okay. It is not a settled question in the law. There is no case that has considered this question. What a party claiming abandonment would say is that we would have licensed Already then to increase its production and its distribution. But even if one didn't agree with that, Justice Ginsburg, my point would be this: And that is you can't continually evade an attempt to invalidate your mark because, certainly, the agree -- we would agree that if you give a second one of these things out or the third one, you would be abandoning the mark. I have some actual facts for you about this, and that --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Page 173 of the Joint Appendix. They had every opportunity to describe exactly what you wanted to know about, Justice Breyer. We moved to dismiss the case --",
  "Okay.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Sure.",
  "Sure.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, that would be fine.",
  "Yes. And, Justice Sotomayor --",
  "Well --",
  "They're going to win. They're going to win, Justice Sotomayor. And so for your vote, I am resting my entire case on the fact that you're understanding that this is what their affidavit suggests that's just not right.",
  "Yes. Yes. So page 173 -- because there is a record here. You -- you don't have to hypothesize. This was all on the table in the district court. We said, they have no intention, no desire, no nothing, to make something that is not unambiguously covered by the covenant. And Justice Ginsburg did point out, in passing, that if they said something to the contrary, we would have modified the covenant. So here's what they said -- and I -- it would take a lot of your time for me to read all seven paragraphs on page 173, but they don't --",
  "Okay. So these paragraphs do not say -- they do not suggest, they do not imply -- even between the lines -- an intention to make something that is outside the covenant. They just don't. And that's --",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay. Do you want --",
  "All right. Justice Breyer, so you've got a choice. You could let us win now, or you could say, well, maybe you will win on remand.",
  "Okay. Right.",
  "Right. And, Justice Breyer, I have two answers for you. Number one is going -- the first one is going to be about the facts of the case, and the second is just going to be jurisprudential. The first one is what more could one imagine in such an opinion that you would ask Nike to do on a remand?",
  "Justice Breyer --",
  "Well, I hope you'll get a good answer. The -- my point is this, Justice Breyer: what you've just said on remand, what we would do is ask a question. We wouldn't try to prove and anything. My point is this: Already has told the district court, the court of appeals, and this Court everything that it wants to say about its intentions. It has had every opportunity in every court to have its lawyers simply say, Justice Sotomayor, this is not an accident. The reason they are not saying that they want to make a covenant of the -- a copy of the Air Force 1 is that they don't want to make a copy of the Air Force 1. There is no reason in the world to send this back to give -- ask Already, again, the question that has been asked in three separate courts. I said I had a jurisprudential -- jurisprudential answer to you as well, and that is the case was presented to you as presenting a question of law, and that is, can you have a covenant not to sue that will end a case like this? And if you tell the lower courts, we don't know, you are doing, I think, not as much of a service to the development of the law as you could. It is a much more sound approach, we think, to say Already had the chance to build its record --",
  "It is still -- it has been around for at least 20 years. It is still not very common for the very important reason that trademark owners know that, if they hand these things out, they are at risk of having their mark invalidated; and second, they know that it doesn't avoid a -- a determination of the validity of the mark because a party like Already can always go to the Federal agency, the TTAB. So I said I have some actual facts. And the facts are these: Although Nike has a broad trademark portfolio, it has only, once in its history, issued a covenant not to sue. It is in this case.",
  "We -- Justice Kennedy, we do enforce our trademarks. You say we usually sue. I will tell you that we have filed six trade dress actions in the company's history. Now, you had said, because I think it's the other side's -- the impression the other side has given, that we are getting a special advantage over them. I think it's really important to recognize, for purposes of standing doctrine and mootness doctrine, that of all the shoe manufacturers in the country, the one that is least likely to be injured by this trademark -- there is only one. And it is Already because they are the only company in the entire world that has a promise that's substantial not to be sued under this trademark. We are the one -- they are the ones that are least likely to come into conflict with Nike. Now, they --",
  "Yes. Yes, that's right, but we did give them the covenant. That's my point. After the covenant -- we didn't merely withdraw the case. I have one other piece of fact.",
  "Yes, we're judicially estopped. It's not a contract. We are estopped, and they have -- the district court acted in reliance on it, construed it, and so we are bound by it. It's not a contract. I did have one other fact for you, because the other side has given you this impression that, once bitten, twice shy; that if you are sued once for a trademark -- they have a special fear that they're in the cross-hairs, that we're watching everything that they do. So when they made this argument --",
  "Yes. They are on the top ten list of infringers. But after that -- after that they, and they alone, got a covenant not to be sued, under the -- they are the -- they are in the specially protected position, not a specially disadvantaged position. I did, however -- when they made this argument in the reply brief -- tried to figure out if that is true. Is it actually the case that a person who is sued once has a legitimate worry that they will actually be sued again? So you should lower the -- the mootness or standing bar still further. So we looked at every single trademark action between 2000 -- January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2004, all of them. There were 593. And over the next eight years, we tried to figure out how many times did the plaintiff sue the defendant again. It happened six times, so --",
  "Yes.",
  "You could not -- you could not be more right.",
  "It's also the truth that -- that it is what happens in every single patent and trademark invalidity case. If you believe that gives rise to Article III injury, then every party has standing to challenge every competitor.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. I think the reason they did not pursue the Rule 41 argument in this Court and abandoned it is that it's completely understood that, if the party that's instituting the claim says I'm not going to pursue my case at all, there simply is no Article III jurisdiction. And so even without a Rule 41 dismissal, there is no case or controversy remaining in the case. The district court -- the court of appeals might also have said, when it's dealt with this issue on 8(a) and 9(a) of the petition appendix, that they actually acceded to the dismissal of our claims. They're happy to have our claims gone. And you can't say, we'll take the dismissal of the -- sorry -- the plaintiff's claim, but want to have the counterclaim remaining.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, I understand --",
  "The Chief Justice suggested an argument that could be made. It is an argument that we disagree with. We've looked at the cases. We think that it's a point in their favor, Justice Kennedy, that, while you can go to the TTAB, they wouldn't be able to appeal to an Article III court. I think that's a point in their favor. A point in our favor, however, is this notion of scarecrow trademarks hanging out there on the fields is inaccurate because of the ability to go to the TTAB in the first instance; they're experts. And second, remember what I said to Justice Sotomayor, anybody in this market can say we want to counterfeit the Air Force 1 -- we just want to make a copy of it, it's not complicated -- and they will have the right to bring a claim to invalidate the mark. So we can't leave the trademark hanging out there. I have kept trying to come back -- and if I could, in my remaining time, to the understanding of the lower courts about the record because I said, Justice Breyer, I think it would be much better for you to resolve the case because they had the opportunity to build a record, the case came to you on two courts' understanding of the record, and so if I could take you back to 14(a) and 15(a) of the petition appendix?",
  "That's not correct, Justice Ginsburg. So on -- we do disagree because of the Court's decision in Deakins, that this a voluntary cessation case, but we accept for present purposes, so you don't think I'm fighting the hypothetical. Assuming that voluntary cessation principles apply, here's how they apply: When you not just dismiss the case, but you grant the covenant not to sue, and the covenant not to sue says, I won't sue you over what you're doing now or anything that I can imagine you doing in the future because you haven't told me anything else, then you have ensured that the controversy can't arise again, and you've met the Voluntary Cessation Doctrine. If, on the other hand, the other side comes forward with a declaration from an officer or some other form of proof that says, no, I'm worried I might do something outside the covenant, I would definitely want to make a counterfeit, then the case is going to go on. But this case is not that hypothetical case. On 14(a), the first full paragraph, seven lines from the bottom, \"Given the similarity of YUMS' designs to the '905 mark and the breadth of the covenant, it is hard to imagine a scenario that would potentially infringe the '905 mark and yet not fall under the covenant. YUMS has not asserted any intention to market any such shoe.\" And then in footnote 5, on 15(a), \"Given the absence of record evidence that YUMS intends to make any arguably infringing shoe that is not unambiguously covered by the covenant, this hypothetical possibility does not create a definite and concrete dispute.\" That's how the case should be resolved. You should say, yes, there can be other cases where the covenant is too narrow; yes, there can be other cases where someone does allege a desire to make a counterfeit. Those are different cases. But do not, I suggest to you, remand when the facts have already been developed in this case. If we lose on this record, we lose on this record. But if we win on this record, we win on it because the record has been built in this case and it is settled.",
  "Yes.",
  "Our burden was met by our submission of the covenant, which dealt with every product they're making and every colorable imitation in the future of it. And when they didn't then come back and say, actually, we want to make something that might be outside the covenant, then it was -- that's -- that's when we won the case. Thank you very much.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, thank you very much. May it please the Court: This case can get complicated, quickly, because the word \"jurisdiction\" means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, in a lot of different contexts, and the parties have advanced both broad and narrow theories for resolving the case. So the thing I can do, most helpfully, at the beginning, I think, is to frame where I believe the real dispute in the case lies. The FCC claims the authority to interpret Section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act with the force of law. And my argument today is limited to the question -- that threshold jurisdictional question, which we call interpretive jurisdiction, Iowa Utilities called it underlying jurisdiction, law professors like to call it Chevron Step Zero, but that's what I'm focused on. And the Fifth Circuit said that, on that question, the FCC gets Chevron deference. And that is it gets to decide whether it has the authority to interpret the --",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, the question on which you granted certiorari was how to decide that question, not what is the answer to that question. What the Fifth Circuit did, acknowledging a circuit conflict, was decided that the FCC's assertion that you are right is, itself, entitled to Chevron deference.",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay. I --",
  "Justice Breyer, I do want to talk about it. I do hope --",
  "I appreciate it. But I'd like to talk about the things you want to hear me talk about. I am very conscious of the fact, let me say, that the Court limited this grant of certiorari to the first question presented, which was the abstract Chevron question, and so I just don't want to jump the gun --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, you -- you and Justice Breyer have both asked me to turn to that question, so I'm going to do it. The only point I'm making is that all of these questions assume that we are right on the question presented, which I think we obviously are. So I'm happy to move on, but I just did not want to hurry past the legal question on which you granted certiorari.",
  "Okay.",
  "I mean -- what I mean by it --",
  "Yes.",
  "That would. That would be --",
  "That is a different kind of jurisdictional question. It is a jurisdictional question. Justice Scalia, so maybe I can help you, just on the question of what I'm talking about and whether I can draw -- whether I can draw my line or whether it's just malleable and every court's going to get drawn into it, which I suspect you may be concerned about. Okay? The kind of jurisdiction I'm talking about is what you called, in your Iowa Utilities opinion for the Court, \"underlying jurisdiction.\" And, in Iowa Utilities, in the discussion of the FCC's underlying jurisdiction, you undertook the judicial task of looking at the words of the statute and figuring out that Congress did intend, along the lines of the theory that Justice Ginsburg just articulated, that the FCC did have the power to implement those provisions of the '96 Act. And in -- as we have rehearsed, to be honest, every one of your Chevron opinions deals with this question: Just did the agency have the power to interpret this statutory provision with the force of law? You and the -- all of your colleagues on the Court have always decided that question de novo.",
  "I do.",
  "I do.",
  "Okay. Justice Scalia, the place where -- I do limit myself to the entry point and the place where you and I are going to disagree is whether the entry point is just the generic question, does the FCC administer the whole Act or the somewhat more narrow question, does the FCC administer this statutory provision?",
  "Yes. Okay. The answer to your question is yes, and the best example is this statute. It is uncontested and incontestable that the -- the FCC does not administer all of the Communications Act. This Court so held, squarely, in the Louisiana Public Service Commission case, in which, there, Congress added to the Communications Act Sections 251 and 252. And there was a provision in that statute that said -- that limited the scope of the FCC's power, as we say Section 332(c)(7) does. We will have to go through that and debate that. But the Communications Act is plainly -- and there are other provisions as well. But the best example is the Louisiana PSC case. And so --",
  "That is correct. I would only cabinet it in the following way: And there's -- the question on which you granted certiorari is does the FCC get Chevron deference in its assertion that it gets to interpret 332(c)(7) with the force of law. I think --",
  "Yes.",
  "It's that --",
  "It would be a very easy jurisdictional question. We rely on two provisions of 332(c)(7) to establish the proposition that Congress did not intend the general rule-making authority in Section 201(b) of the Communications Act to extend to 332(c)(7). And those are --",
  "Justice Scalia --",
  "We disagree. And I understand that you have a vision of how Chevron deference operates. We disagree with it in this respect, respectfully, and that is we believe that every one of this Court's Chevron precedents has started -- sometimes, only in a sentence, because, often, it's very simple -- often, it's uncontestable -- that it's a provision of the Communications Act that does fall within, for example, the FCC's 201(b) authority. But it is always as -- you have always approached that question as judges. First, we decide does the FCC have the power to implement this statute?",
  "Justice Kagan, I disagree. I honestly disagree. I'm going to give you three cases that I think show that I am right and that your articulation of your -- that approach is not correct. And I encourage you to ask the Solicitor General what his best case is. It may be he thinks American Hospital, which I'll talk about. Here are my three cases: Louisiana Public Service Commission, provision by provision, the Court looked de novo at the question of whether Sections 251 and 252 of the Communications Act were subject to the general rule-making power. It said no. Adams Fruit, another case where the Secretary of Labor had general rule-making authority over the agricultural worker protection statute. And the Court looked specifically at the private right of action and said, your authority doesn't extend here. And the last one is Meade, where the Customs Service has the general authority to administer that statute. And, instead, the Court looked at the specific provision involved, and it said, do you have lawmaking authority with the respect to these interpretive rulings? And so it has always done some --",
  "It did not. I have not --",
  "Justice Scalia, I will tell you this: I am not overclaiming the cases. I am describing what happened in them, particularly on the axis of whether the Court went provision by provision.",
  "Justice Scalia, let me tell you why --",
  "Justice Scalia, here's why I disagree: I picked three cases for a very specific reason, in that each of those three cases rejected the assertion of jurisdiction. And so that, if Chevron were applying, the Court would have had to find that the statute was unambiguous. And it didn't do that in any of those cases.",
  "Yes, absolutely.",
  "Absolutely, Justice --",
  "I did. I agreed with Justice Kennedy vociferously. That was -- that was the end of my answer.",
  "Okay. I have two -- I have three answers. They will be brief. Louisiana Public Service Commission and Adams Fruit are as I described them. The reason that Meade is helpful to me is on a different axis than you've described. And that is that the agency there had a general -- generally applicable authority in which it could have urged that its authority to issue those rule-makings, that it was entitled to deference on its view of its power to issue rulings with the force of law. But the third thing that I want to say is let me just take --",
  "Skidmore.",
  "Because, Justice Scalia, Skidmore deference is, as you know, of course -- and you have been a very -- a very powerful critic of it, obviously, in your opinions -- that it is the -- you give the agency the respect of the persuasiveness of its opinion. And I took -- or I -- the part of the comment that I was agreeing with Justice Kennedy was -- is, as Justice Ginsburg has suggested, the FCC understands the Communications Act.",
  "Yes.",
  "And that -- that --",
  "We -- the Court has -- I am quoting the Court.",
  "It more than makes sense, Justice Scalia. I think that there -- there is a common-sense element to this, and that is that the FCC, we recognize that it has its expertise. The question is do we have to -- when the statute is ambiguous, as it will often be, do we have to accept, as a matter of law, their view that they do have jurisdiction? I do want to --",
  "Yes. Okay.",
  "All right. You and Justice Breyer have encouraged me to get to the merits question, so let me turn the corner, if I might, to how we think a court would look at this question de novo. We have two points. One is the statutory provision, and this is going to be at pages 1 and 2 of the cert petition, if you have that copy in front of you. The statute -- and so, Justice Ginsburg, I am going to answer your question, but I want to make a couple of quick points about our offensive argument about why it is Congress didn't intend the FCC to implement the statute with the force of law. It begins with preservation of local zoning authority. Subsection (a) says, \"Except as provided in this paragraph, nothing in this Act\" -- which includes Section 201(b) -- \"shall limit or affect the authority of a State or local government with respect to this subject matter.\" Then, in Subsection (b)(5) -- Justice Ginsburg, you said the essence of the statute is (b). In subsection (b)(5), Congress located the enforcement power of this statute in the courts. \"Any\" -- and this is it at the bottom of 2, \"Any person adversely affected by any final action or failure to act by a State or local government or any instrumentality thereof\" --",
  "I -- I could read the whole thing, Justice Ginsburg. My point is going to be that that \"reasonable period of time\" phrase is enforced through the courts. Now, Congress - -",
  "Yes.",
  "I -- I will, now, turn to that question. It makes enormous sense, and it was explained by the conferees in the conference report at page 209 of the petition appendix. And what happened here is that -- that the House version of the bill instructed the FCC to conduct a rule-making and the rule-making would set standards for establishing a reasonable period of time. The Senate came along, which had no such provision and said, no, we are going to have a provision that, instead, says that nothing else in the Act will apply to this question; that you will go to the courts, rather than to have a rule-making, the rule-making must be canceled, and then explained its intent. And so if I could just read that to you, very quickly --",
  "Yes.",
  "Justice Scalia, I -- my point is that it is a point in our favor, particularly when you compare -- (b)(5) has two parts, in addition to the statutory history, which was -- told the FCC to cancel the rule-making on this point. Subsection (b)(5) says, you go -- on the reasonable period of time provision, you go to the courts; and, on questions related to radio frequency emissions, which is also covered by (c)(7)(A), you go to the FCC. And what the conferees explained, quite clearly, Justice Ginsburg, is that you can have two different visions of what reasonable period of time is. And that is a general -- this is -- the first one is what the FCC you would expect to implement, and that is a reasonable period of time is a general national standard, a kind of baseline. What they said is a presumption of 90 or 150 days. And that's what we think, generally, the FCC will decide how long it takes to act on a wireless application. Or you could think about reasonable period of time as within the locality, and that is, is the locality following its ordinary standards for resolving siting applications and not discriminating against wireless applications. And that -- the latter is what Congress intended. And it makes every sense in the world, in the context of this statute, that Congress wanted that because, first, it has always been the case that State and local -- that wireless siting and all siting decisions are decided by localities, not by the Federal government --",
  "That, Justice Ginsburg -- just to put this in context, the government says that the FCC was concerned that the wireless companies wouldn't know when to go to court. They cite no case in which that was ever an issue, neither the wireless companies, nor them. And --",
  "Because it's a continuing violation.",
  "Yes.",
  "It does, Justice Kennedy.",
  "Okay. Two things, Justice Kennedy. First is I will tell you that Congress consciously used phrases, \"reasonable period of time\" and \"substantial evidence contained in a written record\" -- those are the subdivisions of subparagraph (b), which Justice Ginsburg was pointing to, because those are judicially administered standards. And I will just read you one sentence from the conference report. \"The phrase 'substantial evidence contained in a written record' is the actions,\" the agency here being the locality. And, Justice Kennedy, on your question and --",
  "Yes.",
  "That was at 210, Justice Kennedy. There is a similar passage relating to \"reasonable period of time.\" It's quite clear. I believe -- the conference report is four or five pages long. When you have the opportunity to read it again, I think you will see that Congress was adopting local standards, local -- a local approach to deciding this question, against a broader framework. Can I just answer Justice Kennedy's --",
  "Sure.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "The lower courts decide de novo whether the agency was given the power to interpret a particular provision with the force of law. That's the entry point question -- the threshold question. All of this works --",
  "It did not --",
  "Here's where it went wrong -- here's where it went wrong: It looked at the statute. It found the relationship between 332(c)(7) and 201(b) ambiguous. And, when it found ambiguity, then it said it was compelled to accept the FCC's reading. It did not resolve that ambiguity itself, as it would in any other case involving statutory construction. Before I sit down, Justice Kennedy and Justice Ginsburg have raised the point that the government did, that when does someone know when to go to court? AND the only part of my answer I got in was that there are no cases identifying that as a problem, and the reason is that it's a continuing violation. No communications provider, so far as we are aware, was ever thrown out of court for coming in too late, for a failure to act, because every day the State and locality didn't act is regarded as an alleged violation, and it doesn't take away from jurisdiction to go to court. There are no cases that support their concern. If I could reserve the remainder of my time?",
  "I -- I've heard, and I regret that I have contributed to such a horror. This is silliness.",
  "The Court has -- we have cited to you 17 cases of yours in which you have always looked at the entry point question de novo, and on the -- the idea that we're making this more complicated makes no sense to me because what the government wants -- and you see this in the Fifth Circuit's decision -- is a surround of Chevron on whether they have authority. Go through that entire process, and then go through it again, assuming that you do believe they have that authority. There's not a step that we're adding to the inquiry.",
  "No, it is not. This Court has said, time and again, including in Meade, that the precondition to the application of Meade is a determination that Congress delegated authority to the agency to interpret the statute with the force of law. And that has to be asked in every single case, and that is a distinct inquiry. Once you decide that they have that delegated authority over that provision, then, as -- as this Court has done in every case --",
  "We are at loggerheads, Justice Kagan. I believe that Louisiana Public Service Commission and Adams Fruit are just simply contrary to that. It also doesn't make any sense to believe that Congress gave the agency this 201(b) authority and then implicitly gave the agency the authority to decide how far 201(b) extends. This is just a question-begging exercise. They say we have this general authority. I ask, does that general authority apply to this particular provision in the Act? And they say, well, our general authority gives us the power to answer even that question, and that is not correct.",
  "It is because I am only asking the threshold question, did Congress give the agency the power to interpret this statutory provision with a question of law? And that is a different -- I'll give you an illustration, and that is there is an extended discussion of this question in the FCC's order. It had no difficulty identifying that as a separate inquiry. I did want to just turn to the merits -- let me just say that the Solicitor General's argument about whether the 201(b) authority extends to 332(c)(7) is a great illustration of our argument on the question presented because that's a lawyer's argument. There was not a word that my friend said about there was a technical question of communications law and how wireless siting facilities operate. That's the kind of question that Congress gives to agencies. It is not the threshold lawyer's issue, does this statute read this far? I would only encourage you, on the merits question, which is not included in the question presented, which you didn't grant certiorari on, that is, the application of de novo review to this statute, to pay more attention than, I think, this argument has given it because it wasn't the core issue briefed in the case, obviously, to what Congress did in this statute. There was a version of the statute that gave the FCC the very authority that it is claiming here. That was the House version of the bill that was rejected in Congress, in conference, Congress adopted this version, ordered the FCC to cancel the rule-making and reserve this power to the courts, the -- the authority to decide what is a reasonable period of time. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would ask you to write an opinion affirming and that adopts the following rule ­­ and that is that a false promise to purchase securities for one's self in which no other person will have an interest is not a material misrepresentation in connection with the purchase or sale of covered securities. The other side has asked you to adopt a rule that has never been advocated by the SEC in any other proceeding; it's never been advocated, as I understand it, in its briefs in this case; it's never been adopted by any Court ever. And I think there are good reasons for that. Their theory is that what happened here is that there was a promise to buy covered securities that would be for the benefit of someone else. That has two textual flaws, it doesn't comport with the purpose of the statute, and it would have extraordinary consequences. It doesn't ­­ it doesn't conform to the text of the statute in either of two ways. Covered security, which is what the Plaintiffs here purchased, is a defined term. It is a security, but only the subset of securities that are traded on a national exchange and some of the other additions that would involve, for example, mutual funds. And so Congress didn't say that it was in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security, if it was a covered security that someone else would get the benefit of. It is ­­ what has to be bought here is a stock, and instead, what was bought here was a CD. As Mr. Clement says, this is a case of a massive fraud. He could well have said, this is a case of a massive securities fraud, but it was not a case of a covered securities fraud. The Plaintiffs here bought something that Congress specifically excluded from preclusion under SLUSA. The second textual flaw in their position is that ­­",
  "Okay. So ­­",
  "The jumping off point is that there ­­ is the defined term \"covered security.\"",
  "So SLUSA only applies if there was a material misrepresentation in the ­­ in the purchase or sale of a covered security.",
  "Because Congress asked you ­­ or told the courts to focus on the question of what the product is, that there was a misrepresentation in the course of the transaction, in the course of the purchase or sale, and that is only a covered security. It is not some other product that has, as a benefit, an interest in a covered security.",
  "That's actually, I think, Your Honor, a really good point for us because the other side's argument, up till the brief ­­ excuse me ­­ up until the oral argument, is that it was a misrepresentation about covered securities that would trigger SLUSA. The problem with their position is that what the Court has always said, when it talked about the definition of \"in connection with,\" is really two things. It has to be flexible. We have to give the SEC the ability to deal with novel frauds. But because, metaphysically, everything is connected with everything else, we're going to have to draw a line. There's going to have to be some limit. And you've pointed out that it's not an easily administered one, but the ­­ the bulwark, the one thing that stops 10b­5 from getting completely out of control, is that all of the frauds involved are ones that the Court has recognized would have an effect on the regulated market. That was true in O'Hagan; it was true in Zandford. Now, I realize that my friend from the Solicitor General's Office said today, at the podium, that they can imagine that this fraud would have an effect on the regulated market. They did say the opposite in their briefing in the case. Their brief at the cert stage said there was no possibility that there would be an effect on the regulated market. And so this, I ­­ I imagine ­­",
  "Yes, sir. The ­­ it is ­­ I will get it during the ­­ it's quoted multiple times in our brief, but my colleagues will get it, if you don't mind, and ­­",
  "It's in the cert pages, at about page 12, I think, but we'll ­­ I will have it for you in just a moment, please. And they said there is no ­­ the ­­ to quote it almost verbatim, there was no prospect that this fraud would have an effect on the covered securities market. The second textual flaw ­­",
  "No, I do not.",
  "Well, it ­­ it is a ­­ as I understood, they're ­­ they seem to recognize, and if you were to read, for example, their brief in Zandford, they say that the sine qua non of their ability to determine as the enforcement authority here, that something has a ­­ is in connection with the purchase or sale of the regulated security is whether it would have an effect on the regulated market. They wrote a brief to you saying that and ­­",
  "I think that that is their best hope, and I don't think they can satisfy it. We think their authority is narrower still.",
  "That is securities fraud, in our view, according to the SEC's administrative position. No court has ever said that ­­ so that's Justice Scalia's point from the first half­hour. We can ­­ if that is correct, if the SEC is correct about that, we still prevail because what's happening is the broker is saying, I will purchase for you the covered securities. That's what the Line case stands for. Their brief in ­­",
  "Okay. So the ­­ the critical difference, I think, is in the definition of \"purchase.\" And that was going to be the second textual flaw that I was going to point out. And that is we can acknowledge that they would have a much stronger case in the hypothetical that you've described if the covered securities are pledged to back the CDs. This happens, for example, on a margin account. It happens if ­­ there are lots of times someone will say, I intend to use your money to buy covered securities, to buy stocks, and I am providing those stocks as security for the loan. The reason that's securities fraud is the definition of a purchase includes pledging the ­­ pledging the stocks. That's really important. And it tracks with the Court's holding that \"in connection with\" reaches as far as frauds that would have an effect on the regulated market. Imagine if I were allowed to say, look, I am going to buy covered securities, and you now hold an interest in them ­­ an enforceable interest in the stocks. And if that were not securities fraud, the market couldn't function very well because things like margin accounts, you could never have the confidence that you would have the protection of 10b­5. The critical difference, Justice Kennedy, is between two different cases. If ­­ this case, which is SIB, says, look ­­ among all of its many misrepresentations ­­ I will take your money, and I intend to buy covered securities. That gets the ­­ you know, putting all aside the difficulty of liquid assets versus covered securities, give them their best version of the representation here. But it was only buying it for itself. It did not pledge to sell the assets. It did not give the plaintiffs any interest in them. For example, the interest rate on the CDs was completely independent of the return on those covered securities.",
  "We ­­ we do defend that rule. We do not think it's the best ground to decide the case, and I will explain what I mean by that. The Fifth Circuit undertook to articulate a rule that would govern all cases in which someone purchased something that was supposedly invested in covered securities; so including, for example, the Madoff cases, where there was securities fraud. Madoff falsely sold interest in a fund. That's core securities fraud. SIB never sold any securities at all. It only sold CDs. So if the Court believed that the Fifth Circuit was correct, that it was appropriate to decide all of these derivative investments ­­ if I could, cases ­­ then we think you need a flexible term like \"more than tangentially related.\" But we think this case stands on its own, on the question of, look, if I promise ­­ if I sell you something, and I say I am going to take the money and buy CDs for myself, and those CDs have the quality of being liquid ­­ now, you don't have an interest in the CDs, I am not pledging them to you, so there is no purchase by you of a covered security ­­ then that is not a securities fraud. And I did want ­­ want to get ­­",
  "Okay. Two things about that, Justice Sotomayor. I will say that if ­­ what I think you were actually told from the podium is that it is unclear from the SEC's administrative opinion whether the persons who gave the money to the broker as an investment were actually given an interest in the securities. It's just not clear from that opinion. There is certainly no SEC holding. Second ­­",
  "Okay. Then the second thing I would say is the SEC has always been very clear to you that the key part of your hypothetical is that it's a broker. And the SEC has said to you repeatedly, and I will just give this to you from their Zandford brief at page 23. \"There is a particularly strong connection between fraud and securities transactions when stockbrokers, like Respondent, misappropriate securities and securities proceeds from brokerage accounts.\" The key feature is that you can understand why it is that the market can't function if your stockbroker is making promises about buying and selling securities. This is a bank. This is a bank that doesn't issue covered securities in any way because it's a foreign bank. It issues only the non­covered securities that Congress specifically excluded from ­­",
  "Yes. That's market manipulation.",
  "Yes.",
  "Sure.",
  "Because the first completely messes up the stock market and the second one has nothing to do with it. The first ­­",
  "Absolutely, because that's the sine qua non ­­",
  "That's right.",
  "And it's not ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay. I ­­ I will play it out. That was not my intention. The Madoff cases involved the following scenario, and there are diverse ones, and so I caution the course ­­ the Court about trying to lay down a rule that will govern all those. So Madoff engages in securities fraud. We ­­ in covered securities fraud. He says, I have this fund; it is invested in stocks. That turns out to be completely untrue. So we know that Madoff engaged in securities fraud. The Madoff cases are about the next generation, the indirect purchasers, and that is people who bought into a fund, and the fund bought into Madoff. Now, those cases have been resolved on two separate grounds that may not be entirely consistent, neither one of which has any implications for our case. Theory number one, and this is by ­­ in an opinion by Judge Rakoff, just a few weeks ago for the Second Circuit. He says, look, the indirect purchaser cases are covered by SLUSA because I look at SLUSA, and it says, look at the allegation. And the core allegation in those cases is of covered securities fraud. It is that I was deceived, I lost my money, I should say ­­ because Madoff engaged in securities fraud. He was selling air. He wasn't selling anything at all. That's not this case. SIB sold only non­covered securities. The second way they have been resolved is that you may be said to have ­­ when you bought into what are called the \"feeder funds,\" that ­­ that in turn invested in Madoff, you may well have purchased an interest in the Madoff fund itself. And, therefore, you were engaged effectively in the purchase or sale of covered securities. That is clearly on the other side of the line from this case. Nobody contends that we bought anything other than noncovered assets. Now, I have tried to get to the ­­ to the hypotheticals that the Court put to the ­­ my friends in the first half­hour. And realize that these ­­",
  "Yeah.",
  "Correct.",
  "No, sir. They have not even made that argument. They say that it's enough to trigger SLUSA, that SIB bought something that was said, in some sense ­­ and I have no idea what the rule is, to be for our benefit or to back our CDs, but the only ­­ it is categorically the case that the only purchase or sale by the Plaintiffs ­­",
  "Yes, yes, sir. Now, this is, of course, a significant step further than the line that already concerned some members of the Court, Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas and the late Chief Justice dissented in O'Hagan, and this is a very significant move further than even that case because the emphasis of the SEC in O'Hagan was that that kind of fraud would have a tremendous effect on the market if ­­ if people didn't ­­ couldn't be confident that the other ­­ the person on the other side of the trade had material nonpublic information. Now, returning to the hypotheticals that the Court put to my friends in the first half­hour, realize they're not hypotheticals. They are exactly why the SEC is in the case. The SEC doesn't administer SLUSA. It is concerned that a narrower reading of \"in connection with\" will affect its ability to administer the securities laws. But you put to the SEC the question, okay, name a case that you've brought in the past 80 years that you could not bring if the Plaintiffs prevail here. Name a case that you, hypothetically, want to bring.",
  "If he does, it'll be the first time. They filed three merits briefs, three reply briefs, the SEC filed a cert stage amicus brief. It filed a merits amicus brief. It has argued orally in front of you. And so far, we haven't found a case. Now, can you ­­ can I tell you that I can imagine a case that, because of my rule, the SEC can't bring? I can and I think that they shouldn't be allowed to bring it. I'm not saying that our rule has no effect on them. I'm saying it does. But it's the lending cases, it's the prenuptial cases, it's those things that hang over the economy like a loaded gun.",
  "My point ­­ my point, Justice Ginsburg, I apologize, is not that those are affected by ­­ that those ­­ that rule affects SLUSA. It affects the SEC's ability to bring a felony prosecution, despite the rule of lenity on the basis that that's securities fraud. Really understanding the consequence of this case, I'll admit to you, that the effect on SLUSA ­­ this is kind of a one­off case. They haven't identified any other cases like this under SLUSA, so they're adopting a very broad reading of \"in connection\" to kind of kill a gnat. But the reason that they ­­ the SEC wants to do it is because it wants an extremely broad reading of \"in connection with the purchase or sale.\" They want to be able to bring a case in which someone is alleged to have purchased a non­security, a house, issued a loan, on the basis of some statement about the liquidity of the fraudster. And that is never a case that's ever been brought before. And so it's true that we would prevent them from doing that, but that's a good thing, not a bad thing. They've had 80 years to say that they need that authority, and they never have. If there is going to be a way in which we lose this case, notwithstanding the foregoing, I think it's going to be Justice Alito's concern, can you articulate a narrower rule in favor of the Petitioners that says it was the feature that they were covered securities that was essential to the fraud. I think we can say, first, that is not in the text of the statute, right? That those words don't appear.",
  "Well, I do think that this was not in connection with the purchase or sale. It certainly wasn't material to any purchase or sale. But the other thing, Justice Alito, is this notion that ­­ that the feature of them being stocks was essential to the fraud would be true in, for example, a loan. If I say to you, I want to get a loan for $100,000, I promise to buy for myself stocks that I could sell to repay the loan, the only thing that was critical about them is that they were liquid. And remember, that's actually all that SIB said, is that it had liquid assets. That's the only feature of it. And so if we're going to focus on that ­­",
  "We are not. I will say, however, that the other side has a serious problem of administrability of an opinion in its favor in the following way: Justice Ginsburg, the $7 billion in assets that SIB claimed to own clearly included some stocks on the NYSE. I think that's perfectly fair. The question is how many? Nobody knows the answer to that. And if you are going to rule for them, the lower courts are going to face cases where a bank says, we have liquid assets as well.",
  "Yes.",
  "It is not essential to our position. If you agree ­­ if you agree with the SEC that there doesn't have to be a purchase or a sale, we still easily win the case. No court has ­­ I believe that's only been resolved administratively. And so you would have to decide that, in their favor, in order to win the case. In order ­­ we are not giving up on the question.",
  "No.",
  "That is not the ground on which we have pressed the case in front of you. I'm not trying to make it more complicated. I'm ­­ it is illustrative of all the rules that they need you to adopt that no court has ever adopted. Remember, on Page 21 of their brief, which is what you're being pointed to as their best cases, they point to three administrative proceedings, no court decision of a district court, court of appeals, or this Court, and it's only on the failure to purchase point. They have no cases in which the ­­ the core features of this case are present, and that is you have a fraud that would not have an effect they had previously said on the regulated market whatsoever. And it's merely the fact that it's for the benefit of someone else. There ­­ no court has ever adopted it. And ­­ and in picking up what this Court said was so important in Zandford and O'Hagan is that it has not been the SEC's position in the past. I know they have said it when they stood up today, but there, the SEC assured you, for decades, we have taken this position, it's been essential to our enforcement priorities, under Section 10b, this case is completely different.",
  "No, sir. My point is not that when the SEC says it it becomes true. We certainly don't agree with that. My point is that they haven't articulated ­­ before, they said the opposite, and today, they haven't articulated anything that is more than the kind of metaphysical go from here to here to here. And it asks too much when we start from a statute that carved these CDs out. Congress said, we have this idea of a security, we have this idea from the National Securities Markets Improvements Act that the States regulate noncovered securities, and so we are going to say that the preclusive effect of SLUSA does not reach these things like the CDs that we leave to regulation by the State. So this case clearly falls very easily within the ­­ the text of SLUSA as being not precluded. Then you ask, well, am I going to stretch the language of the statute to say, well, even though these are noncovered CDs, because securities were involved, I think SLUSA should still apply. In asking whether you should stretch the language, you would say, well, what's the point of the phrase \"in connection with\"? Why did Congress give it that kind of capacious reading, but didn't say fraud about securities or fraud involving securities? It did say \"in connection with.\" And what your precedents have said over and over and over and what has been the dividing line that has prevented 10b­5 from swallowing all fraud is that these are misrepresentations that affect the regulated market negatively. These ­­ this fraud did not do that. If there are no further questions.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: You are being asked by the other side to write an opinion about personal jurisdiction that is going to try and slice the salami very, very, very thin, that is going to create a huge amount of confusion about these facts versus the facts in Calder and that is going to be very, very difficult to reconcile with the internet cases and the cases that the lower courts are constantly confronting, about where a person in State A intentionally injures a person in State B. And that person frequently doesn't shoot a gun into the other State. They sit at their computer, and they steal money under the bank account. They take the person's ID. They use their credit cards and the like. I think, in truth, the way the case is most likely to be resolved ­­",
  "Justice Scalia, we disagree, and so let me focus on your point and Justice Kennedy's question about which claim it is. The claim here ­­ the complaint states two complaints, Judge Berzon recognized. One is about the seizure. It's exactly what you are describing. The other is about the false affidavit. And those really are different as a matter of law. I have a couple of citations to give you to explain how this legal process works. What happens is the DEA seizes the money at the Atlanta Hartsfield Airport. He takes the cash and turns it in to a locker. Then what happens is that we have to state a claim to the money. And when we state a claim to the money, they either have to do one of two things: They have to give it back to us as a matter of law, or they have to start a forfeiture process as a matter of law. And if you start the forfeiture process, you have to provide to the assistant U.S. attorney a factual basis for the forfeiture. And the way to look at this, I think, is the way that Justice Kagan's hypothetical asked, and that is imagine that there were two officers here, not one. Officer A ­­ we'll call him Walden ­­ is at the Atlanta Hartsfield Airport, and he seizes our money. And just assume that that's perfectly lawful. We then state a claim to the money, and then we provide factual information about why it is that the money is not subject to seizure. They have to return it to us at that point, or they have to start the forfeiture process. And when that second officer creates a false affidavit to start the forfeiture process, we are not in Georgia. We have no ongoing contacts with Georgia. And we are losing access to the money only in Nevada. That's the only place we're in ­­",
  "No, sir. The lower courts have tackled this question because people go visit their mother­in­law. They do travel around. It's a mobile society, and they have taken, from your opinion in Calder and Jones, the focus on where it is that the plaintiff lives and works. And there is a good reason for that. Personal jurisdiction is trying to tackle the question of where does the defendant reasonably believe that he will be haled into court. It's a fairness principle. And that is, we need to have a predictable rule that allows the would­be defendants to know, okay, if I do this ­­",
  "That is ­­",
  "No, sir. The ­­ and let me just start with the premise of this case, all right? My friend said that this officer was shown the California ­­ California driver's license. That's not correct. He wasn't shown a California driver's license. The officer in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was shown one. They only ­­ their principal residence, the complaint alleges, I think, in paragraph 2, is in Nevada. We do have situations ­­ and that's where they lived and worked. We have situations ­­",
  "That is true, at one point, and they had moved. I'm going to step outside the record, just so I can accurately answer your question. But it will give you a sense of how these cases actually operate. Most often, you have the situation where they're college students ­­ you know, you have a college student who lives at home with their parents, but they go off to college, and they may be injured where it is that they live and go to school in that case. And what the lower courts do is, sensibly, they say, if you know where the person's principal residence is ­­ and this case is simplified by the fact that the district court understood and assumed that the defendant knew that they lived in Nevada. It's never been contested in the case. And Judge Berzon said, quite correctly, what you have to do is you have to make it a prima facie case because there's no evidence in this case that the ­­ that the principal residence was Nevada and that the defendant knew that.",
  "No, sir. I'm sorry ­­",
  "Okay. Then I've ­­ I've misled you, and let me state our test, which I haven't done yet, and that may help you. Our rule is as follows: When the defendant intentionally targets the plaintiff for injury in State A, where the injury arises ­­ and that's going to be the big difference. Does the injury arise there? Justice Scalia, your impression in your earlier question was that this injury didn't arise in Nevada. But our test requires that it arise in Nevada, and the defendant knows that it's going to arise in Nevada. I'll contrast our ­­ our false seizure claim, right? We were in the airport. We lose the $97,000. If we then go back to Nevada and then file suit, our injury can't travel with us. And that's the big concern of ­­",

  "In that kind of situation, where the injury actually ­­ and you have named several situations.",
  "So, Justice Breyer, it is our position that, in that situation, there is not personal jurisdiction. And let me try ­­",
  "Okay. The difference is that the defendant in that instance, the injury arises at the bookstore. Okay? And the fact that it has a continuing effect, as a practical matter, the lower courts uniformly treat the injury arising as in the bookstore. But there are situations that you can imagine the following: And that is, he loses the billfold in the store. Okay. That injury arose there. Now, someone takes the credit card from the billfold after he has gone home, knows that he's at home, and starts spending his money with it. That injury arises where he lives.",
  "Okay. The cases that are closest to that ­­ two of them are at page 25a of the petition appendix. They are the Bancroft case, and that ­­ these are not going to be billfold cases. Okay? Billfold cases, people tend not to ­­ if you lose $100, people don't file a lawsuit. These are bigger cases. And it's the petition appendix. You've pulled open the red brief, so I am asking you for the cert petition. The Bancroft case at 25a is where a Georgia resident writes to a Virginia registrar, and the registrar misappropriates the website of a California company. And that is, they never set foot in California. They don't ­­ you know, do anything in California at all. And there, there is jurisdiction in California because they know that the person's going to be hurt in California. The next one is Metropolitan Life, that ­­ the same page, an Alabama resident writes to an insurance company, and they say, Ah, I'm entitled to the insurance proceeds. But the actual proceeds belong to someone in California. And they never get the money. So it's like this case. The money never gets sent into California. And these remote injury cases ­­",

So I don't think we are trying to push the bounds ­­ let me make one point about McIntyre and then try and correct the misimpression that I think that's been left, that there are a few contacts between Nevada and this case and hopefully prove to you that there are far more contacts between this tort and this forum than will be true in the overwhelming majority of cases that the lower courts confront. And the point I would make, Justice Ginsburg, and it's made by the plurality in McIntyre, is that there have always been special rules for intentional tort cases. That's the distinction, and that's why Calder comes out the way it does, citing restatement Section 32nd of the second ­­ the second restatement of the conflict of laws, and that is the reason ­­ it's not just made up. The reason there's a special rule for intentional torts is that the defendant knows he's hurting someone somewhere else and, therefore, expects to be haled into court. The view of the McIntyre plurality, of course, was that the overseas manufacturer there wasn't, itself, doing anything directed at the forum. But if I could just get to the very important point about ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "That they lived and worked there.",
  "That ­­ that is actually, generally, what the lower courts hold, and their reason is that the defendant is doing something, knowing that he may be haled into that court. It is a defendant­favoring rule that intends ­­ attempts to give predictability. Now, if that's wrong, it doesn't hurt my case because, as the case comes to you, it's not ­­",
  "Justice Scalia, there is a ­­",
  "Right. It's almost like the Fourth Amendment reasonable expectations to privacy. There is a circularity here. But it's not entirely circular because we're talking about a specific State here. It's not that he knows that the plaintiffs might be ­­ live in Georgia or might live anywhere in the United States, it's a very specific State, and that's why it's not circular. Now, if I could just help you understand our view that there are a lot more contacts between this tort and Nevada than in the great, great ­­ at least 90 percent of the cases the lower courts are confronting. So here are the points that I would make about those contexts, and there are six, and I will try and be brief. The case involves money owned by Nevada residents, $30,000 of which originated in Nevada, and all of which was on its way to Nevada. Second, the defendant intentionally hurt the plaintiffs, knowing that they would lose access to the money in Nevada, where they lived and worked. Third, we will use documents in Nevada to prove that his action was intentional because it omitted the information that the defendant requested. This is not a ­­ us unilaterally sending money. At the Atlanta airport, he said, send us the proof that the funds are legitimate, that he requested and received from the plaintiffs in Nevada and that he learned in searching a Nevada law enforcement database, which is paragraph 79 of the complaint. The two last points I would make is that the plaintiffs will show that they were deprived of the money in Nevada until the Nevada lawyer they had to hire used records in Nevada to persuade the government to send the money to Nevada. And the plaintiffs in their case, of course, will show, because it is the fact that they are gamblers working in Las Vegas, that the economic injury occurred to them there. Now, if you think that's not enough, if you conclude that's not enough, you are closing the door absolutely to all of the internet cases because those are cases where someone sits at the computer and targets someone in another State. This ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Justice Alito, you always tell us that you've got to write a legal rule, and there is no special personal jurisdiction rule, and the lower courts ­­",
  "Justice Breyer, the kinds of internet cases ­­ and it's wrong for me to just say, \"internet\" ­­ the kinds of cases that I'm talking about are the fraud cases, the intentional tort cases ­­",
  "You steal ­­ you're sitting in Georgia ­­ you don't, but someone is sitting in Georgia, and they steal the identity of someone who's in Nevada.",
  "I'm ­­ exactly ­­ that's why I took it immediately back, recognizing the error.",
  "But there are bad people in the world, obviously, and those people do, with increasing and distressing frequency at ­­ with these new tools of communication, they are very, very capable of causing significant harm to someone else without actually do ­­ setting foot in the State. Now, I have to offer you a solution. Let me just be clear. I recognize that this can go either way because if I say, \"internet cases,\" well, then I'm opening the door to potentially a very wide­ranging set of cases going into Nevada, and we have here the special case of the law enforcement officer, and I believe that I do have the solution. And that is, this is actually a case about transfer. It is not a case about jurisdiction and venue. This is the unusual case where the defendant filed a motion to dismiss and did not file a 1404 motion to transfer. And this case is a lot ­­ you should treat it like Atlantic Marine because what you need to do is recognize, I think, that there's the big category of jurisdiction. Where there is jurisdiction, there's a subset, there is venue. That's where you can file a lawsuit. That is not where the case is going to be litigated. And in these cases, what defendants uniformly do ­­ and the lower courts pay incredible attention to the fact that law enforcement officers are going to be witnesses or are the defendant. In these cases, the defendant comes in and says, okay, I recognize, technically, there's jurisdiction and venue, but let me tell you how disruptive it will be if I actually have to litigate the case here.",
  "No, sir. I would not ­­ this is my judgment. I do not want it reversed. What I'm saying ­­",
  "I'm trying to describe an opinion that you would write, and the opinion that I think you would write is this ­­ and it says, look, personal jurisdiction in the wake of Calder, particularly where there are contacts here, exists. Venue exists because several of these are events and omissions, including the injury that occurs in Nevada. But what we expect the lower courts to do in a case like this is to pay particular attention at the beginning of the case, as we do with qualified immunity, to have an efficient process in which the defendant can say ­­",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I am not trying to just skip over. I have talked for this entire time about why I think we are right on jurisdiction and venue, and I am pleased to return to the issue. What I'm suggesting to you is that I recognize that we can't have ­­ there are two ways of dealing with the prospect of a broad personal jurisdiction rule. One is to narrow it substantially. The second is to recognize that it doesn't determine where the case is going to ultimately be litigated. I will tell you, Justice Ginsburg, from personally reviewing all of the post­Calder cases in the Federal courts and the State courts, that the contacts here are much, much greater between Nevada and this tort than exists in the great majority of cases that the lower courts are confronting. And so if you ­­",
  "Two things about that. That is the rule for torts, not specifically ­­ it does ­­ it is true of libel, but it is true, as well, of fraud. The fraud occurs where the person is defrauded.

  "And, Justice ­­ that's correct. And, Justice Scalia, this is exactly why ­­ you were asking the question, why is it that then­Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Calder has the discussion that the other side is focusing on about how the article was centered on California and how it came from California sources. Now, none of the holding of the case describes it, but you wondered ­­ and he has emphasized, my friend has, why is it in the opinion? And it's for the reason you have just given. And that is defamation and libel cases, when you are talking about the publication to the internet or publication nationwide like the National Enquirer, the lower courts have rightly focused on the fact, can we say that this isn't just directed to the United States?",
  "We are saying the same thing. I'm just not explaining my view of it well enough, and that is – the",
  "I don't think so, and let me try my best. All right. The reason these defamation cases about internet and national publications ­­ say the New York Times is sued for defamation. The Court was very concerned and the lower courts are very concerned that the publisher can't be sued in all 50 States. And so what the lowers courts have done in the wake of Calder is say, I know you published it to the whole country, National Enquirer, but is it fair to say you expected to be haled into court in California because there were special features about this defamation. Now, defamation and nationwide publication is very different from the other torts the lower courts confront, which, as was suggested in the first 30 minutes of questioning, I think, by Justice Kagan, are directed at a person, the \"shoot the gun\" example, the \"defraud the victim\" example.",
  "Justice Scalia, I agree with you, but I will say in my defense that, when the Court has said ­­ when we are trying to figure out if there are minimum contacts and whether it's consistent with fair play and substantial justice, the language the Court has used is, is it fair, because the defendant could reasonably be expected ­­ could reasonably expect to be haled into the court. That's true of purposeful availment cases like McIntyre. It's true of intentional tort cases. And that is, we measure fairness and whether you are getting process that is due to you procedurally by whether this is something that you could expect to happen to you ­­",
  "No, sir. No, sir. I have given you a specific test about where you have to intentionally injure the person, knowing that they will be injured there, and the injury has to arise there. And as I've said, the way in intentional tort cases that has to work is that the lower courts recognize that a tort has a wrong and an injury, and the injury is what makes the tort complete and the tort occurs where the victim is. Just take the \"shoot the gun\" example, right? The reason is that the person is injured there. It doesn't have to be that you shoot the gun, that the bullet travels across the State line, because the same thing can happen when money is taken out of your bank account.",
  "Yes. It is essentially a fraud claim. And that ­­",
  "That he knowingly submitted information that caused the government not to send us the money. False ­­",
  "Yes. That is ­­",

  "Okay. The citations to the complaint about ­­ it would be paragraphs 99 to 101. \"It's alleged to violate the Fourth Amendment and our due process rights to have submitted the false affidavit that caused the government not to send us the money.\" And if you were to conclude, Justice Scalia, that this injury doesn't arise here ­­ let me just tell you what the consequences of that are. And that is there are a large number of cases that arise constantly where people lose access to money, where they don't have the insurance proceeds sent to them or the Social Security checks or the IRS refunds.",
  "Right.",
  "It doesn't make any practical sense to me, and the money wasn't in Georgia. The money was in an account in Quantico, Virginia that belonged to the DEA. What difference does it make as a matter of personal jurisdiction between the following two cases and that is the defendant sitting in Georgia steals money from my bank account in Nevada or the defendant sitting in Georgia causes the government not to send me the money in Nevada ­­",
  "Okay.",
  "Right. I believe that the elements of the tort that Justice Kagan is describing are the same elements that I am talking about here. It's just where the money starts.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, it is a different case, Mr. Chief Justice. And the lower courts say the real question is, where ­­ is this the kind of injury that will arise where the Plaintiff lives and works. And any case ­­",
  "No, I ­­ that is ­­ for example, on our seizure claim, we acknowledge that, at the very least, there wouldn't be venue. And there's another difference, in addition to the fact that they had returned to Nevada and they had returned to living and working. And that is, in our actual case, we have the documents that are sent at his request from Nevada. We have the fact that he searches the Nevada law enforcement databases. And we have the fact that the money is going to be sent by the government to Nevada. It's requested by their Nevada lawyer, sending documents from Nevada. And so those are ­­ if we think of Calder as a case in which there's not merely injury in California, but a few extra factors that were in California, that's much more this case than it is any of the other cases that the lower courts are confronting.

  "Yes.",

  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We ask you to resolve this case narrowly by reaffirming that an arbitrator, rather than a court, presumptively resolves a dispute over a precondition to arbitration. That holding would decide the question presented and would resolve the circuit conflict and govern 99 percent of the cases in the lower courts. Argentina wants you to decide a different issue. Its position in this Court is that there is no arbitration agreement with my client in the first place, so it says a precondition to that non­existent agreement is irrelevant. Now ­­",
  "We do not take that position. If a party were to say that, as the governments in NAFTA have done, as the Solicitor point ­­ Solicitor General points out is the language of the U.S./South Korea Bilateral Investment Treaty, unlike this one, we think it would be settled that a Court would resolve the dispute.",
  "Yes. So let me see if I ­­",
  "Well, a couple of things about that. You do ­­ you have held in Howsam that, if there is a precondition to arbitration, it is presumptively decided by the arbitrators, rather than the courts, so that ­­",
  "All right. Maybe I can help by locating the parties' different arguments in this case because there are a lot of them. We have said, of course, that we think you should decide the question presented. Argentina wants you to go beyond the question presented. We can talk about whether that's appropriate. If you did decide the question of consent, I think you would do it in a three­part opinion, and some of the parts are contested, and some aren't. This is how I would write the opinion: Part one would say look at our decision in Howsam, and it's undisputed here that if this was an ordinary contract case, just between two American companies, then BG Group would win because this looks just like a procedural precondition. It's like the John Wiley staged grievance procedure, and I don't think the other side argues against that. Then the other side has given you two different arguments for why you wouldn't apply Howsam and why you might have a different analytical framework. The first argument, we could call it part two of the opinion, is the argument of the United States. And what the United States says is, look, the difference between this and Howsam is it's an international case. And what's different in international cases is that, when you dealt with Howsam, you dealt with a set of expectations between parties agreeing to arbitrate that may not apply in the international context, and so maybe it's different. Now, this ­­ and the reason they say that it's different is that an international case, when it's cited in the United States, is governed by the New York Convention. And in a New York Convention case, whether it's a commercial case, whether it's an international treaty arbitration case, what the rule of judicial review is ­­ and that's what we're looking at here, do the arbitrators finally decide the question, or does a court, on judicial review, decide it? In a New York Convention case, you look to the law of the citeus, here, the United States, the Federal Arbitration Act. So I take the Solicitor General's position to be this: Look, when you have Argentina arbitrating against a company from the United Kingdom, then the Argentine company and ­­ excuse me ­­ Argentina and the UK Company don't have any ex­ante understanding about whether the dispute will be finally resolved by a court or, instead, the arbitrators because who knows where the arbitration would occur. Here, it occurred in the United States. Our answer is that this objection answers itself. It's true that they don't have a specific judicial system, that it will be ahead of time when they sign the treaty ­­ Argentina signs a treaty with the United Kingdom. They don't know whether a dispute over this precondition will be resolved de novo or, instead, it will be resolved deferentially because they don't know where the arbitration will occur, but they do know that the applicable law will be the citeus of the arbitration. And there is precedent on this. The government's argument here is about international arbitration governed by the New York Convention. There are 149 signatories to the New York Convention. There have been thousands of challenges to arbitral awards under the New York Convention. And we are unaware of any precedent from any country, ever, that says we are going to not apply our domestic system set of rules, here, the Howsam first options lines, because this is an international case. We know that ­­",
  "Correct.",
  "That's correct. And that is what has been true in every New York Convention case ever decided in the United States and, so far as we are aware, every case decided by every New York Convention signatory because they have ­­ they are accepting a body of rules. When you were trying to confirm or overturn the award, they agreed to put it here. That's how it ­­",
  "No, that's part three of the opinion. I just haven't gotten there. Here's the reason why, and that is, the government's argument about the New York Convention doesn't have anything to do with investment treaties. It's about the New York Convention. And so it applies ­­ a company from Japan sues a company from Ecuador, and they arbitrate in the United States. So the government's position has very wide­ranging consequences for any international arbitration in the United States. Now, Argentina does make the argument that you've described, and this is the next part of the opinion, if we got past the government's position, which I don't think has any precedent for having a special international rule, we come to Argentina's argument. And Argentina says this: Look, the reason this isn't Howsam is that this is a unilateral contract, effectively, and that is, we put our treaty out there, and now, BG Group has to do something in order to create an arbitration agreement in the first place because we don't have an arbitration agreement with them, we haven’t consented to arbitration, then, because of that, call it a precondition, call it whatever you want, because an arbitration agreement hasn't formed, the arbitrators have no power to decide anything, and, therefore, you can't defer to their judgment. We would never expect them to have the power to decide anything Argentina says because there's no arbitration agreement at all. So that's the next part of the opinion, and it will get to the points you raised, Justice Alito.",
  "It is not. There is a principle of latches, but there is an equivalent principle of equitable tolling, so it's true that we could go there. I do think, ultimately, it's a point in our favor because it shows how pointless this exercise is. We'll recall, of course, that while we could leave ­­ we could file a claim in the Argentine courts, the Argentine courts, of course, would have the power to do nothing at all. They couldn't bind us. They couldn't bind Argentina. They wouldn't have to decide the case in the first place, and then we would be back here. And the question is, if you have a provision like that, which is, effectively, go wait in the Argentine courts, does anybody seriously think that that determines your consent to arbitrate, when it is that that act, going and sitting, can't have any effect on the case whatsoever. Do we really ­­",
  "We would be.",
  "But, Mr. Chief Justice, my point isn't that it's not important. I'll give them that it's important; they negotiated for it. My point is that whether it's important or not doesn't tell you if it's a procedural step or a substantive step, in terms of their agreeing to arbitrate with us.",
  "Justice Kennedy, the way you would resolve that issue, I believe, is to get to Argentina's argument that it did not consent to arbitration, that there is no ­­ there is no arbitration agreement in the first place, you would have to go outside the question presented to begin with. Remember, the question presented that you granted certiorari on, to resolve a very distinct circuit conflict at the urging of the arbitration community was what do we do if we have an arbitration agreement and this is a precondition to arbitration? If you were going to decide the antecedent question, the question before that, is there an arbitration agreement at all, which is my part three, it is the argument that Argentina is raising in this Court, then I think you have to carry it all the way through.",
  "Well, I agree with you, Justice Kennedy, that if you were asking me did the D.C. Circuit correctly interpret the treaty and decide ­­ I misunderstood you. You have asked me, look, I see the D.C. Circuit's decision, which is three sentences long, on the question of whether they can invoke this waiting period, and I see the arbitrators, they're the experts. It's much more substantial. If you accept the United States' argument to remand this case, which neither of the parties think you should, then it could be ­­ you could suggest to the D.C. Circuit it reopen it. But, otherwise, I'm going to agree with you, Justice Kennedy. I am a believer that you should stick with the question presented and the arguments that are properly presented to you. Let me try, then, to deal with your point about the United Kingdom court and the point about how courts decide if there is an arbitration agreement. We actually agree that you ­­ you are obviously a court ­­ you need to decide if there is an arbitration agreement here. You do decide that de novo. The point that I want to get to in the part three of an opinion that I am imagining is that there clearly is an arbitration agreement here, and I am going to come to that in one second. I will just bracket the point about the United Kingdom. Remember that, as I said with the New York Convention, the United Kingdom has one system for reviewing arbitral awards, Switzerland has another, we have another one. What you need to look to, I think, is your own body of law because each one of those systems is because of not some great principle ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. And can I maybe take you to the treaty itself and explain what I think are the questions for courts and what I think are the questions for the arbitrators? Because I actually think it's pretty clear from the treaty. It's in our Blue Brief in the appendix. But Justice Ginsburg, the answer to your question is yes, and I will explain how that plays out under the treaty. So this is the agreement that Argentina made with the United Kingdom, and the dispute resolution provision starts at Page 8A, it's Article 8. Now, there are three conditions in this agreement on Argentina's consent to arbitrate. It does have to agree, and we had to do something. We had to invest. And those three conditions are set out in the first sentence of the dispute resolution provision. It says ­­ and I am now on Article 8, Roman I. \"Disputes with regard to an investment,\" so this arbitration provision is only going to apply to an investment, which is a defined term under the treaty, \"which arises within the terms of the agreement.\" So it has to be a treaty claim. \"Between an investor of one contracting party and the other contracting party.\" And so that is it has to be a U.K. investor suing an ­­ seeking to arbitrate against an Argentine company. And those are ­­ if those things aren't true, there is no arbitration agreement. Now, that ­­ that language that I just read to you is from the local litigation provision, and then the treaty says the exact same body of disputes are eligible substantively for arbitration.",
  "Right.",
  "I'll agree with that, but I just don't think you can ignore the rest of it. And so let me explain why that's true. So as I said, those three conditions apply to the arbitration provisions, So I'm at the top of 9A. \"The aforementioned disputes\" ­­ those are the ones that meet the three conditions ­­ \"shall be submitted to international arbitration.\" And then, Mr. Chief Justice, it turns immediately to the relationship between the local litigation and the arbitration. And it's common ground that, in the example that you gave, if you had just part one ­­ and I just think it's really important by you, Mr. Chief Justice, and that is, if this provision said, go litigate in the local courts, come what may, this would be a completely different case. But this provision is wildly different from that. It says, go to the local courts; whatever they do, it makes no difference. It cannot stop the case, it can't change the issues that will be arbitrated, it can't have any effect on the arbitrator's decisions. It is exactly like a waiting period, which exists in every international ­­",
  "Okay. Mr. Chief Justice, but then I would just take you to the next page, sub 4, and we understand what the answer to that ambiguity perhaps is, the last sentence is, \"The arbitration decision shall be final and binding on both parties.\" That is the only body under this treaty that can issue a decision that decides the parties' dispute. It's only the arbitrators. Now ­­",
  "Fair enough ­­ no, that's not quite right, Mr. Chief Justice, because, remember, imagine that we went to the Argentine courts, and for the first time ever, we won. And so that an Argentine court told the Argentine state, you know, we actually think you should pay this company $200 million. What would happen then is that Argentina can take the question to arbitration, but nothing about the local court's decision binds anyone. We ­­ there is never a point at which you can say that the investor will abide by or be bound by a decision of an Argentine court under this system. That's what's so unusual about it. Perhaps I can explain why it's there ­­ because it is odd, I will tell you, and I will tell you that, in deciding this question that Argentina is adding to the case, in the context of this local litigation provision, it is a very strange vehicle to do that. There are only ­­ only 1 percent of bilateral investment treaties have this provision. It's a historic remnant. It's in ­­ of the first 15 bilateral investment treaties that Argentina agreed to, it's in nine of them. In the subsequent 40 of them, it doesn't appear at all, again, a good example of how it isn't really a condition on their consent. And it is a remnant of an era of espousal. It used to be the case that, before these treaties, that an investor in BG's position would have to go to the Argentine courts. And when Argentina first created the investment treaties, it kind of liked the idea that you had to spend some time in the courts. But no one would agree to the treaty ­­ this is Justice Alito's question earlier ­­ no one would ever agree to these treaties if they didn't know that the decisionmaker would be the neutral, expert arbitrators, and so it just has this you­have­to­wait­in­court feel to it. But it is absolutely critical that we look at the substance of the provision. It's very much, Mr. Chief Justice, like the John Wiley case, which is structured, one, you will have step one of our grievance process; step two, within five days you have to go to our next step of the grievance process; step three, then you can go on to arbitration. It could have stopped, theoretically, at any of those. If you had given up at step one or two, you would well have been bound by it. But the question you are being asked here, if we could just return to if you are trying to decide this de novo or, instead, defer to the arbitrator's interpretation of whether this litigation provision is binding, is, fundamentally, when Argentina went into this treaty, did it think that the arbitrators were going to resolve the disputes? Right? Did it expect ­­ it's a question of consent, Justice Sotomayor ­­ did it expect that the answers to these questions would come from the arbitrators or, instead, the courts? And when we are talking about the process for getting it going ­­ Justice Ginsburg talked about the timing, do you have to do this for 18 months, there is another provision here about 3 months, the natural understanding is that there is an arbitration agreement, Argentina knew that it could only get this treaty if there was a guarantee to the investors that they would be able to arbitrate, and so expects the arbitrators to decide this. Imagine Argentina's world, if you will. Argentina's world is that every timing question, whether something has to be filed on blue paper ­­ I have no idea what the line they want to draw is. Every procedural step is, instead, a condition on its consent to arbitrate, and that doesn't seem to make any sense at all. There have to be procedural prerequisites. And Argentina would recharacterize this as, as I said, a unilateral agreement. So it's like Argentina says ­­ posts a sign on a pole and says, if you pay me ­­ if you find my dog, I will give you $100. And so you have to perform an act. And it says we have to perform an act here. We have to go to the local courts, or otherwise, there is no agreement at all. Well, a few things about that. Arbitration is not a dog, and Article 8, if we just go back to page 8A, does not require us to submit it to the local courts at all. This can't be a step that we are required to take because we are not required to take it. If I could just take you to the last two lines of it? \"It shall be submitted at the request of one of the parties to the dispute.\" Argentina was just as entitled as us to put this into the local courts as we were. It can't have been an expectation that we had to do something before it would consent to arbitration. And so I do think that this is just on all fours with John Wiley for that ­­ for that reason. The only other thing that has been put on the table in front of you is the question of whether Argentina's sovereignty should make a difference here. And this is kind of the second theme of the brief of the United States. And I would say about that that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which was discussed, of course, in the last argument, has an express waiver of sovereign immunity for arbitration awards that's controlled here. And if ­­ when the Solicitor General's representative speaks, talked ­­ if that person were to talk about what the treatment of these issues in other countries is, we are unaware, again, of any country in the world where the arbitral system of review in the courts changes in the slightest because one party happens to be a signatory to a treaty, and that makes a ton of sense. Again, this is fundamentally a commercial relationship. Argentina knew that it couldn't, in its ­­ in the crisis that gave rise to these investment treaties, Argentina couldn't get the money to come into the country if it hadn't agreed to arbitration.",
  "So, Your Honor, I think that there are a variety of cases out there that deal with the question in other jurisdictions of different ways of reviewing arbitration awards. And those are unique to their own arbitral system. We've cited decisions from ­­ a decision from France, for example, that follows your Howsam line. The important point I would make is that there is ­­ when the other side points to decisions in which a court reviews de novo a jurisdictional ruling of an arbitral tribunal, none of those decisions are unique in any way to the fact that it was an international arbitration or an international treaty arbitration. Their international rule, the U.K. rule, the rule in lots of other countries, is simply about arbitration. The reason that the other side can say that this case might well be reviewed de novo in the United Kingdom, for example, is that the jurisdictional decision in essentially every arbitration of any kind in the United Kingdom will be reviewed de novo. They just have a different approach to these questions.",
  "That is not the most current view, Justice Ginsburg. In a case called Nihon Plast, which was the most recent court of appeals decision in France in 2004, the court adopted the procedural­substantive distinction that very much parallels Justice Breyer's opinion in the Howsam case. But, even if it were the case, it's because the French have their own approach to arbitration. We have a system that says, look, if you can always run off to court because of any of these procedural objections ­­ it has to be on blue paper, you didn't write ­­ wait for the ­­ wait 30 days, another great example would be, in lots of arbitration provisions, you have to submit a sufficiently detailed statement of claim to the arbitrators. Well, that would be ­­",
  "The language in the agreement meant that what Argentina did disentitled it from being able to rely on this provision. I will take you, quickly, if you don't mind, to the provisions of the treaty so you know what I am talking about. There are two of them. One is the one that the arbitrators relied on, and that is in the arbitration provision 8­4, which is on 10A, it says, \"The arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with the provisions of this agreement, the laws of the contracting party involved in the dispute, including conflict of laws,\" and, then, at the end of the sentence, \"the applicable principles of international law.\" So this exhaustion requirement ­­ it's not even an exhaustion requirement ­­ the local litigation requirement is subject to international law. And then earlier ­­ and so three other tribunals have reached the same conclusion as this one, that you ­­ for that reason of that provision, you can't rely in the particular circumstances on the local litigation. And then Article 3 ­­",
  "Sorry.",
  "There are three other tribunals ­­",
  "­­ that have reached the same conclusion as this one, and that is Argentina can't rely on the local litigation provision because it effectively closed the courthouse doors. It's own conduct disentitled it. Then ten other tribunals have reached the same conclusion based on Article 3, the most favored nation provision, because this requirement doesn't exist in the Argentina/U.S. BIT. There are only three tribunals ­­ to be clear, only three tribunals out of 16 or 17 have agreed to enforce it. If I could reserve the remainder of my time?",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I do have a rule that distinguishes the A4 paper, and that rule should be, and we think it does follow from the analysis of Howsam, which is just a thinking about when people make agreements and what they expect is that an arbitration agreement is formed and a party consents to arbitration when they guarantee that the ultimate decision can be made by an arbitrator and not a court. It's forum selection. We're going to have the ultimate decision made by the arbitrator. And that rule is applied in the investment treaty context as follows: And it is there is consent to arbitration when the investor is guaranteed that their claim can ultimately decide ­­ be decided by a court, and the state can't force it to be ultimately ­­ excuse me ­­ by an arbitrator, and the state can't force it to ultimately be decided by a court. And I'll show you where that rule, how that line is divided in this treaty. And that is, I gave you the three conditions at the beginning. Those are not A4 paper. You have to be a U.K. investor, you have to have a treaty claim, you have to be suing another party to the treaty. And if those aren't true, then there is no arbitration agreement and Argentina has every reason to say I have no idea why these arbitrators are here, this person's from Ecuador, not from the United Kingdom. But on the other things ­­ at that point, once ­­ we are a U.K. investor and we have invested in Argentina, that's the performance that is required, once we did that, then we are protected by Article 8, the dispute resolution provision. And you look at Article 8 and you say, okay, does that guarantee that you have the right to ultimately have it decided by the arbitrators? Or can Argentina actually insist that it will be ultimately decided by a court? And it's the former. We made clear, I think, and nobody disagrees, that they can't force us to go into court and wait for that ruling, take that ruling in any way, shape, or form. Now, my friend says that, look, this is like a unilateral agreement, and this is like where I say I'll hire you to paint my house, if you post a bond. Well, that is a terrible argument for them because this treaty reads as if he was saying, I'll let you paint my house if you post the bond or I post the bond, because, remember, the thing they want us to perform on, supposedly, is something they can do, too. Whoever heard of unilateral agreement that was conditioned on either party doing something? There’s nothing they’re waiting for us ­­",
  "That ­­ I don't believe that is correct, Justice Scalia.",
  "I see. I believe the answer, when this was put to them, his answer to your question was, I just don't have to do that. His view was ­­ and it's a perfectly fine position to take, and that is he's not going to help me win my case. Fine. But it does describe whether this is a condition on his consent, that he could do it, too, and if he could do it, too, it can't be something that he is waiting for me to perform at all. I would also say that, on this question of whether it has any value, that all that you got, Justice Alito, was that, if I were to pursue the case in the Argentine courts, maybe something would happen, we First thing's first. I don't have to pursue it. Remember, his whole point is, when asked if the courts were closed, he said, I just have to put the piece of paper down. So if this were a treaty provision that actually involved litigation, involved exhaustion of remedies, where we might learn something, that might be a different case. But this is a waiting period in an Argentine court. And, remember, as well, these are treaty claims, and it is perfectly clear and undisputed that the local court, even if it decided the treaty claims, their ruling would not bind the arbitrators. And so he says, well, hey, we might win.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I will then say that's a possible argument. But let's figure out who we would ordinary expect to figure that out. This is a treaty provision. It's ­­ the experts involved in treaty interpretation are the three neutral arbitrators, who really do this every day. It's what they do. They have enormous expertise in interpreting treaties. And so you might say ­­ and it would be a perfectly valid interpretation, well, maybe submitting it to the local court requires some activity. But do we really expect, when the U.K. and Argentina ended this treaty, that it would actually be the Supreme Court of the United States that would be deciding that question, or instead, the arbitrators? And if you believe it's the arbitrators, then we win, because it's the kind of procedural question that we put to them purposely.",
  "And, surely, they wouldn't, Mr. Chief Justice, but that's the point of the treaty. Remember, my friend said, look, if it weren't for this treaty, we could never sue them. That's the reason there's the treaty because, if there wasn't the treaty and we couldn't get relief from them, we would have never invested. And so the whole point of this treaty is to put these disputes into arbitration. There is no special substantive rights in this treaty. They are all customary international law. The thing that matters in this treaty ­­ the thing that matters in all the treaties is I don't have to have my case decided by an Argentine court.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is a reprise of Oxford Health. The argument of the party that wanted arbitration in Oxford Health, the arbitrator had just gotten it terribly wrong under this Court's decision in Stolt­Nielsen. And this Court may well have had sympathy for that, but the Court realized that it was going to actually have to write an opinion about the case, an opinion that the lower courts were going to have to apply in later cases. And the difficulty is that if you interject Federal law here, you are going to have just a wealth of DIRECTV challenges, because in every instance in which the State court announces here's how we understand this language, which is State law language in our contract, it will be open to the party proposing arbitration to say no, actually, if there is an ambiguity in the ­­ in the law ­­ excuse me ­­ in the contract, then you are obliged to apply a presumption in favor of arbitration, and this is always a Federal question.",
  "So, sir ­­",
  "So, Mr. Chief Justice, if I could deal with your real concern about where this statute comes from, the idea that this is kind of the core discrimination against arbitration that the statute is after kind of structurally and then what exactly happened in this case. The root of the FAA ­­ and it's reflected in the ­­ in the statutory text in Section 2 ­­ is that State courts were adopting doctrines that were hostile to arbitration. Discover Bank's one of them this Court concluded. What the FAA is not concerned with ­­ and Congress could well pass a law that would be ­­ is the threshold question of whether there's an arbitration agreement in the first place; that is, we have been unable to locate in this Court or any other court a time when the courts overturned the determination under State law whether the parties had agreed to arbitrate vel non. That's an antecedent question. It may well be that Congress could conclude that there is a problem like that and adopt a statute like it. But to do that here is to really open up an enormous can of worms. What you have is the ­­",
  "Sure.",
  "No, Justice Scalia, don't ­­ don't misunderstand me. If the Court were to ­­",
  "I apologize, then. If the Court were to conclude that this is just an effort to discriminate against arbitration, then I think the Court has doctrines and the lower courts have doctrines. We are not saying that you have to turn entirely a blind eye to the idea and let a State court get away with anything. My point is different. And that is, that this is not a doctrine that is intended to discriminate against arbitration. It is not an indicia of a pattern ­­",
  "Yeah.",
  "Yes. If you were to ­­ we agree that there is a backstop here, and it's an important backstop. And that is, if you conclude that a court is just, you know, making it up and discriminating against arbitration, we think that's an important role for the court to play. But the difference here is that the argument is that the State court really got this wrong and had an obligation to kind of presume that the parties wanted to engage in arbitration. That is a very, very, very different proposition of law because it asks the Federal courts to interject and the State courts to interject ­­",
  "Okay. There are two points about that.",
  "Okay. There are two things about that. The first is, Justice Kennedy, the language that kind of trailed off in your sentence is that the Court has been very clear that ambiguities in the scope of an arbitration agreement have to be construed in favor of arbitration, and here's the reason. And that is, if we know these parties have agreed to arbitrate ­­ this is in the first options. It's in lots of cases ­­ if we know you and I have agreed to arbitrate so that there's an arbitration agreement, we're going to assume that all of the cases fall into the bucket of arbitrability, and that's a fair common­sense presumption. But what the Court said in Justice Thomas's opinion for the Court in Granite Rock is that the question of whether there's an enforceable arbitration agreement at all is not ­­ is a State law question, not a Federal law question, and here's the reason. There are two interpretive principles under the Federal Arbitration Act. Number one is, we want to only require people to arbitrate when they have ­­ we are convinced under their State law contract they did intend to arbitrate. We can't presume that you and I intend to arbitrate because that's the question we're asking. And the most important thing for you to understand about the nature of this Section 9 in the contract is that it does determine whether there is going to be any arbitration at all in California. That is to say, is there any agreement between DIRECTV and its California consumers to arbitrate? And I can point to ­­ it's very important that you understand that.",
  "Okay. There are two just ­­ there are two rules at stake. When it comes to the question of whether you and I have an arbitration agreement at all, what the court has said is two things. One is, this is going to be a matter of State law. But, of course, if all you're doing is ­­ this is a game. You're just trying to evade enforcing the Federal Arbitration Act. That's a ­­ you know, that's a role for the Federal courts. What Mr. Landau is relying on and what the language that's quoted from Volt that comes from Moses H. Cone is talking about is something quite different. And that is, construe every ambiguity in favor of arbitration. That's what I'm resisting, not ­­",
  "First, is that there is no administrable line that he can identify between something that's wrong and really, really wrong. But in any event, it's not ­­ it's not correct that the contract is improperly interpreted. Here are the reasons: The first is that, Justice Breyer, if you and I have a contract that says if California law would prevent us from having a class action waiver, we will not arbitrate at all. That is not preempted. That's the second holding of Volt. Remember, all AT&T versus Concepcion is, is a rule that says, if California forces us to engage in class action arbitration. But you and I can agree to anything at all. This contract, when it says, \"If the law of your State would find the class action waiver invalid\" is a perfectly fine thing for us to agree to. That's State law and even accounts for preemption because the FAA does not preempt California law in that circumstance.",
  "It does. It does.",
  "In several respects. The first is there are several cases ­­ there are an array of cases that aren't subject to the Federal Arbitration Act. And the second is if you and I agree to follow that law, it is not preempted. Let me also point to some other indicia that's going to make it very hard for ­­",
  "Okay.",
  "We don't, Your Honor. So remember, my point is this: If you and I have a contract to follow that State law, which is this is a contract, then it's not invalid because Concepcion and preemption only apply when the State forces you to do something. But in all events ­­",
  "Right. And, Your Honor, my problem is that that's going to be the question in every case. And if we say we're going to reverse this decision, then every time there's going to be a Federal question about whether this is really what the parties intended, that every time that the contract is ­­ is ambiguous under State law. But I did have a couple of other things ­­",
  "It is ­­ is a possible horrible, Justice Scalia. So let me just give you the choice between the two of them. There is no evidence that the latter is actually happening, and you do have the backstop. And that is, we fully agree that if you conclude that a State court is just making it up and discriminating against arbitration, the FAA has a role to play. What I'm saying to you is that they do, in truth, want a different legal rule, and that is, you've got to construe these in favor of arbitration. That's the principle that he's trying to derive from Volt, Your Honor. That's a whole other kettle of fish than the backstop that you and I are talking about.",
  "I think so, Your Honor. And ­­",
  "All right. If that's what the question is, because that is not the Volt principle. That is the idea that this is just wildly out of bounds. It's the incredibly fact­bound question about whether this one decision is wildly out of bounds. So let me talk about the other reasons it's not remotely wildly out of bounds. Because if you write an opinion about anything other than legal rule you just articulated, Justice Alito, we are going to be in an incredible way.",
  "Okay, Justice Kennedy. Because in my ­­ I may be mistaken, but I think that you and Justice Alito are describing two different legal rules. Justice Alito is saying, as I understand it ­­ and I don't purport to speak for the Justice, obviously ­­ is that if this is a crazy decision, it's invalid under the FAA. The ambiguities construed in favor of arbitration principle is an ordinary interpretive principle. And the reason, Justice Kennedy, just to bracket this, why the Volt principle, the Moses H. Cone principle doesn't apply here, and that is that it's ambiguities in the scope of an arbitration agreement. Here the question is whether the parties had an arbitration agreement whatsoever. So we ­­ I think we've now agreed on the legal rule perhaps. And so let me tell you, if I could, why I don't think you can write an opinion that says this is nuts.",
  "Yeah, it was ­­",
  "­­ nonsensical.",
  "I mean, I just don't want to ­­ I don't want to play around with words, Your Honor, about nonsensical or not. I think you and I are basically on the same page about the FAA principle. Here's what I have in terms of why this is not remotely outside the bounds, why, if you write an opinion reversing here, you are going to invite an enormous amount of second­guessing of State law contract interpretation. The first is that Section 10 of the contract expressly contrasts State and Federal law; that is, it says the law of your State, and then distinguishes Federal law from that. The second is, as Justice Ginsburg says, why is it the parties even referred to State law at all if what they are talking about is just \"it would be invalid.\" The third is both before this contract and after this contract, DIRECTV wrote this contract very differently in the way that it now says this contract means, and it says if it would be found invalid, and as was mentioned in the first half hour, every other Fortune 500 company wrote it that way as well. So there are a whole series of very good contrasts for us. I also have what I think is the pushback to the intuition that DIRECTV really must have always intended for the contract to pick up Federal preemption law. And here's the reason why that's not right: DIRECTV claims and has applied the power to unilaterally change this contract, and that is a huge deal in the ­­ in the context of a national form contract. Here's what happened here: DIRECTV put this into the contract in 2006 before AT&T v. Concepcion was a glimmer in anyone's eye at all. And it referred to State law, and everybody agrees at that time that California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act was going to control and was going to prevent any arbitration in California whatsoever. DIRECTV filed an amicus brief in Concepcion saying we will not arbitrate with anyone in California before the court's decision in Concepcion. And the way that DIRECTV intended to account for changes in the law is that they would change the contract unilaterally when the law changed, and I can prove it. In the wake of Concepcion, DIRECTV rewrote the contract. It did it before the California Court of Appeals' decision in this case. DIRECTV had another mechanism fully available to it that would account for the idea that now, under the Federal Arbitration Act, the State can't forbid class action waivers. It didn't need this contract to do anything other than to pick up existing California law. And I will add a couple of other points just about whether, as a matter of Federal law, you would want to say that right now we have to go to arbitration. Remember, DIRECTV's position is in the teeth of the efficiency of the Federal Arbitration Act. Its view is that the parties intended that three years into the litigation, what they would want is to blow up the litigation and send everybody to thousands of individual arbitrations. That is an extremely implausible interpretation of what the parties would want if their goal was to have an efficient dispute resolution mechanism. And so what I'm ­­ the point that I'm trying to make, Your Honors, is while I am sympathetic to the concern, and it may be a concern directed at California in particular, that we need to be attentive to whether or not those courts are discriminating against arbitration. My point to you is that you may believe this is wrong, like you were concerned in Oxford Health that the arbitrator had got it wrong, but you have to adopt a legal rule here. And there are too many points in favor of the California Court of Appeals' decision to say that this is wildly out of bounds and have an administrable legal rule that the lower courts can actually apply. You can say it's way out of bounds; you could say it's nonsensical. But then the lower courts are going to look at what happened here, and they are not going to view it as something that is just wildly impossible.",
  "Okay. Mr. Chief Justice, let me just distinguish this case from the one that you granted in the Long Conference, which is the factual scenario that you just described. In that context, what you have is an arbitration agreement. You know that the parties have agreed to arbitrate and what you then do is assume that they intend the arbitration to be effective. This is importantly, doctrinally a very different case.",
  "Yes.",
  "Excellent. So you've just described Prima Paint and the assignment between the court and the arbitrator. Here is why it is in the paradigm of not favoring ­­ not presuming arbitration, and that is, the effect of this contract, Your Honor. The effect of Section 9 is not to determine ­­ this was Justice Sotomayor's question about whether there'd be some arbitration in California, but just not class arbitration. The effect of this provision is to mean that there will be no arbitration between DIRECTV and any of its customers in California at all. There is no agreement to arbitrate any dispute. And let me just give you the proofs of that. They filed an ­­",
  "Your Honor ­­",
  "Your Honor, so ­­ if I could just distinguish. There is an agreement on the subject of arbitration, that is to say, Section 9 is in the contract. What Section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act asks is, is there an agreement with ­­ to resolve any disputes by arbitration? And what Section 9 tells you in the States where it is effective, where the ­­ what we call the blowup clause takes effect, is that in all of those States, DIRECTV will not arbitrate with individuals, it will not arbitrate with respect to class arbitration. If I could just give you the reasons we know that's true. DIRECTV filed an amicus brief in Concepcion saying we do not arbitrate with anybody in California. It then ­­ and you can see this in the Stevens declaration in opposition to the motion to compel arbitration said we have gotten 215 small claims requests related to these early termination fees, which is ­­ and in court, which is the subject matter of our complaint. And we have arbitrated with one party. So what was going on ­­ and so there ­­ in California, DIRECTV was arbitrating with no one whatsoever because of this contractual provision. And that brings it not within the Volt principle, Your Honor. We interpret ­­ when we have an arbitration agreement, we're going to put things into the bucket, your argument ­­ your ­­ your point, Your Honor, about scope when it comes to safety disputes. But rather, within Granite Rock, which said quite expressly, what we are ­­ when we are talking about the antecedent question, we're trying to figure out if you and I have agreed to arbitrate any subjects whatsoever. When we're in that circumstance, we can't presume that we are arbitrating, because the first principle of the Federal Arbitration Act is to not force people to arbitrate when they haven't intended, and to require people to arbitrate when they have. So, Justice Kennedy, the distinction I was drawing with Justice Alito is if we had an arbitration agreement and we were trying to figure out if, say, class cases were in and individual cases were out, it would make a little bit more sense to say we're going to presume and resolve ambiguities in favor of putting class cases in. But this is not that situation. It is the question whether we are going to arbitrate with anyone. Now, that is not to say that Federal ­­",
  "Okay. Justice Scalia, what I am saying is you ­­ I ­­ you and I agree, but the consequence of the place we disagree is important; that is, you and I agree that this is in the contract. We have a contract on the subject of arbitration. When this Court has said that we will construe arbitration agreements and their scope to include all the subject matter, that is, we will construe them in favor of arbitration, it has been doing so when we not only have an agreement on the subject of arbitration, but we have an agreement to arbitrate some disputes.",
  "Yeah.",
  "Justice Breyer, there's one threshold point that needs to be made, and that is five members of the Court in Concepcion, as I understand their opinions, would not have applied Concepcion in this circumstance. They would not extend it here whatsoever, because the four members of the Court who ­­ you and the other members of the Court who agreed with it would not extend it to the circumstance in which the parties have agreed by contract. And Justice Thomas explained in his opinion in that case that the opinion there ­­ that the ­­ the principle opinion depended on obstacle preemption, and there is no argument here that this case implicates obstacle preemption because it's a question of contract law. So at the threshold, I don't think Concepcion would apply here at all. But your question is bigger. And that is, look, I'm concerned that if we, as the Supreme Court ­­ U.S. Supreme Court articulate a question of Federal law, particularly on a statute that's as important as the Federal Arbitration Act, particularly on a statute that is ­­ is rooted in a concern about hostility of the State courts, we have to show people that we're serious. A couple of things about that. First is, we know the California courts are serious in the wake of ­­ excuse me. We have filed a supplemental brief. The California Supreme Court has decided a case called Sanchez. And Sanchez dealt with the contract that is written like every other Fortune 500 contract is. And it talks about if the ­­ the provision barring class action waivers would be deemed invalid. And the California Supreme Court said that's controlled by Concepcion. That is an enforceable arbitration agreement right there. And so now we are dancing on the head of the pin about one contract that's entirely defunct, and the question of whether the reference to State law, when contrasted in another provision of the contract with Federal law, is so far out of bounds. I think that what you have to do is compare two prospects, Justice Breyer. One is the concern. And we recognize the concern that if you write in an opinion that says, nah, we're not going to take too hard a look, that the State courts will run wild. All I can tell you is that there really isn't evidence of that happening at all. And the Court has doctrines like discrimination against arbitration that can handle it. The second is a reality. We know for a fact that if you announce an opinion that says, this interpretation of State law ­­ because we know what the California law is here. The California Court of Appeals has told us. This interpretation of State law is just too bad and invalidated my arbitration agreement, that's now a question of Federal law, and we are going to relitigate what State law means. That is a boundless rule that is going to be invoked in every single arbitration case. And so you just have to choose between those two prospects. One is you know what will happen. You will be going against the very first principle of Federal arbitration law, which is that we look to State law in determining whether an arbitration agreement is formed, or you have the hypothetical prospect. And what I can say to Your Honor is we have a legislature that is there in the event that the hypothetical prospect comes to pass. We have doctrines to deal with this. I am just terribly worried about how it is that you write an opinion that says this is not just wrong, it's really really wrong, and explain why in the face of the other things in this contract, the contrast with other contracts that I have given you are out there. You do retain the possibility, of course, of not deciding the case at all in the wake of Sanchez, why it is that we need to have an opinion about this, given that this is a contract that doesn't exist anymore, and the California Court of Appeals has resolved it is a question that ­­ that is, you know, very difficult to answer. But if you are going to write an opinion in the case, please do not do it in a way that just invites litigation upon litigation upon litigation because you, as in Oxford Health, are concerned that this Court got it wrong, just like you were concerned that the arbitrator got it wrong. It is an unfortunate cost of the Federal system that Congress decided this is the job of the Federal courts. Not everything is a Federal case. If there are no further questions.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: Our narrowest argument assumes that, in circumstances like this case, Indian tribes do have the legislative jurisdiction to subject nonmembers to tribal tort law duties. Respondents argue that the same facts also give Indian tribes the mandatory adjudicatory jurisdiction to decide private tort lawsuits against non­Indians. Respondents' theory is that, when the Tribes entered the United States and were incorporated into this country, their power to adjudicate cases in this fashion was understood to be an element of their sovereignty. That is not correct. In ­­ I want to identify the three separate respects in which the overriding sovereignty of the United States and our Constitution ­­",
  "I can give you several, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "The first is removal. Remember, our point is not that the Tribes lack any adjudicatory jurisdiction. It is that they lack mandatory adjudicatory jurisdiction so that we do not have access to a neutral judicial forum. A State has the power to pass State tort law, for example, but it does not have the sovereign authority to insist that the case be litigated in its own courts.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, everyone agrees that the Tribes have a form of adjudicatory authority upon consent. They don't have it inherently. The question is going to be: What qualifies as consent? Our point is that, in three separate respects, the national tradition of the United States and our Constitution does not contemplate that a sovereign would adjudicate cases in this fashion. And I want to briefly identify the three, if I could. First, the Constitution contemplates the availability of a neutral forum for suits against noncitizens, and by analogy, noncitizens as you say, Justice Ginsburg, have always been able to remove a case from State to Federal court. The United States at the time of incorporation could not have accepted that non­Indians would not be able to remove to a neutral forum. Second, the Constitution contemplates that this Court will be the one Supreme Court, and State court rulings on questions of Federal law have, of course, always been reviewable in this Court.",
  "Justice Kennedy, if we say it ­­ in those terms, regulatory authority without getting into the question of all forms of legislation, for example, tort law, then the first exception to Montana says that, although there is a presumption against jurisdiction, the Tribes do have their regulatory authority. We have the argument that tort law, because it is so broad and would swallow the rule, that the Tribes lack legislative authority over nonmembers. We have the argument that that is not within the legislative jurisdiction. What I had said at the beginning ­­",
  "Okay. Justice Ginsburg, I need to just separate two questions: Justice Kennedy I understood to be asking me was: Do the Tribes have the antecedent legislative authority? And I was explaining that we have the argument that in the tort context they do not. You then point out that if ­­",
  "We assumed.",
  "Yes. We ­­",
  "Well, Justice ­­",
  "Okay.",
  "I apologize.",
  "Sure. I do not intend, Justice Kennedy, to give up a good argument in our favor. I was just attempting to identify the narrowest ground for reversal. I'm very pleased to discuss the threshold point, and that is that, with respect to nonmembers, the Tribes do not have the authority to subject us to such sweeping tort law duties. It's not that there aren't tort law duties. The plaintiff here is a citizen of the State of Mississippi. Mississippi's tort ­­ State tort law does apply to the case. And the plaintiff has a remedy in State court.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's true that this Court's decisions can often be resolved in different ways. What Nevada v. Hicks in the footnote addressing this question explains is that what the Court has done is narrowly identify the legislative jurisdiction of the Tribe in the cases before it. And so in Strate and in other cases, it has held that the Tribe lacked that antecedent legislative authority. And on that basis, concluded that, well, then because the adjudicatory authority can't be broader than the legislative authority, there's no adjudicatory authority either. So the second point that I was going to make is that it's true that ­­",
  "Justice Ginsburg, what the Court has said in Nevada v. Hicks, addressing the various times that there is dictum in the Court's opinions that has assumed the parallel between legislative and adjudicatory jurisdiction is that that question had not been fully considered by the Court and it remained open. And we assume that that's one of the reasons the Court granted review in this case. To decide, assuming that there is legislative jurisdiction, whether there also is adjudicatory jurisdiction. And I'm pleased to explain why it is. And what I ­­ my introduction was trying to do was, assuming the antecedent legislative jurisdiction, here's why you don't have jurisdiction to decide a court case in this fashion. So the first one that I gave you was the availability of a neutral forum as anticipated by the Constitution.",
  "Oh, Justice Sotomayor, I think actually that your hypothetical is a good one for us. In Article III of the Constitution, we contemplate the availability of a neutral forum when a noncitizen is a defendant in the case, including when we, you know, ordinarily respect the neutrality of State court judges. Right? If a noncitizen is sued in State court, like we are a noncitizen of the Tribe, is sued in the Tribe ­­",

  "All right. I ­­",
  "Yes. That's right.",
  "That's right. Our Constitution ­­",
  "Justice Breyer, I'm ­­ I'm not going to lose sight of your question, but just on this point, our Constitution says we anticipate a neutral forum that this Court will ­­ the Supreme Court ­­",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I understand that. My ­­ what ­­ and, Justice Breyer, I'm not losing sight of your question ­­ what the ­­ what Oliphant and other precedents of this Court say is that the Tribes have the sovereign authority that is consistent with the overriding sovereignty of the United States. And the point I was trying to make is that our legal tradition understands that there will be certain basic protections. And remember, two of the things I'm identifying in the Constitution are not specific to the States: The supremacy of the Constitution ­­ but the Constitution does not apply in tribal courts ­­ and also the supremacy of this Court as the one Supreme Court, which is not available. Now, Justice Scalia, those are features of our national legal tradition, and those features existed at the time of incorporation of the Tribes into the United States. And my point is that Congress could not have believed that, if State courts couldn't do these things, that the tribal courts would be superior. Now, Justice Breyer, you said, well, what's wrong? Two things. I want to say that there are some things wrong even in the context of a tribe like this one. For example, we have a Federal claim against the due process ­­ a due process claim against the putative damage award in ­­ that's asked for in this case, and that would be entirely unreviewable in this case. Now, you contemplate the prospect that we would collaterally attack the judgment. A few things about that. The first is, if that's going to be serious, if we are really going to have a serious regime of collateral attacks where you would just assess whether or not the tribal court ruling is consistent with due process. That is hardly treating the tribal courts as sovereigns. Imagine a Federal district court ruling could be overturned by a circuit court in Mississippi. We wouldn't say that that was an actual sovereign ruling. And the second is that that review system is extremely rare. The Respondents identify a single case, one Ninth Circuit case in which a tribal ruling was overturned. What the Federal courts have done is afford enormous respect and only overturned rulings of tribal courts or foreign courts that are way out of bounds. My point is that the rule that's contemplated by the Constitution is not one of being way out of bounds, it is simply that we have a right to due process; that this Court will be the Supreme Court, that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land. And when that is not true in the courts that we are talking about, even the best­managed, most modern courts, when those rules simply don't apply, that is not consistent ­­",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, the rule of the Constitution is not \"close is good enough,\" but I will say that I think the Indian Civil Rights Act is a point in our favor. Because when you talk about the regulatory matters discussed in the first Montana exception like taxation and licensing, those are things that Congress has left to the Tribes. But the Indian Civil Rights Act, like Public Law 280, like the Courts of Indian Offenses, like the Indian deprivation system shows that the United States has actually been deeply involved in the tribal judiciary. It has not treated tribal adjudication of civil claims as something that belongs to the Tribes. It's quite different. The United States obviously did not regard the Tribes' judiciary as something that is purely a part of their government, because time and again, it has micromanaged them. And, Justice Breyer, I do want to point out another example of that, and that is the Violence Against Women Act. There, we see the right way of doing this, and that Congress has developed systems that say if this tribal judiciary is a good one which affords due process, then it has jurisdiction over cases. And we think that's the right approach here. Congress has the institutional capacity to develop rules like the one you were talking about. It's a much more ­­",
  "Justice Breyer, as I mentioned, we have real concerns, even with respect to a system like this one. For just an example ­­",
  "No, I ­­ our point is broader. You had suggested, Justice Breyer, that I was concerned about another set of tribal judiciaries. I just don't want to lose sight of the fact that there are concerns, even when you have the most modern tribal judiciary. An example is that the ­­ we are a noncitizen, a nonmember of the Tribe, and the tribal jury may be composed only of members of the Tribe, and there's no inherent rule that stops the jury members from being people who know the plaintiff. Now with respect to other judiciaries, it is the case that we do recognize, and the United States has recognized, a wide swath of tribes that use more traditional dispute­resolution mechanisms that also deserve respect because that's the tribal tradition. But it is not the tradition of due process. And the question you've got to figure ­­",
  "Okay. Justice Breyer, I do think your hypothetical of a contract is a really good one for us, because we do believe that the Respondents are most concerned, and their best facts are a business like this one, to be honest, that's operating on tribal land, in the Reservation on an ongoing basis, and they say, look, you have to have anticipated the applicability of tribal tort law. We disagree, but we understand the argument. My point is that in these circumstances, what the Tribes do is, as a condition of operating on the Reservation, they call for not just what you describe, which is the application of tribal law, but a consent to the forum. And remember, in this case, there is a consent to the forum, but the ­­ which the Tribe wrote, but they limited it to disputes arising from the lease. So we say, going forward, we have two solutions. One I've described: That's the prospect of congressional action. You say it could work the other way, and I'll come back to that. But the second is just the contract. Obviously, in the cases that they are concerned about, what the tribe can do and will do is require as a condition of coming onto the Reservation that you accede, knowingly and actually, to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts, and ­­",
  "Actually, it wouldn't work the other way, Justice Kagan, with all due respect. Remember, this is a private tort suit by a member of the Tribe.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, I just don't understand how it is the case ­­ I disagree, let me just explain why. I understand that you take the ­­ you have the opposite view. If a private person sues us, the fact that we have a contract with that ­­ that individual State government does not strip a State court of jurisdiction over their private suit. So that's our view of it. But ­­",
  "But Justice Kagan, for the other side to win, what they have ­­ their premise is that the consensual relationship exists in simply the activity with the individual tribal member, not the contract. Remember, their point is that a contract is irrelevant. So the consent would exist simply by operating the business. But in all events, it is the case that we could insist on a contract; they can insist on a contract. My point to Justice Breyer was simply that the upshot of our position still leaves enormous room for the exercise of tribal sovereignty. They do have this power. Remember that the data before you from the United States indicates that this is a very small proportion of cases that the tribal courts adjudicate. The data from this Tribe indicates that it's 1 percent of cases.",
  "They do have a lot to do with the fact that it's a private claim. Let me distinguish, importantly, actions by the Tribe itself. And the analogy here is that when a State sues a noncitizen, that is an act of the sovereign and it is not removable, because what Montana is concerned with, what this Court's precedents are concerned with, is the exercise of sovereign authority in the pursuit of self­governance. This is not a sovereign action. This is a private suit between two individuals, and so it is important that if the Tribe is exercising its sovereign authority, bringing a civil enforcement action against us, for example, that would have presented ­­ present a very different question, because it would be sovereignty. It has never been understood that ­­",
  "Well, we think that's an impossibility. Remember that the other side's explanation ­­ although there aren't any citations; it's hard to know what the tort law is ­­ the other side's explanation is that tort law of the Tribe tracks Mississippi tort law, and there isn't a situation in which the Tribe could bring such an action. And I think if it was a parens patriae action, we would still regard it as in the interest of the individual. I'm thinking instead, Justice Ginsburg, of take the follow­on to what Montana describes, that is, a licensing regulation or a taxation regulation. We believe that if the Tribe went into tribal court to enforce those measures, that would be a sovereign action and it would be susceptible of the Montana exception. The difference is when the Tribe is not a party here. We don't deny that there is some sovereign interest. Okay. There is some sovereign interest in this adjudication.",
  "If that were our argument, it would be an odd one. What we say is that you have a very different regime. If you have a legal regime that said here is a duty towards our noncitizen, our ­­ our tribal members or just individuals on the Reservation, and if you violate that, here are a set of fines, you will be excluded from the Reservation, then that would be an act of the sovereign. So our point isn't just it's the nature of this ­­ you know, this is a very serious allegation that we take very seriously about a minor child, a member of the Tribe. I am not demeaning that in any way and saying, well, that's less important than taxation or a hunting license. Not at all. My point is that you are being asked that at the time the Tribes came into the United States, was a private suit against a nonmember regarded as an incidence of sovereignty, could the Congress of the United States, when the States didn't have this authority, when the Constitution didn't contemplate they would, have really believed that the Tribes could?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "We think not, and let me explain the reason. That would be State action. You know, the Federal government would be passing a law essentially shunting the jurisdiction over an individual's matter into another adjudicative system.",
  "Justice Kennedy, if I have suggested that Congress could do that, I apologize. It wasn't my intention.",
  "The limits are due process, and that is that if you ­­ and the reason that due process applies here is that the tribe of judgment ­­ we've switched to the civil context now in your newest hypothetical. If the Tribe's judgment would presumably be enforceable in the courts of the United States or of a State, there would be State action then, and it would violate the principle of due process. It also ­­",
  "That's unconstitutional because Congress is subject to the Constitution. It would violate the Supremacy Clause; it would violate Article III, which contemplate ­­ sorry.",
  "Justice Kennedy, we agree with you that there's ­­",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "We do ­­ okay. Justice Kennedy, we do make the argument you're describing. I apologize. I misunderstood your point. It's my fault. We say that there is a significant constitutional avoidance argument ­­ that's how we describe it ­­ in concluding to ­­ for concluding that Montana does not apply here because of the very serious prospects that there would be a loss of property without due process of laws because the tribes would have just what you've described. This plaintiff has sued us for multiple millions of dollars in punitive damages. We do not have the guarantees provided by the Constitution, and we do not have review in this Court.",
  "I agree.",
  "Or the Triple A.",
  "That's the second point I made, Justice Kennedy. We have the procedural due process question, but also the Article III question, and that is this is the Supreme Court of the land. The Supremacy Clause says that the Constitution will be the supreme law throughout the land, and Congress could not take cases in the United States and assign them to the UN or the Triple A or anybody else. We absolutely agree with that.",
  "The following. The first is ­­ and this case is an illustration of it ­­ those claims that are subject to the contract that allow the individual or the business to come on to the Reservation. We acceded, quite expressly, to jurisdiction over disputes arising from the lease. The second is when the Tribe itself, in the exercise of its sovereign authority, brings the action, so long as it's consistent with principles of due process, we think that would be much more consistent with Montana ­­",
  "The examples that I gave before are that enforcing a taxation rule, enforcing a licensing rule. Also importantly, the Tribe has the self­help remedy of exclusion from the Reservation. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you. I have three points, and they all happen to relate to questions by Justice Scalia. The first deals with the question of whether tribal tort law, the last point by my friend, is a form of regulation. And we have cases like Regal, we have the preemption context in which the Court has said something like that. But the big difference is that that is about the substance of the tort law, not the forum where it occurs. Imagine a case like Regal. We would say that the application of State tort law was a form of regulation. But if that was heard in a Federal district court, on removal, on ­­ in diversity jurisdiction, or on a Federal question, it would still be State regulation. So my point here is: The most that can establish is that the substantive tort law's regulation, not the forum. We do not agree that that's so, but it would be the only thing that they could get from that argument. What would remain is the difference of adjudication from the substance of the tort law. The second point, as Justice Scalia, I will line up my friend's committee reports against the text of the Constitution. We do not have an answer to the fact that our constitutional tradition has three points in it that are inconsistent with this form of adjudication. And two of them are not specific to the States. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land in the United States. This Court is the Supreme Court of the United States. That's not true just with respect to the States, that is a bedrock ­­ those are bedrock principles. Neither of them are true here. We also think that our tradition is that you have access to a neutral court. I understand; I accept that Congress implemented that in a removal statute that does not apply here. But my point is that Congress could not have understood that it was a necessary incident of sovereignty when the States were subject to removal jurisdiction at the time the tribes came into the United States. It is historically implausible to believe that in all three of these respects, when the tribes came into the United States, they were in a superior position to the States. And we know that from one other example, and that is also at the time ­­ so these are the judiciary acts of 1789 and '90, Congress made the judgments of State courts enforceable by full faith and credit, but not tribal courts. And it cannot be, then, that it thought the tribal courts were better than the State courts. And it does relate, Mr. Chief Justice, to your point that the Court has never held, despite dictum, that a nonmember is subject to adjudication in a tribal court. Because if you haven't done it till now, it is, I think, respectfully implausible to believe that Congress thought it was true in 1880, at a time when the tribes had much less developed legal systems. My final point is ­­ relates to administrability. And you have been offered two alternatives. The other side says we have a test about nexus and foreseeability. I have a standard that says, write it down in a contract. My rule is infinitely more administrable because the other side imagines that people will constantly be running to State and Federal court saying this nexus wasn't strong enough; I didn't know when I mailed this to the Tribe, or this form of tribal tort law is not quite foreseeable enough for me to know what the rule is. That is a bad system. You have said, time and again, that jurisdictional rules need to be known ahead of time, and they need to be clear. And I don't understand the answer to our point that it is disrespectful of the sovereignty that is asserted here. If the Tribal Supreme Court can constantly be overruled by a circuit court in Mississippi, are we seriously treating it as an independent sovereign? That ­­",
  "Okay. Justice Sotomayor, I do not want to give up on our broader argument that Montana's first exception doesn't apply here. But our position is consistent with the fact that this is a question, as my friends have emphasized, of State sovereignty. And when the sovereign brings an action, it is much easier to understand that that is an exercise of self government and sovereignty than a private tort suit between two people. In addition, we have ­­",
  "Justice Sotomayor ­­",
  "Justice Sotomayor, because my time has expired, I will be brief. The difference is the dependent sovereignty of the Indian tribes and the fact that individuals have the protections of the Constitution. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The doctrinal fight in the briefing is over whether the plaintiff in a case like this has to assert a constitutional right. And I think the questions so far have indicated an understanding that the plaintiff would have to. And the real question, then, is, is there actually a constitutional right here, one that we might define in other terms, including the one that Justice Kennedy identified as the right not to have your political views inquired in. And this is actually discussed in the Court's opinion in O'Hare in describing Elrod and Branti. And so I want to start there because we have to recognize that this right has never been recognized in any other political association case whatsoever. And there's no logical reason why it would occur specifically in the public employment context, which is an unconstitutional ­­",
  "I'm sorry. I have to focus on, really, the precise wording of your hypothetical, but I think you may actually have something slightly different in mind, because you identify this, the second employee, one who is politically neutral. And the Court has said, in cases like Elrod and Branti, that the decision to remain neutral ­­ that is, I see this candidate, I see that candidate. I'm going to just not choose between them, because I ­­ you know, for any individual reason, that that's protected. That's a political choice. And in your precise hypothetical, both of those employees would have a claim. This case is different, and critically different. The other side has quite consciously, throughout the case, made only two arguments. The first is that he was a supporter of Spagnola. And he's given up on that. And the second is that he had no association whatsoever. He didn't have any more association than I did. He was politically oblivious.

And that is entirely the point of Elrod and Branti.",
  "No, sir.",
  "Right.",
  "My point, Justice Kennedy, is that he may have a State law right; he does have a collective bargaining agreement right, but he doesn't have a First Amendment right, because he's not engaging in First Amendment­protected activity. I do ­­",
  "Sorry.",
  "No ­­ Justice Kennedy, and that ­­ that brings us back to your question. And that is does he have a right not to have an inquiry into his political views. And that is, of course, not a right that's been recognized in any other political association context. When the Court discussed it in O'Hare, it did it in a very specific and really important way, and that is it looked at cases like Elrod and Branti, which are general policies. And what the Court has said there, is that when it's a sweeping policy, it's not necessary into ­­ to inquire into individual political beliefs. And what those cases ought to be understood as is applications of First Amendment overbreadth doctrine. It is commonplace in First Amendment law that if you have a general rule, and the general rule will be unconstitutional as applied to some people, and the other people involved weren't asserting First Amendment rights, the policy can be facially unconstitutional, and we don't inquire into the individual standing of the plaintiff. And that's what happens in Elrod and Branti. It's not necessary to inquire into the ­­ each individual employee. It is an entirely different ­­",
  "And we just disagree. It's called an individual right, not a government wrong.

There is no First Amendment right not to have this individual inquiry. And Justice Kennedy, remember that our position, in particular ­­",
  "No. It's a very important distinction. So let me give a hypothetical that ought to be hard for us, and that is Heffernan is asked by the chief of police, you know, do you support the mayor. He's completely agnostic, and he refuses to support the mayor, and he's transferred. The decision not to support or to be subjected to your hypothetical is a political choice. This case was framed by the plaintiff in a very specific way on purpose, and that is he disclaimed any such influence, any such pressure, any such choice that he was having to make. Now, the important piece about ­­ on this question of inquiry is that our position only applies to a party that doesn't claim anything other than being politically apathetic. So Justice Kennedy, there is no inquiry. Justice Kagan is quite right that if you have somebody who is an Independent or a Democrat or Republican, the First Amendment doesn't care. But if the plaintiff is going to pursue a claim that says I'm not engaged in association or speech, there is nothing to inquire into ­­",

  "So ­­",
  "Well, it will not surprise you that I agree, Justice Scalia. The ­­ Justice Kagan, if ­­ if we could just take this outside the public employment context. And the reason I want to do that is that we ought to be able to agree that the First Amendment rights aren't greater association of rights there. The Court has pointed out that there is a greater Federalism interest in managing the public employment workforce, and also that this is an unconstitutional conditions case. But just imagine the following simple ­­ you know, hypotheticals that relate just to this case. Imagine that the chief of police, with the same motivation, went up to Heffernan as he went to pick up the sign, grabbed the sign, and tore it up. Or imagine that Heffernan was trying ­­ was stopped from entering a parade in favor of Spagnola, but what he was actually trying to do was just cross the street.

Those are all the exact same motivation. And there ­­ I don't think there's any way the Court would recognize such a claim. It's a very sympathetic claim. Okay?

  "He has two forms of relief. The first is the collective bargaining agreement. I will tell you that it is not in the record, but it is judicially noticeable. It is a public document.

It says that if you are ­­ you have an employment action that is inequitable, it is ­­ you ­­ it is grievable. The second thing is the attempt provision, which was discussed, and Justice Alito is right, that there are broader civil rights under New Jersey law. And this just makes sense.

But what we're talking about here in the context in which there is a real concern that I would like to talk about, about whether it will interfere with the management of local government, that it's an affirmative constitutional right, it's a violation of the First Amendment. Now the reason you ought to be concerned, Justice Kennedy, is there is another side of the coin. Take it from the perspective of the supervisor. If this right is recognized, which is to say the plaintiff need not have engaged in any association, then the supervisor's expression of political views may well be chilled because he has to worry that any employee can say, look, I was regarded as politically active. If I could just give you this case again, and that is, take the sign out of it. The plaintiff says he was well known as a Spagnola friend and supporter. Okay? Imagine that that's discussed in the chief of police's office, but the chief of police thinks that ­­ that Heffernan really should be transferred. Okay? The chief ­­ if the Petitioner is right, he really has to worry because if it's discussed, then there's every reason that Heffernan can just bring a lawsuit saying, look, I wasn't actually involved in the campaign, but you did it because he was my friend.

  "Justice Kennedy, that's right. The government thinks a lot of things about me, okay? Some of them are not very nice, I imagine, but ­­ and some are about my politics and that sort of thing.

  "Okay. Or to act, Justice Kennedy.",
  "Oh.",
  "Just ­­",
  "Well, essentially all of the rights, individual rights in the Constitution, other than the antislavery provision, requires State action. They all talk about what the government can't do. But the government ­­",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me just say that I don't think it's ­­ it's contested after the Petitioner's reply brief. You described this in First Amendment terms, that if this was a speech case, which it used to be, rather than an association case, he would lose. It is well settled in this Court's precedents that the threshold inquiry under Pickering is did the individual engage in the constitutionally protected activity? This actually is at issue, I should say, in the Court's other associational case, public employment association case, this sitting, where there is a significant issue of is there a different rule that applies ­­ when we're talking about a policy, Justice Kennedy ­­ that applies broadly to a lot of employees versus an individual, one­off employment action which is what is at issue here? We think that's a critically important distinction, whether you look at this as kind of a Pickering standard case, where the first thing that has to happen is that the individual has to assert at least that they engaged in the constitutionally protected activity. If you have an Elrod and Branti­type case, which is what's discussed in that part of O'Hare, it's an entirely different kettle of fish because there, you do have a general policy. You could see people being chilled. You could see the government taking a broad view of its employees.",
  "Justice Kagan, that's, of course, not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that under First Amendment Overbreadth Doctrine, when you have a general policy ­­ and this is what we think happened in Elrod and Branti ­­ the fact that you don't ­­ you do not inquire into the individual person's political views because the policy is facially unconstitutional. But it has never been the case in any context. And the other side has had every opportunity in the world. We cannot find any First Amendment case that says, you know what? You don't have to engage in constitutionally protected activity so long as the government thinks you did. And it's really a problem if that's the rule because it is the threshold thing that stops plaintiffs with meritless cases from getting out of the box. In all of these cases, if the plaintiff no longer has to say, I engaged in ­­",
  "That will ­­ two things. First, I think it is practically impossible because you would have to somehow magically pluck out the people who are politically apathetic from those that are politically neutral. I just don't think you can do it. But the second is that's right. The Constitution doesn't fix everything.",
  "Justice Kennedy, I think that that is not a First Amendment violation. I don't think the other side thinks it's a First Amendment violation. Remember that there's the materiality requirement.",
  "Justice Kagan, I think you are right. It is an important thread of this Court's decisions. And the Court has said that it is a necessary but not sufficient condition. Waters makes very clear, which is a First Amendment public employee case, that the individual has to have engaged in the constitutionally protected activity. Every one of ­­ Garcetti says the same thing. You have to have an individual ­­",
  "What would the attempt ­­",
  "The Court ­­",
  "No.",
  "Justice Breyer, the reason that we allow ­­",
  "If it's only going to be an attempt and it's not going to succeed, no. The statute you describe is unconstitutional.",
  "That's right. There are all kinds of times ­­",
  "If it's defined, Justice Breyer, as not going to succeed, if the statute doesn't say ­­",
  "Oh, no, Justice Breyer. If the person ­­",
  "I know. I'm just ­­ I'm just trying to keep up with it. The ­­ in ­­ in the one that you just described, Justice Breyer, if it is the case that the law is going to go into effect, we do allow, including under First Amendment overbreadth grounds, an effort to bring a declaratory judgment action.",
  "It doesn't.",
  "And here would be an example.",
  "If I could just finish, Justice Breyer, just so ­­ I really do want to help. If Congress at the same time passed a law that said no Federal funds shall be used to implement the ban on talking about the political views of Ruritania, that is to say the law won't go into effect ­­ we tried, but the money was taken away from us ­­ it's not unconstitutional.",
  "There would not be. But in my hypothetical vote in which ­­ or Justice Breyer's where it actually goes into effect ­­",
  "More than a policy, it will actually have adverse consequences for someone trying to exercise their constitutional rights.",
  "Yeah.",
  "Justice ­­",
  "Sorry.",
  "No. No. Common sense does not leave the courthouse, and that is if I have a policy that says, I will not hire Democrats, I think a court would understand that there are going to be Democrats who would apply for jobs. And there doesn't need to be an inquiry. But the ­­",
  "No. It's a real ­­",
  "Justice ­­",
  "I think it's a really important point on the question of chilling because Elrod and Branti and the rules that also ­­ and O'Hare, which is a one­off case, do say that you can't do this for political purposes if the person is actually exercising a constitutional right. So that we all agree that if the plaintiff here was a supporter of Spagnola, or even of the mayor, or had decided to remain politically neutral, this is a bizarre case that comes to you on the assumption that he is completely politically apathetic.",
  "No, but I ­­ I ­­",
  "No. But I do think that there is a concern that comes into play. And so I do not mean to demean the concern about the government having a sense of what individuals' political views are. But I'm saying that that happens, Your Honors, in all kinds of cases, whether it's redistricting, whether it's campaign finance. There's lots that we do to ascribe political views to people in this country. And adopting that doctrine is going to have pretty widespread consequences when it's not necessary. I do think that it should be common ground that there are multiple layers of protections for these employees. The basic rule ­­ and Justice Kennedy, remember, under the basic rule, the plaintiff has always come in and said, I'm a Democrat, right? The Elrod Branti rule when it's involved, one­off cases. The opinion in O'Hare describes the political views of the tow truck company there. And it has never been regarded as a First Amendment problem when you don't actually exercise any First Amendment rights.",
  "It's not true of the Constitution.",
  "Well ­­",
  "Under ­­",
  "Great. Justice Breyer ­­ and if you would just contrast in your own mind the statute that affects millions of people versus the beat cop who talks to one person in terms of its chilling effect, because First Amendment overbreadth doctrine was born because of your hypothetical. The concern that a broad policy or statute will have widespread effects. That is not anything like this. We have a guide ­­",
  "To the contrary, I can tell you that in ­­ in both Waters and Garcetti v. Ceballos, the Court said, look, we recognize the rule that's being proposed to us. So in Waters it was the idea that the public ­­ the employer's views wouldn't matter; it would just be whether the speech was protected. In Garcetti it was the question of whether it was the public employer's speech. And the public employee's argument in both those cases is that, look, these rules are going to chill speech because they are of uncertain boundaries. We need to have wide­ranging expression. If I have to bring my case, there will be inquiries into my speech views or whatever, and the Court said we just have to balance things here. There is a real concern that is rooted in a history of the United States involving political patronage. We have ­­ the Court has never tried to extinguish politics from local government. And if you try to do that in New Jersey, we are going to be here a lot.",
  "I agree.",
  "All right. So Justice Alito, the Third Circuit has a rule discussed in the brief ­­ brief in opposition adopted in a case called Ghaly that says you do have the right to be politically apathetic. The reason the case is so bizarre is that the other side, for its own reasons, decided not to assert that right. Now, I will say that it does nonetheless matter because there are going to be other kinds of cases where you have a public employee that just is not asserting any rights at all, and is not involved, say, in environmentalism or gun rights or whatever. And the public employer, if it's thought just to have perceived the employee as having been involved in some association, then is subject to a claim. And our real ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor ­­",
  "Right.",
  "I would just take you back to my hypothetical of getting rid of the sign. And his political view ­­ his support of Spagnola is discussed in ­­ in the chief's office, right? And then he has to be reassigned. And the chief has to really worry that he's going to be sued. The ­­ my point is this: The set of cases that you have to be concerned with, there have been no other cases we've been able to identify like this one. It's very small.",
  "But the downside risk is significant.",
  "It ­­ it may be that I have not persuaded you in this case.",
  "The ­­ the ­­ I will say, Justice Kagan, what you ask is, can the government do it? The government cannot because there are lots of other protections. And remember, if the person is politically neutral, it is the case that ­­ the right of political association is the right of political association. If you aren't engaging it, you aren't actively pursuing the right in any way, or even if you aren't active about it."
