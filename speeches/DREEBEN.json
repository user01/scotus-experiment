  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A video poker license is property both in the hands of the State and in the hands of the licensee. Petitioner's scheme therefore violates both the first and the second clauses of the mail fraud statute. I'll address first why a video poker license is property in the hands of the State. A video poker license represents the State's right to a stream of payments from an enormously lucrative business, a business that the State has absolute power to conduct itself. Instead of conducting the business itself, the State franchises that opportunity to private individuals while asserting control over every aspect of the business and retaining a right to a large share of the revenues. By --",
  "Justice Souter, I would agree that if there were a direct fraud at money or property of the State in a tangible form or in a financial form, that would be an easier case than this one. This case, I suggest the best way to look at it is to start from the premise that the State is to be treated as any property owner under the mail fraud statute. It is to be no less and no more protected than a private individual similarly situated, and to understand how the State loses property, you have to compare the State to a similarly situated private individual. Now, the two analogies that most readily show how the State loses an intangible property right are a private franchise business, which has the right to exercise franchises and grant franchises to private parties, and has a contract right not to be defrauded in choosing the franchisees that it chooses.",
  "Well, it's not a metaphysical property right. It is an intangible property right, and under this Court's decision in Carpenter v. United States, intangible property rights are just as protected as tangible ones. Now, the way that an intangible property right is identified is by looking at the legal scheme that creates those rights, and Louisiana created a legal scheme under which it has the exclusive right to determine who may engage in the video poker business.",
  "It is both a regulatory and a proprietary interest.",
  "No, because I would define the State's property interest more broadly than simply the actual currency that is received under the license.",
  "No. We didn't charge or attempt to prove that the State lost revenue and, in fact, Louisiana connects the gambling, the video poker terminals to a central computer to ensure that skimming of revenues does not occur.",
  "No, I think we are talking about a property interest that in the private sector would clearly be recognized as such. It would be analogizeable most closely to a contract interest of a party that runs a franchise business and selects its own franchisees, and if it is lied to by the franchisees, it is defrauded in it's act of letting a contract to that franchise holder.",
  "That is true, but under the mail fraud statute we do not.",
  "I think that the analogy is an analogy which attempts to compare the State to a private party, and the difference is that the State can always be said in some sense to be acting as a regulator.",
  "No. There were no money damages in the Wall Street Journal case at all, because all the Wall Street Journal lost was its exclusive right to determine when to publish certain columns, and Winans and Carpenter were accused in that case of having taken from the Journal their right, the Journal's right to decide when to disclose the contents of that column. It was highly intangible. It's an interest only created by law, and by direct analogy here the interest that is created is Louisiana's interest in deciding which proprietary parties will work with it in the video poker --",
  "Under the Louisiana law, the answer is no.",
  "Under Louisiana law --",
  "-- I don't believe that the State has that authority.",
  "Well, it would be --",
  "The State --",
  "I mean, that's your analogy.",
  "The State could choose to operate in precisely that manner. The State could have --",
  "But I think --",
  "Justice Breyer, I agree with you that the State has not assigned to itself the right to sell video poker licenses.",
  "No, I don't see any reason --",
  "Under its own statute, but if you're looking at the legal rights that it has invested in itself, it is as if Louisiana has made the State the exclusive holder and determiner of who may participate in the video poker industry with a substantial revenue share being assigned back to the State. The State could have done the exact same thing in a different manner. It could have said, you, the State, shall select someone who will choose all these State franchise holders who will do the video poker business and it could have sold that interest, could have said, a private party can take over the role of deciding who gets a license and collect all the money and give some of the money back to the State, but it did not do that. Instead, it retained those legal rights in itself, and those legal rights would have been viewed as property had a private property holder exercised them.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, it spreads only to those licenses and those State activities that are generically speaking more in a proprietary mold than in a regulatory mold, and there is a classification question that arises. Both liquor licenses and taxi medallions share some features with the Louisiana scheme and, therefore, arguably both of those would fall on the property side of the equation.",
  "Our position is that a purely regulatory license, such as a license to practice medicine, or a driver's license, is not encompassed within this theory of property, but a license, or a regulatory proprietary scheme such as a franchise scheme, or a license that is very closely linked in the revenue stream that goes back to the State and in the regulatory component is.",
  "I think that they do under a strict analytical approach, but I also think that there is a component to the analysis that is narrower than assuming that all such licenses fall within the scope of the mail fraud statute, and --",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Well, I think if there was no linkage between the taxation and the licensing scheme, then it's harder to say that the State is acting in a proprietary than in a regulatory --",
  "It's not itself sufficient, but in combination with a scheme such as this, that creates in the State the power to participate in a particular industry, and to select, in effect, the participants in the industry, the agents who will carry out the work, the State has acted in a way that far more closely resembles a franchise business than it does a pure, sovereign regulator, and that is the question that has to be asked under the mail fraud statute.",
  "No, Justice --",
  "Correct.",
  "Yes, I do. It is our alternative theory of why --",
  "Well, the Court has discretion to address it. It certainly isn't required to address it. We did not argue it below. But I will say that in favor of the Court addressing it and resolving it is that it is a purely legal argument that the Government made in McNally, that the Court did not squarely address in McNally for a variety of --",
  "Well, there is language in McNally, without doubt, that reads that way, but that language could not have announced a holding in McNally, because the actual holding of McNally was, in addition to the well-known part of McNally that an intangible right to good government is not a property right, the Court also held that there was no deception of the State and there were no false statements made to any third party, so there was no factual predicate in McNally itself for deciding whether the second clause applies.",
  "I agree, Mr. Chief Justice, particularly --",
  "Well, there is --",
  "Well, there is actually no discussion in the opinion itself of the theory that the Government raised that the false statements alone, when the defendant obtains property, are sufficient.",
  "Well, as I said, Justice Scalia, there -- the square holdings of McNally did not require the Court to come to a definitive answer to it, and if you read the McNally opinion, which is fairly brief, it doesn't identify and reject in terms this theory. What the McNally opinion does do is point out that the second clause of the statute, which was added in 1909, has the effect of codifying this Court's decision in Durland v. United States, which held that --",
  "-- false promises come within the mail fraud statute.",
  "No, it's not contrary to it. I think that the amendment did more than that. It clearly at least codifies Durland. There's no question about that. But the plain language of the statute does not require that there be a deprivation of property.",
  "It would not have produced a different result in McNally, Justice Scalia, because the Court made quite clear in footnote 9 of its opinion that there was no deception of the State at all. The Government's theory in McNally was that State officeholders who have an adverse interest to the State are required to disclose it to the State, and this Court said in footnote 9 of McNally that we should not assume that there was any such duty of disclosure, and without a duty of disclosure, there could have been no fraud that would have triggered the second clause of the statute.",
  "The Court could have decided the case based on that analysis, but it decided it on a broader analysis, which is --",
  "Footnote 9.",
  "What I think is evident from McNally is that the Court at various points in the opinion wrote broadly about the mail fraud statute. But there is a distinct theory of liability that we briefed before this Court in McNally and that was not addressed in terms, and I think that there is an explanation for why that theory was not addressed, which is that there were no false representations to anybody that were charged in the jury instructions that could have supported that theory.",
  "Well, I don't want to speak to Richard in the Survivors, since --",
  "-- we haven't charged that case and I'm not familiar with it.",
  "But as far as the breadth of the theory, it is a broad theory. I'm not sure, Justice Breyer, whether it covers all of the hypotheticals in your question, but it is a broader theory than the license as a proprietary activity theory, because it would apply whenever an individual lies for the purpose of obtaining property --",
  "I don't think so.",
  "No. I think there is a materiality component in the mail fraud statute that this Court described in Neder v. United States --",
  "I haven't tried to frame this as an application that would sweep in routine commercial conduct.",
  "No, Justice Ginsburg, but in this particular case what the defendant did was lie to the State, concealing adverse facts about his background in order to obtain a valuable license, which --",
  "That is true.",
  "That is true, and there is yet another theory of the mail fraud statute which we have not raised in this case and we haven't briefed in this case, which holds that lying to, for example, the State in order to obtain a regulatory approval that will then allow someone to obtain money from a third party fits within even the first clause of the mail fraud statute.",
  "I think, Justice Ginsburg, that Congress has attempted to speak very clearly and comprehensively in the mail fraud statute. When this Court ruled in McNally that it did not apply to the intangible right to honest services, Congress came back and amended the statute to make clear that it did want the Federal Government in that line of business.",
  "I don't suggest that it does, Justice Scalia.",
  "Even taking the Court's own holding in McNally, the Court's holding is that the State is not to be less favored than a private party insofar as it's a property holder. It's to be treated on the same footing if the defendant uses a Federal jurisdictional means which subjects him to a Federal regulatory system, and there are lots and lots of defendants who make false statements to Governments in connection with obtaining money or property or even defrauding a State of tax revenue, which some people might think are quintessential things for the States to handle all on their own.",
  "Well, the elements of the two statutes are different, and there are many applications where 1001 would fit where we wouldn't necessarily be able to establish a scheme to defraud under the mail fraud statute, so the --",
  "Well, you'd -- under our second theory, we do not need to show that there is an intent to deprive the State or the Federal Government of a property interest, whereas --",
  "In some ways it's broader, and in some ways it's narrower.",
  "Well, mail fraud requires a use of the jurisdictional means that you have mail fraud, and it also under the scheme to -- you need to have proof of the mails in other words, which is not true for 1001. 1001 involves any Federal agency, any false statement in a matter within the Federal agency's jurisdiction, and it need not involve any money or property loss or gain. So the two statutes have a substantially different sweep.",
  "Correct. Correct.",
  "That may be true, and there's also an intent element, though, in the mail fraud statute of an intent to defraud, which is not present in the 1001. 1001 simply applies to a knowing false statement within the jurisdiction of a Federal agency.",
  "To the State?",
  "Well, certainly the second clause as we have construed it would apply in such a case, because the employment applicant seeks employment.",
  "A misstatement that is intended to result in a greater tax --",
  "Yes. But Justice Scalia, that would be covered under anybody's interpretation of the mail fraud statute, because it's a scheme to acquire money or property that should belong to the State, and that's fundamentally --",
  "No, the State has a right to --",
  "I think that I read the statute broadly in respect of money or property losses to the State, and apply it in a way that makes it congruent with what a private party would be subjected to.",
  "The trial judge combined the first clause and the second clause of the statute which were charged in the indictment. He combined them by saying a scheme to defraud by making false or fraudulent representations to the State.",
  "He did, but a jury that found guilt on those instructions necessarily found that the object of the scheme was to make false statements to the State to obtain the license and, indeed, the charged mailings were the mailings of the license to the defendants.",
  "It's exactly included within what the jury had to find in order to render the conviction on the instructions that were given.",
  "There are no guidelines beyond the legal requirements for charging mail fraud that are given to Federal prosecutors.",
  "In theory. In theory, Justice Ginsburg. I would also say that under the property prong of mail fraud individual prosecutors have discretion on what level of case they are going to bring, and the competing obligations and case loads of Federal prosecutors tend to send those cases to the wayside, but there are small cases brought even where the State is defrauded of a relatively small amount of property. And one of the reasons why that is is because frauds against the State often involve State actors in collusion with the private parties, and the Federal Government there serves a very valuable role in coming in and being able to prosecute when the States themselves seem to be less able to do so, and this case itself had a corruption component in it involving charges against State Senators, which the jury ended up rejecting, but there was a reason why the Federal Government was involved in this case in the beginning.",
  "I think the people of the State of Louisiana are actually benefited by having the Federal Government available as a supplementary prosecutorial tool. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We agree with petitioner that the Seventh Circuit erred in adopting a significant difference test for measuring the prejudice inquiry under Strickland v. Washington. We believe, however, that the judgment in this case is correct, because petitioner's counsel at trial and direct appeal neither rendered deficient performance nor gave rise to prejudice.",
  "Justice O'Connor, at the stage when we responded to the petition, we told the Court that we thought the judgment was correct. We did not defend the rationale of the Seventh Circuit and, in fact, indicated that the Seventh Circuit might wish to reconsider it in light of this Court's intervening decision in Williams v. Taylor and a Fifth Circuit decision that had criticized it, but we had not formally concluded our analysis of whether at the end of the day we would or would not defend the approach that the Seventh Circuit adopted at the time we filed our response to the certiorari position. After we told the Court not to grant the case, and the Court disagreed and granted it, we then undertook a complete analytical review of the Seventh Circuit's approach and concluded that we could not submit that this Court could affirm that approach consistent with its own cases and principles governing the ineffective assistance analysis, but we continued to believe that the judgment in this case as rendered by the Seventh Circuit was correct on alternative bases.",
  "I agree, Justice O'Connor, that the sentencing guidelines question and the intricacies related to whether money laundering should be grouped with the underlying offense are both complicated and the kind of issue that this Court would ordinarily properly leave to the Sentencing Commission to resolve, particularly since the Sentencing Commission is aware of it. We presented that analysis on the prejudice prong of the case in order to illustrate how very complicated the guidelines decisions that counsel faces are when deciding whether to raise a particular claim or not to raise a particular claim. These are intricate matters that are quite complex in Federal criminal law, and more complex than most decisions that counsel has to make, and it is therefore highly relevant to what this Court says, if anything, about the proper analysis and performance when counsel is charged with having failed to raise a sentencing guidelines claim that the client later believes that he should have raised. The Seventh Circuit --",
  "That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice. The fundamental point that the Seventh Circuit was trying to make in adopting its significant difference test was that there are a multitude of guidelines questions that confront counsel who is handling a sentence or a sentencing guidelines question on appeal, and that if it were the case that any guidelines error could support collateral relief, the defendant would often get the chance for two full bites at the apple at sentencing questions, first at trial and on direct appeal, and second on collateral review, and --",
  "I quite agree, Justice Breyer, and my point is that the considerations that drove the Seventh Circuit to adopt its rule on prejudice are actually far more pertinent to analyzing the performance prong. Sentencing guidelines claims, as the Court knows, are not only complex but can have unpredictable outcomes, and can --",
  "I think, Justice Ginsburg, the reason why it is relevant for the Court to say something about the performance issue, which was not addressed squarely by the Seventh Circuit -- we did argue it in the district court and the district court didn't address it either, so it has not been resolved by the courts below, but it is highly interrelated with the prejudice inquiry in a sentencing guidelines ineffective assistance collateral attack, and the point that the Seventh Circuit was trying to make was to give courts a way to weed out these collateral attacks in an efficient way.",
  "I agree that the Seventh Circuit hasn't resolved it, but this Court is going to announce a decision that will be influential in the way that the lower courts address comparable sentencing guidelines ineffective assistance of counsel cases, and I think that it would be useful for the lower courts to have some guidance from this Court as to some of the relevant considerations and factors that ought to be brought to bear on the performance inquiry.",
  "Well, I hope they're not bizarre, but I do think that the arguments that we've made have gone a little bit beyond what you, Justice Scalia, have just accurately described as where this Court has thus far gone in analyzing the performance inquiry. Clearly, counsel has to be selective in raising the issues that it chooses to present to an appellate court especially, and clearly, as this Court stated in Smith v. Robbins last term, just because a claim might look good in hindsight doesn't mean that it's the kind of claim that counsel should be deemed obligated to have raised. But there is a unique feature to the sentencing guidelines claims, as well as a generally relevant point to appellate advocacy that I think the Court could do well to clarify. In these sentencing guidelines claims, there can often be ambiguity about whether a particular claim will indeed help the defendant when it is raised on appeal and prevails and, if so, by how much. In this case, most starkly, our view is that if petitioner got the grouping that he asked for, his offense level should actually go up, not down, because the grouping would have required that all of the financial harm that he inflicted on the various victims be aggregated into one group, so a counsel who was looking at a sentencing guidelines claim, unlike claims that would simply result in a reversal of a conviction, has to be cognizant that there can be unintended adverse effects. In addition, and this was the insight that I think the Seventh Circuit was most concerned with, sentencing guidelines claims can produce sometimes only very modest benefits, and the length of the benefit that would be produced is a relevant factor in considering whether reasonable counsel would elect to raise a relatively long-shot claim, or a claim that's not established.",
  "Correct, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "I'm here seeking to affirm the judgment, and if I can't affirm the judgment, at least get some guidance that would be useful to the lower courts that have been grappling with this problem. Now, petitioner has, of course, pointed out that it is unusual for the Court to go beyond the scope of the question presented and address grounds that were not decided below and the Government, of course, fully agrees with that. We recognize that it's unusual. It's certainly not unprecedented for the Court to decide a case on grounds that weren't decided by the lower court or that were not fully addressed.",
  "I would call it giving guidance, Mr. Justice Stevens.",
  "The Court similarly believed that it was appropriate to give guidance to the lower courts by showing how the rule of law applies to the particular facts in Brook Group v. Brown & Williamson, a 1993 decision where the Court took a novel antitrust principle and then applied it to the very intricate and specific facts of that case. In Siegert v. Gilley, a 1991 decision, the Court actually affirmed the judgment on a ground that the lower court had not reached at all. There, the lower court had said there was a heightened pleading requirement for qualified immunity. This Court decided the case on the grounds that there was no underlying constitutional right that was asserted in the Bivens action at all, and in that case not only was that not the question presented, but the parties hadn't even briefed it or addressed it. So --",
  "I do have a hard time saying it's logically antecedent, but the third case that I would refer the Court to involves the elaboration of the additional implications of a claim that the court decided. That is Colstad v. American Dental Association, which was decided in 1999, and there the Court elaborated a standard for punitive damages in Title VII actions and then went on to give guidance to the lower courts about how agency principles apply, but then remanded --",
  "I am relying on the majority's disposition in the case.",
  "The Seventh Circuit obviously could resolve these issues, and if this Court chooses to give the guidance that we think is appropriate, it will help the overall administration of the judicial system, because we believe, on the one hand, that when a defendant has not had adequate assistance of counsel, constitutionally effective assistance of counsel in litigating the sentencing guidelines claims, and he can show a reasonable probability of a different outcome, then he has satisfied the elements of a constitutional claim.",
  "I think --",
  "I think that the Court could --",
  "That's perhaps why the Sentencing Commission is going to clarify this. I think it's also perhaps why counsel should not be quickly branded ineffective.",
  "No. I actually would like the Court to say that the Seventh Circuit applied the incorrect test for prejudice, but a properly analyzed performance and prejudice inquiry would produce the conclusion that petitioner's counsel is wrong. That would be my first choice. My second choice is for the Court to do no harm to the arguments that I'm making about ineffective assistance, and that those are really the only two choices that I'd like to submit to the Court at present.",
  "No, Mr. Chief Justice. There is a constitutional floor that applies regardless of whether counsel is retained or appointed. The only place where there's a different standard is where counsel is waived altogether and the defendant represents himself. He can then not charge himself with ineffective assistance of counsel. There is one legal point that has not been clarified in this Court's cases regarding appellate assistance by counsel that could also be usefully clarified, and that is that we think the proper inquiry would look to the state of the law facing appellate counsel, rather than having an evidentiary hearing that would analyze in great depth how much legal research the particular counsel did in anticipation of filing his appellate brief. The inquiries here are essentially whether the defendant's lawyer did not present a claim that was sufficiently strong that it was ineffective for him not to present it. We think that that is an objective inquiry that should be measured by the state of the law that was confronting the appellate counsel at the time, and should be resolved based on the legal precedents that are in existence.",
  "Well, I think the answer is no, for several reasons, Justice Ginsburg. First of all there's no authority that I know of that says that competent counsel is required to continue to survey the developing law on issues that he decided not to raise to appeal to an appellate court to determine whether there has been some change of law on an issue that he abandoned. I don't think that competent counsel is required to stay abreast of the law in that fashion. Second, as we have pointed out, competent counsel may well conclude that, rather than risking the ire of the court of appeals by raising a claim that he had previously abandoned and is now exploiting only because some other defendant had successfully raised it might cost him credibility with the court of appeals and is therefore not appropriately done. There was no authority in the Seventh Circuit at the time, as there is today, that says that counsel has a right to present new issues that are based on intervening law.",
  "I have spoken to the U.S. Attorney's Office about that question and I have not received a clear answer, because it doesn't come up all that often, but I will say that the Seventh Circuit is a procedurally strict circuit and it does make every effort to ensure that parties get review only on those issues that they've elected to raise in their opening brief. Now, there is one piece of stray dictum in a Seventh Circuit case that suggests that, of course, if the law changes, maybe parties can raise new issues. Other circuits are divided on that issue, so it's hardly something that I think competent counsel should be presumed required to do in order to meet the minimal constitutional standard of adequacy. And the final reason why in this case I don't think competent counsel was deficient even if he knew about Wilson and didn't raise it to the court of appeals is because Wilson, under its grouping analysis, produces this strange anomaly of requiring more financial harm to be included in each of the offenses that is grouped, and for reasons that as Justice Breyer has pointed out, very few people understand but we've attempted to lay out in our brief, the offense level would actually go up, and it would have a counterintuitive result. This actually happened in the Wilson case. The judge on remand from Wilson I, the case that petitioner says should have been cited to the panel, resentenced the defendant to a higher sentence, faithfully applying the guidelines as he understood them. The court of appeals then reversed, saying, well, the Government had waived its right to argue the increased offense level in that manner. We don't agree with the Seventh Circuit's waiver analysis, but the more salient point here is that no counsel could have foreseen that the Seventh Circuit would later apply a waiver analysis, and thus, if counsel had actually read the Seventh Circuit's decision and said grouping is required under subsection (d) of the sentencing guidelines, section 3(d)1.2, and had asked for that, the sentence could go up, and that lawyer would not be assured that there would be any purpose served by raising that kind of an argument only to his client's ultimate detriment. So taking into account the complexities of the guidelines, the potential for adverse results that can occur, and the state of the law which hardly suggested that this was, as Judge Easterbrook has called in another context, a dead-bang winner on appeal, we don't think that there was any deficient performance by petitioner's counsel that would merit ineffective assistance relief on collateral review. If the Court has no further questions --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Custis v. United States this Court made clear that at a Federal sentencing proceeding a defendant who faces recidivist sentencing may not bring a constitutional challenge to the validity of the underlying enhancement conviction. We submit that the same principle applies where it --",
  "With the exception of a conviction that was entered in violation of Gideon v. Wainwright, that's correct, Justice Stevens.",
  "I think that that is the line that the Court drew in Custis, Justice O'Connor. It rested that on a variety of considerations. The first was that the Court's jurisprudence had recognized Gideon violations as a unique constitutional defect that rose even to the level of a jurisdictional defect. The second two reasons I think are the ones that most clearly explain the rule that we're espousing here.",
  "Well, there are two distinctions between that kind of a situation and the Gideon situation. The one that I think is most applicable to the majority of cases that are going to come up in this context is that a Brady violation is a very fact-intensive inquiry. It can't be resolved, as the Court noted in Custis with respect to a Gideon claim, simply by looking at the judgment or the judgment role and determining whether the defendant had counsel. It requires instead a fairly intricate analysis of whether the Government suppressed and withheld information that the defendant couldn't with due diligence have gained access to, and whether there was resulting prejudice to the defendant as a consequence, and the administrative costs of adjudicating that are far more substantial and very intrusive into the sentencing process as compared to Gideon.",
  "Well, the second -- I think, Justice O'Connor, that is the second distinction in your hypothetical, that the hypothetical posits that this was information about a constitutional claim that could not with due diligence have been obtained, I'm assuming within any time for bringing an appropriate appeal or collateral challenge. The capital context is unique in that area, I think, and I'm going to set it aside, because questions of actual innocence in the capital context would be dealt with under the Eighth Amendment and would implicate constitutional principles that aren't broadly applicable. But as to the generality of sentencing cases, I think that the basic rule is that there is a system in place to challenge convictions that balances two fundamental interests. One is in finality, the other is in fundamental fairness. Those two interests have always been accommodated not by giving one total sway over the other, but by saying that in certain contexts there are claims that are available and they may be brought, and if they are brought in a manner that's compatible with the procedural limitations such as statute of limitations, procedural default, exhaustion, Teague v. Lane, if they surmount those hurdles, then the interests of vindicating the Constitution take precedence over the interests of finality. But if those procedural hurdles have not been met, and the defendant did not bring his claim in accordance with the procedures that are set out, then society is entitled to take that conviction as conclusively final, and any further remedy that would be available would have to come from the executive branch --",
  "Under this Court's decision in Custis he may at the Federal sentencing raise it, and I --",
  "That would be a procedural default, Justice Stevens, and I think it would bar the defendant from coming back even if there were otherwise a right to come back under applicable procedure.",
  "The sentence of the -- the underlying conviction --",
  "Well, if the underlying conviction sentence had not been served, then the defendant's remedy would be to go back into the jurisdiction that entered it and see if he can comply with --",
  "I don't think so, Justice Stevens, because he has the right to do that under Custis at the Federal sentencing proceeding itself, and the failure to bring that claim at a timely point in the proceeding, when it is available, would constitute a default, and then he would be left with the argument --",
  "Well, inadequate assistance of counsel isn't even permitted to be brought under this Court's decision in Custis with respect to the underlying conviction. With respect to the conviction that -- the Federal conviction that was entered, ineffective assistance of counsel claims typically are not brought in the original sentencing court that imposed the conviction because the defendant typically has the same counsel and because the facts haven't been developed, and therefore there is no procedural default typically in bringing an ineffective assistance claim directed to the Federal conviction in a section 2255 proceeding. But as to the underlying enhancement conviction, which is what we are talking about here, petitioner is saying that I suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to a 1978 robbery conviction that is now being used to enhance my 1992 Federal sentence, and I should have the right, on 2255, to litigate that 16-year- old, or 19-year-old claim, and we submit that the Court's decision in Custis says you can't do that at the Federal sentencing and you therefore cannot do that on the 2255 proceeding.",
  "The fundamental problem with that, Justice Souter, is that those same interests are fully at stake in the Custis situation itself. When this Court said --",
  "If I could address that --",
  "That actually is not the question that the Court left open in Custis, Justice Souter. What the Court left open in Custis is the following scenario. Take Custis himself. After Custis is sentenced, the question that was raised in Custis was, could he then go back to the State court that had entered the enhancement conviction and obtain a judgment that that conviction was constitutionally invalid, and then come back to the Federal sentencing court and apply for reopening of his Federal sentence, and the crucial difference between that scenario and the scenario that's presented here is that the litigation over the validity of that sentence would take place in the State court.",
  "Litigation on Federal habeas corpus that attacked the State sentence.",
  "No, I don't think that that is --",
  "Well, I don't think that that's what the opinion says, because it talks about Custis having been in custody still on his State sentences.",
  "Correct.",
  "And Federal habeas review is Federal review under 2254 --",
  "-- that attacks the State sentence. This is a case under section 2255, attacking the constitutionality of the Federal sentence.",
  "The necessary --",
  "The language says, I think accurately, just what Justice Stevens read, and I would interpret Federal habeas review in that context to mean Federal review under 2254 attacking the prior State sentence.",
  "If it were not limited to that, it would be odd to say that the defendant could then come and apply for reopening of this Federal sentence, because that's exactly what section 2255 is all about. It is saying there's something wrong with the Federal sentence that was imposed, and we know from Custis --",
  "But the theory behind section 2255 litigation in this case is that there was a constitutional violation at the Federal sentencing.",
  "Because sentence was imposed based on a conviction that, although facially valid and never set aside by any court, might be unreliable if one took the time to unpack the claim that petitioner is now making and get the records and litigate it and determine whether it's valid or not, and the Custis court held there is no constitutional violation in imposing sentence without adjudicating that claim and, further, by leaving open the question that we've been discussing, the Court made clear that it's not inherently indispensable that there be any place left to litigate a claim that is based on a conviction that is 16 years old in this case, 19 years old, that the two convictions the petitioner is raising.",
  "Justice Souter, I think the fundamental answer to that question goes back to the interests in finality that have been struck in this Court's post-conviction jurisprudence generally. There is a recognition that there are fundamental interests in having an unconstitutional conviction overturned, but they are counterbalanced by other interests such as the fairness and reliability of the adjudication of that claim. Now, here we are talking about a claim by petitioner that when he entered his guilty plea 16 years ago and 19 years ago he wasn't adequately informed about one of the elements of the offense and therefore, he says, he didn't enter a knowing and voluntary guilty plea. Now, that's the kind of claim that can routinely be made on direct appeal or upon an immediate post-conviction attack, and it's made with the State that entered the judgment as a party, and the State can come back and say we have access to these records, they're very easy to determine, you can see that the judge went over him, the various elements, or his lawyer counseled him about the various elements of the crime and the court can reach a reliable adjudication promptly on whether that conviction is valid. A defendant who doesn't challenge his guilty plea in that fashion at the time that it's available to do so is essentially saying, I struck a deal with the Government, the deal allows me perhaps to reduce my time of imprisonment compared to what it would have been if I had gone to trial and lost, as I probably would have been, would have lost, therefore I'm going to enter a guilty plea and establish finality, and I'm not going to take an appeal, because if I appeal and win at this juncture I'll probably be back right in the position that I started in, namely, facing a trial and a potentially longer sentence.",
  "But the risk that he faced, Justice Souter, was one that he either knew actually or should have known at the time that he entered that plea.",
  "Well, apart from the fact that the Court in Nichols v. United States said that it's the kind of thing that prisoners do know when they're sentenced, that if they're seen back again they're going to face more serious consequences from it --",
  "I think that recidivism statutes are among the most common kind of statutes in the criminal justice world. All 50 States have them. The Federal Government has one. There's a great deal --",
  "Correct.",
  "No, but there has long been a tradition in this country of recidivism laws that fairly significantly escalated the potential sentence from some of the cases that I've seen from 5 years to 35 years, and these are convictions based on statutes that were enacted long before the current wave of three-strikes statutes.",
  "I don't think --",
  "I don't think the constitutional holding in Custis had anything to do with the language of the statutes. The Court concluded that the statute in Custis, which is the same statute at issue here, didn't authorize these kinds of challenges at the sentencing proceeding and it then went on to hold that neither did the Constitution. Now, petitioner's --",
  "Yes, but there's nothing --",
  "Justice Breyer, I accept that you've attempted to carve out the category of obvious unconstitutionality from what we're dealing with in this realm, but I submit that as a matter of real-life litigation it doesn't exist. What you in fact get in the vast majority of cases are records just like this one. The prisoner comes in --",
  "Any constitutional rule that says you can do this but only when it's really obvious is going to lead to the same sorts of burdens of litigation of whether it falls into that category or not, and it's going to require the Government, when confronted with one of these things, to do exactly what the Court recognized in Custis was an extremely burdensome and usually unproductive exercise of running round and trying to find the prosecutor, the judge, the defense lawyer, the probation officer who were part of the original sentencing proceeding, which could go back decades, and attempting to reconstruct --",
  "No, it is the Government's problem, because the prisoner comes in with an affidavit that says, I was there, and I'm going to swear out as a factual matter no one ever told me that aiding and abetting liability required that I join in this venture as if it were something that I intended to succeed. All I thought is that if I was present and I knew about the bank robbery, that was enough for the conviction. That is petitioner's claim right here. He's filed an affidavit, he's sworn it out under oath, and for the Government to sit back and say to the sentencing court, well, judge, he has a strong interest in this and this was 20 years ago, you shouldn't believe him, is really more than can be expected from us. We need to respond factually.",
  "That's right, Justice Stevens.",
  "That's right, and I think that that is the line that the Court drew in Custis, and it essentially says --",
  "Custis was a holding first on the meaning of 924(e) and then on what the Constitution required of a sentencing judge, and it held a sentencing judge may accept a facially valid --",
  "-- conviction that has never been set aside, other than --",
  "Well --",
  "There are normally other chances for a defendant to attack his prior conviction, the direct appeal from the conviction, post-conviction review in the State, and post-conviction review federally.",
  "Correct.",
  "Correct.",
  "That's correct, and the Court didn't say that this is an indispensable prerequisite of a valid Federal sentence. What it said was, the Federal sentencing court can look at the State judgment and say, on its face there's no Gideon problem here, we're not required to entertain other constitutional challenges.",
  "If some other court wants to entertain them, that's to be presented to that court. The rendering court --",
  "No, I don't think that's unconstitutional.",
  "That is a, an expectation that the prisoner can have that the laws give him notice that that's what the laws are intended to do.",
  "Justice Stevens --",
  "It is a view that the Government has taken in the lower courts. We have lost it in the six circuits that have considered it. We're currently rethinking what our position is on that issue. That issue is a quite distinct issue from this one.",
  "Because in that situation the Federal court, instead of saying, I have a facially valid conviction in front of me and I have a defendant who says there's something wrong with it but he's never done anything about it, the Federal court in this latter class of cases has a conviction that it previously relied on and said, this is a reliable indication that you are a more serious offender, and it turns out that a later State court judgment may have set it aside on constitutional grounds that fundamentally call into question reliability. That's a distinguishable scenario from this situation, and the outcome there does not control the outcome here.",
  "Well, I think Justice Scalia is referring to a statute that was premised on the following theory. If you know you have a conviction on the books and you are not deterred from the -- by committing another crime, notwithstanding the fact that you know that your sentenced will be enhanced, the question is, is that constitutional apart from Gideon violations. My answer to that is yes, but I don't actually think that's the sentencing theory that was adopted in section 924(e).",
  "Correct. Correct.",
  "Correct, and if it were of the sort, I would submit that it's constitutional, but the question is, is it of that sort.",
  "And I think the answer to it is not.",
  "I don't think it's a fortiori, Justice Scalia, although I do think our position is a fortiori from Custis, and the reason I think they're distinct is, the theory of the sentencing statute that you have posited is deterrence, and the theory of the recidivist sentencing statute, that is 924(e), and of most recidivist statutes, is reliability of a prior conviction which shows that this defendant is a more serious offender because he has committed crimes in the past which aggravate the current offense, and therefore this individual warrants greater incapacitation as a matter of protecting the public because he's clearly not learning but is going on to commit offense after offense after offense.",
  "Well, the United States took the position in Custis that Gideon error belonged to a very small class of fundamental errors, and the other error that we identified in Custis was the error that you identified, Justice Kennedy, of an error that really deprives the sentencing court of the character of a court that could render a fair judgment.",
  "No, because this Court in Custis didn't agree with the position of the Government and held that Gideon violations are unique. They are unique not only because they have such a pervasive impact on the fairness of the proceeding, but they are also unique in that they are fairly easy to discern from the judgment role or from a motion accompanying the judgment role, and the Court relied on the consideration of administrative ease as well as of the character of the error in defining what you could do when confronted with a recidivist enhancement and a prior conviction that is challenged on constitutional grounds, and so long as the Court adheres to that line, I think that the interest of the State in ensuring that its judgment carries usual force and effect are just as strong at the Federal sentencing proceeding as they are on 2255. The State --",
  "That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. That's the question that we're revisiting after our litigation track record in the lower courts, and it's not presented in this case because petitioner did not do that, and almost undoubtedly would be out of time to do that today, and quorum nobis is not apparently available in California, and our fundamental submission is, that was the chance that he had. Whatever procedures the rendering court provides and post-conviction review provides of the underlying conviction are sufficient for constitutional purposes absent a Gideon error when the Federal sentencing court is imposing a recidivist sentence. If the Court has no further questions --",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, thermal imaging senses heat gradients on the exterior of a surface, in this case the structure was a house. It does not penetrate the walls of the house, it does not reveal particular objects or activities inside of a house, and the record in this case and the findings that the district court made indicate that it is not capable of doing so through walls of a house. The question in this case is whether individuals have a reasonable and justifiable expectation of privacy in the heat that's on the exterior surface of their walls. We believe that they do not. Heat loss is an inevitable feature of heat in a structure. If a structure is generating heat, it will lose that heat, and everyone knows that. That's why there is an insulation industry. In addition, heat loss is frequently observable without the aid of technology, as, for example, when snow melts on a roof.",
  "Justice Souter, I think that Katz is fundamentally different in the respect that what the bug picked up in Katz was sound waves, which is what we hear with, and it amplified them and exactly reproduced what Mr. Katz was saying inside the booth.",
  "No, I think what the infrared imager is picking up, and the record in this case again corroborates this, is heat leaving the house. Now, there are a number of sources --",
  "Well, there are a number of sources for the heat that will leave the exterior of the house. There is the heat that it has absorbed during the day. There is heat that --",
  "No, but what is picked up and what is discerned is the exact reproduction of the words that the person is speaking, and that is the invasion of privacy that Katz was concerned with. The whole point of Katz was not to look at it as a technological invasion or to focus on whether the police actually went inside the phone booth in order to acquire that information. The point was that the information that was acquired was from within the booth, whereas here that's not the case at all. What is acquired --",
  "Well, Justice Souter, I think that it's not only considerably less sophisticated, but it is also picking up something that is very different in character from the words that people speak within a particular place. That is unquestionably a private and protected activity, and that's what the Court was focused on in Katz. Here we are talking about heat loss, and I think as some of the earlier questions have developed, the heat that is lost is heat that's generated inside a structure by virtue of the use of power. Here the police already had utility records that indicated that an abnormal amount of power was going into the house, which logically supports the inference that an abnormal amount of power may well be coming out of the house.",
  "But the critical point here, Justice Souter is the thermal imager doesn't tell you that he's lying in the house under sun --",
  "It doesn't get you in that way in the same mechanism that Katz does, which is by exactly reproducing it. Here you --",
  "Exactly. And this Court has made clear that law --",
  "But there's nothing wrong with the police attempting to use techniques from outside the house that will allow them to draw inferences about the inside of the house.",
  "I think that the argument that I'm trying to present, Justice Souter, is more complicated than that because it's really focusing on the core question of whether there are reasonable expectations of privacy in heat loss, and in order to assess that --",
  "And what you're doing in your bathroom is not picked up by the thermal imager. I think it's very --",
  "If you fog up the windows, you could probably actually see that from the street.",
  "I guess a modern Finnish thermal imager --",
  "I think that what the record in this case shows you is that it might be able to pick up exterior heat on the outside of the house, and it will not tell you what's going on inside the house.",
  "I do but I think what it overlooks is that the record in this case, the video in this case is particularly instructive. It is lodged with the Court, and it represents what is alleged to be a search here. It shows nothing of the kind. Contrary to petitioner's suggestion that it showed three evenly spaced heat spots that could only be the signature of a heat lamp, it doesn't show that, and nobody testified that that was the inference that was drawn. All that was drawn was an inference that there is an anomalous heat loss from this house compared to the structures nearby, and from that piece of information you could learn absolutely nothing about what is going on inside the house.",
  "Well, the thermal --",
  "The whole point of using the device to try to cross-corroborate various pieces of information so that you can better establish probable cause for the search warrant that was ultimately obtained.",
  "Most of those activities probably will make heat, Justice Scalia, but the thermal imager --",
  "Well, I actually think --",
  "I realize that -- the point that you're making but I actually think that the physics of it are that if you use more electricity, probably a lot of it will end up as heat, but the point that the thermal imager gives you is real-time information, that there actually is what appears to be anomalous heat that is coming out of this house compared to its neighbors. Neither the imager nor the utility bills will tell you there is probably a marijuana-growing operation inside this house. It will not tell you that there's a sauna, it will not tell you that there's a bath or a dehumidifier or anything else.",
  "I would, Justice Stevens, if what it is doing is, in effect, revealing the activities that are inside the house, yes.",
  "Well, I think Katz may well have come out differently if what was being learned was nothing more than you could actually see through the booth, which is that somebody was using the booth.",
  "That's right, and I want to --",
  "We're very clear about this for Justice Souter and Justice Breyer's questions, if the thermal imager functioned like an x-ray machine or if it functioned to be able to reach inside the house and pull out the sounds and listen to what was going on, then we don't dispute that it would be a search. Under Katz it clearly would be a search if what it does is reveal the activities that are going on inside the house or things that are inside the house.",
  "But what we're not learning is what activities are going on or where they are going on in the house.",
  "You do learn that.",
  "At that level of generality, coupled with inferences because you don't learn that directly from the imager at all, you don't learn directly from the imager at all that unusual amounts of heat are being generated. You have to couple that with inferences about what other houses next door might be doing, and you probably don't know what's going on inside of those houses, and you have to couple it with inferences that it hasn't been unduly heated up by the sun or that there's not a local microclimate that is causing the imager to pick up additional radiated heat at that location. You have to factor in all of those things, which reduces the specificity and directness, the linearality of any inference that you draw. There isn't a one-to-one correspondence between heat on the exterior of the structure and heat on the interior of the structure.",
  "I think it's several factors, Justice Souter. That is one of the factors. The factor that you're relying on inferences to conclude that there probably is a heat-generating source inside the house that is greater than average. Another factor is that heat loss is not that private a fact, as it corresponds roughly to consumption of energy, which is not private. And a third factor is that the imager is not picking up, again, activities that are inside the house directly. It is picking up the exterior surface of the walls.",
  "It complements the utility records. I do think that if the Government --",
  "It's not showing that Justice Souter, because we don't know the composition of the insulation within the house, we don't know the configuration --",
  "The ultimate inference that we would like to draw, of course, does but the question is whether the data that we are collecting from which we draw that inference constitutes a search. The steps of inference that we use once we have acquired the data cannot make a description --",
  "I would hesitate to say categorically that that is so, but I think --",
  "I think that my argument in this case depends on the nature of heat, what the imager actually detects, and the fact that we need to draw a series of inferences.",
  "Well, I think there are several critical differences, Justice Kennedy. The first is that heat loss is inevitable from a structure. Everybody knows that. That's why there's an insulation industry in the first place.",
  "Most people talk, and when they talk within the four walls of their house, unless they have the windows open and they're screaming out the window, will make an assumption that they cannot be heard by people who are standing on the street.",
  "Well, in addition, the fact that heat is generated in a structure is largely a product of the power that's going into the structure, the electrical and other utilities that are brought into the structure, and there's no secret about that information because it comes from the utility company. Third factor is that heat loss itself is observable in a variety of circumstances without the aid of any technology whatsoever. In the examples of when snow is melting on a house or when, for example, smoke is going up a chimney.",
  "Well, I don't think that it's neutral. I think that --",
  "Well, there's a fairly significant difference between cases where the Court has said somebody has publicly exposed their activities to view and therefore doesn't have any reasonable expectation of privacy, and the very question of whether heat loss is a private enough fact in the first place.",
  "I don't think that's --",
  "Well, I don't think it's the strongest analogy, although there are cases where I think the analogy would fit. The theory of the garbage cases is that by voluntarily abandoning --",
  "Correct.",
  "Well, I think that there are cases in which the analogy would fit better; for example, where there is a very active ventilation system that is specifically attempting to draw the heat out of the house in order to provide a suitable climate for growing the plants that are inside, but the primary rationale that the Ninth Circuit used which is similar to the rationale that I'm articulating here is that the thermal imager doesn't pick up any intimate details or particularly private details about what is going on inside of the house.",
  "Absolutely correct, and I do think that that illustrates --",
  "No, I don't think so. I think the whole point of Katz, Justice Stevens, was that that physical intrusion is irrelevant. What matters is what information you were acquiring, and in Katz, and in the hypothetical of removing the bug from six feet, the information that you are acquiring is direct information from inside the house. In the thermal imager it's not. It's a fusion of heat from a variety of sources. It's a very weak correlation between what's going on outside the house and what's going on inside the house. It's not like seeing a visual heat impression of a particular object that's outlined as if it were in silhouette on the outside of the house. Nothing of the kind occurs.",
  "Certainly if what you are acquiring is information that is not itself the product of a search, as in Justice Scalia's hypothetical, the fact that you can draw inferences, including very detailed and intimate inferences about the inside of the house doesn't convert the original observation into a search.",
  "Well, I think that the opposite is actually what holds true. You cannot use the fact that inferences can be drawn from the observations to categorize the observations as a search.",
  "Well, but my seventh grade science classes don't help me very much with this, either, and I think what the Court's cases indicate is that it's not essentially a science question. It's a question about, as the latter part of your comment indicated, the reasonable expectations that people have, and I think people have different expectations about what is outside of their house from what is inside of their house, and there are a variety of ways --",
  "Probably very little, although so far there has been some commercialization of thermal imaging in cars that will help it detect animals in the road and so forth, and there probably will be other uses in the future. I don't think that this case turns on whether thermal imaging is so prevalently in use that everybody would expect it would be used on their house. I think the core question is whether the heat loss on the outside of their house is sufficiently revealing of what's inside of the house to be considered a search.",
  "No, but the California versus Greenwood analysis is not the only analysis that could be used for expectations of privacy. The Court was clear in that case that the people could expect that their garbage would be rummaged through once they put it outside and therefore couldn't expect that the police would not do that, but that doesn't mean that people do intrinsically have an expectation of privacy that their houses are losing heat. Most people do not go around thinking about that as something that they view as a particularly private fact. They ventilate heat, they try to put insulation in to keep it from leaving the house, and they buy electricity and other sources of power that are going to generate it. What they do expect is that they will not be able to be viewed engaging in their personal activities or listened to in the house.",
  "I think it would be a very different case, Justice Ginsburg, because then it would begin to approach an x-ray device or some other device that could actually penetrate the barriers of the walls, and there the expectations that would be intruded upon would not be simply heat leaving the house but would be the very detailed activities that go on inside of the house.",
  "I think there's information in the search warrant that tends to show that they produce -- that they consume an inordinate amount of electricity, and there is testimony that the halide lights that are used for growing marijuana generate a high amount of heat.",
  "I don't recall whether there's a direct --",
  "The thermal imager doesn't really measure it that way, either. All it detects is relative amounts of heat. It doesn't detect absolute amounts of heat, and accordingly, officers tried to use a reference structure. Now, they're going to have to draw a lot of inferences by comparing one structure to another because it's not a perfect control. They don't really know what's going on inside the house next door, and even the inference that there's an anomalous amount of heat that's going on in 878 Rhododendron Drive, which is what the thermal imager produced in this case, is an inference that depends on things that the officers don't really know, that what is going on in the house next door that makes it look cooler compared to the house that they're actually surveying, and all of those factors contribute to make the data that is obtained in this case qualitatively different than the data that would be obtained in a wiretap case or in a case where an x-ray-type device actually penetrated the house. Now, if this Court were to hold that thermal imaging is a search, it could have a very chilling effect on uses of the thermal imager other than the kind of use that it was put to in this case. Thermal imagers are often used in fugitive apprehension, in perimeter surveillance for law enforcement, and for search and rescue operations in which they pick up an enormous amount of data, including houses that may be nearby to where a fugitive or a missing person is located. And if the Court concludes that -- thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent pleaded guilty with counsel by his side after having been advised at least twice earlier in the proceedings of his right to the assistance of counsel at all stages of the proceedings. The court of appeals, nevertheless, set aside his guilty plea on the ground that the district court, during the guilty plea colloquy, had failed to advise respondent of his right to the assistance of counsel as required by rule 11(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The court of appeals decision is wrong for three reasons. First, the court of appeals erred by applying a harmless error rather than a plain error standard of review to the district court's violation of rule 11. Respondent had not objected in the trial court to the rule 11 error, and therefore the standard of review is that for claims which were not preserved below, rather than claims that were. Second, the Ninth Circuit applied an incorrect standard for determining whether a rule 11 error affects substantial rights within the meaning of the harmless error and plain error rules. The Ninth Circuit was of the view that unless the defendant could be shown to have knowledge of the precise aspect of rule 11, that the district court had failed to inform the defendant about the guilty plea must be set aside. The correct standard under this Court's cases is whether the error had an effect on the outcome of the proceeding, which in this case means whether the error had an effect on respondent's willingness to enter a knowing and voluntary guilty plea. And finally, the Ninth Circuit erred by confining its analysis of whether the error in this case warranted reversal to the record of the guilty plea colloquy itself, failing to look at other portions of the official record that illuminated whether the defendant actually had knowledge of the information that the district judge had failed to provide to him. In this case, the district court, through its magistrate judges, had advised respondent, both at the initial appearance after respondent was arrested and at the arraignment after respondent was indicted, of his right to counsel at all stages of the proceeding. Respondent executed a waiver of rights form in which he acknowledged receiving and understanding these rights, and the district magistrate judge asked respondent at the arraignment whether he understood these rights. If the court of appeals had looked to the entire record to determine whether the rule 11 error in this case warranted reversal, it would have concluded, even under its own standards, applying harmless error review and asking whether the respondent knew the information that he had not been told during the rule 11 colloquy, that respondent, indeed, did have that information and, therefore, entered a valid guilty plea.",
  "Our second argument is that the proper inquiry into whether an error affects substantial rights is whether there is an effect on the outcome of the proceeding. And in this case, the relevant proceeding to look to is the guilty plea itself. Now, a court of appeals, in determining whether that standard is met, must of course look at the record. The difference between the position of the United States and the position of the court of appeals is that the court of appeals says the only record that's relevant is the rule 11 guilty plea colloquy itself. Nothing else matters.",
  "Well, it is -- it's a difficult inquiry to make if there is no information in the record that sheds light on it, and in that instance, the party that bears the burden of proof will probably lose, which is why it matters whether the standard is plain error review, in which the defendant bears the burden of proof, or harmless error review, in which case the Government bears the burden of proof. But in this case, the claim of the rule 11 error is that the defendant didn't get, at his guilty plea colloquy, information that he had the right to counsel at every stage of the proceeding. Since the record shows that the defendant, in fact, got that information, not once but at least twice, at earlier stages of the proceeding, and he had counsel by his side when he pleaded guilty, not once but twice, it is untenable on this record to suggest that the guilty plea would have come out any differently if the judge had complied with rule 11 in every relevant respect.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I believe the Court can reverse the judgment based solely on a favorable resolution for the Government of the third question presented it; that is, if the Court does look to the entire record in this case, then I believe that the Ninth Circuit's judgment is incorrect even if it were correct on the other two points that I've outlined. But there is a conflict in the circuits over the question of whether harmless error review or plain error review does apply in these circumstances, and the Government sought review on that issue in order to have this Court resolve the conflict.",
  "That is true, and the Court could resolve the case solely on that basis. If it did so, it would leave unarticulated in this Court's jurisprudence the precise approach that lower courts should take when rule 11 errors occur.",
  "That would be a resolution on what I think is the first question that we present in the petition.",
  "Yes.",
  "It's certainly possible to do that. The second question, which we did not present separately, but I believe is fairly included within our first question, the definition of what is an effect on substantial rights for purposes of a rule 11 error, is a question that the Court doesn't need to resolve in this case, but it is an important analytical tool for understanding what lower courts should do when confronted with rule 11 errors. And therefore this Court's guidance on it would be useful.",
  "The two that we presented I think are both equally important. The question whether plain error or harmless error review applies and the question of what record the court of appeals should look to in deciding --",
  "There is a conflict on the latter as well.",
  "No. I believe that the Ninth Circuit is the only court of appeals that has limited the -- the review solely to the guilty plea transcript. The advisory committee notes to rule 11 make clear that the harmless error rule that was added to rule 11 in 1983, rule 11(h), was to be applied based on the guilty plea record and the rest of the necessarily limited record that is made in guilty plea cases. But that record will include, as it did here, the initial appearance, the arraignment. Sometimes there will be multiple hearings on whether the defendant wishes to change his plea to a plea of guilty. Admissions may be made during the course of those hearings. And, of course, there is a sentencing hearing. And during the sentencing hearing, the defendant may provide -- be provided with the information that was left out inadvertently of the rule 11 colloquy, and he may at that time either reaffirm his interest in pleading guilty or show no surprise at the information that is provided to him or otherwise make it clear that this rule 11 error had no effect on substantial --",
  "The Government doesn't ask the -- the Court to write new words. Rather, we ask the Court to apply its existing plain error standards. Under the plain error review that this Court has articulated and, indeed, under harmless error review, the meaning of an effect on substantial rights is defined by its effect on the outcome in the generality of cases.",
  "Well, there are two competing definitions that are proposed for the Court on what an effect on substantial rights is.",
  "Justice Kennedy's question suggested that there may be some reason to --",
  "Justice Breyer, I certainly agree and I agreed with other questions that suggest that there is a very straightforward, simple resolution of this case that would involve making very little law. It would make clear that courts are to look to the whole record, and it would then leave unresolved the circuit conflict on plain error versus harmless error. But the fact is that there are differences between plain error and harmless error review that will matter in a certain class of cases. One difference between plain error and harmless error review is the one I've mentioned, that the defendant bears the burden of proof if it's plain error; we bear the burden of proof if it's harmless error. The other difference is that even if an error does affect substantial rights, under plain error review, a judgment is not to be reversed unless there is an impact on the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of --",
  "The court of appeals should affirm because there is ample evidence that the defendant had knowledge of the particular right in question that he claims was not given to him at the rule 11 colloquy.",
  "No. There's not an irrebuttable presumption. If there were something in the record that indicated --",
  "If there is nothing else in the record, then I think that there's nothing to rebut the presumption. This Court has indicated in a number of contexts that information that a defendant has been given at one stage of a proceeding -- give rise to a presumption that the defendant has knowledge of it. For example, the defendant is indicted and read the indictment at an arraignment. This Court made clear in Bousley v. United States that there's a presumption that the defendant has been given adequate notice of the charge. Now, that presumption can be overcome later in the proceedings if the judge gives the defendant misinformation about the charge or if the defendant otherwise can show from the record that he didn't have an adequate understanding of the charge.",
  "He said that the first time that he wanted to enter a guilty plea and the district judge recessed the proceedings for a week to give the lawyer an additional chance to explain to the defendant what was going on. He said, take a week. It's not going to cost you anything. You'll get credit for the time. You have a good lawyer. He can explain it to you. And the defendant said, yes, Your Honor, I acknowledge that. A week went by, and the defendant came back into court, with the advice of counsel, counsel by his side, and pleaded guilty to one of the two counts that were pending against him. The other count was continued on for trial. Several other proceedings occurred while that second count remained pending, in which the parties obtained continuances for trial because counsel was unavailable. All of this time, the respondent is in the courtroom, hearing this information, being made aware that he has a lawyer, that his lawyer is with him and his lawyer is going to be with him at trial. Now, it is true that when the time came for the ultimate guilty plea, the judge didn't enumerate the defendant's right to counsel at trial. And in fact, when the Government tried to alert the district court that it hadn't mentioned the right to counsel, the court said, I didn't alert him to that because he already has counsel. And no one stood up at any point, neither the defendant --",
  "Yes. The court clearly violated the rule because rule 11 is a prophylactic rule that sweeps more broadly than the Constitution. It contains a specific enumeration of rights. It contains those rights that this Court identified in Boykin v. Alabama, as --",
  "I don't think that that's a necessary consequence of a ruling in our favor, Justice Kennedy. First of all, all of the court of appeals apply some form of harmless error or plain error review. The Ninth Circuit is in the minority in applying the most restrictive form. All of the other courts, though, currently imply something. And that doesn't detract --",
  "It is -- it is applicable if the Court concludes that plain error review does not apply. Our first submission is that because this was a defaulted not raised below, it can be considered by the court of appeals only under rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of --",
  "Justice Souter, I believe that the reason that the drafters picked just one is that the drafters were addressing a specific holding of this Court that, as Justice O'Connor indicated, had suggested that there was automatic reversal in the case of a rule 11 violation. And the drafters wanted to negate that specific holding. The rule --",
  "The drafters weren't thinking of this issue. What they were thinking about was specifically negating McCarthy. They also wanted to make it clear -- and they did make clear in the advisory committee notes -- that the addition of rule 11(h) to rule 11 was not intended to have a negative inference that violations of other rules should give rise to per se reversal. Rule 52 would remain in place for all of those other errors involving other rules.",
  "You could. I believe that there's a general presumption in the Federal criminal system that if an error is preserved at trial, it's subject to harmless error review, which is what rule 11(h) provides for. If an error is not preserved at trial, it's subject to review only under the plain error rule, rule 52(b), and this --",
  "That's right, and rule 52 is also addressed to the district court. Rule 52 is found in the Rules of Criminal Procedure, not in the Rules of Appellate Procedure. So, it instructs both district courts, court of appeals, and this Court to disregard errors that did not affect substantial rights and give the district court, the court of appeals, and this Court power to set aside judgments where the error was not called to the attention of the district court but the error constitutes plain error.",
  "Correct. There was a -- an attempt by the Government --",
  "That's rule 11(c)(2). The violation in this case was of rule 11(c)(3), which enumerates for the defendant the various rights, not a complete list, but a partial list of rights that the defendant has at the trial.",
  "And those rights --",
  "Correct. That -- that rule is a response to this Court's decision in Boykin v. Alabama which held that if the record is entirely silent on whether the defendant entered a knowing and intelligent plea, a court of appeals on direct review cannot uphold it. And in response to Boykin, the drafters of the rules wanted to provide a prophylactic buffer to make sure that there could be no valid claims, either on direct appeal or on collateral review, that the defendant pleaded guilty without a sufficient understanding of the rights that he would have at trial if he had gone to trial. So, 11(c)(3) walks through the right to counsel, the right to confront witnesses, the right to self-incrimination, and the right to a jury trial. And then it goes on in 11(c)(4) and says, by pleading guilty, you waive your right to a trial.",
  "Yes, but it would be an almost impossible burden --",
  "-- for the Government to satisfy.",
  "That's right.",
  "Actually I want to revise the answer. I think that it would be very hard for us to win if the advice required under (c)(2) were not given and the defendant were not represented by counsel.",
  "But not because only counsel can make an objection. If a defendant validly waives the right to counsel, under Faretta v. California, and he's given an adequate colloquy, and he's told of the risks and disadvantages, and he's told by the judge, look, you're not a lawyer. It's going to be difficult for you to do this. If you want to go forward, please understand I'm not going to help you out in this. You're on your own, and the rules of procedure are complicated. They usually finish up by saying, so if it's up to me, I wouldn't do it, but if you want to do it, it's your choice. If the defendant goes through that and he elects to go without counsel, he's subject to all the same procedural rules that anybody else is, and it's true that he won't probably do a very good job at protecting his own rights, but once he decides to act as his own counsel, he's not given a free pass to escape from those rights. Now, if the judge doesn't give the advice required by 11(c)(2) and we can't show that he has gone through a thorough and adequate Faretta colloquy elsewhere in the proceedings, then I suspect we're going to lose that case because a felony trial without counsel is one of the few errors that gives rise to a per se presumption of prejudice without any further showing, and it would be almost impossible for us to show or for the defendant to fail to show that he's entitled to plead anew.",
  "Well, I don't think, Justice Ginsburg, that the Court should frame a rule to provide a sanction. All of the parties to rule 11 fully understand that it should be complied with. The Federal Judicial Center has a bench book. We come to court often with checklists to assist the court. Defense counsel has that responsibility. And judges conscientiously try to do this.",
  "The ultimate sanction would fall on society if --",
  "No, Justice Stevens, because whoever bore the burden of proof on appeal is going to have to make that showing based on the existing record, and if the Government bears the burden and it can't establish harmlessness, then the court of appeals should vacate the plea. If the defendant bears the burden and he can't show it, he loses. There will be an opportunity to make a constitutional claim under 2255, but this isn't an endless remand.",
  "Correct. That's correct.",
  "I wouldn't say never and I wouldn't exclude the possibility that a district court -- that a court of appeals had discretion, but it -- it's not the normal procedure. And if you look around --",
  "Well, with 60,000 Federal criminal convictions each year, even a very low error rate is going to produce a large number of cases. And there are a large number of rule 11 cases that come to the court of appeals where there really is no substantial doubt that the defendant had all the information and counsel to plead guilty. Now, he could make an ineffective assistance of counsel claim if he really felt he was missing something so that his plea wasn't intelligent. But the purpose of rule 11 was not to create a regime in which guilty pleas were upset for minor deviations from the rule. That was exactly what --",
  "I think this is a minor deviation, Justice Stevens, because this defendant had been told about this right.",
  "And he had counsel. And I also think that almost any defendant who pleads guilty in an American court with counsel will have had a discussion with counsel about the option of going to trial, which would include counsel --",
  "It's virtually inevitable that it will be. And this was not a right that this Court had enumerated in Boykin v. Alabama was one of the rights that the defendant should be advised about.",
  "He -- he should know that, and rule 11 should be complied with. But I do not believe that there is a court of appeals case that reverses a conviction for failure to give this advice to a counseled defendant. If I could save the remainder of my time.",
  "Unless the Court has any short questions --",
  "-- the Government will submit.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court's decision in McMillan v. Pennsylvania forms the backdrop for both the statutory and the constitutional questions in this case. As a matter of statutory interpretation, the amended section 924(c) creates one crime with a minimum of 5 years and a maximum of life in prison and then gives the sentencing court additional guidance as to where the penalty shall be set within that 5-year-to-life range. The increase in the mandatory minimums does not run afoul of the Apprendi rule and is, in fact, specifically endorsed by this Court's decision in McMillan. And on the constitutional question, this Court's decision in McMillan 16 years ago established that it does not violate the Constitution for a legislature to choose one fact that has historically borne on the appropriate penalty to be assessed at sentencing and give the judge guidance as to what that sentence shall be.",
  "Justice Kennedy, there are several significant differences between the issue in a case like this and the issue in a case like Apprendi. In Apprendi, the judge could not go above the jury's verdict based on the Court's constitutional analysis. In other words, the jury sets the outermost limit that the judge can do, and in the sense of protecting the jury trial right, the Apprendi rule tracks onto what the jury must find. Here, regardless of what the jury finds, the judge has the discretion and the authority to sentence the defendant between 5 years and life in prison. What the mandatory minimum takes away is not a jury trial right, but a right to judicial discretion to give a lower sentence than the mandatory minimum calls for. But Apprendi was not about protecting judicial discretion. Apprendi, in fact, limited judicial discretion and said that the judge cannot go above the maximum that the jury's facts have determined. Here the judge is not doing anything that he could not do based on the jury's verdict anyway. All that is happening is that he is losing the discretionary power to give less, and that judicial discretion interest is not the interest that was at stake in Apprendi. That's reinforced by the fact that the history that this Court relied on, as one of its key determinants in the Apprendi decision, is not present in this case. The history in Apprendi, the Court concluded, showed that it has been the rule down centuries into the common law that the judge cannot give a higher sentence than based on the facts that the jury has determined. But there is no comparable historical rule that would support a preclusion of judicial discretion within the otherwise applicable range. The history of sentencing in this country shows that within the maximum sentence established by the jury verdict, judges have been often given tremendous amounts of discretion on what sentence they should impose. But the history of sentencing also reveals that legislatures have frequently intervened in order to establish more precise rules to govern that discretion. And the -- therefore, there is no broad historical rule that is contradicted by a statute like the one in this case and the one that was at issue in McMillan.",
  "It --",
  "It might, Justice Breyer. The crucial question is whether that statute has created an affirmative defense.",
  "If it's --",
  "As I understand Apprendi, it would.",
  "The significance of it concerning a minimum is that under this statute, once the jury returns a verdict of guilty, using or carrying a firearm during in relation to an underlying drug trafficking offense, the judge has the authority by virtue of that jury verdict to sentence from 5 years to life in prison. That's what the statute means. What the mandatory minimum provision does is say, within that range, we want this defendant sentenced to not less than 7.",
  "Well, the two most significant factors, as I've tried to say -- and I'll try one more time -- is that in Apprendi, the defendant could not have gotten a sentence above 10 years based on the jury's verdict alone. It took an additional finding by the judge to send him into the realm where the maximum was now 20, and then he -- Apprendi got 12. In this case, once the jury or, as it happens, the judge -- the defendant waived a jury trial -- assigned a finding of guilt to the defendant, the statute said, your sentence, Mr. Harris, is between 5 years and life in prison. And the statute comes along and doesn't give the judge the authority to do something that he could not have done before.",
  "The difference in that statute, Justice Scalia -- and I agree that that would not trigger the rule that this Court announced in Apprendi -- is that as the Court's opinion in Apprendi notes, if Congress writes the second kind of statute and says the range is 1 to 25, it is exposing all defendants who are sentenced under that statute to a possible sentence of 25 years. And the Court said that structural democratic constraints exist to deter legislatures from enacting statutes with more draconian maximum penalties than they think are appropriate for the worst of the worst who are going to be sentenced under that statute. Now, here when Congress amended section 924(c), it went from a statute that had determinate sentences. Previously whatever you did under 924(c), the judge had no sentencing discretion at all. It was just 5 years or 20 years or 30 years. Congress changed that and said this is a more serious crime. This is a crime which, if you're convicted of it, you're going to get at least 5 years with an implied maximum all the way up to life in prison. By virtue of doing that, Congress envisioned that there would a spectrum of offenders under section 924(c), some of whom are going to be at the bottom of the tier and are just the least worst offenders under that statute. They'll get 5 years. Others are going to be the worst of the worst. They are going to get a sentence that will be closer to the top of the statute. Within that range, Congress gave to the sentencing judge additional guide points of how to exercise that discretion. For someone who brandishes, that's a little worse than simply using; he should get at least 7 years. For someone who discharges -- that's an increment worse yet -- it's 10 years. But there's still all of the head room up to life in prison that Congress established for this offense. It doesn't violate the Eighth Amendment for Congress to say that someone who brings a gun into a drug or a violent crime has committed a serious offense. We want the judge to have up to life in prison.",
  "Justice Stevens, it's unclear what impact this decision will have on the sentencing guidelines, I assume on the assumption that the Court extends Apprendi to mandatory minimums. The sentencing guidelines are like mandatory minimums in certain respects. They provide ranges, once the judge has determined by a preponderance of the evidence, the defendant's conduct and criminal history, that by statute the judge is to give a sentence within. But they differ from mandatory minimums in that the statute further says that the judge can depart from the guidelines sentence based on an aggravating or a mitigating fact that distinguishes the case from the kinds that the guidelines' drafters had in mind. Now, the guidelines are -- are different primarily in that there is a broader range of discretion available for the judge to depart than there is under a mandatory minimum. I emphasize that this is a question of degree rather than one of kind because even these mandatory minimums under section 924(c) can be departed from. If the Government makes a motion that says the defendant has rendered substantial assistance to the Government in the prosecution of others, that authorizes the judge to depart from what is otherwise a mandatory minimum. That same ground for departure also exists within the guidelines, and it accounts for more than half of the departures that exist in the guidelines. Now, the guidelines do, of course, provide a further zone of less guided discretion to the judge in when he can depart. And if this Court rules against the Government in this case, we will be back saying that that zone of discretion distinguishes the guidelines. Whether the Court agrees with that or not will be an open question.",
  "That's correct.",
  "No, not in the sense that Your Honor is asking the question. But I -- I do wish to underscore that there is -- there is a range of ways that Congress can draft statutes and the States can draft statutes. Under the drug statutes, for example, there's not only the substantial assistance departure that I've mentioned, but there's also a departure for first-time offenders called the safety valve. Now, that adds an additional amount of discretion to the judge. And any constitutional rule that this Court develops for mandatory minimums is going to have to be very careful in articulating how much discretion is enough in order to make the mandatory minimum no longer mandatory and no longer minimum. It could be that the availability of the substantial assistance departure is enough to take it out of a rule that says never means never, and if -- if Congress says never, then the judge can't make the finding. That is precisely why we urge the Court to adhere to McMillan v. Pennsylvania which held 16 years ago that it is permissible for -- for the legislature to provide additional guidance. And the Court left open the possibility that particular statutes may fall under a constitutional rule, but it didn't prescribe the sort of rigid rule that petitioner is advocating in this case.",
  "The rational distinction, Justice Ginsburg, is that in the former case, the defendant has a right to a jury trial that has to find him guilty on all the facts that are going to determine the longest possible time that he can spend in prison. Under this statute, even if he does have a jury trial right to brandishing -- just suppose that he did; suppose that Congress gave it to him so we eliminate the constitutional question -- the jury could find him not guilty. And the judge could still say, well, I think by a preponderance of the evidence, you did brandish, and exercising my discretion, I'm going to give you exactly the same 7 years that the statute called for. The fact that that can happen shows, I think, that the right that's in play here is not a right to a jury trial that will protect the defendant against the possibility of this increased punishment. It is the right to have a judge with unlimited discretion not to impose the mandatory minimum even if he finds brandishing, because that is the distinction that I think both petitioner and I draw between the sentencing guidelines and this mandatory minimum. And the right to judicial discretion is simply not the Apprendi right. It's not a right that's been historically recognized. And if this Court were to accept respondent's -- or petitioner's analysis of the constitutional rules that govern here as being drawn from the ex post facto cases, which is essentially what he relied on in his reply brief and in this Court, the Court would have to fashion a far more sweeping constitutional rule than would address merely mandatory minimums, because the ex post facto cases are triggered by any substantial disadvantage to the defendant. It doesn't have to be a substantial disadvantage that can only be proved as an element of the crime. The ex post facto cases apply to the withdrawal of good-time credits. They apply to the sentencing guidelines, as the Court held in Miller v. Florida. They would presumably apply to the withdrawal of an affirmative defense after the defendant committed his crime. And petitioner, by relying on that test, essentially says, I want a rule that means that anytime I am substantially disadvantaged by one aspect or another of the criminal laws of a State, the jury must find those facts. All facts that are germane to my punishment --",
  "That is the --",
  "I hope not, Justice O'Connor, because I think that the Apprendi rule, as bounded by the history that the Court relied on and the explicit statements of its holding, coupled with the Court's recognition that, yes, legislatures can write statutes that will achieve similar results to Apprendi but will do it in an acceptable form, all of those things suggest that the Court did not have a broad ruling on it.",
  "Well, retrospectively Apprendi has caused a considerable amount of judicial chaos as courts have attempted to sort out harmless error, plain error, and retroactivity considerations, one of which is before the Court next month in the Cotton case. Prospectively, the United States has responded to Apprendi by having facts that raise the -- the maximum be submitted to the jury. And it does, as a matter of practice, cause some complications in particularly intricate conspiracy cases where the jury has to make separate determinations as to each conspirator. It also creates the kinds of issues that Justice Breyer was talking about for defendants who are hampered to some extent in their ability to present dual alternative defenses of the nature, I wasn't involved in this conspiracy, but if I was, I'm only accountable for a certain amount of drugs, because the jury is being asked to make that determination. Once the jury makes it affirmatively, the judge is not going to be in a position at sentencing to second guess that. So, Apprendi does -- does restrict the -- the defendant's ability to make a defense --",
  "The defense bar has been --",
  "Their primary desire to date so far, Justice Scalia, has been to get all of the old sentences in the pre-Apprendi regime overturned. And when they've finished with that agenda, maybe they'll turn to trying to get different proceedings at trial.",
  "As cases like this reveal, there's been an effort to expand Apprendi to what could be viewed as its widest logical implications, because although I've presented a theory for why Apprendi should be read narrowly to avoid disrupting the traditional ability of legislatures to structure sentencing, there is obviously within the opinion the seeds of a much more fundamental change in the --",
  "I don't think that it would be true for a defendant like the defendant in Jones who was convicted by the jury of a crime that carried a 15-year penalty.",
  "The Government could do that.",
  "The States have a much wider range of mandatory minimum sentencing programs. They've filed an amicus brief in this case that itemizes the far greater number and wider range of State mandatory minimum programs. I'm not in a position --",
  "I think that the States will suffer increased practical problems compared to the Federal Government because in the Federal Government, the mandatory minimums are in relatively specific areas and we could, indeed, go forward and charge and prove them to a jury. The more fundamental implication of an extension of Apprendi within the maximum term is that it does raise greater questions about the constitutionality of schemes such as the sentencing guidelines. Those are, of course, not only on the Federal level but prevalent throughout the States as well. And -- and the process of drawing lines between whether mandatory minimums are mandatory enough to trigger any constitutional rule, versus sentencing guidelines not being, is going to require a process of adjudication, and there's no way to predict where that will end up. It will largely depend on how broadly this Court interprets the rule that it announced in Apprendi and then if it applies it here, how it applies it. If there --",
  "Under 18 U.S.C., section 3553(e).",
  "Yes. The Government can file a motion for substantial assistance of the defendant in the prosecution of others, and upon that motion, the judge can go below. This Court analyzed that statute in Melendez v. United States several years ago, a case which I believe is cited in our brief.",
  "Correct. And, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I agree with the suggestion of Justice Souter earlier that this statute is not identical to the Jones statute and shouldn't be construed identically to it. First and most fundamentally, in Jones and again unanimously in Castillo, the Court commented that a statute that's written, as section 924(c) is written, has the look of the creation of sentencing factors when you start off looking at it. In Jones, the Court then went on to analyze a number of structural features that suggested that the initial look was unreliable. Here the initial look is reliable. Unlike in Jones where the additional factors, serious bodily injury and death, took the penalty from 15 years, first to 25 years, and then to life in prison, here the initial range of the statute is 5 years to life, and the mandatory minimums are fairly modest incremental increases in the minimum sentence of 5 years and 7 years. But most importantly, what is different from the statute in Jones, the carjacking statute and the statute here, section 924(c), is in Jones the carjacking statute was modeled on three Federal robbery statutes. Two of those Federal robbery statutes contained serious bodily injury or putting somebody in jeopardy of serious bodily injury that were clearly offense elements, and the Court commented that it could see no reason -- and the Government was unable to adduce a reason -- why Congress would have departed from the explicit models on which it relied in drafting the carjacking statute. So you had a firmer basis for concluding in the carjacking statute that Congress probably intended an element. Here not only do you not have that feature, because there was no Federal antecedent for section 924(c), but you have the very important consideration that there's no constitutional doubt that should be applied to the construction of section 924(c). Unlike in Jones where the Court held that a series of cases over 25 years had raised constitutional questions about increasing the maximum, here the relevant precedent, of which Congress is presumed to be aware, is McMillan v. Pennsylvania which gave the legislature fair warning that it could provide for the kind of statute that it's provided here. And for those reasons, we think that the Fourth Circuit and every other court of appeals that's analyzed the question is correct in concluding that Congress's approach in section 924(c) was a sentencing factor approach. The question then becomes whether that is a constitutional approach.",
  "No, Justice Stevens. And the reason for that is that the history of sentencing in this country moved from early statutes which were wholly determinate.",
  "Then in the 19th century, the legislatures and Congress and the State adopted a -- a policy of having wide ranges and judicial discretion within them. Then later, legislatures moved to a system of parole boards and -- and indeterminate sentencing in many States. And it was as a result of those processes that in the mid-20th century and late 20th century, a variety of commentators began to decide that this sentencing scheme that gives so much discretion to various actors in the system was not acceptable because it produced unwarranted disparities against similarly situated offenders. And at that point, to promote transparency, meaning we know what -- why the judge is doing what he's doing, and uniformity, namely, similar offenders will get the same sentence, schemes came along like mandatory minimums and guideline sentencing. But I believe that they were understood to be directions to limit judicial discretion, not to wholly supplant it or to be the type of statute that the Court invalidated in Apprendi. And it's really the petitioner's burden in this case to show that these sentencing innovations are unconstitutional. In Apprendi, the defendant was able to carry that burden by pointing to a long line of consistent judicial decisions. Here neither party can point to a long line of consistent decisions. What each of us does is argue from the background baseline tradition. Our submission is that judges have always had a wide range of discretion. Defendants have never been able to rely on not getting a stiffer sentence within the maximum authorized ranges. Legislatures have relied on this Court's decision in McMillan, saying that it's constitutional for the legislature to structure that discretion, and we believe that the Court should adhere to that position today. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is typical of many Federal drug prosecutions that were tried before this Court's decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey. Respondents were indicted on a superseding indictment that alleged a conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine base without alleging a specific threshold quantity of drugs that were involved in the offense. Respondents were convicted of that offense at trial, and the evidence established at trial that the offense involved well in excess of 50 grams of cocaine base, the threshold quantity of drugs to authorize a minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. At sentencing, as all parties expected, the judge made findings of drug quantity and determined that the quantities of drugs involved in the offense justified a sentencing range up to life imprisonment and imposed sentences on several respondents of life imprisonment and others of 30 years imprisonment. Respondents made no objection to the judge's procedure in determining drug quantity himself without a jury trial determination on that issue or without an --",
  "The problem in this case, Justice Kennedy, is that the court of appeals has held that the omission of a drug quantity allegation from the indictment is a jurisdictional error that always requires automatic correction on plain error review regardless of the strength of the evidence against respondents on the question or on whether respondents had notice that they would face an increased sentence as a result of enhanced quantities of drug --",
  "It's --",
  "What will happen if the -- this Court affirms the judgment of the court of appeals is that respondents will not be subject to the sentences that Congress authorized and that the evidence unequivocally showed in this case were justified.",
  "In this case we're not arguing about retroactivity. What we're arguing about is plain error. Respondents never made a constitutional objection in the district court to the procedure by which they were sentenced. They never even objected as a factual matter to the proposition that their offenses involved 50 grams of cocaine base or more, which is all that is required in order to support a statutory increase in the sentence. And notwithstanding their failure to object, the court of appeals concluded that plain error analysis always requires vacation of the enhanced sentence, and the Government does not get a chance to seek the enhanced sentence on --",
  "That's correct. The indictment in this case charged a complete offense under 21 U.S.C. 846, the drug conspiracy --",
  "Correct.",
  "This case was tried before Apprendi.",
  "Yes, absolutely, Justice O'Connor. Post Apprendi, the Government understands that it's its obligation to include an allegation of drug quantity in the indictment. This case, which was tried pre Apprendi, was done in a regime in which all parties understood that an allegation in the indictment of a conspiracy offense, with no specification of drug quantity, did not limit the Government to proving increased quantities of cocaine base.",
  "Well, Justice O'Connor, this Court already has overruled Ex parte Bain on its square holding, which is that the narrowing of an indictment is impermissible and deprives the court of jurisdiction.",
  "Ex parte --",
  "Well, that -- that is a difference from Ex parte Bain, Chief Justice Rehnquist, but we don't dispute that in this case, post Apprendi, there is an error in the sense that drug quantity is treated as a constitutional element.",
  "Correct. And the fundamental flaw in Ex parte Bain was to treat a constitutional error arising under the Fifth Amendment's Indictment Clause as if it were a jurisdictional error. And it's our submission that the reason that the Court did that is because at the time, in the 19th century, on habeas corpus, relief was available only for jurisdictional errors, which led this Court to treat a variety of constitutional errors as though they were jurisdictional.",
  "Correct. So, the -- the result was that a -- the Court had broadly characterized a variety of constitutional errors as if they were jurisdictional errors, but later decisions of this Court make clear that the failure of an indictment to charge any offense is not a jurisdictional error.",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg. We think that the time is -- is right in this case to make it clear that that's not a jurisdictional error.",
  "Well, jurisdictional has been appended as a label to a variety of kinds of errors, but the relevant sense in which it's being invoked in this case and in which the lower court understood it was a kind of defect that may be raised at any time regardless of an objection and that is tantamount to subject matter jurisdiction, the sort of error that is so fundamental to the proceedings that harmless error review and plain error review simply don't apply. Now, the court of appeals in this case did, as a formal matter, apply rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the harmless error rule. But it also repeatedly stated that errors relating to the indictment process are jurisdictional, and the failure of an indictment to charge an offense violates a mandatory rule and creates a jurisdictional error. And that led to the conclusion that this Court's precedents in Neder v. United States and Johnson v. United States simply don't apply and that the weight of the evidence against respondents in this case and their possession of notice that they would face increased sentences under the drug statute --",
  "In -- in the factual record --",
  "In this case, Justice Stevens, we rely most fundamentally on the fact that the state of the law at the time of respondents' indictment was that all defendants understood that notwithstanding the absence of a --",
  "We don't have to rely on that. I think the prior indictment makes clear that the Government believed that this conspiracy --",
  "Well, not in view of the fact that at the prevailing legal regime at the time --",
  "I would. And I think it's important to underscore that the superseding indictment didn't give the defendants the impression that the Government was retreating in the scope of its proof. To the contrary, the superseding indictment expanded the conspirators from 9 to 14. It expanded the length of the conspiracy --",
  "It didn't withdraw all references to quantity, Justice Stevens. If you look at the superseding indictment, it alleges that there were multi- kilogram cocaine shipments and multi-kilogram --",
  "And that's correct. But what --",
  "The earlier indictment in terms said this offense involves more than 50 grams of cocaine base. The later indictment didn't say that. But if you do read the allegations in the later indictment, it's impossible that anyone could come away thinking that the Government had narrowed the scope of the conspiracy it intended to prove. And respondents didn't take it that way. There is information in the detention hearings of at least four other respondents that indicates that they understood that this was the kind of cocaine conspiracy -- cocaine base conspiracy that, if proved, would expose them to a life sentence. They had a full opportunity to try to contest that evidence if they wished to do so. What the respondents did instead was attempt to say we weren't part of this --",
  "Well, I don't think it would mean nothing, Justice Stevens, but we are asking the Court to rule on the broader ground that when an indictment fails to allege what we now understand to be an element of the offense, but the evidence is sufficiently powerful so that any rational grand jury, if asked, would have found that.",
  "Nothing, Chief Justice Rehnquist, because Stirone was a case in which two features are present that are not present here. First of all, the defendant in Stirone repeatedly objected to the broadening of the indictment in that case. There the indictment had alleged that there was an effect on interstate commerce from an extortion as a result of obstruction of commerce in sand. And the Government got to trial and attempted to prove that the sand would have been used to build a steel mill, the steel mill would have exported steel to other States, and that was the effect on commerce that had been obstructed. The defendants vociferously objected, but the judge allowed that to go to the jury. So, that case is not like this case, a plain error case. It is a harmless error case. And furthermore, the respondents -- or the -- the defendants in Stirone had a plausible claim that they were deprived of notice of the kinds of charges that they would actually face at trial; whereas in this case, there is not a claim, a plausible claim, that the defendants did not know that they would face an increased sentence if the Government established that the crime involved more than 50 grams of cocaine base.",
  "It's a little unclear, Justice Kennedy, whether the defendant can do that because typically the Government has not acquiesced and the courts have not been hospitable to partial pleas of guilty. And in effect, the defendant would be tendering a partial plea to an aggravated drug offense and then asking the judge to decide one element of the offense. Under pre-Apprendi law, that procedure would not be followed in any circuit. Now, there have been some defendants who really would be willing to plead to the underlying offense and contest drug quantity, and I haven't had a chance to see whether that has played out in the district courts with any courts allowing that to happen.",
  "No, Justice Kennedy. We allege the amount of threshold quantity of drugs that we believe we can prove at trial. If the trial evidence then establishes that a rational jury could find guilt on the underlying offense but still have a doubt about drug quantity, then the Government would be entitled to a lesser included offense.",
  "Correct. And -- and the lower courts have understood that that's the appropriate analysis in a case like that.",
  "We can't do it in this case, Justice Kennedy, which is why, in effect, the result that the court of appeals achieved is a tremendous windfall for the defendants. They never raised a constitutional objection at trial. They never contested the amount of drugs involved in the offense. The statute clearly authorizes a life term for the conduct that was proved, and the evidence supports that --",
  "Well, the objection could take place at trial when a defendant could have said the Government has to prove this quantity up to the jury or it could --",
  "Well, that's --",
  "That was just what I was about to say, Justice Souter. The -- the most pertinent time for the defendant to object would be at sentencing, and there are defendants who raise the kind of constitutional objection that this Court alluded to in the Jones decision in 1999 and later accepted in the Apprendi decision in the year 2000. There were defendants who raised that constitutional objection, and they are entitled to the benefit of harmless error review. Those defendants who do not raise that constitutional claim are subject to plain error review. And this Court has repeatedly recognized that even the type of error that might entitle a defendant to reversal on harmless error review, regardless of the strength of the evidence, does not automatically entitle the defendant to relief on plain error review. In Johnson v. United States, this Court considered a very analogous type of error. There the trial court convicted the defendant of a perjury offense without sending materiality to the petty jury. So, there was no petty jury determination of materiality. The defendant made no objection to that, and on appeal, this Court held that the appropriate standard is plain error review because the defendant had never objected. And when the evidence is overwhelming and uncontestable -- and uncontested at trial, the Court concluded that it is affirmance that supports the integrity of the judicial system rather than reversal.",
  "The objection --",
  "The objection would not be irrelevant because -- for two different reasons. First of all, the -- the defendant, had he objected at the pertinent time and had the Government concluded that this was an objection that we should worry about, could have sought indictments on other counts relating to substantive drug violations if it believed that the sentence that it was about to obtain was not sufficient. We're not in that position today because it's the year 2002, and the statute of limitations will have run on many other drug offenses that we might have brought.",
  "Well, any -- a substantive drug count is a separate offense from a conspiracy offense. This Court has held that in Felix v. United States and reaffirmed it more broadly in United States v. Dixon. So, there would have been no double jeopardy objection. But the Government is no longer in the position where we can extricate ourselves from the -- the dilemma that the court of appeals has placed us in. These defendants will not receive the sentence that the sentencing guidelines called for and that the statute authorizes. And the fact that they did not make a timely objection puts them in a very different position than a defendant would be who had timely objected.",
  "That's right. That's right.",
  "The disparity in sentencing is large both from the Government's point of view and from the defendant's point of view. The way that the Government looks at this question is would the defendant have gotten the same sentence if he had been accorded the procedures that he now claims that he should have been given. If the Government had understood that it had to obtain an indictment that mentioned drug quantity and it had understood that the Constitution required the jury, not the judge, to make that finding, would the defendant be better off or the same off? That is exactly the kind of analysis that the Court used in Johnson v. United States and Neder v. United States. It looked at whether the -- the availability of the procedure that the defendant has been deprived of would have made a difference to him. Of course, it would make a difference to him if he could have compelled the sentencing judge to drop down to 20 years as a result of the Government's failure to put drug quantity in the indictment, and that's what would happen today if this case were unfolding in a post-Apprendi world. But in a pre-Apprendi world, particularly where the defendant didn't object, it makes more sense to look at the problem as one of a deprivation of procedure and to ask whether the possession of the procedure would have --",
  "In that kind of case, our position would be the same, that particularly on plain error review, the Court should look to the entire --",
  "Right, even though --",
  "Well, it's not clear that -- that Neder wouldn't apply to it. It's true that in Neder itself, the Government proved up all of the evidence relevant to materiality at the trial. But in many cases, that were tried --",
  "That's right. We would. But, as Your Honor has indicated, the Court wouldn't have to agree with that in order to sustain in this case. And this case is the far more typical one in which the grand jury investigation itself developed substantial evidence of drug quantity. Everybody knew that before the trial, and the trial evidence itself is where the evidence of drug quantity was adduced.",
  "No, it's not the position that we're taking, Justice Scalia. And the logic of -- of the Government's position in this case doesn't have to go to a total omission of any grand jury indictment at all. Just as in Neder, the Court made perfectly clear that although harmless error analysis would apply to the omission of an element, it would not apply to a directed verdict --",
  "Well, there -- there is a class of cases in which the Court will find an effect on substantial rights without regard to the strength of the evidence.",
  "And those cases are called structural error cases. And as the Court is well aware, that's a very narrow category. It was hotly debated in the Neder case whether structural error did apply to the petty jury's failure to decide an element to the offense, and the Court held that it was not a case of structural error. Even the dissenting view in Neder, however, recognized that when there wasn't an objection at trial and the case comes up on plain error review and the Court might find an effect on substantial rights, it's still not required to reverse. It applies the -- the test that was articulated in United States v. Olano and in Johnson v. United States, was there an effect on the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings.",
  "Well, that's all the Court needs to hold in order to conclude that the court of appeals erred in this case because the court of appeals in this case got to the fourth step of plain error review, after finding an effect on substantial rights, and then it held that we really can't say what the grand jury would have done. We're not permitted to speculate about that because the grand jury is a body that operates without any legal restrictions at all on whether it can charge or not. That proposition that the grand jury is essentially free to charge or not, regardless of the evidence, is inconsistent with the historical record of the way grand juries operated. The charges that were given by members of this Court sitting on circuit in the early years of this Nation made clear that grand juries had a duty to indict when there was probable cause to believe that an offense had been committed. And the grand jurors' oath similarly reflected that grand jurors should indict when the evidence justifies that.",
  "Well, if that case took place, as this one did, in a legal regime in which the Government didn't believe it had to get a grand jury indictment on the point, then I suppose my answer to that is if we had known, we could have gone back to the grand jury and gotten a superseding --",
  "Oh, we could have gotten a superseding indictment.",
  "And -- and that's what's odd about this case. All parties in this case proceeded on the theory that it wasn't necessary to go to the grand jury, and that's the explanation on this record for why there's nothing --",
  "That's true, but the defendant on this case proceeded on the same theory as we did. The defendant never objected. The defendant never believed that there was a contest as to the amount of drug quantity in question that increased the sentence. And the result is that the entire sentencing proceeding unfolded with all parties fully well understanding that the legal regime in place at the time meant that drug quantity did not have to be charged in the indictment. And the proposition that a grand jury is free to reject the evidence of drug quantity and determine itself that it just doesn't want to charge the greater offense would be fundamentally at odds with the democratic system in this country. Congress has voted a regime in which drug quantity can increase the penalties. The evidence in this case established to the satisfaction of the Government that those increased quantities were there, and therefore the increased penalties should be applied.",
  "You could make that argument, Justice Souter, but in a post-Apprendi environment, Apprendi is a sufficiently well-known decision of this Court that no prosecutor would responsibly go to sentencing and say I would like to have an increased sentence regardless of the fact that we didn't charge drug quantity. And it's hard for me to imagine that there are defendants or judges that wouldn't catch the error if the prosecutor didn't itself bring it to the attention of a court.",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we would because of reasoning analogous to -- the Court used in Neder v. United States. The underlying values of the right in question are not impaired. The evidence was so strong that no rational grand jury could have failed to find the increased drug quantity and the defendants were not deprived of notice and an opportunity to contest it. So, even though there was error, the error has to be weighed against the important values of essentially depriving society and the Government of the sentence that Congress prescribed for the kind of offense in question. And weighing those against each other, the conclusion should be that the court of appeals should affirm rather than reverse.",
  "That's correct. And most of the cases that we are dealing with in this transitional era of drug prosecutions that were tried before Apprendi but are now on appeal after Apprendi, do not involve objections by the defendant in the trial court. They are almost all plain error cases, and a ruling on the fourth prong of plain error analysis that concludes that in this scenario it doesn't offend the integrity and public reputation of judicial proceedings or their fairness to affirm rather than reverse would be a outcome that would resolve almost all of the litigation that has occurred in this area. If the Court has no further questions, I'll reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Unless the Court has any questions, the Government waives rebuttal.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has made clear that conspiracy is an inchoate offense, the essence of which is the agreement to commit an unlawful act.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that it means an uncompleted offense, activities that have not yet progressed to the point of having violated a substantive provision of the criminal law, yet which represent a sufficient step to warrant legal intervention under the doctrine of either attempt or conspiracy.",
  "Yes, Justice Scalia, except that word seems not to have appeared in this Court's opinions.",
  "Well, in the case of a conspiracy, Justice Kennedy --",
  "It -- it may -- it means that with --",
  "-- with -- right. With reference to the object offense. So a conspiracy is an agreement to commit an offense. The offense has not yet been formed. It has not actually been realized, but the conspirators have agreed to commit the offense. And the law of conspiracy deems it appropriate for society to intervene at the stage at which the conspirators have entered into that agreement so as to protect society against two things.",
  "Justice O'Connor, under the drug statute, this Court held in United States v. Shabani that there is no requirement of proof of an overt act in order to punish a drug conspiracy.",
  "The conspiracy terminates, Justice O'Connor, either when the conspirators achieve the objective that they have agreed to carry out, or when they have abandoned efforts to do so. That fundamentally reflects the principle that the essence --",
  "No, not automatically, Justice Scalia.",
  "That individual will -- in order to accomplish a withdrawal from the conspiracy has to do more than simply leave it. The law of withdrawal of a -- on withdrawal from a conspiracy requires that the conspirator do some affirmative act to terminate the existence of the conspiracy either by going to law enforcement, or by communicating to his fellow conspirators that he's done with the venture and he's out of it. But the termination of the participation of one co-conspirator through withdrawal or abandonment or telling law enforcement does not terminate the conspiracy. The very nature of conspiracy is a group of individuals who have come together to carry out an unlawful act, and in order for the conspiracy to do that, it frequently will grow and enlarge its membership. Other members may drop out. But so long as there is a common agreement to commit a definable crime or unlawful act, the conspiracy continues.",
  "Well, this Court has never addressed the question, and I could find no cases in the common law that had addressed the question. Certainly under the common law, you cannot have a unilateral conspiracy, although the Model Penal Code would have allowed that. There may, however, be policy reasons to hold that once a conspirator has embarked upon his venture, even if all of the other conspirators are arrested and give up the effort, that one lone conspirator who still soldiers on, without knowing that the other conspirators have abandoned it, might properly be held liable for seeking to accomplish the aims of the conspiracy.",
  "If such an animal exists, it would be a conspiracy in which all members but one have abandoned the objective. In a case like this, however, where what happens is that two members of a multi-member conspiracy are arrested, one of them becomes a Government agent, the other one perhaps does not -- and it's not clear that he did abandon the efforts to accomplish the goals of the conspiracy -- but there are many others at large who are continuing to carry out the conspiracy, the criminal agreement persists. And where the Ninth Circuit got off on the wrong foot was by believing that a conspiracy ends when its goals have been defeated. When the object of the conspiracy has been defeated, the Ninth Circuit thought, the conspiracy is over. That, however, is contradictory to the fundamental principle of conspiracy law that the essence of the crime is the agreement between the parties to carry out an unlawful act, and to take the --",
  "Conspiracy to distribute and deliver marijuana and cocaine.",
  "As the case comes to this Court, the conspiracy that survived was the conspiracy to distribute that cocaine and marijuana that had been seized. But what's crucial is that those conspirators who remained liable were entirely unaware that the Government had intervened and frustrated the objective of the conspiracy. And I think that the hypothetical that makes clear why the Ninth Circuit went wrong is the instance where the Government enters the market in a reverse sting operation and goes into the market as a seller, offering to sell drugs, and a collective of individuals decides to pool their resources and arrange to purchase the drugs that the Government is offering. It is highly likely that the Government has no intention and never had any intention of delivering actual drugs. Therefore, the goal of the conspirators is frustrated at the inception. They don't know it, but they could never accomplish the object of their conspiracy. Yet, it's settled in the Ninth Circuit and elsewhere that the conspirators can still be held liable because their agreement to perform an act which, under the facts as they understand them, would be unlawful.",
  "That's correct. Conspiracy intervenes at an earlier stage, Justice Stevens. The traditional Federal rule is that in an attempt, you need the intent to perform the illegal act, plus a substantial step towards its completion. The law of attempt has always required a little bit more activity on the part of the defendant before the Government can intervene and penalize it. And that's in part because of the need to have some corroborating evidence that the defendant actually did intend to carry out an illegal act and to avoid penalizing something as a thought crime.",
  "Well, the conspiracy charge, Justice Ginsburg, remained the same in both. In the -- the indictment was not changed. It was a single indictment that alleged the conspirators formed an agreement at a date unknown to the grand jury, but by November 18th, 1997, to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana. In the original trial, the parties were unaware of the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States versus Cruz, which forms the basis for the legal rule that the Government challenges here. And it, therefore, proceeded on the -- what we believe to be the wholly correct theory that respondents could be held liable for joining that conspiracy on November 19th when they agreed to become couriers to move the drugs further down the road in Idaho. They did not know that the drugs had actually been seized earlier by the Government and that the Government was watching them. So the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Cruz meant that what the Government had argued in the first case no longer was sufficient to support conspiracy liability.",
  "It doesn't lapse through a period of time, Justice Kennedy. What could cause the conspiracy to end is the conspirators' wholly abandoning pursuit of the objectives of the conspiracy. In other words, if all of the conspirators on the outside -- those who were in Arizona on the sending end and those who were on Idaho on the delivery end -- had all concluded that something has gone wrong with this shipment, the drugs have disappeared, they could have abandoned the narrowest version of the conspiracy --",
  "Well, the people who were in jail were the couriers, not the principals.",
  "Correct, because so long as those individuals who are involved in the conspiracy are still trying to accomplish its objective, the conspiracy is still alive. And as the -- as in the case of the Government sting where there's never any drugs in the outset, the conspiracy is impossible as a matter of fact for the conspirators to successfully accomplish. But if it is accepted that that can be a crime, where there's a Government sting at the outset, then surely the Government's intervention in midstream doesn't automatically terminate the conspiracy as a matter of law, which is what the Ninth Circuit held.",
  "Justice O'Connor, it would depend on whether the powdered sugar is supplied by the Government under the representation that it is cocaine, or whether the defendants are actually seeking to move powdered sugar knowing that they are seeking to move powdered sugar.",
  "Liability. Because the -- the question of conspiracy liability is judged by what the actor perceives to be the facts.",
  "Well, it is the same, Justice Kennedy, and -- and the uniform position in the Federal courts is that it is. That would be a mistake of fact, and when the conspirators or the person who's attempting to commit a crime has the intent to commit a crime and takes a substantial step for it, the fact that unbeknownst to him some aspect of the universe is such that he can't complete the crime does not defeat the accomplishment of the objective.",
  "No. The -- the modern rule, Justice Scalia, is that there is a crime. In this country, the earliest case that addressed it and the case that all of us are familiar with from law school is People versus Jaffe, a New York Court of Appeals case from 1906. And that case did, indeed, hold -- as Justice Kennedy has described it -- that if the person is receiving what he believes to be stolen goods and the goods are not stolen, he is not liable. But the modern focus on attempt law is on the intent of the actor to commit an illegal act, and the fact that unbeknownst to him there are circumstances that prevent him from accomplishing the completed crime does not defeat his liability for an attempt. In other words, attempt law and conspiracy law have, to an extent, converged on the policy that the importance of inchoate crimes is to get at dangerous actors.",
  "There -- the only thing that there is from this Court, Justice O'Connor, are two opinions that have addressed the obstruction of justice statute, Osborn versus United States and United States versus Aguilar. In both of those cases, the Court was dealing with a statute that didn't use the word attempt. It used the word endeavor. And the Court made quite clear that the impossibility of the defendant accomplishing the objective of his crime doesn't defeat liability. In Osborn, it was an individual who was attempting to bribe a juror. Unbeknownst to him, the intermediary, who he was using to pay the bribe, was working with the FBI. And of course, the bribe was not going to be paid. The juror was not going to be corrupted. And yet, the Court held that an endeavor to commit the crime is punishable.",
  "Yes. The Model Penal Code goes very far in the direction of the intent-based focus of attempt law and conspiracy law. In the Model Penal Code, there is no defense for impossibility of any kind, fact or law. What the Model Penal Code does, however, is allow, in certain extreme cases that it wasn't able to craft a principle for, a power to a judge to either reduce the grade of a crime or to dismiss it. And the Model Penal Code was thinking about hypotheticals which have not come up in any cases that -- that anyone has actually found, such as where an individual believes that he can kill through incantations and voodoo and sets about to do so. Under an orthodox, doctrinaire approach to principles of attempt law, that individual has the intent to kill, and has carried out a substantial step. Many commentators have said that should not occasion liability because it's inherently impossible that the actor will achieve his goal and in reality that person is probably not a dangerous individual who warrants punishment.",
  "Only a matter of degree, Mr. Chief Justice, and for that reason, the Model Penal Code rejected a legal rule that would carve out inherent impossibility and said that it's really something that should go to whether a judge should reduce the grade of a crime or dismiss it. Our position is that that sort of --",
  "I don't know if there are any other instances where the Model Penal Code does it, but our position is that the sounder approach is to --",
  "-- leave those cases in the hands of prosecutorial discretion and the common sense of juries. The fact is that there really are no hypotheticals in real cases that resemble the killer by incantation.",
  "The Ninth Circuit, I believe, made a -- a linguistic mistake. There are an abundance of cases that say that a conspiracy ends when its goal is either accomplished or defeated, and those cases, read in context, mean that if the conspirators actually abandon their efforts to complete the crime, or all of them are arrested and they're in custody and they're really not in a position to go forward anymore, the conspiracy ends at that point. And frequently that sort of a determination is made for purposes of the admission of co-conspirator statements under 801(d)(2)(E). You want to know whether the conspiracy is alive so you can determine whether to admit post-arrest statements by one conspirator against another conspirator. And in those cases, it makes perfect sense to say that the conspiracy ended when all of the co-conspirators are arrested and have given up. The Ninth Circuit took that language -- the language referring to the defeat of the object of the conspiracy -- and took it literally, and the effect was to create a defense of factual impossibility. And the court actually used those words. It was factually impossible for the conspirators to complete their crime. Therefore, the conspiracy was over as a matter of law.",
  "It all depends, Justice Breyer, on whether --",
  "-- on whether he's still attempting to achieve the goal of the conspiracy. There are a -- a number --",
  "Well, not -- not necessarily, Justice Breyer. In this case, for example, one of the two arrested couriers, Sotelo, reportedly told Arce, the other arrested co-conspirator, that they should both tell a lie to the authorities and then try to escape. I mean, that --",
  "Correct.",
  "That's correct. So long as the statement isn't made in furtherance --",
  "No. What it may show is that the statement wasn't made in furtherance of the conspiracy. If he's simply talking to his neighbor, it may not be doing anything to carry out the aims of the conspiracy. If, on the other hand --",
  "Right. The statement to be admitted as a statement of a co-conspirator must be both during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. So to continue your hypothetical, if you suppose that A comes out, and then tries to communicate through intermediaries that he knows where the drugs are and that people should take efforts to secrete them before the authorities seize them, then that statement could be admitted as a co-conspirator's declaration.",
  "Correct.",
  "Actually, I -- I think the -- the way the case comes to this Court, the involvement of the two couriers begins on November 19th, the day after the drugs are seized, when they're recruited.",
  "That's right. That's right.",
  "As the case comes to this Court, that's right. When -- when the case was charged, the parties weren't focusing on Cruz and the case was just charged in the way conspiracies normally are; namely, the grand jury alleges that the conspiracy came into existence by a particular date when it could be certain that it did come into existence. It may have come into existence earlier, and the grand jury's charge says from a date uncertain, but at least by November 18, there was a conspiracy in place and the following four individuals were -- are to be charged as co-conspirators, plus others unknown to the grand jury. Now, in light of the way the facts actually panned out at -- at the trial, and given the holdings of the Ninth Circuit that the Government failed to prove pre-seizure involvement on the part of the respondent couriers, the indictment might have more accurately been written to say that on November 18th, at least, a conspiracy was formed, and by November 19th the respondents joined it. The --",
  "I don't think so, Justice Kennedy, because the crucial aspect of a conspiracy and a defining, limiting principle is the scope of the nature of the agreement. Courts have worked out a multi-factor test to determine whether you have one agreement or two agreements. And it focuses not on literal identity of membership or complete chronological co-existence of the participation of each conspirator, but whether there's a common agreement which each is seeking to advance forward in his own way and whether the excess of one is dependent on the efforts of the others. Now, in this case, construed most narrowly, the indictment alleges a conspiracy to move drugs, staring in Phoenix, Arizona, through Las Vegas, and all the way up to Idaho and then perhaps beyond that. That is the conspiracy in which respondents were involved as substitute couriers brought in to move the truck from the Karcher Mall in Idaho to its ultimate destination. That's the same conspiracy that existed at the outset. The original couriers, had they not been arrested, would have completed the trip. So what you have is one common agreement in which all participants are working to achieve the same goal, and there is only a switch of two members, the two couriers, midstream --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, if you read the indictment as alleging that they were involved on the 18th and we didn't show that they were involved until the 19th -- and as the case comes to this Court, that's what we showed -- you have a variance between the allegations of the indictment and the proof at trial. And the settled law on variances is that it is no defense for a defendant if the proof varies from the conspiracy charged in the indictment so long as the conspiracy that's proved up is within the scope of the indictment, a lesser included conspiracy, so to speak, and the defendants suffer no prejudice from the variation. Now, in this case, everyone knew from the outset that the centerpiece of the Government's proof against respondents was going to be the observation of them driving up after the call was placed to the Arizona supplier of the drugs and getting into the truck and driving the truck away down the highway in Idaho, following which they were stopped and gave completely unbelievable stories about what they were doing driving around with a truck filled with drugs. There was no prejudice to the defendants in defending against a conspiracy that was proved up based on the events of the 18th because those events were always going to be at the heart of the Government's proof that they were liable. So absent a showing of prejudice, the variance between the allegations of the indictment and the proof at trial does not warrant any relief.",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's -- the essence of our argument is that -- and the Ninth Circuit in ruling that the evidence was insufficient did not rely on principles of variance or principles of multiple conspiracies or any other fact-based, record-based analysis that would show that the Government didn't prove the conspiracy alleged in the indictment. What the Ninth Circuit relied on was its holding in Cruz which is that a conspiracy ends when the Government intervenes and renders its completion impossible. And the Ninth Circuit, therefore, reasoned that respondents could not have joined the conspiracy alleged in the indictment because that conspiracy was, as a factual matter, over. Accordingly, the only way on the Ninth Circuit's view that the Government could win this case is if the Government showed that respondents joined the conspiracy before the seizure of the drugs, or if they were involved in a broader conspiracy that involved other drugs. Only under those two assumptions did the Ninth Circuit think that the Government could prevail. And the Ninth Circuit held that the evidence was not sufficient to prove either of those other conspiratorial activities. It never questioned that the evidence was overwhelming to prove a conspiracy to participate in the distribution of drugs on November 19th, when respondents showed up and got in the truck. And because the Ninth Circuit was wrong in its holding that a conspiracy terminates when it becomes factually impossible of accomplishment, the rest of its analysis also crumbles. I'd like to save the remainder of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To address the jury instruction issue first, the jury in this case was instructed in accordance with the requirements of Cruz, and therefore, the jury was asked to find whether there was evidence of respondents' involvement in the conspiracy before the seizure of the drugs or, alternatively, whether they were involved in a broader conspiracy, not limited to the drugs that were seized. At pages 6 through 8 of our reply brief at the petition stage, we addressed the consequences of what happens if this Court should conclude that the Cruz legal rule is incorrect. And in essence, our position is that any rational jury that found guilt under the Cruz instructions also would have found that respondents were involved in a conspiracy to distribute the very drugs that they drove to the Karcher Mall to pick up. That was the centerpiece of the Government's evidence, that respondents were involved in a conspiracy, and the fact that the jury may have found that respondents were involved in a longer conspiracy, or in other conspiracies wouldn't detract from the rationality of its necessarily concluding that the respondents were also involved in this conspiracy. Even if this Court didn't agree with that rationale or chose not to reach it, it's important to note that the effect of the Ninth Circuit's holding is to find insufficient evidence to prove the crime charged in the indictment. That doesn't leave the Government with the option of pursuing a new trial on correct instructions with the Cruz findings purged from them. It would mean that respondents have permanent immunity from the crime that's charged in the indictment. If this Court were to conclude that Cruz is wrong, and either this Court or the Ninth Circuit also concluded that the jury instructions somehow prejudiced the defendants, the remedy would be a new trial. It is also important, I believe, to note that the -- the principle that the Ninth Circuit has adopted would go contrary to what this Court has noted about the evolution of conspiracies. In a case called Blumenthal versus United States, which we did not cite in our briefs, but it appears at 332 U.S. 539, the Court noted that conspiracies involving elaborate arrangements generally are not born full-grown. Rather, they mature by successive stages which are necessary to bring in the essential parties. And in this case, two essential parties were brought in not at the inception of the conspiracy, but after events that the conspirators were aware of required that new couriers were brought in. They were not aware that the Government had seized the drugs, but they knew that they needed new couriers. They brought them in. Under the principles of Blumenthal, that's all one conspiracy. Respondents' counsel has mentioned the Model Penal Code provisions. The Model Penal Code at section 5.01 addresses the question of impossibility under attempt law and concludes that the defense should not be recognized and at section 5.03 does the same for conspiracy. Finally -- thank you.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Virginia has singled out cross-burning with the intent to intimidate because it is a particularly threatening form of such conduct. History has revealed that cross-burning has been used as a tool to intimidate and put people in fear of bodily violence in a way that no other symbol has been used.",
  "Justice O'Connor, our analysis of the intimidation element is that it's akin to a threat to put somebody in bodily harm. And as such --",
  "Apart from the presumption or prima facie case provision that Your Honor called attention to earlier, the prohibitory language of the statute does not reach cross-burning when it is done solely for the point of expressing a particular view.",
  "Justice O'Connor, it raises separate issues that are distinct from whether a cross-burning statute can single out that particular activity and prohibit it on the basis of its threatening --",
  "It is, but the Virginia Supreme Court approached the issue by first asking whether the cross-burning provision, insofar as it targeted cross-burning --",
  "-- ran afoul of this Court's decision in R.A.V., and it only then turned to the prima facie case provision --",
  "-- and concluded that it rendered the statute overbroad. The United States has not taken a position on the validity of the prima facie case provision, which does raise distinct issues because it could allow a jury in certain instances to infer solely from the act of cross-burning, without any other evidence at all --",
  "That was the instruction given in one of the two cases. In the Elliott case, there was no instruction --",
  "-- whatsoever on the prima facie case provision, and so Elliott's case is somewhat similar -- differently situated from -- from the Black case. But a cross-burning statute like this functions not like a fighting words statute which seeks to avert breaches of the peace by the use of particularly obnoxious language that would induce anybody to strike back with a violent reaction. It functions instead on the theory that a signal to violence, or a warning that violence will come is not protected within the First Amendment. It is a prohibited form of conduct, and when done as here by an act of putting a flaming cross in a place with the intent to actually put somebody in fear of bodily harm, it's not a form of protected conduct that directly implicates the First Amendment. It's --",
  "Justice Scalia, my understanding of Virginia law is that it has a -- a written threats statute which would cover any threat of any kind in writing, but it does not have a general intimidation or threat statute that would reach other means of oral expression.",
  "Well, what Virginia has done is take something which has historically been used as a particularly dangerous means of intimidation because it has so often been followed up by actual violence and establish a prohibition that is limited to that. Rather than sweeping in other classes of speech that may raise questions when you come close to the line of whether it is or isn't intimidating and therefore might chill free expression, Virginia has chosen to focus on what conduct occurred within its borders that caused particular harms. And what --",
  "There is a common law of -- of putting somebody in fear of bodily harm through the tort law. And there were similarly antecedent criminal provisions that are --",
  "No, there is not, Justice Kennedy, and it's crucial to underscore why that is. The harms that can be brought about by threat statutes are not only putting somebody in fear of bodily harm and thereby disrupting their movements, but providing a signal that the violence may actually occur. It may not occur tomorrow, the next day, or next week, but it's like a sword of Damocles hanging over the person whose head -- who has been threatened. And in that sense it creates a pervasive fear that can be ongoing for a considerable amount of time.",
  "1952 originally.",
  "Well, I think they're coextensive, Justice Thomas, because it is --",
  "Well, I don't mean to understate it, and I entirely agree with Your Honor's description of how the cross has been used as an instrument of intimidation against minorities in this country. That has justified 14 States in treating it as a distinctive --",
  "It --",
  "It absolutely was, and for that reason can be legitimately proscribed without fear that the focusing on a cross -- burning of a cross with the intent to intimidate would chill protected expression. This is a very different case than the R.A.V. case that was before the Court. There the Court was confronted with a statute that prohibited the use of language based on particular messages of group-based hatred. And in singling out speech based on the content, the State was expressing disagreement with particular messages. In the Virginia statute, and in the other statutes that the States have, the focus is not on any particular message. It is on the effect of intimidation, and the intent to create a climate of fear and, as Justice Thomas has said, a climate of terror.",
  "I would, Justice Souter, and I think it's for the reason that Your Honor pointed out in his concurrence in Hill versus Colorado. Merely because a particular activity might have become the signature of a certain ideological group does not prevent the State from addressing and regulating what is proscribable about that activity.",
  "Well, that would --",
  "I think that would raise a much more difficult question because notwithstanding the fact that there is a very powerful linkage in our society such that the State is justified in singling out the cross, it may be that under certain contexts, a particular individual is attempting to express a message rather than attempting to intimidate. And it -- it is important to note that merely expressing a message of race-based hatred is not something that the State can proscribe --",
  "There -- there are -- there are hypothetical cases that one can imagine, the desert, the bedroom --",
  "It might well be, Justice Stevens, but I think that a law that is more tailored, as this one is, and reaches those acts of cross-burning where it is the very intent of the actor to put a person or group of people in fear of bodily harm makes it quite clear that a -- that statute aims at the proscribable feature of that conduct and not at the protected feature, namely race-based hatred.",
  "Justice Stevens, may I answer? Justice Ginsburg, the inference provision is problematic because it does raise the potential that a wholly protected act of cross-burning, which this Court might find within the scope of the First Amendment, could serve as the exclusive source of evidence from which a conviction could be rendered for unprotected conduct. And it's for that reason that most States don't have any sort of analogous provision. The Federal Government doesn't, and it raises distinct problems from the targeting focus of the law that's at issue here.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address the question of jurisdiction first. Dr. Sell's claim should be analyzed as having two related but distinct components. One component of his claim is a Harper-style objection to forcible medication by the Government in order to render him competent to stand trial. The second component of his claim is a Riggins-style objection to the fairness of his trial if, in fact, he is medicated and restored to competence and tried. The Riggins-style claim is clearly not amenable to review under the collateral order doctrine. Dr. Sell has not even been tried. There is clearly no determination yet whether he can be given a fair trial, whether he will receive one, and he may raise an objection to the fairness of his trial at the conclusion of the criminal case and obtain reversal of his conviction at that time, but the Harper-style claim is amenable to review under the collateral order doctrine. It deals with a right that is effectively unreviewable if not reviewed now, just as this Court's cases addressing double jeopardy claims and qualified immunity claims are effectively unreviewable if not reviewed --",
  "Correct, and --",
  "-- that right would be lost if the trial occurs. Here, one of his claims is a right not to be medicated. That right will be lost if, in fact, he is medicated.",
  "Well, that's right and that's because the court has concluded that there is no right not to be tried in the relevant sense without particular evidence that will be suppressed. What that reflects is a right whose remedy would be a right not to have the evidence used against them, which could include reversal of a conviction, so that kind of a claim is reviewable at the end of the case. But taking Dr. Sell's claims at face value, he's saying it will violate my First Amendment rights and my substantive due process rights to be medicated, and those claims are, in a sense, independent of the main criminal action. Justice Scalia is correct that in a sense they could be viewed as claims that could be brought independently, but I think under the statutory scheme that exists they are better brought in the context of the criminal case, rather than through an independent APA action or some other form of action.",
  "Justice Scalia, I'm a little bit less concerned about the practical consequences, although I share the view that the delay of the criminal case and, more importantly, concretely here, the delay in starting the medication is a critical problem that results from collateral order review, but there are two things that I think reduce any of the costs associated with permitting collateral order review. First, if this Court does settle the fundamental question in favor of the Government and determines that, on an appropriate showing that this court defines, medication for the purpose of restoring competence is permissible, in the future, criminal defendants will not be able to assert that broad, unsettled, and important legal issue and obtain a stay of the medication order in order to litigate it. What they would have to show is that the actual application of those standards to the particular facts of the case is incorrect. That will most likely be reviewed under a more deferential standard. Courts of appeals can establish expedited calendars to dispose of frivolous claims, and can weed out those claims that don't --",
  "It would be a new exception as applied to the particular facts of this case, but the standards of the collateral order doctrine I think are met, and there is --",
  "Justice O'Connor, I do think that a heightened form of review is appropriate. I don't have any case that has precisely articulated the correct standard of review, but in all of this Court's substantive due process cases, what the Court has done is balanced the interests of the individual in his liberty, or in this case in the First Amendment concerns, against the Government's interest in achieving the objectives that it has.",
  "In order to render the defendant competent to stand trial, Your Honor, the Government would have to have some sort of a finding that would justify --",
  "Well, I don't think that that makes any difference at all, Justice Kennedy.",
  "Well, the Government's authority here is the -- derives from the fact that Dr. Sell has been indicted on serious criminal charges, and he has been -- been found incompetent to stand trial on those charges. The Government will be completely unable to achieve what this Court has recognized to be the compelling interest in adjudicating serious criminal charges.",
  "It's the same due process question as presented here, Justice Kennedy, with the possible difference that our interests may be greater with respect to a person who has been charged than with respect to a person who has not. Material witnesses are held all the time without bail.",
  "Well, the authority would be an application of any principle that this Court adopts in this case to permit us to medicate the defendant. As I indicated, there is a distinction between a witness and a defendant, but here we deal with someone who has already been placed under indictment, which is to an -- a certain extent a significant restriction on liberty as well as an indication of a paramount Government interest in adjudicating the charges.",
  "Well, I think maybe it's important to back up and look at how this case came to be before the Court. Dr. Sell was found to be incompetent to stand trial, and pursuant to statute section 4241(d) of title 18, he was committed to the Bureau of Prisons for treatment to determine whether his competency could be restored. In the context of that confinement at a medical facility, pursuant to regulations of the Bureau of Prisons, the Bureau of Prisons determined that antipsychotic medication and nothing else was the means by which the Government could restore him to competency.",
  "No, the regulations do indeed address the potential of medication for the purpose of rendering competence to stand trial. That's one of the criteria that is given to the Bureau of Prisons when it accepts a patient for treatment under section 4241(d), and the bureau in fact made the finding that this was a medically appropriate treatment for a person who has the illness, the serious delusional disorder that Dr. Sell has, and that this treatment had a substantial probability of restoring him to competence. The --",
  "The administrative order, and it's the same administrative order that I referred to in answering Justice Kennedy's question, Justice Ginsburg, does rest on both restoration of competency and to a certain extent on concerns about danger. What happened after the Bureau of Prisons entered that order is not that it immediately implemented it and began to medicate Dr. Sell. Rather, it stayed the order, and Dr. Sell then sought judicial review in the very court that had ordered his commitment, which is why I think that it was appropriate for the district court to hear this in the criminal action rather than under some separate APA action. This is the district court that had ordered Dr. Sell confined. The magistrate judge determined that the Government had not made a showing of dangerousness, which would have permitted medication under Washington v. Harper, but that it had adequately shown that medication was necessary in order to restore Dr. Sell to be competent for trial. Dr. Sell then appealed that determination to the district court, which entered its final decision saying that the Bureau of Prisons could medicate, there was a substantial probability of restoring competence, the antipsychotic medication was medically appropriate treatment for the psychotic illness that Dr. Sell had, and that there was a reasonable likelihood of a fair trial, and any particularized fair trial concerns that Dr. Sell was raising, involving effects on his demeanor, or his effects to relate to counsel, should be determined after the medication has been administered and it's been determined whether, in fact, he was restored to competence.",
  "Well, at that point, Mr. Short is correct that under 4241 he would then be referred over to the director of a medical facility where he would be held for confinement to determine, pursuant to section 4246, whether, if released, he would be dangerous to himself or others.",
  "And --",
  "It is not something that courts of appeals that I have seen have had to deal with, and this Court --",
  "Correct.",
  "I think it's a very particularized inquiry under the sub --",
  "Well --",
  "Justice Breyer, the question of what would happen if Dr. Sell were living safely in free society is obviously distinct from this case. There's no authority --",
  "I had taken Justice Breyer's question to involve somebody who's at liberty but not charged with a criminal offense.",
  "Yes to both.",
  "Justice Breyer --",
  "-- the question that you're asking is, how serious need the offense be in order to justify an intrusion on substantive due process interests, whether they be through psychiatric medication or through blood pressure --",
  "And I entirely agree that it needs to be a sufficiently serious offense to outweigh --",
  "Well, to the extent that a person was making a claim that, I'm not medically competent to go to trial because I have high blood pressure, and if I go to trial, I may have a heart attack and die. This actually happens. People will come into court and say, you can't try me now because I'm too fragile, I have a serious health condition, and courts then have to balance. It's essentially the same balancing test that's at issue in this case. They have to balance --",
  "It may be, Justice Stevens, relevant to the analysis to the extent that courts have held that the amount of time that a person can be held for treatment under 4241(d) cannot exceed the ultimate sentence that they would receive.",
  "No, it's not true in this case for a number of reasons. First of all, even limiting consideration to the medicaid fraud and money laundering charges, the test is the maximum sentence that the defendant could receive as a matter of statutory law, and he could receive a sentence --",
  "Well, this Court obviously hasn't addressed the question, and it would be free to weigh in --",
  "Yes, it probably is. Of course, he's also charged with attempted murder and conspiracy to murder charges.",
  "Well, to be --",
  "You're right, Justice Stevens, but to the extent that the question is, how long can the Government hold him for treatment, he's clearly indicted for attempted murder and conspiracy to murder charges, and the length that the Government can hold --",
  "No, because the Government's position here is that any felony case is serious enough --",
  "Well, again, if-- if a court were to hold -- it's not critical to my position, because my position is, it's statutory maximum. If the Court were to hold that we're not going to look at the attempted murder and conspiracy murder charges, we are only going to look at the sentencing guidelines sentence, and we are going to hold that he cannot be held for treatment longer than his ultimate potential sentence, then the Court would have no choice but to remand for treatment of Dr. Sell under 4246 to determine whether he should be civilly committed. Those are questions that were never litigated in any court, and are certainly not raised in the petition for certiorari. What is raised in the petition for certiorari is whether treatment to render a defendant competent to stand trial on a nonviolent offense is a sufficient Government interest.",
  "He has not been getting antipsychotic medication. He gets --",
  "Essentially, no, and the reason is that there is no other form of treatment, standing alone, that would have any likelihood of success with a person with delusional disorder, persecutory type. This is a serious thought disorder, interfering with Dr. Sell's ability to rationally understand what is going on in the world, and it's well-established in the medical literature that antipsychotic medication and nothing else is the only thing that may hold promise of treating the -- the ailment that he has. Now, the -- the --",
  "I -- Justice Souter, if a court were to attempt to make an order drug-specific for a patient it would be essentially ignoring the medical reality of what this treatment will entail. Now, Dr. Wolfson, the treating psychiatrist, or consulting psychiatrist at the hearing, testified that in his view there were two particular medications, quetiapine and olanzapine, which were likely to be the most suitable ones for Dr. Sell's case because of their very minimal side effect profile, that they would have a much better chance of not inducing sedation or other side effects that he might claim would interfere with the fairness of his trial. But he explained that he did not want to be locked into a particular medication because one of his hopes, as the psychiatrist on the case, is that Dr. Sell would participate in choosing, if he had been told, he's ordered to take medication, which medication he wanted to take. This is the kind of interactive process that doctors and patients have all the time, and for a court to superimpose some rigid rule up front that establishes this and only this medication can be administered is --",
  "Well, I -- I think the Court should be very cautious about superimposing a judicial decision making process on a --",
  "The -- the problem with that, Justice Ginsburg, is that the response that an individual patient has to a drug is individual-specific. Side effects can be described in general categories, but nobody knows what side effects will actually occur, or whether the drugs will be effective until they've been administered, and it is not uncommon for the treating psychiatrist to discover that a drug that may have a wildly, you know, significant side effect in one individual has none in another, and a drug that's anticipated to be entirely successful turns out not to be successful. One of the newer, new generation of drugs, the atypical drugs that have the more favorable side effect profiles in general may not turn out to be suitable for a particular patient.",
  "That would -- might be true, Justice Souter, if the Government's alternatives were antipsychotic medication and psychosurgery, so that the difference was dramatic between the two forms of treatment that are being proposed, but even looking at the, at the classes of drugs that are at issue here, the atypical drugs and the older generation of typical antipsychotic drugs, there are very important and dramatic differences between them, but they belong to a family of medications that are used for treatment all the time, and the psychiatrist's understanding of the various range of effects that might be achieved is not likely to be enhanced by subjecting that to judicial review, nor are the potential side effects so dramatically different that it calls for an entirely different substantive due process analysis.",
  "There is legislation that authorizes and requires the Bureau of Prisons to treat an individual to attempt to restore him to competency once he has been determined incompetent. That's what section 4241(d) says. Now, it does not --",
  "Correct, and it does not specifically refer to antipsychotic medication, but in 1984, when this legislation was enacted, it was well known that, for the kind of psychotic conditions that render a defendant incompetent to stand trial, it's antipsychotic medication or --",
  "You know, Justice Kennedy, I'll answer that question yes, but I recognize that it involves a very different set of considerations, because the intrusion through force feeding of somebody who wants to die might be considered to be a very different decision than treating an ill person's illness with medication that is the norm that's used to treat people with these kinds of disorders.",
  "Well, as a matter of the organization of Government, this Court has recognized that the ability to resolve criminal charges through the mechanism of a trial is a compelling interest in maintaining social order and peace, and in order to try these criminal charges, the Government has no option but to attempt to restore competency.",
  "Well, it -- it's quite clear that the Government may seize the person and hold them in pretrial detention, which is a --",
  "Not that this Court has considered, but this -- this kind of medication has to be judged against the backdrop of the nature of the intrusion and the efficacy of the treatment for those people who have this kind of disorder. Virtually everyone who is committed to the Bureau of Prisons' care for incompetency determinations has some form of psychotic disorder that can be treated. There are, of course, organic problems that cannot be treatable at all, and there are other kinds of mental illness that can create this, but the statistics that the Bureau of Prisons furnished to us in considering this case shows that 80 percent of the individuals who are committed take these drugs voluntarily. Of the remaining 20 percent who did not, there's very little indication that any sort of judicial relief has been sought through appellate review, and I think that's because these drugs enable someone who has serious psychotic orders to be restored to a point of rationality where they can make decisions about what they want to do with their life. So instead of remaining incompetent and perhaps being committed indefinitely to a Bureau of Prisons facility, where they may be warehoused without any treatment, or being released if they are not subject to civil commitment, so that they don't stand trial on criminal charges and suffer essentially no consequences, most individuals accept the fact, particularly after an initial round of treatment has rendered them competent so that thy can understand the benefits of this, that the medication is the appropriate, medically sanctioned way to deal with the disease that they have. And when the Government has no mechanism to achieve its essential interest in adjudicating criminal charges but for using these medically appropriate means, and it can show the, the items that have been laid out in our brief of medical appropriateness, no less-restrictive alternative, and that there's a reason to expect that a fair trial will not be precluded, the Government should appropriately have the authority to override the substantive due process interest that the defendant has asserted and medicate him.",
  "Yes, it would, Justice Stevens.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: What makes this case distinctive as a First Amendment case is the presence of a general law not directed at speech at all but directed at conduct that's under challenge and the absence of any expressive activity whatsoever by the person seeking to raise the overbreadth challenge. This Court's cases have entertained overbreadth challenges as a means of alleviating the chill of First Amendment rights of persons who are not before the Court, but the Court has never entertained overbreadth when the consequence of doing so would be to invalidate a general law that's primarily aimed at conduct and when the person who's raising the challenge did nothing to engage in speech or any expressive activity at all. The costs of an overbreadth challenge, this Court has recognized, are high because they prohibit the Government from enforcing a law against conduct that is not constitutionally protected. But those costs are magnified when the law under challenge is not merely a law that directs --",
  "I'm not sure that this Court would, Justice Stevens. It would then be in a posture more analogous to the J.H. Munson case that was before the Court in which the Court considered and Your Honor's separate opinion addressed the question of whether, when there was an independent State overbreadth analysis, could an aggrieved State official then bring the case to this Court. What is clear on the current record is that the Virginia Supreme Court cited and relied on --",
  "Well, the question there would be whether the State was sufficiently aggrieved so as to have standing under the principles announced --",
  "Well, the most relevant case is probably the Asarco decision in which the Court concluded that once the State court binds the State officials to a particular ruling, that there may be the requisite case or controversy to allow this Court to decide --",
  "That's right. And --",
  "Well, it has two aspects, Mr. Chief Justice. One aspect of it does relate to whether there is a case or controversy, and there clearly has to be a developed enough case or controversy to allow Article III to be invoked for this Court to announce First Amendment principles at all. And part of the overbreadth doctrine responds to those concerns. But another aspect of the overbreadth doctrine is purely prudential, and this Court has adopted those limits as a matter of -- of prudential principles to avoid the premature adjudication of hypothetical and abstract First Amendment questions.",
  "That's correct. I wouldn't dispute --",
  "Well, I think overbreadth is -- is an application of a more general principle that this Court has adopted on -- in various circumstances to allow a party who's before the Court and who is aggrieved to raise the rights of others. For example, in Batson challenges, the Court allows criminal defendants to raise the rights of the excluded jurors. This is an example of third party standing designed to implement First Amendment norms, but the Court has recognized that the costs of invalidating a law, when the person before the Court doesn't have constitutionally protected conduct, are high, and those costs are higher when what's being invalidated is not merely a law aimed at speech, but a law aimed at access, general conduct, as is this law.",
  "That is probably true unless the Court applies the Asarco principle to allow an aggrieved State official to bring the case here because its own supreme court has interfered with the implementation of Federal law --",
  "I think the answer to this paradox is that the State court can adopt much broader principles of law with respect to standing than this Court would impose, and it can administer them even when it's adjudicating Federal light -- rights. For example, a State could allow a purely advisory opinion to be issued by its State supreme court challenging this law by any citizen.",
  "That's true.",
  "Well, that -- that is an adjudication of the -- of the overbreadth challenge on the merits. It would be a determination that there is not sufficient real and substantial overbreadth to invalidate this law, and we do think that that is a correct analysis and would suffice to reject the Virginia Supreme Court's holding in this case.",
  "It's not exactly right, Justice Souter, because I think this is an area analogous to the Court's rules in criminal cases under Michigan v. Long where the Court has to decide, does this opinion rest on a question of Federal law or does it rest on a question of State law? And in Michigan v. Long, the Court adopted a presumption that if what a State court does is cite and rely on Federal precedents, we will presume that it did what it did because it thought it was compelled to by the force of this Court's decisions.",
  "I think it would only be a modest extension because in this case the court did not separately analyze the questions of standing as such from whether respondent could bring an overbreadth challenge, and the question wasn't posed with a --",
  "It -- what it --",
  "Let me -- let me explain it this way, Justice Souter. If this Court said the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine requires that State courts entertain overbreadth claims like this one even when it's a general law and even when the party before the court has been convicted of conduct that doesn't involve speech, then State courts would be required to follow that rule and could not adopt a different standing principle that was narrower and that would exclude respondent. And our reading of the Virginia Supreme Court's opinion is that Virginia either thought or assumed that it was required by this Court's cases to entertain an overbreadth challenge. The proper response, if the Court agrees that it's not the State court's obligation to entertain this overbreadth challenge, would be to vacate the judgment, announce the correct First Amendment principles, and remand the case to the Virginia Supreme Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.",
  "In this case, it certainly would because the State court hasn't relied on a clearly insufficient case or controversy in order to adjudicate Federal rights. There is, in fact, a case or controversy here. The respondent has been convicted of a criminal offense, and he is challenging the law under which he was convicted. So this case does not fall outside of the case or controversy requirement even measured by Article III standards.",
  "That -- that is correct, Justice Ginsburg. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If the Court reaches the second question presented in this case, the United States submits that the Confrontation Clause should be properly construed to be limited to testimonial statements and their functional equivalent, but it should not be an absolute bar against the admissibility of that kind of statement.",
  "No, Justice O'Connor. We took the same position with respect to the limitation of the clause to testimonial statements in White v. Illinois, and this Court rejected that submission by a 7 to 2 vote. We renewed it in this case in light of the Court's grant of certiorari on the second question presented in which the petitioner's position is that this Court has too broadly construed the Confrontation Clause, but within its compass, it should be given an absolute prohibition.",
  "That's correct.",
  "No, Justice Scalia, but --",
  "The Court has said it about the Confrontation Clause --",
  "-- in a variety of contexts.",
  "Well, starting from the overall structure of the Sixth Amendment, the Court has construed many of the rights in the Sixth Amendment not to be absolute in certain contexts. The jury trial right does not extend to all criminal prosecutions as the language of the Constitution would provide. It does not -- the right to counsel does not extend to every criminal case in which a -- arguably the text would require. The -- the Compulsory Process Clause has been held --",
  "What this Court has said about the Confrontation Clause is that it incorporated a preexisting common law right that had common law exceptions with it, and those common law exceptions were capable of growing and being developed along the lines of analogous principles.",
  "It's not an absolute guarantee. What helps to, I think, explain that is to look at what confrontation involves. It involves having a witness who's under oath, who is subject to cross-examination, who's demeanor can be observed by the jury, and who is brought face to face with the accused. Now, this Court has held in a number of cases that all or some of those components of confrontation may be dispensed with when, in the necessities of the case and in order to obtain witness -- witnesses who will be able to testify at the trial, it is required to do so. For example, in the instance of former testimony, you have oath, cross -- and cross-examination, and you have at one point the defendant face to face with the witness, but you do not have the important confrontation right of the jury having the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witness. And the Court held that that is required because the necessities of the case require overcoming what would otherwise be a confrontation right. Similarly in Maryland v. Craig, the Court held that the literal face-to-face right to confront the witness may be overcome by the necessities of the case.",
  "No. It's definitely not what we're saying, Justice Breyer.",
  "We define the underlying purpose of the Confrontation Clause --",
  "To serve the truth-seeking mission of the --",
  "I doubt seriously that -- that Sir Walter Raleigh's case would come out differently under our approach. What we are talking about --",
  "The witnesses were available, Justice Breyer, in Walter Raleigh's case. And our position on the availability of witnesses is that when they are available, they should be brought in.",
  "Oh, definitely not, Mr. Chief Justice. Our view of Inadi is that the statements of co- conspirators made to each other out of court in connection with the -- with the conspiracy are almost invariably non- testimonial statements. There may be a few rare instances in which the co-conspirators are continuing the conspiracy and speaking to law enforcement, and in that context, in the unlikely event that the United States submitted that those statements were coming in for the truth of the matter asserted and not because they were false, then perhaps there would be some issue about our approach. But in the vast majority of cases --",
  "There was no suggestion in the lower courts that these two individuals were attempting to further the conspiracy or that there was a conspiracy going on at the time of the statements.",
  "That's -- these -- these statements were admitted, Justice Souter and Justice O'Connor, as statements against penal interest. And the basis for the State court decision in letting them in --",
  "Yes. The -- the Confrontation Clause --",
  "The hearsay basis was statement against penal interests. The confrontation argument that was accepted by the Washington Supreme Court was that the confession of Sylvia Crawford interlocked, which meant that it overlapped and paralleled the confession of Michael Crawford --",
  "We do not endorse that position, Justice Stevens.",
  "This statement should have been excluded, Justice Kennedy. It -- first of all, we think that under --",
  "Under Roberts --",
  "That's correct.",
  "Under Roberts, as explicated in Idaho v. Wright, corroborating evidence that serves to show the reliability of a particular statement is not an acceptable means of vindicating its admission under the Confrontation Clause. I can think of only two possible reasons why the confession of the defendant when it interlocks with the statement made out of court might be treated differently, and neither of those arguments seems to me to be valid. One would be if, as a factual matter, the defendant's own statements showed that the out-of-court statement was reliable to a degree not found with any other corroborating evidence, and I don't think that that's --",
  "He certainly could and was impeached with his out-of-court statements. And this brings me to the second reason, Chief Justice Rehnquist. The defendant can attack the reliability of his own out-of-court confession. He's not bound by some notion of estoppel that because he said it, therefore it must be true. And the record in this case reflects that Michael Crawford attempted to present a self-defense at trial that was substantially more robust than the statements that he made at the time. And under Crane v. Kentucky, this Court has held that a defendant can attack the reliability of his own statements. So even if the statements did directly interlock, in the sense that the defendant's statements matched the out-of-court declarant's statements, that would not render them per se reliable for confrontation purposes.",
  "And -- and the State made that point in its rebuttal argument. So there -- there is certainly ample basis for saying that under existing law the statements do not come in. The question for the Court is should the Court revisit its Ohio v. Roberts jurisprudence because of the concerns about whether Ohio v. Roberts was constitutionally accurate.",
  "Concerns that I think are -- are raised by reading the Confrontation Clause as an original matter before this Court's jurisprudence made all hearsay subject to the Confrontation Clause. Now, we do not submit that there is a practical need for the Court to revise its jurisprudence. The United States has not encountered a significantly difficult burden in admitting evidence under the hearsay rules under the Roberts approach as -- as it has now been articulated. And we also acknowledge that the Court would have to develop a jurisprudence to decide what testimonial statements means, if the Court adopts the testimonial approach. What we do submit is that the way in which the word witness against is used in the Sixth Amendment, particularly when read in light of the way the word witness is used in the Fifth Amendment and also in the Sixth Amendment's Compulsory Process Clause, that the word witness was meant to refer to people who were giving evidence for purposes of a case, not to people who simply happen to observe facts in the world and made statements about them and that are now being used as hearsay in a criminal trial.",
  "No, Justice Scalia. I think they both involve certain challenges. What exists today is a body of law that has examined the indicia of reliability question, and with respect to certain statements in the testimonial category, such as victim statements to the police in a condition that might be likened to an excited utterance or sometimes in statements in aid of medical diagnosis or treatment, and also true statements against penal interests such as guilty pleas by a defendant that does not implicate the defendant on trial but simply acknowledges criminal conduct, the lower courts have concluded that those statements do have sufficient indicia of reliability to be admitted. And our concern is that if this Court were to adopt the testimonial approach, that it not do so in a way that would foreclose lower courts from taking advantage of evidence that is reliable, unavailable from another source, important in criminal prosecutions and well- grounded in the theory of the Confrontation Clause as a vehicle for achieving truth in criminal trials.",
  "Our position is that with respect to testimonial statements, the preference is to get live, in-court testimony with all of the benefits that the Confrontation Clause envisioned for testimony. But sometimes a defendant who pleads guilty is still awaiting sentencing, and as this Court held in Mitchell v. United States, the defendant still has a Fifth Amendment privilege and can refuse to testify on grounds of privilege. Other defendants who plead guilty in their own cases will sometimes refuse to testify even on pain of contempt, and at that point the choice for the judicial system is either admitting that's -- that evidence in the criminal trial or excluding it altogether and risking a manifest failure of justice because there isn't the evidence. And I think it's important to distinguish between those kinds of statements, the excited utterances, 911 calls, true statements against penal interests that implicate only one --",
  "Thank you --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Before this Court's decision in Dickerson v. United States in the year 2000, it was the uniform rule in the lower Federal courts that the failure to issue Miranda warnings meant that the unwarned statement was not admissible in the Government's case, but that there was no requirement to suppress physical evidence that was derived from those unwarned statements. Following this Court's decision in Dickerson, which affirmed that Miranda has constitutional stature, the majority of the Federal courts of appeals to address the issue continued to adhere to the pre-Dickerson rule that physical fruits of an unwarned statement were admissible. In this case, the Tenth Circuit broke ranks with that uniform body of authority and held that, as a result of Dickerson's ruling that Miranda has constitutional stature, there is a derivative fruits suppression component to the Miranda rule. That holding should be reversed. Miranda stands as a rule that implements the Fifth Amendment, not by requiring the compulsion that the Amendment literally speaks of, but by providing an extra level of protection for the core of the Fifth Amendment right, the right for the defendant's own statements that are incriminating not to be used against him in a criminal trial.",
  "Justice Scalia, as I understand it, it is a right that implements the Fifth Amendment's protection.",
  "The Fifth Amendment. What the -",
  "What the Court concluded in Miranda and then reaffirmed in Dickerson is that the traditional totality of the circumstances test for ascertaining whether a statement is voluntary or has been compelled by the Government is not adequate when the statements are taken in the inherently pressuring environment of custodial interrogation. And to provide an extra layer of protection to avoid the violation of the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights, the Court adopted a prophylactic warnings and wavier procedure.",
  "Justice Scalia, it is a constitutional right that is distinct from the right not to have one's compelled statements used against oneself.",
  "Well -",
  "Oh, I think you do, Justice Scalia. That is a violation of the core due process right not to have substantive violations of one's liberty interests. What we're talking about in this case is not a substantive violation of the defendant's rights, but a procedural violation of the Fifth Amendment that this Court has defined in Miranda, but has defined it in a way that is highly distinct from the basic, textually-mandated rule of the Fifth Amendment that compelled statements may not be used.",
  "I would - I'm not sure, Justice Scalia, that your question addresses what Miranda addressed. What Miranda addressed was a situation in which it was extremely difficult for the courts to sort out whether a statement was coerced or not coerced, and to avoid the risk that an actually coerced statement would be used in evidence against the defendant, thus violating the core Fifth Amendment right. The Miranda Court, as this Court has later explained, adopted a presumption, a presumption for a limited purpose. In the government -",
  "If your hypothetical, Justice Stevens, presupposes an assertion of the Fifth Amendment right and actual compulsion of the -",
  "- information, presumably under a grant of immunity, then the gun would not be admissible, because this Court has defined a violation of the Fifth Amendment that involves actual compulsion as entailing two different evidentiary consequences. One evidentiary consequence is that the statements themselves may not be used. The other evidentiary consequence is that nothing derived from the statements may be used. But the critical feature of that hypothetical and its distinction from Miranda, is it involves actual compulsion. Miranda -",
  "It does, Justice Ginsburg, and there are many things in the Miranda opinion that have not stood the test of later litigation in this Court, because they extended the implications of Miranda far beyond where this Court has gone. And let me be precise about this. The rule, at the time of Miranda and today, is that if there is actual compulsion, the Government may not make use of the actual statements that are taken or their evidentiary fruits. The Government may also not use that statement for impeachment, and there is no public safety exception that could -",
  "Justice O'Connor, the determination of whether the statements reflect voluntariness at the outset and then a knowing and - and intelligent waiver of Miranda warnings later on after they are given needs to be determined based on the totality of the circumstances. But this Court has recognized, in allowing the use of unwarned statements for impeachment and in adopting the public safety exception, and in permitting a second warned statement, as the Court did in Oregon v. Elstad, to be admitted into evidence, notwithstanding an earlier unwarned statement, that there is a difference between the Miranda presumption and a finding of actual compulsion.",
  "No, we still do, because the crucial thing about Miranda that is not challenged here is that a failure to issue Miranda warnings, followed by custodial interrogation, means that the unwarned statement is inadmissible in the Government's case in chief. That is the core ruling of Miranda.",
  "No, the core ruling of the public safety exception is that you can use the statement. The Court held, in New York v. Quarles, that when pressing public safety needs justify the conduct of custodial interrogation without prior issuance of Miranda warnings, that situation falls outside of the Miranda paradigm, and the statements themselves can be used. Now, Justice O'Connor's dissenting opinion argued that there should be no exception for public safety for the statements themselves, but the gun, as derivative evidence, should come in, because it was not the product of actual compulsion at which the Fifth Amendment is aimed.",
  "Justice Souter, if - if I accept that that accurately describes this case, it does not accurately describe the large class of cases in which physical evidence is discovered as a result of unwarned statements. In many -",
  "Justice Ginsburg, that is my position, but I don't think it would be a prudent policy for law enforcement to adopt. This case may be one in which the Government can prove knowing possession of a firearm by the defendant even without the benefit of his statements, but police officers are not going to be able to predict in advance that that is going to be true in the vast majority of cases. What they are going to know is that if you have a statement that links the defendant to the gun, that allows you to show knowing possession. In the absence of that, having the physical evidence alone will not necessarily guarantee a conviction.",
  "Oh, I do in this case, Justice Souter.",
  "I think that the Court should decide this case not based on the particularities of this factual scenario, but on the class of cases in which physical evidence is at issue, and should regard the question of what incentives the police may have as informed by the totality of cases that may arise. Police officers who decide to conduct custodial interrogation without giving Miranda warnings know that they will not be able to use the statements that the defendant makes in the Government's case in chief, and they have no way of knowing before they conduct custodial interrogation what the defendant may say. If the defendant offers up information that is incriminating on unanticipated crimes or provides leads to information that the police haven't previously anticipated, then the police officers run two risks. The first is that they won't be able to use those statements against the defendant in the case in chief. The second is that by failing to issue Miranda warnings, they increase the likelihood that a later court reviewing the facts will conclude that this is not a case of a mere failure to give Miranda warnings, but is a case involving actual compulsion. And if a court concludes that the statements are actually compelled, involuntary -",
  "It would be evidence that a defendant could argue is relevant, but I don't think that it would be evidence of compulsion. What's relevant in the compulsion analysis is what the police officers actually say and do and communicate to the suspect. Their uncommunicated intent or law enforcement policies would not add up to compulsion by itself.",
  "No, Justice Kennedy. The Court should still do as it has done in other contexts, balance the costs of a Miranda suppression remedy against whatever incremental benefits there may have.",
  "What the Court has done in the Fourth Amendment context is deal with an actual violation of the Fourth Amendment and establish very exclusion - various exclusionary rules that are designed to deter that kind of police conduct. The Miranda rule is very different, because even if the Court holds that Miranda prescribes a rule of substantive conduct for the police, which we submit it does not, even if the Court were to hold that, it still is a rule that merely presumes compulsion. It doesn't constitute a finding of actual compulsion.",
  "That - that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice. But what the Court has done under the Fifth Amendment -",
  "I think this Court will be better able than I am to say what Chavez held.",
  "But the - the reason that that principle alone does not decide this case is that the Court has, in instances of actual compulsion out of court, applied a derivative evidence suppression rule. That's the rule that the Court adopted in Counselman v. Hitchcock, and it's followed it in its immunity line of cases where it has held that to displace the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination, you need to suppress both the statement and the fruits.",
  "That - that's -",
  "That's the core of it, Justice Kennedy. What the Court did in Miranda was create a rule that operates in the very heart of the Fifth Amendment by creating a prophylactic buffer zone against the risk, not the certainty, but the risk, that actual compulsion has been exacted. It is that risk that the Fifth Amendment targets as the core concern.",
  "Justice Breyer, as the Court explained it in its immunity line of cases, the starting point of analysis is that a defendant under the Fifth Amendment can claim his privilege against testifying based not only on incrimination from the statements that he makes, but also that evidence that the Government can obtain as a result of the statements is incriminating. If his testimony is a link in a chain of incrimination, he can stand silent, and the Court reasoned from that that the Government should not be able to circumvent that right of the defendant not to be a witness against his - himself, by calling him out of court, compelling testimony over his objection that - based on the Fifth Amendment, and then obtaining the very incriminating information that the privilege shielded him from having to provide.",
  "Well, the - the distinction between this situation and the true compulsion situation is, Miranda does not involve an actual finding of compulsion, and the Court has been very frank about this. As a result, the Court has repeatedly drawn distinctions between the use of unwarned statements and the use of actually compelled statements. Actually compelled statements may not be used to impeach a defendant's trial testimony. That too would violate the Fifth Amendment right. But the Court held in - in the Hass case and in the Harris case that statements that are merely unwarned, but not compelled, can be used for impeachment. The Court similarly held in Michigan v. Tucker and then again in Oregon v. Elstad that statements that are unwarned, but not compelled, can be used as leads to find another witness' testimony, or to obtain a second statement from the defendant himself. And if -",
  "One case, Justice Kennedy, involves a literal violation of the Fifth Amendment. Miranda involves a presumption that this Court -",
  "It is a little metaphysical, Justice Kennedy, but there's a - a pot of truth, I think, a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow here, which is that the Miranda presumption does not mean, this Court has held, that a statement is actually compelled. It protects against the most crucial right contained in the Fifth Amendment itself, which is -",
  "You could look at it that - that way, Justice Kennedy. What - what the Court has done when it's dealt with a - a failure to issue warnings, is balance. It has recognized that, by providing a rule that presumes compulsion in lieu of proving it, the Court has taken a step beyond the core of the constitutional right itself, and the Court's language in its previous cases of calling Miranda warnings and the exclusionary rule under Miranda a prophylactic right is understandable in that sense. Miranda excludes some statements that are not compelled under the Fifth Amendment.",
  "I - I - I don't want to go off into an excursion into rules of law that might occur to me as I stand here, Justice Stevens. But what I do know is that the Court's own Miranda jurisprudence -",
  "It -",
  "There is language in the Miranda opinion, as Justice Ginsburg has mentioned, that would support the view that the original vision of Miranda was that it would constitute compulsion -",
  "- not merely presume it. But as the Court developed the rule and considered what the costs and benefits would be of having a rule that merely presumed compulsion, any context in which it was not necessarily true. The Miranda Court itself recognized that not all statements taken in custodial interrogation without warnings are compelled. Once you are dealing with a prophylactic rule, it's incumbent upon the Court to balance the benefits against the burdens of the rule.",
  "Well, I think the Court has put itself back into it by adopting the holdings that permit statements that are not warned to be used for impeachment and to be used to obtain leads for other witnesses.",
  "And I think that that's what the Court has really decided is the right approach when you are outside the core concern that the Miranda Court was addressing, namely the use of the unwarned statement itself. There is a terrible cost to the truth-seeking function of a criminal trial to suppress reliable, physical evidence that was obtained not as the result of a core constitutional violation involving literal compulsion or a substantive due process violation, but merely a failure to issue warnings.",
  "Well, I -",
  "Well, there - I - the argument based on cost, Justice Souter, is - is not weak, because the costs are quite real. The jury does not hear the evidence that's suppressed -",
  "This Court has repeatedly recognized though that there are situations in which there are ambiguities in the way that Miranda actually applies, and law enforcement officers are going to make mistakes in the way that they apply Miranda.",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg. Our position is that if they don't give the warnings up front, they lose the statement that is taken without warnings. That is the Miranda rule, and it responds to the core concern that Miranda had. The question is, how much further should that rule go? And, as I think I answered Justice Souter and yourself earlier, police officers do not know before they get hold of evidence whether they are going to be able to link it to the defendant with other admissible evidence and prove the violation at trial. They are much better off following the Miranda script, getting the admissible evidence of - of the defendant's own statements, and using it to tie the defendant to the evidence. And in a large percent -",
  "Justice Souter, I think as the Court will hear more in the next hour, the - the officer in that case acknowledged that he was rolling the dice. There are many reasons why -",
  "That officer testified that he had been trained to do that -",
  "- and he decided that - that he would in that case. The FBI policy has been, even before Miranda and continuing to this day, that you issue the warnings. You avoid difficult voluntariness inquiries, you smooth the path to admissibility of the evidence, you ensure that the warned statements are admissible.",
  "Well, it - I think that in many cases it pays off with risks that responsible law enforcement officers often choose not to run. If I could reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Miranda is a rule that is perfectly matched to the problem that the Court sought to address, namely the risk that the defendant's own self-incriminating statements would be obtained by compulsion and admitted against him to prove his guilt. That risk implicated two central concerns of the Fifth Amendment, one going to reliability, the other going to the state's burden to prove guilt with evidence other than that extracted from the defendant's own mouth. Extension of Miranda to this case, which involves physical evidence that does not involve the reliability concerns that are at the heart of the Fifth Amendment, and does not involve the concern about using the defendant's own self-compelled words to incriminate him, would not only be contrary to the body of authority in the lower courts before this Court's decision in Dickerson and largely after it, but would also be contrary to the purpose of truth-seeking in a criminal trial that is central to the Court's jurisprudence in this area. Justice Stevens, I - as far as the Government is aware, there was no more than a handful of cases in the state courts that have followed the rule, other than what the Federal rule had been. Justice White's dissenting opinion from the denial of certiorari in the Patterson case, I believe, collects them, but this was by no means a groundswell movement in the state courts.",
  "My understanding is that there are eight Federal circuits before Dickerson, including the Tenth Circuit, that it held that suppression of derivative physical evidence was not warranted. Since Dickerson, only the Tenth Circuit has changed its position, and there is no other court, other than the First Circuit, which follows a rule that depends on - on balancing deterrence concerns against the loss to - of evidence to the trial, that follows anything akin to the kind of derivative suppression rule that the Tenth Circuit adopted in this case. Thank you.",
  "In our view, Justice Breyer, no different rule is warranted in that situation, because Miranda continues to protect against the risk that it's aimed at. Absent actual compulsion, there is no warrant for a rule that does anything other than suppress the actual statements.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: On the central legal issue in this case, the critical fact is that, at the jailhouse, after petitioner was transported from his home, petitioner received a full set of Miranda warnings, which apprised him of his right to counsel, and knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to counsel.",
  "Yes. I believe that the Eighth Circuit did, Justice O'Connor, because the Eighth Circuit applied Oregon v. Elstad to reject what appears to be a Miranda-style argument that petitioner made in addition to his Sixth Amendment argument.",
  "Well, I -- I think in -- in part, Justice O'Connor, your reading of the opinion is correct. The court did say that under Patterson, the Sixth Amendment argument that petitioner is making in this Court doesn't get out of the starting gate, because there was no interrogation, it used the word interrogation. There was an issue about whether interrogation is equivalent to deliberate elicitation, and I'll try to address that. But before the court got to the Sixth Amendment question, it addressed on pages 121 and 122 of the joint appendix the argument based on Elstad, and the argument that the petitioner made was that the statements made at the jailhouse should be suppressed -- and this is on page 121 of the joint appendix -- because the primary taint of the improperly elicited statements made at his home was not removed by the recitation of his Miranda rights at the jail. And then the court went on to discuss Oregon v. Elstad in detail and rejected that holding, that argument. And the way that I interpret that passage is that the court affirmed the district court's explicit finding of a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver, and applied Elstad to reject that claim.",
  "Yes. Patterson v. Illinois specifically addressed the question of what does it take for officers to obtain a waiver of counsel. The only point where I would disagree, Justice Kennedy, with your summary is that presence of counsel is not required. The defendant has the right to choose whether to have or to waive counsel. And in Patterson, the Court held that the Miranda warnings conveyed to a suspect who has been indicted all of the information needed to make a knowing and a voluntary and intelligent waiver of counsel in custodial interrogation. That's what petitioner got.",
  "That's correct. They can approach the defendant, apprise him of his rights, and if the defendant then makes a knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights --",
  "I think so, if that's construed as seeking a waiver of his right to counsel. Of course, there has to be a finding that there was in fact a waiver of the right to counsel. The police officers can't simply read Miranda warnings, provide no interruption whatsoever to make sure that the defendant actually understood them, and then barge right ahead. Now, there are cases where the courts have to decide whether there was an implicit waiver of --",
  "Not at that time. I -- I want to make it perfectly clear, Justice Stevens --",
  "Well, I -- I don't think it is extreme, because I'm going to follow it up with what I think Your Honor is getting to, which is, can the police simply go to an indicted suspect's home, ignore his right to counsel, and engage in questioning? And the answer is, generally no, sometimes yes. The generally no is that once the defendant has been indicted, the right to counsel provides a -- a direction to the police not to interfere with or circumvent the right to counsel.",
  "Sometimes yes is that, this Court has recognized in its seminal case in this area, the Massiah case, and then again in Maine v. Moulton, that the Sixth Amendment, as it is offense-specific, does not preclude the police from investigating ongoing criminal activity that's not charged.",
  "Yes. I -- and this case doesn't involve the --",
  "There may be a ethical obligation, even if the party is not known to be represented at the time, although --",
  "He's known not be represented, I think it's a closer question whether -- whether the ethics rules would -- would bar the approaching of the defendant. But this Court has made --",
  "Well, Justice Stevens --",
  "I think, Justice Stevens --",
  "The implication is that you couldn't approach him. And this Court has clearly made it evident that whatever the ethical rules might be with respect to private conduct, the Sixth Amendment rules are not governed by them. And the Sixth Amendment rule, in this area at least, is relatively clear. The police can approach an unrepresented defendant, advise him of his rights, and obtain a waiver of the right to counsel.",
  "Not on the charged offense, Justice O'Connor, and have the information admitted at trial. The -- the threshold question --",
  "That -- that has been the way that this Court has formulated the test, and I would suggest that if --",
  "Yes, but I think the Court should clearly reformulate it to make it in the context of overt interrogation by the police, known police officers, to be an objective test. The deliberate elicitation standard, as so phrased, gives rise to some confusion, because it does suggest that there's a subjective component to it, where deliberate elicitation does have a different application than interrogation for purposes of Miranda with respect to undercover agents. The Court has made clear that once a suspect is indicted, the police cannot use an undercover agent, not known or identified as such to the defendant, to circumvent his right to counsel. And in that respect, deliberate elicitation is broader. But in footnote 12 of Maine v. Moulton where the Court was discussing deliberate elicitation in some detail, the Court made clear that intent is hard to prove, and it's really not the main issue here anyway. What we should be interested in is whether the Government must have known that its conduct would be likely to elicit incriminating statements, and that is essentially the same as the Rhode Island v. Innis standard for interrogation. In fact, it's a little bit more onerous for the defendant, because it says, must have known, and the Rhode Island v. Innis standard is should have known. In any event, the Government submits that the Court should make it clearer that when you're dealing with identified police officers interacting with suspects post-indictment, the Rhode Island v. Innis standard, the objective test should be the definition of deliberate elicitation. Then the question becomes, was there deliberate elicitation on the record in this case? What happened is, the officers arrived at petitioner's home. The officers knew petitioner. This was not somebody that they had never met before. They'd met him on prior occasions. And they said in one continuous statement, we're here to discuss your methamphetamine activities, we have a warrant for your arrest --",
  "Justice --",
  "Justice Souter, on three occasions when Officer Bliemeister was asked to say what he said in his own words, he said, we're here to discuss your methamphetamine activities. On one occasion, when defense counsel in cross-examination reformulated what Officer Bliemeister said, and said, didn't you say you're here to discuss with petitioner his methamphetamine activities, Officer Bliemeister answered yes. Both the magistrate judge and the district court did not use the with you language in describing what the officer said. And to the extent that this case turns on a rather subtle distinction in language, I think the distinction is relevant, because what the officers were essentially doing is introducing the topic of what they were going to tell petitioner, namely, your methamphetamine activities have landed you in trouble, we're here to arrest you, we have an indictment for your arrest. And then petitioner began to speak primarily --",
  "I don't think there was any ambiguity about the object of the statements, but the question of what the officers were intending to do is somewhat informed by the way they phrased it.",
  "I readily acknowledge that this is a case that could be reasonably decided more than one way, but I would submit that if you look at what the officers did, the officers in the -- at his home, basically informed him about the fact that he was under arrest and indicted. He spoke uninterrupted except by one completely irrelevant question to the topic of the indictment, until the officers interrupted him, cut him off, and said it's time to go, John, you know. And John said, can I please get some shoes on? And they accompanied him downstairs, he got shoes, then they took him down to the jailhouse. No questions about the topics that were later discussed at the jailhouse.",
  "Then I think, Justice O'Connor, that this Court should apply its rule in Oregon v. Elstad that the knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel constitutes an independent act of free will that breaks any causal link that might otherwise have been posited between the statements that were made in the initial unwarned session --",
  "Not only do I think that it was made explicitly in the district court and implicitly in the court of appeals, but I don't believe that petitioner contests it. I don't believe that petitioner's position is that the waiver of rights was actually tainted. What I understand petitioner's position to be is that there was a violation of a primary constitutional norm at home when -- when petitioner was interrogated or statements were deliberately elicited. Accordingly --",
  "Exactly. The same fruits rule ought to apply that applies under the Fourth Amendment and then petitioner relies on Fourth Amendment precedents, which the Government does not think are -- are applicable here.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I'll have to let petitioner's briefs speak for what --",
  "There are two critical reasons, Justice Breyer, why Oregon v. Elstad should apply in this context. The first is that the right that the defendant did not get, by hypothesis now, at home, was the right to make an informed waiver of the right to counsel. When the defendant got the Miranda warnings at home, that fully cured any deficiency in knowledge that the defendant previously had about his right to counsel, and enabled him to make an act of free will that broke any causal link between the first statements and the second statements. And the second crucial reason why Elstad should apply here is Elstad is not simply limited to reasoning that is only applicable in the context of compulsion under the Fifth Amendment. It also clearly and explicitly said, it's very speculative and attenuated to posit that a defendant who spoke at one time is therefore going to believe that the cat is out of the bag and I should speak again, I don't really have a choice.",
  "Well, I don't think it's a change, Justice Breyer, because the Court has never addressed the specific dynamic involved in this case under the Sixth Amendment of a defendant who makes an unwarned statement --",
  "It does --",
  "Yes, Justice O'Connor, and I -- I accept, although I think it's fair to say that Nix did no more than assume that there would be a fruits rule as to physical evidence.",
  "Correct. As to physical evidence.",
  "Well, the Court -- the Court there relied on inevitable discovery.",
  "Here, our basic position is that the voluntary testimony of the defendant himself is different from physical fruits or from the situation involving a tainted line-up, which was involved in Wade, and that the decision, made voluntarily and intelligently by a defendant to waive counsel, is a per se break in any causal chain that would be positive. And our second argument is that the Court has already rejected in Elstad the idea that there is a causal link between a defendant's letting a cat out of the bag in the first statement and then being confronted with the question whether to waive his rights in the second.",
  "It is. My view that the violation is not complete until the evidence is introduced at trial, but I think where I put the Sixth Amendment is not numerically accurate, but it's somewhere in between the Fourth and the Fifth Amendment rules, in that there are circumstances in which I believe that there is a fruits rule attached to conduct that infringes a Sixth Amendment norm. The right itself may not be a completed violation until evidence that results from infringing a Sixth Amendment norm is actually used against the defendant. Adversarial fairness is the goal of the Sixth Amendment. If it is not infringed, neither is the Constitution.",
  "No, I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg. And one example that I think makes the point very clear is this Court's ineffective assistance of counsel cases. Those cases require not only that a lawyer performs deficiently, below any reasonable professional standard, but also that there be an effect on the fairness of the trail in the form of prejudice. It's a two-part standard. There is no constitutional violation merely by interfering with the right to counsel. Another case that makes that point --",
  "And my --",
  "I -- I think that there's a lot in your question, Justice Souter, but I -- I think I basically agree with the thrust of it. He does have the right to choose whether to have counsel or not after he's been indicted when the police approach him for interrogation. The question in this case is, what do you do if that didn't happen? And --",
  "Well, as we discussed yesterday, Justice Scalia --",
  "I -- I believe that the violation in a Miranda case consists precisely of the admission of the defendant's statements in the Government case in chief. The Fifth Amendment is an evidentiary rule. That's what the nature of the violation is. It's not a conduct-based rule.",
  "That -- that's correct.",
  "No, but I don't think that it matters because we're conceding that the Court engages in fruits analysis. Our primary position in this case on the legal issue is that the defendant's independent, untainted decision to waive counsel is a act of --",
  "Well, that -- that is --",
  "True. But that's what the Court held over Your Honor's dissent in Patterson v. Illinois. The Court explicitly considered the issue of what kind of a waiver is necessary, and the Court held that the issuance of Miranda warnings provides the defendant with all the information that he needs to know.",
  "No, but --",
  "And we're not claiming that there was a waiver of the right to counsel. Our -- our claim for whatever favor it may meet with the Court is that there was no deliberate elicitation of statements. We're not claiming a waiver at the home. We are unequivocally claiming a waiver at the jailhouse.",
  "No, I don't think it's strange at all, because as the Court explained in Patterson, the question of a waiver is a functional question that turns on what the role of counsel might be at a particular setting. Now, the role of counsel at trial is considerably more complex in dealing with evidentiary matters and legal claims than the role in pre-trial interrogation.",
  "Well, in this particular case, and this is my third and final point, if the Court should determine that the waiver of rights is not a per se independent act that attenuates any taint, on any record the Court should not find that there is any taint that is unattenuated. The violation at home, if there was any, was an extremely mild violation. If the defendant let the cat out of the bag, it was really at most one paw, not an entire cat.",
  "The -- the defendant barely spoke at all about his activities relating to the charges that were identified in the indictment. He said that he had business and personal problems and he was a methamphetamine user, and he rambled on for a while until the police cut him off. At the station house, he was asked specifically person by person what his relationship was with the individual and what the activities were, and of course, he gave more elaborate information at that time, but -- and this is critical too. It was not information that admitted the charges in the indictment. This wasn't a case where a defendant said, well, I've confessed once, I might as well confess again now that I have my Miranda warning. This was an individual who spoke about his problems at his home, then he gets down to the station house and he's essentially talking about all the things that make him not liable, criminally liable under the indictment. It was an instance in which, I would submit, the motive for the defendant to talk was not that the cat was out of the bag, but that he was hoping to minimize any suggestion of guilt and persuade the officers that the indictment was not properly founded. And finally, of course, the officers never exploited any prior statement and they did give him a thorough, complete administration of Miranda warnings, and under the circumstances of this case, even if the Court were to apply a taint analysis sometimes, or to assume that a taint analysis applies, the facts of this case demonstrate enough attenuation so that the jailhouse statements should be admitted, while the statements at home were suppressed.",
  "I am arguing that a fruits rule applies under the Sixth Amendment. I'm conceding that by virtue of the Court's assumption in Nix v. Williams and its holding in United States v. Wade. But the case of a defendant's own voluntary statements should be treated as a special case under a fruits rule in which there is per se attenuation in the form of an independent act of free will that intervenes between the violation and the ensuing waiver. And that comes about when the defendant receives full and complete information about his rights. There is no suggestion of involuntariness in his waiver and he decides to speak. The ultimate test in attenuation law is was there an independent act of free will when you're speaking of a confession that breaks the causal link to the prior illegality. Here, we submit as a matter of law under Oregon v. Elstad's reasoning, there was. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals correctly held that section 666 does not require proof of a Federal connection between the offense conduct and the federally funded program or Federal funds beyond that which the text of the statute itself requires.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, the Government has relied on Congress' Necessary and Proper Clause authority to protect its Spending Clause expenditures and programs in this case. I recognize that the Commerce Clause could also provide a basis for Congress to reach transactions involving criminal activity that affect commerce, but this Court in Salinas v. United States, in describing why section 666 was constitutional, as applied to the facts of that case, discussed that there was a legitimate Federal interest in protecting the particular program that corruption had affected in that case. And the outgrowth of section 666 historically is of an effort by Congress to improve on previously deficient methods of protecting federally funded programs. There were -­",

Richland County, that analysis under the Necessary and Proper Clause is deferential, tracing its roots back to McCulloch v. Maryland, but there is an attenuation element to the analysis. The law does need to be conducive and plainly adapted to the end that Congress is seeking to protect. And in your example of $1 to a State and then protection through criminalizing the activities of hundreds of thousands of agents, there might be an attenuation problem.",

  "No. I think there are ample avenues for the Federal Government to legislate, when things involve interstate commerce, without worrying about Lopez. I believe the Court could uphold the statute as a regulation of interstate commerce, but it was clearly not designed with that in mind, and this Court did not so regard it, or at least didn't articulate itself as regarding it that way in Salinas v. United States. The problem that Congress was trying to solve was a very particularized problem, not the generalized problem of there is crime in America, therefore it will affect federally funded activities. The problem that Congress was trying to solve was that it would give Federal money to particular entities to --to administer Federal programs, and there would be crime that had the potential to affect those Federal interests, but because of deficiencies or perceived deficiencies in prior statutory law, that crime could not be prosecuted. In particular, with theft crimes there was a problem because once title had passed with the money to the local entity or State entity, some courts were saying that was no longer theft from the Federal Government and the theft statute didn't apply. With respect to the Federal bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. 201, lower courts had divided on whether State and local officials who were administering Federal programs could be held accountable as Federal officials. And to remedy those deficiencies of prior law, section 666, as the court of appeals I think aptly described it, changed the enforcement paradigm, and it said that what we want now is not to focus on particular Federal monies that we have difficulty tracing into federally funded entities or who is a Federal official. We want to make sure that the entities that we fund to carry out Federal assistance programs are clean, and the way that we are going to do that is to draft a prophylactic statute that ensures that all agents who are involved in the authority to conduct business on behalf of the entity are not engaged in significant acts of theft, embezzlement, or bribery. It, therefore, included various limitations in section 666 that prevent it from being an all- encompassing, all-devouring statute that sweeps in all related crimes to the entities that are funded. There's a $5,000 limitation with respect to the transactions that are going to be influenced. It's not every traffic ticket that is issued by any State agency. And there is a -- a condition, of course, that there be $10,000 of Federal money going into the entity.

And in anticipation of Federal money coming into the entity, the officials could engage in corrupt conduct.",

  "Well, this --this statute, though, I think rests on a generalization that is less attenuated and more reasonable than statutes that would take the form of the statute Your Honor has described.

  "Justice Breyer, I think the most logical way to write this opinion is to rely on the test that this Court articulated in 1819 through Chief Justice Marshall with respect to the power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Here the enumerated power that's being protected is the spending power. The Necessary and Proper Clause was long ago construed to give Congress substantial deference to pass laws so long as they are conducive to the end that Congress is trying to achieve and its legitimate.",
  "That's --that's correct. That's correct, Justice Kennedy.",
  "I can't think, off the top of my head, Justice Kennedy, of a Commerce Clause case that was specifically directed at governmental activity. Of course, this statute is not specifically directed at governmental activity. It's directed at any fund recipient, be it private, Indian tribe, or governmental. So the Court could rely on cases probably like Reno v. Condon in which the Court upheld a law that dealt with an item in commerce, be it in the hands of the Government or in hands of private parties. And of course, United States v. Perez did uphold a very broad view of the Congress' power to regulate transactional conduct.",
  "No governmental entities in -- in Perez, but of course, this case doesn't focus on governmental entities as such. What it focuses on them is -- it focuses on them in their capacity as administrators of funds that are paid out under Federal assistance programs. It treats them identically to private entities that also receive Federal funds under Federal programs, which is strong evidence that what Congress had in mind here was ensuring that its purposes and goals under the Spending Clause aren't frustrated by corruption within whatever entity it is that happens to be taking the funds to administer the program.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, 18 U.S.C., section 641, which was the Federal theft statute, was really a protection of Federal property, and that probably could be justified under a variety of enumerated powers under Article I. 18 U.S.C., section 201 was the Federal bribery statute that primarily focuses on people who are Federal officials or who are designated to become Federal officials. And this Court in United States v. Dixson interpreted the statute to cover State and local officials who were administering Federal programs because they were acting on behalf of the United States. And with respect to that branch of section 201, although the Court did not address the constitutional question in Dixson, I think that the proper grant of authority to analyze it is the Necessary and Proper Clause as applied to the spending power because it, like section 666, criminalizes the activities of non-U.S. persons because they are engaged in an activity that relates to federally funded programs. So the theory of protecting through criminal law the misdeeds of agents that may impair Federal programs or impair Federal funds is not new. What was new about section 666 was its removal of the impediments that Congress found in the prior law so that it could have an effective mechanism to ensure the integrity of its programs. The case that is before the Court today is a facial challenge to section 666, arguing that it is always and everywhere unconstitutional. That submission is impossible to reconcile with this Court's decision in Salinas v. United States which specifically said that as applied to the conduct in that case, where there was a connection to a Federal program, the statute was constitutional as applied. What that means is that the court of appeals was clearly correct in holding that section 666 is not facially unconstitutional. It leaves open whether there is an as-applied constitutional challenge to section 666. No such challenge was brought in this case, and the United States made a proffer to the district court indicating how the particular bribery in this case would have had an effect on Federal funds and Federal programs, making clear that no such as-applied challenge would have succeeded. So the only way that petitioner can prevail in this case if this Court is prepared to say that notwithstanding its prior decision in Salinas, holding that section 666 was constitutional as applied, it now turns out that section 666 is facially unconstitutional and can never be applied to anyone anywhere. We submit that that is incorrect.",
  "Judging from the way that this Court resolved the Salinas decision, Justice Kennedy, it would be a constitutional as-applied challenge to be resolved by the Court. This Court in Salinas said that the statute was constitutional as applied and there had been no jury finding on any nexus requirement.",
  "I don't think that they would, Justice Kennedy. Just as in a case like New York v. Ferber where the Court held that child pornography can be outlawed across the board, the statute is not --",

  "But the Court left open the possibility that there would be as-applied challenges, and it didn't suggest that those as-applied constitutional challenges would raise jury issues. They would instead raise issues of law for the -­",
  "I am judging, Chief Justice Rehnquist, by the way that this Court resolved the legal issue in the Salinas case. The Court would have two options open to it if it decided, contrary to our arguments today, to read in some sort of a nexus requirement. It could do what the Second and Third Circuits have done, which is, we think incorrectly, superimpose on the statute as an implicit element that has no textual foundation some sort of a Federal nexus. Now, if the Court did construe section 666 to require a Federal nexus, that's clearly a jury issue under United States v. Gaudin. Every element, be it implicit or explicit, has to be found by the jury. But alternatively, I understood Justice Kennedy to be suggesting that there could be a constitutional overlay to ensure that there was no unconstitutional application of section 666, and if it's treated as a pure constitutional question, then I think the better reading of this Court's decisions is that it would be a question of law -­",
  "I think the y have been groping towards consistency.",
  "Well, so long, Justice Ginsburg, as the statutory valuation elements are met, that the transaction involves $5,000 or more, which it probably would, given teacher salaries, then it would be covered by section 666, and the Government would have discretion to prosecute it. I think what that illustrates is that the broad prophylactic approach that section 666 takes leads easily to the manufacturing of hypotheticals that seem attenuated from core Federal interests. And the choice that Congress had before it was to draft a statute that would go to that degree of breadth but eliminate impediments that had previously hobbled the enforcement of a law or draft a statute which Congress believed was both under-inclusive and would put to the jury perhaps difficult and murky issues of whether there really was a Federal connection that justified application of the statute. And let me give an example because it's a very important, classic example of the way that we use section 666. Suppose that there is a city council person or a mayor or some other official who has responsibilities for some respect --in some respects administering a Federal program or Federal funds, and he turns out to be engaged in corruption with respect to non-Federal monies and non- Federal programs. The Government wants to prosecute him to ensure that he doesn't begin to widen his field of operation and harm the Federal program, but in the facts that can actually be proved, there's no connection between the Federal program and the offense conduct. Conceivably could a statute be drafted that would allow the Government to say that's the kind of Federal nexus that's covered? Certainly, but there are many, many hypotheticals where the potential injury to Federal interests is not necessarily going to be easy to articulate and prove to a jury. As a matter of discretion, the United -­",
  "Yes, Justice Scalia. If it's a question of law, is the statute unconstitu tional as applied, then the defendant should have the burden of establishing that. But I understood Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical to raise the question what if Congress had drafted a narrower statute that had some sort of an offense nexus element. Then we'd have to prove it up. The United States Attorneys Manual does direct prosecutors to use 666 in cases where there's a substantial and identifiable Federal interest. So what you have here is a combination of Congress saying we need a statute that's adequate to vindicate Federal interests and prior efforts to draft narrower ones have frustrated that goal. We're going to draft a broader statute. And then the Federal executive branch uses its discretion to prosecute cases that do, indeed, pose a real threat to Federal interests. Now, that's as a matter of discretion. It's not as a matter of constitutional law, and it's not as a matter of what the statute provides.",
  "It's not relevant, strictly speaking, to the constitutional question. What it is relevant to is why it was rational for Congress to draft a somewhat broader statute without fearing that, by virtue of having given the executive branch this power, State criminal law would be thoroughly swamped, I believe as one of the dissenting opinions said.",
  "Then I'll have to withdraw this statement.",

  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Sentencing guideline systems, like the State of Washington's and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines fulfil valuable functions in regularizing the sentencing process, and are distinctly different from the systems that this Court considered in Apprendi and Ring.",
  "Justice Scalia, the United States will argue if this Court applies Apprendi to the Washington guideline system, that it should not be further extended to the administrative guidelines that are created by the sentencing commission.",
  "The answer is",
  "I think it's possible and the United States will certainly contend that this Court apply",
  "Well, there are some obstacles to it that the Court should be aware of before it concludes that Apprendi can easily be applied to Washington and not to the Federal guidelines. Under Federal law Section 3553 (b) of Title 18 the sentencing courts are required to impose a sentence of the kind and within the range specified by the sentencing commission. So there is an act of Congress that requires that the sentencing guidelines be applied.",
  "For administrative purposes",
  "The sentencing guidelines themselves are not self-operative. They come into play for the sentencing courts direction, because of an independent Federal statute. In addition, there are situations which Congress has given very detailed direction to the sentencing commission about the type of guidelines that Congress.....",
  "They're appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. And they do not include only members of the Article 3 branch. In addition to that Congress has on occasion",
  "Well, certainly, Justice Scalia.",
  "The Court held it in the judicial branch but the question is, what status the guidelines have, not which branch the commission is in.",
  "Thank you for the lead in, Justice Breyer. I think that the best way for the Court to look at the problem of sentencing guideline systems is to understand the penalty systems fall on a continuum. At one end of the continuum are the kinds of statutes that the Court had before it, Williams versus New York, in which judicial findings about fact were critical to what sentence a defendant actually received and those findings were not subjected to a jury trial, or proof beyond a reasonable doubt guarantee.",
  "I think that that would probably have been reversed even at",
  "Very little but sheer arbitrariness would probably not have sufficed even under Williams. But",
  "What he did",
  "But what happened in fact in Williams is critical. The judge made findings that this defendant had a long arrest record, he posed a future danger to the community and he therefore deserved a longer sentence. And those were facts. They were ascertained by a judge. And there's no dispute in this Court's jurisprudence that facts that are ascertained by a judge, when the judge has wide open discretion in a long range are not subject to Apprendi. The facts.....",
  "But what the legislature expects, Justice Stevens, when it gives wide ranges to judges, is that they will exercise their discretion based on facts to sentence the most serious offenders at the top of the range and the least serious",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, what I would submit to the Court is that when a legislature established a wide range, say, 10 to 30 years in prison for a particular offense, it expected that the judges that heard criminal cases would use their experience and discretion to take into account all of the circumstances of the offense and the offender and determine whether rehabilitation and retribution were properly served by a longer sentence, or a least harsh sentence. And they did this, in the expectation of calling on judicial wisdom based on particular facts. What they",
  "I agree with that, and it was a large purpose of the sentencing guideline system to provide some centralization for the policy decisions that are made in sentencing to ensure uniformity, and proportionality. But this is what's critical for purposes of the Apprendi decision here, also room for individualization. Based on the judge's traditional perception, that there are things in the record, or in the character of this defendant that were not taken into account by the legislature and that the judge in the exercise of his discretion will determine, deserve a higher or a shorter sentence. Now, in the context of",
  "It means",
  "It means, Justice Scalia, that the facts -- that the legislature itself identifies as warranting the harsher punishment shall be found by the jury. But when the legislature says to the judge, impose a sentence in the standard range, unless you in your discretion determine that there are circumstances that take the case outside the standard range, or outside the heartland. In that event, the judge may exercise his discretion to go up to what the legislature determines is the statutory maximum, then what the judge's -- what the legislature has attempted to do, is combine a system that will regularize and provide some uniformity but at the same time import that Williams discretion, the traditional discretion that this Court has recognized is consistent with the Sixth Amendment. And I submit that if in the Williams era a legislature had passed a law that said, judges, we are giving you a range of 10 to 50 years for this offense. We want you to figure out who should be sentenced where. We want you to find facts and make judgments that are expressed in writing so that we can see what you are doing. And we want you to put the worst offenders at the top and the least worst offenders at the bottom. But this Court would not have held that those sorts of inroads on judicial discretion automatically mean that the Sixth Amendment kicks in. And traditional judicial discretion is out the window.",
  "That is exactly right, and that is exactly what Washington purported to do when it said there are illustrative factors that we are going to put in a statute that replicate what we know judges have traditionally done, but we are not eliminating your discretion to find other facts. This is a nonexclusive list. We want to call upon",
  "Precisely what you",
  "It's not a label. It is a consequence of the effect when the legislature says these are the facts that are necessary. Here's the set, you use a gun, you engage in deliberate cruelty, you have a certain quantity of drugs, you have one of those facts, and nothing else can justify a sentence above the standard range. That would define the standard range as a statutory maximum. But that's not what Washington does and that's not what the Federal sentencing guidelines do. What those systems do is say, here are some illustrative facts for your consideration. But we are not going to cabin your discretion to identify additional aggravating circumstances in the exercise of the time immemorial judicial prerogative to look at all of the facts of the case in the sentencing. And go up to what we have legislated as the statutory maximums.",
  "They have cabined. They have cabined it.",
  "Justice Scalia, but my point of the -­ the point of my hypothetical in which the legislature says to the sentencing judge, find facts, put the worse offenders at the top, apply the following three policies of sentencing. Proportionality, retribution, and rehabilitation.",
  "That's right.",
  "If the delegation",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, if what the legislature does is say to the judge, here's a standard range, but you in the exercise of your discretion identifying whether a factor takes the case outside what the sentencing commission calls the heartland, what Washington calls the standard range, then in that event you may go up to what we have defined as the statutory maximum. And by doing that, by calling upon judicial discretion to consider unspecified factors, the legislature has not erected surrogate elements, which is what the Court found in Apprendi.",
  "That is what it boils down to, Justice Souter, because we're starting from a spectrum at which one end lies Williams versus New York, in which the Court fully accepted that it is entirely constitutional for a judge to say, in my courtroom if you commit a kidnaping and you engage in deliberate cruelty which I'm going to find by a preponderance of the evidence, you're going to get the maximum.",
  "I think that follows directly from Williams versus New York, and it's an additional reason why this Court should be very reluctant to apply Apprendi to sentencing guideline systems. Washington would not have to react to a decision applying Apprendi to its guidelines the way Kansas did. Washington could decide that, all right, if the problem is that our standard range created a top of a statutory maximum term, we're just going to do away with the top of the standard range, and we'll leave it to judicial discretion, with the following policy statements to give some guidance to what they do.",
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: A prosecution for wire fraud based on defrauding a foreign government of taxes serves at least four distinct United States prosecutorial interests.

One foreign government should not be able to come into our courts and enforce its sovereign power by using our courts to collect taxes from our citizens.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, first of all, the complexity of foreign tax law is something that would defeat a federal prosecution in which we need to show specific intent to defraud if the law were not sufficiently clear for us to be able to meet that burden. This case illustrates the kind of prosecution that will be brought. There are taxes that are due upon the importation of alcohol. The Petitioners arranged, through the wires, to bring alcohol from Maryland up to New York, and then they got it across the border by not answering questions when asked by customs officials and by not going to secondary inspection when they were asked. In order to bring a criminal prosecution that requires specific intent to defraud, the government is not going to be relying on obscure systems. As to the concern about the enforcement of tax systems that the United States may believe are -- is unfair, that is the prerogative of the Executive Branch to determine in deciding whether a prosecution should be brought in a particular case.

  "Justice Ginsburg, the syllogism doesn't track, because the entire scope of the revenue rule, as defined in the common law cases that can be pointed to as the background principle, has to do with a foreign government, or someone acting on its behalf, coming into this country's courts to enforce its tax rules. Here what you have is the United States Government determining that it is in the interest of the United States to bring a criminal prosecution. Now, in this case, the prosecutor did concede below that restitution was not appropriately ordered. That's not the position of the United States. The position of the United States is that restitution under the mandatory statute should be ordered and it does not infringe the revenue rule. But there are - -",
  "No, there isn't, Justice Ginsburg, but the revenue rule isn't of such a broad scope that it applies to efforts by the United States Government to secure punishment by -- for a criminal conviction. But, Justice Ginsburg, if the Court were to disagree with that and were to believe that restitution, even when it's been sought by the United States -- not by a foreign government, in its own right, with the power to instigate a lawsuit -- but that even when the United States does it, that somehow falls within the parameters of the common law revenue rule, then the answer to that problem would be to interpret the restitution statute against the background of the revenue rule, not to interpret the wire fraud statute against the background of the revenue rule and hold that a prosecution by the United States is wholly barred. The Petitioner's submission here is really rather extraordinary - -",
  "Justice Scalia - -",
  "There's a difference - -",
  "-- there's a difference, Justice Scalia, between an ambiguous statute and a broad statute. The wire fraud statute is unequivocally broad, and it has been so interpreted. It's not ambiguous on the question of whether it applies to schemes to defraud that may involve foreign victims; it says \"any scheme to defraud.\" And I think, as Justice Kennedy's questions pointed out earlier, if there were a scheme to defraud a foreign business interest in Canada or a foreign governmental interest in Canada relating to some commercial venture, the wire fraud statute would apply, and - -",
  "Here is how I get out of it, Justice Scalia. If you think, as I do not, that the revenue rule would bar restitution at the behest of the United States in a criminal prosecution, there is a background principle that says when there is an established rule of the common law, Congress legislates against that background, and unless it makes its intent clear and unequivocal to overcome that background rule of the common law, then the statute will not be interpreted to be in derogation of it. It was that principle that formed the basis for the government's view that Canada cannot come in under the RICO statute - -",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, there is no common law rule that one country doesn't mess with another country's taxes. What there are, are a set of cases that deal with specific problems in which foreign taxes were at issue. And in all of the 20th century versions of this problem, what you had is a foreign government or an entity, acting at the behest of a foreign government, coming into another country seeking to use that country's courts to enforce its own tax rules. And in that context, the justifications for saying that one country will not enforce another country's revenue laws have to do with the sovereignty interests of the host country. One country, when it seeks to obtain revenue to carry out its own governmental policies, is doing something fundamental to its sovereign existence, and there's no obligation of the United States to assist the foreign government in using its court system to achieve those independent sovereign aims, no prohibition on it, either. As Justice Scalia pointed out, it's not unconstitutional, if Congress wanted to allow it. But countries, historically, have not. And that principle does form an important backdrop - -",

  "When you're dealing with the principle that a statute of the United States will not be construed to be in derogation of a common law unless it's clear that that's its purpose, the Court should be very careful in defining what the parameters of the common law are. The Court should not take a common law rule and treat it as some dynamic entity that has capability of growing a dimension that is not consistent with its purposes and that it had never assumed in any decided case as a means of telling Congress, \"You can't do what you have done.\" So I would say, Justice Breyer - -",

  "-- the revenue rule is that it is a shrinking principle of the common law, not one that has been growing. It originally started out as a principle that allowed countries to avoid invalidating contracts that they believed were in furtherance of commerce. It gradually came under attack, because what it said is that the United States will not notice that a foreign country's laws have been violated in the formation of a contract, and so the contract will be enforced. Commentators recognized that that was contrary to principles of comity and recognition that each country does have a reciprocal interest in acknowledging each other's laws. In the 20th century, those contract cases completely drop out of the picture, and what becomes left are sovereignty cases where a country is seeking to exert its sovereign power inside the United States or inside a foreign country -- the United States, itself, tried it once in Canada -- to collect taxes. And countries said, \"We're not going to do that. We're going to leave it to the treaty process.\" But the rationales that Justice Breyer and Justice Souter have articulated, about complexity of foreign law and odious foreign tax systems, have never been the driving force behind the revenue rule.

  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For the reasons articulated in the brief for the United States and by the State of Texas, this Court should conclude that there was no jurisdiction in the lower court to issue of Certificate of Appealability; and, therefore, the Court should not reach the many questions that Petitioner has raised in this case about the effect of the Avena judgement.",
  "There have been cases in the Circuits, Justice Kennedy, that have held that once a COA has issued, the Court of Appeals may consider a claim that would otherwise be beyond the jurisdiction of the courts. But this is a case where a COA has not been issued, and there is a plain procedural obstacle to its issuance that this Court can determine and, therefore, obviate the need to consider the very sensitive and delicate questions that Petitioner has raised.",
  "I don't think so, Justice O'Connor, because a COA is a jurisdictional requirement. And just as a notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement and the prerequisites for proper notice of appeal have to be satisfied, the prerequisites for a proper Certificate of Appealability should be satisfied before this Court goes on to reach the merits of a question, which, as Justice Stevens has pointed out, may never need to be reached at all if the Texas courts recognize the President's determination with respect to the Avena decision or apply the Avena decision itself. And I think it's very noteworthy that the filing that Petitioner made at the end of last week in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals seeking a successive petition for a writ of habeas corpus under Texas law specifically, at page 25, says that Petitioner is relying on the Avena judgement and he's relying on the President's determination, which are two new sources of law that were not available at the time the Texas courts previously addressed the matter and that now are available, which constitutes a ground for a second petition under Texas law, and that, accordingly, the Texas courts should allow this claim to be developed in the state courts and to be litigated there. To me, those statements are almost an admission that the claims that Petitioner has brought here are barred by failure to exhaust available state remedies.",
  "I do think that the Court would have the option of availing itself of extraordinary jurisdiction, but, as the Court made clear in the Felker case, its exercise of extraordinary original writs would be informed by the limitations that the AEDPA imposes upon the grant of habeas corpus relief; and, therefore, the Court should look to at least the additional jurisdictional obstacle that the United States and Texas has raised; and, namely, that is that the decision that the Texas courts raised -- issued in this case is not contrary to any Supreme Court decision or a misapplication of any clearly established federal law.",

The Avena decision is not a freestanding source of law that can be administered by this Court wholly apart from the President's determination. What the President did was to determine not that the treaty has a particular meaning that favors Petitioner's case, but that, as a matter of compliance with the obligation of the United States, under international law, to comply with a judgement of the International Court of Justice -- or to determine not to -- but that, in the interest of the rule of law and the obligations that were taken on, the President would create a new source of law, in effect, that would enable the enforcement of that particular judgement, without respect to the validity of the underlying merits determination that the ICJ made. But if this Court were to treat the ICJ judgement as a freestanding source of law, it would frustrate the Executive's ability to determine, in a particular case, this determination by an international tribunal should not be enforced and it should not be given effect; rather, that the President might, in a particular case, choose to -- not to comply with that determination.

  "I'm not sure of the exact number, Justice Scalia. I think it's five or six states that have defendants that are at issue in those proceedings.

  "That is absolutely correct. And I think that's an additional reason why this Court should not rush ahead and overlook jurisdictional obstacles that may not have been apparent to it at the time that it granted certiorari, and certainly the Court did not have the benefit of the fact that the President would make a determination that state courts should provide the review and reconsideration that the ICJ had determined was appropriate. And the Court, of course, didn't know that Petitioner would then file a petition for successive writ in the Texas courts that could provide him the review and reconsideration that he now seeks this Court to announce in a ruling that would have extraordinarily broad and detrimental foreign-policy consequences for the United States' freedom to respond to the decisions of international tribunals in a manner that the President sees fit in accordance with his foreign-policy judgement.

  "Pettibone applied, Justice O'Connor, to a specific statute, Section 1503, and it's similarly incorporated in 1505. Those statutes protected against obstruction of pending judicial, administrative, and congressional proceedings. The innovation in Section 1512 was to reach beyond the existence of a pending proceeding and to ensure that basically the store doesn't get robbed before the proceeding starts. If Arthur Andersen is correct, the anticipation of a grand jury investigation that is thought to occur the next day, a corporation can send out a directive to its employees and say, \"Shred all the smoking guns.\" It's the corporate equivalent of seeing something that looks like a crime scene and sending somebody in before the police can get the yellow tape up to wipe down the fingerprints.",

What the Government focused on in this case was using a document-destruction policy as a pretext and a cover to clean up and purge files when a government investigation was anticipated and it was perceived that these materials would be relevant.",
  "I don't think --",

  "Justice Souter, this is to statute, and the word \"corruptly\" is not a word, that has been ever construed to require consciousness of illegality. That is a --",
  "Definitely not. The word \"knowingly\" usually connotes knowledge of the underlying facts. And, in this case --",
  "The word \"knowingly\" does not travel down the statute to modify \"corruptly.\" It --",
  "Well, there is a logical break, because if it travel down the statute and reach all the way to \"misleading conduct,\" what Congress would have written is a statute, when you read the definition of \"misleading conduct,\" that says, \"whoever knowingly knowingly makes a false statement,\" because the definition of misleading conduct includes \"knowingly making false statements,\" \"knowingly omitting things,\" \"intentionally engaging in deceptive behavior.\" And you'd end up with a -- in a redundancy that makes no sense whatsoever. It makes sense for Congress to have said, \"knowingly used force or intimidation.\" But then when you get to the word \"threat,\" there is inherent knowledge in it. \"Corruptly\" inherently embodies knowledge. And the definition of \"misleading conduct\" inherently --",
  "-- embodies knowledge.",
  "Let me try to address each of those. First of all, the words were used as a definition of \"improper purpose,\" and they were used together, \"subvert, undermine, or impede,\" and they logically have a relationship to each other. When the Court of Appeals looked at those words and defined them, which it did, it talked about subversion and undermining as being a ruining of the proceedings and an overthrow of the attempt that the Government was anticipated to make. And I think, \"impede\" has to be read logically in that group. Now, I will acknowledge that \"impeding\" can have broader connotations, but it's not a word that's is foreign to the obstruction --",
  "Here is what it adds, Justice Souter. \"Undermine\" and \"subvert\" have a connotation of completely preventing the performance of the official duty in the proceeding. \"Impede\" removes any implication that you need to totally thwart the government activity in order to be guilty of this crime. It's enough to \"interfere\" with it, which is the word that the Court of Appeals used to define it.",
  "No, but it was to avoid any connotation that the jurors might put on the linkage of those words that the Government sought the use of the word \"impede.\" And I should note that it appears, in Section 1503, Section 1505 --",
  "That's correct. That's correct. But what --",
  "-- what the Government was doing in this instance was attempting to give content to the word \"corruptly\" that would enable the jurors to know that they can convict if the purpose that the defendant had in dusting off this document policy and using it as a pretext to destroy documents was to interfere with the fact- finding ability of an anticipated proceeding.",
  "Justice Breyer, it's a definition of \"corruptly\" that --",
  "The Court of Appeals addressed the argument, which Petitioner makes, that the definition of \"corruptly\" that was used in this case is redundant and superfluous in light of the additional intent that --",
  "Well, I think that they have a very significant difference, an important function in ensuring that this statute is not applied beyond the scope of protection of the integrity of proceedings, which is what Congress intended it to do.",
  "Justice Scalia, on page 5(a) -- or, I'm sorry, on page 3(a) --",
  "-- of the Government's appendix --",
  "-- to its brief, at the bottom of the page, subsection (b) --",
  "-- appears, \"Whoever knowingly uses intimidation or physical force\" --",
  "-- et cetera.",
  "The last phrase in the sequence is \"engages in misleading conduct towards another person.\" That phrase is, in turn, defined in the statute on page 11(a) and 12(a) of the same appendix, the Government's appendix. It's Section 1515(a)(3). And it says the term \"misleading conduct\" means \"knowingly making a false statement; intentionally omitting information from a statement; with intent to mislead, knowingly submitting or inviting reliance on a writing; or, with intent to mislead, knowingly submitting or inviting reliance on a sample;\" and, finally, \"knowingly using a trick scheme or device.\" So, \"knowingly\" is to be read in as if it were part of Section 1512 when it comes to defining the term \"engaging in misleading conduct,\" so you would end up with a statute that Congress have, for some reason, drafted that includes the word \"knowingly\" at the beginning, and then \"knowingly\" later as the definition of one of the terms that the initial \"knowingly\" --",
  "You avoid it --",
  "No. It's, \"Whoever knowingly uses intimidation or physical force.\" That's what \"knowingly\" applies to. And then the words \"threaten, corruptly persuade, and engages in misleading conduct,\" have inherent knowledge in them. In other words --",
  "That's right, because \"corruptly\" is, and always has been, a scienter term, and its appearance in Section 1512 is a direct lineal descendant from the fact that that word appears in Section 1503. When Congress enacted this statute, it had every reason to believe, because it intended to do this, that the definition of \"corruptly,\" that had been fairly widespread in the use of the word in Section 1503, would be applied to 1512.",
  "And, in that context --",
  "Well, that's sort of reading the statute just to achieve a result.",
  "I think it's contrary to --",
  "Because a \"threat,\" itself, which is the third term in the series, and the one that precedes the term that's at issue here, also involves an element of scienter or knowledge. You can use intimidation inadvertently. You could be a very heavy, dangerous- looking guy, standing out in front of the grand jury room, and a witness might come along and see you and realize, to himself, \"Uh-oh, I'm in trouble if I testify.\" If you haven't done that knowingly --",
  "He wouldn't, Chief Justice Rehnquist, precisely because it requires that he knowingly use intimidation. So that --",
  "Well, I think that they're actually quite different in the context of this statute, but even if the Court were to conclude that \"knowingly\" did travel down and produce a phrase, \"knowingly corruptly,\" the word \"knowingly\" generally in the criminal law refers to \"knowledge of the facts that make your conduct unlawful.\" Arthur Andersen here is asking for a very --",
  "I don't think that it does, Justice Breyer. There are, of course, contexts where the Court concludes that a statute, after applying all the tools of statutory construction, is ambiguous, and then rules of construction do apply to narrow it; but there is no provision that says that the Court should approach the question of construction with a view to narrow it. I think --",
  "I don't think that it is that confusing, Justice O'Connor. This is a statute that was enacted against the backdrop of Section 1503 in a well- understood meaning of the word \"corruptly.\" The same word appears in Section 1505. When the D.C. Circuit concluded that that provision was vague, as applied to a particular case, Congress came back with a definition that legislatively overruled the D.C. Circuit decision and said \"corruptly\" means \"acting with an improper purpose.\" The \"improper purpose\" in an obstruction-of-justice case has traditionally been \"the purpose to obstruct justice.\" That definition logically applies to Section 1512, because Congress enacted the corruptly-persuades provision to remedy a deficiency in prior law, because it had not included non-coercive, non-deceptive witness- tampering in the statute, originally. And some courts concluded that it was no longer punishable under Section 1503, either. To fix that situation, Congress looked to the model of Section 1503 case law, where there had been a variety of acts that are covered that under Petitioner's test would not be, such as secreting a witness, or sequestering a witness, in anticipation of a subpoena so that the witness would be unavailable to testify, or destroying documents before a subpoena had been issued, but in an anticipation that the subpoena was likely. Those kinds of acts were considered to be unlawful. Similarly, giving advice, even as a lawyer, to an individual to assert the Fifth Amendment in bad faith, not to protect that individual's own interest, but to obstruct justice by protecting other members of a criminal organization, or, indeed, the lawyer himself, lower courts had recognized could be prosecuted; not uniformly had recognized, but they had uniformly recognized it at the time of the enactment of this statute. And Congress specifically said, \"We want 1512 to be able to pick up the kinds of cases that some courts have said are no longer prosecutable under Section 1503, and that had not been included in the original version of 1512.\" So that there is history here that explains how these terms should be applied. And as far as Petitioner's contention that the word \"corruptly\" does nothing and leads to a series of horrible hypotheticals, actually a sensitive and appropriate use of the word \"corruptly\" solves those problems. Petitioners talk about how people should be able to urge each other not to cooperate with a voluntary investigation, that it's part of citizenship to be able to engage in those conversations. But if an entity has subpoena authority and it doesn't invoke it, and it simply invites people voluntarily to cooperate, it is not going to be an intent to subvert, undermine, or impede that proceeding to invite them to exercise that right. If the agency wants their testimony, it can get it through compulsion. Similarly, Petitioners argue that document policies are, per se, made unlawful under the Government's approach. But as the Court of Appeals specifically recognized in this case, a sound application of the word \"corruptly\" would look to whether there is a threat of some kind of specific proceeding that might trigger an obligation not to destroy the documents before the proceeding gets started. And, as well, there are intents that are simply not intents to subvert the administration of justice, that may result in rendering certain evidence unavailable. And if a person engages in that conduct, it may well violate another provision of criminal law, but it doesn't have to violate 1512. And a sound use of \"corruptly\" prevents all of those hypotheticals from materializing and leading to the conclusion that the statute is unduly broad. Now, Petitioner in this case, in addition to attacking the word \"corruptly,\" also has advanced a number of arguments that there was inadequate instruction on some connection that had to be required between the Defendant's intent in a possible future proceeding. But the reason that there was no adequate instruction on those issues is largely because Petitioner, itself, deliberately decided to ask for two instructions that were contrary to the statute, and never asked for what it's asked this Court to impose today. It never asked that the Defendant must be shown to believe that some particular proceeding was likely to occur in the near future. Instead, what it did is say that the Defendant had to have an intent to impair an object's availability for use in a particular proceeding. And what the Court of Appeals said is that if there was any problem in that, it's not reversible error; it's harmless, because everybody knew that the proceeding that was anticipated was an SEC investigation of Enron. And the other instruction that Petitioners asked for in the District Court is that the official proceeding must be ongoing or scheduled to be commenced in the future. But that instruction is flatly contrary to the statute.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The law of consent searches is governed by a determination of what is reasonable for the police to do in a particular circumstance, and it starts from the premise that consent is not a disfavored species in the law, that cooperation with law enforcement is a good thing and should be encouraged. The right of the cotenant, in this case, to consent stems from her common authority, which is independent of his and allows her to serve valuable social interests, as well as interests that represent her own personal interest. Many of these cases arise not among couples who are harmonious, but among couples in which there is some degree of tension, and the spouse who consents in these situations has an independent interest in ensuring that she can call upon the protection of the law.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that the law in this area is founded on a notion of agency. It's founded on a notion of independent authority of each to grant access to the police, to cooperate with law enforcement with respect to premises over which authority is shared. And in a case like this, the wife has an independent interest in disassociating herself from criminal activity that is going on, on the premises.",
  "Justice Kennedy, there may well be other bases to allow law enforcement activity to go on, but that presupposes that her authority to consent is somehow qualified: If the police could obtain a warrant or some other doctrine, would it support the search? And this Court has twice rejected exactly that approach to the analysis of consent searches.",

  "I quite agree, Justice --",

  "Well, Justice O'Connor, I certainly do not think that there is any uniform social understanding that should drive the decision in this case, for two different reasons. First of all, I think, in many circumstances, two people who share property, and who disagree about whether a guest should be invited, will resolve it in a variety of different ways. Somebody might let in a commercial visitor, over the objection of a cotenant, or someone --",
  "And I think that the other factor that the Court needs to consider in evaluating this is not just social expectations with respect to non-law-enforcement events and visitors, but this positive, affirmative social interest in encouraging cooperation with the law, which is something that she has the ability to do with respect to property over which she has common authority.",
  "I think that what the Court needs to do is look at the consent-search doctrine in relation to third-party consents, generally. Matlock makes quite clear that if the objecting -- potentially objecting party, the target of the search, does not voice an objection, then the third party has full authority to allow the search, even if they're --",
  "I don't think that, on the facts of either Matlock or Rodriguez, that would be a particularly logical or reasonable assumption. In Matlock, you're dealing with a man who was arrested for bank robbery in the front lawn of his house, the police take him to a police car, put him in a police car, do not ask him for consent; instead, they go back and they ask the woman, with whom he is living at the house, for consent to search.",
  "Rodriguez is even more dramatic, because, in Rodriguez, the victim of a battery, Gail Fischer, seeks out the police and says, \"I want you to arrest Rodriguez,\" and brings him to the -- to -- the police to the apartment, where they enter and arrest Rodriguez. Surely, if Rodriguez had been asked, or if Matlock had been asked, the presumption is, they would have objected.",
  "Well --",
  "At --",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, the second one is the easier one. The same rule applies. Anyone who has common authority over the suitcase should be able to cooperate with law enforcement to vindicate both the social interest in cooperating with a law enforcement request and the interests of the person's who's making it. And I think that that's what Matlock is all about. Now, as for the attempt to mirror --",
  "The attempt to transpose ordinary social understandings from a myriad of infinitely varied settings that do not involve law enforcement, I submit, will not correctly allow this Court to calibrate what it should be doing, which is balancing the individual interests in privacy against the social interests that affirmatively encourage and validate the use of consent. And I think what Matlock does, to put this case in context, is to illustrate that if the police had waited until Respondent had left his house to go to work, or to go to court, or to do anything else, or if he had stayed there and gone to sleep at night, then Matlock tells us that she would have full authority to allow the police into the house to conduct a search of common areas. And, for this Court to announce a rule that says, no, when the person is there on the scene and vocalizes an objection, which we can reasonably presume that he would have if he was given the opportunity to voice it, would mean that police simply have an incentive to find a different way to accomplish the same end. And I would submit that that does not give adequate --",
  "An option would be to get a warrant in cases where the police do have probable cause, but, as this Court recognized in Schneckloth versus Bustamonte, the courts -- the officers will not always have probable cause.",
  "I think it clearly would, Justice Ginsburg. And the facts in this --",
  "It would amount to probable cause if the wife, who has -- she's in a position where she would know what's going on in the house, what kind of activity is going on in the house, she is a presumptively reliable citizen providing information to the police, and the fact --",
  "Well, that's not all she said, Justice Scalia.",
  "What she said was that there were items of drug evidence --",
  "-- in the house. And if you look at the warrant that the officers obtained, it more clearly elaborates that she said there were drugs and paraphernalia. But, for the Court's purposes, this case is virtually identical to Illinois versus McArthur with respect to the probable cause. You have a wife and a husband who are in a domestic dispute, and the wife comes out, in Illinois versus McArthur, and tells the officers, you know, \"He's got drugs inside there.\" And the Court was unanimous, I believe, on the point that that furnished probable cause. But what is different from Illinois versus McArthur, and this case, is that the police officers have the consent of someone who reasonably appears to them to have common authority, someone who's living in the marital home, someone who is in a position to know what's going on and exercise her own independent authority. And for this Court to say, \"Well, there are alternatives\" -- you know, the police could pull Respondent out of the house and quarantine it while they go get a warrant, or the police could do other investigation, or they could rely on exigent circumstances -- what that does is treats her consent as worth nothing. It reduces her --",
  "I think it's very odd to say that, in Matlock, the right was relinquished, when Matlock was arrested and taken to a police car and was never asked for consent, or that Rodriguez relinquished his right by falling asleep in his own apartment. What really -- I would qualify my statement, though, in response to your comment, Justice O'Connor. It's not that it treats it as nothing. It would treat her consent as 100 percent valid when he's asleep or absent, no matter how much we know he would object, and it would treat it as zero when he's on the scene and vocalizes an objection. And I think that that would protect Fourth Amendment rights only by happenstance, or, worse, it would simply be an invitation to the --",
  "Well, in this case, as in many other cases involving this kind of potential incident, the wife called the police to the scene. So, there was a reason for them to be on the scene. It was a perfectly valid investigatory step. And once they acquired the information relating to drugs on the premises, and had the authority of someone who's in charge of the premises, I submit that the police should be able to conduct the search as a reasonable matter under the Fourth Amendment, just as they would if Respondent had been asleep or if Respondent had said, \"Well, I have to go now. Am I free to go?\" and the police said that, \"You are.\" And I don't think that it always would be an advantage for the nonconsenting tenant, somebody like Mr. Randolph, to insist on the police getting a warrant or conducting a probable-cause arrest. If he's arrested, he's taken down to the station, he has a search incident to arrest, he may not get a hearing for 48 hours. If the police do have to get a warrant, they are entitled to search anywhere and everywhere in the premises; whereas, in this case, one of Respondent's main claims is that she wasn't credible. Well, if she wasn't credible, and she had led the police upstairs, and the police had found nothing, that might have been the end of the whole incident. And I think that it's because of the socially valuable function of efficiently resolving accusations, potentially dueling accusations of criminal conduct that consent searches can facilitate, that this Court has said that consent searches are a positive social good and should be encouraged, rather than discouraged.",
  "It is, in effect, the same thing. And I think that, had that happened, there would have been no question that, assuming that the police reasonably believed that she had authority to do it, and possibly even if they didn't, the contraband would have come into the hands of law enforcement, and there is really no reason, or doctrine under the Fourth Amendment, to deny it.",
  "I think that the difference, when you receive something with the consent of someone who has the authority to exercise control over it, is a question of whether she leads the police upstairs, or whether she brings the item downstairs. And, for Fourth Amendment purposes, I don't see a difference. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The postal inspectors in this case applied for a warrant to search respondent's property. The warrant that they obtained particularly described the place to be searched and the things to be seized. It was issued based on an affidavit that informed the magistrate judge that a videotape containing child pornography that respondent had ordered through the mail and had paid for in cash was going to be delivered to respondent's house and that the warrant would not be executed until the delivery had taken place. The Ninth Circuit held that the execution of this warrant, which occurred after the delivery that the postal inspectors represented would occur had in fact happened, violated the Particularity Clause of the Fourth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit's opinion is wrong because the Particularity Clause of the Fourth Amendment addresses two specific topics: the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. It does not address the time of execution of a warrant, which the Ninth Circuit impermissibly read into the Fourth Amendment in violation of its text. The Ninth Circuit held, therefore, that because the warrant was not in accordance with the Particularity Clause, this search was equivalent to a warrantless search and that all fruits of the search had to be suppressed.",
  "That's right, Justice Souter. In the Government's view, the Warrant Clause specifically addresses those things that need to be on the face of the warrant.",
  "What would prevent the valid execution of a warrant that had no time limits whatsoever would be the requirement that a warrant must be supported by probable cause. And if agents executed a warrant at a time at which there was no probable cause, for example, because they executed it before the delivery had taken place or they executed it after a time at which probable cause had become stale, the search would be unreasonable and the fruits of the search would probably have to be suppressed.",
  "I think it absolutely just lasts a reasonable time, Justice Scalia, and the reason why there is very little law and very little litigation on this is that since the 1917 statute that Congress originally wrote to provide for the issuance of Federal search warrants, it's provided for a 10-day execution period, and that 10-day limit has been contained and continued in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. So in the ordinary --",
  "Well, I -- I don't want to say that there's no probable cause for the warrant.",
  "No. There -- there is probable cause that the magistrate has to believe that the videotape, which was one of the items to be seized, would be found at the premises at the time that the search was to be executed, which was represented in the affidavit to be after the delivery takes place. If, in fact, the warrant is executed at a time before the delivery takes place, then the warrant has failed to conform to the probable cause that supported it and the search would be unreasonable.",
  "That's right, Justice Scalia, because there is an independent requirement that probable cause must exist at the time of the execution of the warrant. Officers are --",
  "There are two separate things that are going on. One is what the magistrate must do at the time that he issues the warrant. The magistrate must find that there is probable cause to believe that offense -- an offense has been committed, is being committed, or is about to be committed, and that the items that the warrant is going to request to be seized will be present at the location at the time of execution. And the magistrate in this case was easily able to make those determinations based on the warrant affidavit that was submitted to him. But there is an additional requirement of reasonableness, that officers may not execute a warrant, even if it was validly issued, if they become aware of facts that would tell a reasonable officer --",
  "Well, I -- I think, Justice Kennedy, the easiest example to -- to see why this --",
  "I -- what I -- I'm making a separate point here, which is that officers have a continuing obligation to act reasonably in the execution of a warrant, and of course, they fulfill that in a variety of ways. They have to be reasonable in identifying the property that's -- that's specified in the warrant and that they go to search. They have to be reasonable in conducting the search of places within that property to see that they're looking for the things that are specified in the warrant and not going on a fishing expedition for things that are not. They have to be reasonable in deciding whether they decide to dispense with knock and announce, and they also have to be reasonable in deciding that the basis for probable cause that they used to support the issuance of the warrant has not become so stale that a reasonable officer would know that that warrant should not be executed.",
  "No, it certainly doesn't, Justice Stevens.",
  "Well, I -- I think in the ordinary instance, it would be reasonable for the team of executing officers to be responsible for the inquiry that I'm talking about and any individual officer --",
  "Well, the warrant is obtained based on an affidavit by --",
  "Oh, I don't think it's a big change at all, Justice Kennedy, and I -- I think what I'm trying to make clear here is that there's an ongoing obligation of reasonableness. Certainly the Court does not have to get into that in this case to decide it --",
  "Well, in this case, Justice Ginsburg, the -- the affidavit was on the scene. The affiant who secured the warrant was the lead agent who was in charge of the search that was carried out. The search team had been briefed on the probable cause and the -- the contents of the affidavit and the -- the items that were to be searched for and when the search was to take place. All of those things were true. The district court also found that the affidavit, which does contain the triggering condition in two different places, was incorporated into the warrant. The search warrant itself refers to the attached affidavit. So the documents --",
  "It was not -- it was not physically attached. It was in the possession --",
  "Well, in the abstract, I suppose that that's right, but in -- in the concrete circumstances of this case -- and I think it's consistent with what I was trying to explain is reasonable search warrant execution -- all of the search team was fully familiar with the process that was going on. This -- this was a controlled delivery in which postal inspectors were arranging themselves to make a delivery to the premises of the videotape in question. Everyone on the search warrant team knew that until that item had been received and taken inside the house, there would be no warrant execution. And in fact --",
  "Well, I don't think that is the point of the Fourth Amendment. I think what the point of the Fourth Amendment is is that the magistrate judge makes a determination whether the facts that are submitted to him rise to the level of probable cause. And then the magistrate writes a warrant that's consistent with what the Fourth Amendment says in terms the Warrant Clause requires. Then the police officers have to be reasonable in executing it. That was really my only point at the outset of the colloquy that I had with Justice Kennedy and with Justice Souter. And the classic example that I think shows that certainly officers may use discretion in what they do in determining whether it's certain types of triggering conditions are met are wiretaps because wiretaps are issued on the basis that there is probable cause to believe that criminal conversations will occur in the future. The officers then have the responsibility to conduct appropriate electronic surveillance that acquires the criminal conversations but not other conversations that are not within the scope of the probable cause that they've obtained.",
  "Well, the point, Justice Souter, is that they have to make a judgment that criminal conversations are what is going to be intercepted.",
  "Well, they're -- they're not judgments here about probable cause either because the magistrate has --",
  "Well, that's a separate question, and I think the magistrate's question is, is there probable cause? He doesn't have to determine that the probable cause is true.",
  "That's right.",
  "No. I actually, Justice Souter --",
  "I -- I have to say that I disagree fundamentally with the suggestion that he's saying there will be probable cause when the triggering event occurs. He's saying, based on the facts that are submitted to me now, the probabilities are such that evidence of this crime will be on the property when the warrant is executed.",
  "Well, I -- I don't think that there's any reason linguistically to prefer your formulation, Justice Souter, to the formulation that says there's probable cause to believe now that when the warrant is executed, in accordance with the triggering condition's occurrence, the property will be found.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, I think the warrant should be read as a whole and not, as this Court has indicated in many cases, a technical sense. This search warrant, which is at page 47a of the petition appendix, specifically refers to the attached affidavit. And the district court found as a fact that the warrant was intended to incorporate the affidavit. The affidavit states quite explicitly in two different places that it would not be executed until the triggering event occurred, and it also makes clear that the triggering event was the delivery of the videotape that respondent --",
  "Well, I think the -- that is correct, too, because this --",
  "I think that not only do you know that the -- this was clearly intended to be an anticipatory warrant as to the videotape, but it also authorized the search for other items that were related to --",
  "Wiretaps, Justice Stevens, are regulated extensively by Federal statute, and under Federal statute, a wiretap order contains a myriad of details that are not specified by the Fourth Amendment. Among those details are the crimes that are being investigated and the time period of --",
  "It specifies the crimes that are being investigated and it contains a minimization requirement which --",
  "It's a minimization as to what conversations they will intercept if they listen to a conversation and determine that it falls outside the scope of what they're authorized to intercept. Many of the calls that -- that are intercepted in these kinds of wiretaps require a considerable amount of judgment and discretion. Are the individuals talking in code? Are they talking about crimes in an oblique way that pertain to the subject of the warrant, or are they really having innocent conversations? And the officers can listen in long enough to make that determination. If they determine that it's a clean call, they have to minimize and terminate their interceptions.",
  "Justice Scalia, I -- I would certainly with respect to search of common areas. For example, this was a delivery to some sort of a --",
  "No. I'm saying that there would be --",
  "Well, I think one-seventeenth is pushing it for probable cause --",
  "-- which is why my answer was as to the common area. Certainly they can get a warrant that says we know that there's an item that represents evidence of a crime and that it's going to be at a particular location upon delivery and we can go in and search that location.",
  "Yes.",
  "With -- if what you're talking about is invading the individual expectations of privacy of -- of 50 --",
  "No, I -- I wouldn't because I don't think that -- that one-fiftieth in those circumstances would -- would be probable cause without more. I -- I do think --",
  "This case is different because there -- you -- you can subtract out all of the variables except will the postal officials, in fact, deliver it to the place where they're saying they will deliver it and they say that they're delivering it to a household that has actually placed the order.",
  "Then the -- then the warrant should not be executed because this affidavit said that --",
  "I think that that -- it's fair to say that it's not 100 percent controlled by the Postal Service, but I wouldn't say that there are a lot of things that are left up in the air or that there's any more that's left up in the air than in the kind of experience that goes on in installing a wiretap. Justice --",
  "Not under this warrant because it was secured by an affidavit that represented that it -- the warrant will not be executed unless and until the item is taken inside the house. And so the agents assumed the risk, so to speak, that the event that you described, Justice Ginsburg, would occur, and under those circumstances, the search wouldn't take place. Presumably under those circumstances an arrest would take place. A search would take place incident to the arrest of the individual. The videotape would be found, and the Government would have acquired the evidence that it's looking for, which is evidence with jury appeal that this individual has, in fact, received child pornography through the mail. And it's important to recognize that in this case there was ample probable cause that respondent had attempted to receive child pornography through the mail before the triggering event even took place, and had the agents wished to, they could have procured a warrant, a conventional warrant, so to speak, at that time that allowed the --",
  "Well, I don't think this was such a warrant, Justice Scalia. I'm -- I'm just pointing out that there was a chain of events that supported probable cause to a very strong degree and the triggering event represented that until the actual delivery had taken place and the item was brought in the house, the search wouldn't take place.",
  "It's -- it's fundamentally different. This case is fundamentally different from that hypothetical because the measure of probable cause at the time the warrant is issued is very weak under Justice Scalia's hypothetical. One out of 17 is pushing the envelope. One out of 50, at least absent some extraordinary national emergency, is probably well outside the envelope for saying we have probable cause to go into any particular place. Justice Scalia's hypothetical illustrates that the emergence of later facts can make it very clear that the agents can go in and get probable cause at that moment, but this case is fundamentally different because the agents have probable cause based on probabilities.",
  "That's right.",
  "That's right.",
  "That's right. And those fact --",
  "Well, I -- I think this takes me back to the fact that this warrant, number one, should be construed as a whole and not -- not by virtue of which box was checked and, number two, that there were many items that were specified in the warrant that -- and the warrant application that the agent had reason to believe were then concealed at the time. So this was really a case where the form warrant was inadequate to the -- to describe fully and accurately what was going on.",
  "Well, I think you do in --",
  "And that is --",
  "No. It's a -- it's a fair response into -- on how the warrant was drawn and why the statements that were made are not laughably wrong. They -- they are partially inaccurate because the videotape was clearly not on the premises at the time. They are partially right in that other evidence of child pornography distribution was. But this case -- and, Justice Stevens, I quite agree with you. This case only concerns the triggering condition because that --",
  "Yes, and that's the only thing that's before the Court.",
  "Yes.",
  "The -- the box on the warrant is. Again, I think that you need to --",
  "The same response that I gave to Justice Kennedy. The magistrate found that the warrant, the form of -- that constitutes the warrant, incorporated the attached affidavit, and the attached affidavit makes clear exactly what the agent had in mind. There is an alternative point here that I want to make before I reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal, and that is the Ninth Circuit's position, even if the Ninth Circuit were correct that the triggering condition needs to be in the warrant, should still not lead to the suppression of evidence because although the Government's submission is that the triggering condition is not required by the Particularity Clause, if some other doctrine under the Fourth Amendment did require it to be in the warrant, the warrant should be treated as one that is at most overbroad as to the time of permissible execution. That is, on its face it would authorize the warrant to be executed from the moment of issuance until 10 days after issuance instead of from the moment that the triggering condition is satisfied until 10 days after issuance. When courts have confronted overbroad warrants, what they have done is ask is there probable cause that supports part of this warrant. If the answer to that is yes, the next question is, is the evidence that's sought to be suppressed acquired under the part of the warrant that was validly supported by probable cause? If the answer to that is yes, there's no suppression. The warrant is, in effect, severed and the only suppression that can be obtained is as to evidence that was secured by execution of the part of the warrant that's not supported by probable cause. Here, there was ample probable cause to support the magistrate judge's conclusion that after the triggering condition was satisfied, the videotape would be on the premises. The warrant was not executed until after the delivery of the videotape took place, and therefore, there was no deficiency in the correlation between probable cause showings that were made to obtain the warrant and the time at which it was executed. And the result is that there should be no suppression of evidence. If I may save the rest of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Yes, Justice Scalia, because the representations that are made to the magistrate to secure the warrant include the fact that the warrant will not be executed and the agents should --",
  "That's true because I think that the magistrate is making the common sense judgment that this will be -- we don't know exactly when --",
  "It makes the representation, and I think what draws the link between the conditions that are represented to occur before the warrant will be executed and the warrant itself are paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the items that are to be seized because those pertain --",
  "I understand that, Justice Stevens. But the -- the items to be seized include the videotape and its containers which are paragraphs 1, 2, and 3.",
  "That's true. But those items -- the magistrate can conclude that there's probable cause to believe that they'll be on the premises only after delivery has taken place. And the magistrate has issued the warrant, and the three principal items at the top are those things. So it's logical to conclude that the magistrate formed the view that there's probable cause to believe that these items will be on the --",
  "I think it takes a very small step of logical inference, but I agree with you, Justice Stevens, that it doesn't say everything that is logically implied in the magistrate's probable cause finding. But the magistrate's probable cause finding is predicated on the view that the items will be there because the Postal Service has represented they'll deliver them. The burden of the Ninth Circuit's view is that the Particularity Clause applies to the triggering condition and mandates that it be stated in the text even though the Fourth Amendment's text doesn't contain that requirement. This Court in Dalia v. United States rejected a similar effort to add a requirement to a warrant that would authorize surreptitious entry to install a covert bugging device, and the Court's reasoning in Dalia makes clear that the Court was unwilling to go on a progressive path of reading things into the Fourth Amendment's Particularity Clause that are not there.",
  "No, I don't want the Court to send it back to the Ninth Circuit to impose yet new requirements on the execution of warrants.",
  "What I want the Court to hold is that the triggering condition in an anticipatory warrant is not subsumed in the Particularity Clause and therefore it need not be in the face of the warrant at all. And alternatively, if the Court believed that it did, that a warrant that's executed after the triggering condition has occurred, does not require suppression of evidence. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A panic-stricken call for help, which can occur on a 911 call, is not a form of bearing witness within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause that activates the rule in Crawford. Emergency statements, statements that are made to 911 operators and to officers at the scene investigating an urgent need to protect a person's safety, do not resemble the classic forms of testimonial evidence that were generated under the Marian statutes and the civil law practice that formed the impetus for the Confrontation Clause. In three significant respects, statements that are made in emergency questioning differ from the kind of testimony that prompted the rule in Crawford and the confrontation right that it rests on. First of all, in the classic examples of someone giving testimony, which this Court noted means a solemn declaration or affirmation for the purpose of proving a fact, people who are on 911 calls or seeking help at the scene of an -- an urgent situation are not making statements for the purpose of providing evidence in a case. They are making statements for the purpose of obtaining help, and that distinguishes them significantly from the kinds of subtle desires to shape and influence their statements that occur --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, we would distinguish between those kinds of 911 calls where someone is seeking protection from an imminent or present threat to their safety and a 911 call that's making a more generalized report of criminal activity or a desire for safety and maybe speaking in a narrative form about the past.",
  "Actually, Justice --",
  "Actually, Justice Scalia, I believe when the call begins, the caller is speaking in the present tense and says, he's here jumping on me again. And the 911 operator then begins to elicit information to find out what is the level of the threat to her safety and what actions need to be taken and says, okay, I've got help started. Help is on the way. Now, tell me what his name is, and she -- the -- the caller tells what the name is of the defendant and, at that point, says, he's running now. And so, it's only after critical information is imparted at the beginning of the call that the caller says that he's leaving. But even --",
  "I think in that situation, Justice Kennedy, there is still an imminent threatened potential of a recurrence. The person could come back. There's no protection on the scene. The reason that she's calling 911 and not a friend or -- or a health care provider is that she believes she needs protection right then. And the -- the nature of an emergency is such that it exerts a pressure both on the person who is seeking help, as well as the official responder from the government, to solve that urgent problem. Any evidentiary benefit that may come from that is really an incidental --",
  "That -- that situation would not fall within the emergency rule that the Government is arguing for today. What we're arguing for is a rule that deals when people's safety is --",
  "No. I'm not saying that, Justice Kennedy. I'm saying that the Court isn't confronted in this case with a situation in which threats not to the person but to property or the need to obtain or try to apprehend a fleeing felon are present.",
  "We would submit that that is not testimonial within the meaning of Crawford for many of the same reasons that -- that are present in this case. But it is a different case from this.",
  "Well --",
  "The urgency certainly in -- in the jewelry thief hypothetical does deal with apprehending the person who has just stolen the goods. And that's why I say that it falls outside of the rule that the Government is arguing for today. But, Justice Scalia, I think --",
  "I think there is a good --",
  "Well, I'm not going to say that we wouldn't, depending on how the Court analyzes this case, argue for a submission that that's not --",
  "What the Court needs to analyze today is whether an emergency statement where somebody is seeking protection and there is a threat of imminent recurrence of the very violence that has triggered the call is testimony. And it's not testimony because the sort of risks of government shaping and the declarant focus on providing evidence for use in a criminal case are not present, and the information has, as Justice Scalia pointed out, a unique probative value that's very different from the kind of submission of an affidavit or submitting to a civil law deposition that prompted the confrontation right. The Framers were thinking about things that we all would recognize as testimony, being deposed, submitting an affidavit, appearing before a -- a magistrate in a pretrial proceeding, and they used the word witness in the Confrontation Clause not only to refer to the kinds of statements that were covered, but in connection with knowledge that the same word appears in the Fifth Amendment and in the Sixth Amendment Compulsory Process Clause, where in all of those contexts, its most natural application is to the formal acquisition of evidence.",
  "Well, I think what's really striking, Justice Breyer, is that there is no 17th century case law that reflects that. There's really a virtual, complete absence on the other side of this case of an affirmative argument supported by decided cases that says that evidence of that character was even known to the Framers, let alone excluded. If you look closely at their constable cases, which is the closest cases that they -- they submit, one of them is a report from the Old Bailey online source which contains transcripts of criminal trials in -- in England, and one of them, the Radbourne case, is right around the time of the framing, and there's a little line in the transcript where the constable says, well, I bent down and I asked the victim something and then the judge says, well, don't say that. There's no evidence that that was regarded as a -- a legal ruling under confrontation principles. There's no evidence that the Framers were aware of the Radbourne Old Bailey report, and there's additional statutory basis in the treason statute, which was applicable there, which said that all evidence had to be given face to face. So that's their primary authority. Their next authority --",
  "What we have --",
  "The hue and cry reports, Justice Scalia, as I think your earlier questioning suggested, do not necessarily involve the kind of emergency situation what -- that we have here where a person is reaching out from an ongoing present criminal act against them and seeking help. And the fact that we have very little evidence at all of how 17th century British law handled this is really, I think, persuasive evidence that the Court should not deem the confrontation right as a response to some sort of abuses in this area.",
  "Justice Scalia, first of all, there is evidence that the hue and cry practice existed. There is not evidence about how hue and cry reports were viewed as a matter of evidence law. It is very difficult to transpose into 17th and 18th century English practice what we are dealing with now, in part because the system of public prosecutions that we have today where an official prosecutor representing the State carries the ball in a criminal case did not exist. The accuser had to appear in court as the private prosecutor. If the accuser did not appear, there was no prosecution, and these prosecutions were simply dismissed because there was no one official on the scene to carry the ball. So the -- the speculation that's required requires a number of inferential leaps that Petitioners have to make in order to draw an analogy. And at the same time, there really is an intuitive difference between the kinds of statements that people make in emergencies and the kind of core testimonial statements that we know prompted the confrontation right, the Sir Walter Raleigh case involving affidavits and letters, the Marian practice under which testimony was formally taken in the calm of a magistrate's rooming house rather than in the immediate aftermath or time when a crime was actually ongoing.",
  "It is, Mr. Chief Justice, in the sense that it's information that's needed to respond to and resolve the imminent threat to this woman's safety, which would certainly occur if the individual decided to come back and finish what he'd started. And if a law enforcement authority set up its 911 calls so as not to gather adequate information and this individual had come back and actually beaten or killed the victim, it would certainly be regarded as an inadequate response to the emergency situation of an ongoing violent attack. And so for that reason, the rule that we're describing here for the Court would deal with not only the present emergency but also its imminent, threatened recurrence.",
  "My -- my view on that is that the kinds of statements that are made in the immediate report of a crime are really in the form of excited utterances that are much different from the kind of dispassionate testimony that occurs after the fact that prompted the confrontation right. Now, the Court could accept that line and say that jewelry thief reports are not testimony within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause, or it could disagree and say that no, when there's not the immediate threatened, imminent potential for a recurrence of the violence, then we're going to treat that as closer to simply a report of a crime and treat it as testimonial. Court could go either way on that without touching the core of what's at issue today, which is namely emergency situations that pose a threat to the safety of the person who's making the call or who's encountered by a law enforcement officer on the scene in the immediate aftermath of an attack.",
  "I think that --",
  "-- the more that the -- the questioning begins to delve into a past narrative of past criminal activity, the more there is a reason to think that it serves, in addition to its protection purpose, an evidentiary purpose. I'd hasten to add, Justice Scalia, that that kind of information is very important for the officers to know to gauge the seriousness of the threat, to get the kind of idea of who they are dealing with, and to respond effectively. So it is reasonably necessary for those kinds of questions and that information to be elicited. But I also agree with Your Honor's suggestion that not everything that occurs in a 911 call should be regarded as per se non-testimonial. Not everything that happens at the scene of a crime should be regarded as per se non-testimonial. And naturally, the Court is going to have to apply a certain degree of analysis to the actual questions and answers that are given. But if you look at the protocol in this case for the 911 call, if you look at the kinds of questions that were asked and the information that was given, it is all reasonably necessary to resolve an emergency by a person who has really called in a state of extreme stress. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has made clear in its jurisprudence concerning the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel that the core purpose of that right is to secure a fair trial conducted in accordance with adversary procedures. As a result of the Court's analysis of that purpose, this Court has required in its Sixth Amendment assistance of counsel cases either a showing that prejudice be demonstrated in a particular case to show that a fair trial has not been guaranteed or that there is a basis for presuming prejudice.",
  "I believe that Gideon was decided in 1963, Justice Scalia.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, in fact, this Court has recognized that under the Sixth Amendment, as applied to the Federal Government, even before the Sixth Amendment was made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, that it did guarantee the right to appointed counsel if the defendant --",
  "Johnson v. Zerbst, I believe, was in the '30s.",
  "The -- the fact --",
  "Justice Scalia, our position on what the purpose of the Assistance of Counsel Clause is -- is drawn from what this Court has said that purpose is in the way that it's elaborated it. And I think that if the Court looks at the spectrum of contexts in which the Court has applied the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, it's apparent that the most fundamental aspect of the guarantee and the one that is most indispensable to protecting the fairness of a trial, which is the overarching goal of the Sixth Amendment, is that the defendant have counsel by his side at all.",
  "Well, I -- I think that this Court has made clear that the core element of fairness is protecting the defendant's ability to have a lawyer there at all, and if the lawyer is not there, the essential fairness of the trial is in jeopardy. And it's for that reason --",
  "There were --",
  "That's not entirely true, Justice Scalia, because there certainly were many jurisdictions, even at the time of the founding, that provided for the appointment of counsel if the defendant was not able to retain his own counsel.",
  "What this Court has done I think, in the course of the 20th century jurisprudence that has examined the right to counsel, is establish a hierarchy of the critical rights that are necessary for a fair trial. The first, of course, is that --",
  "Well, within limits, I think that that's certainly true, Mr. Chief Justice. But, of course, this case and many of the cases that raise this issue do not involve a situation in which the defendant is deprived of retained counsel with whom he can consult and whose strategic decisions he can control through his role as the client.",
  "I think within limits, that's absolutely right, Justice Kennedy. And the right of counsel of choice, as this Court has articulated it in its Wheat decision, is far from an absolute right. It's a qualified right that does yield to interests that are designed to protect the fairness of the trial.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think it's critical in this case that it -- the court never forced a lawyer on Respondent in this case.",
  "And the Respondent had months after that disqualification was made clear and the court of appeals denied mandamus to retain a different counsel if he chose to retain a different counsel. There's no showing in this record that the Respondent didn't consult with the lawyer who was disqualified and with the lawyer who he elected to have represent him at trial and not determine that that was in his best interest at that time.",
  "He was disabled --",
  "That's right, and that's why we are not disagreeing in this case that there's been an infringement of his constitutionally protected interest in having counsel of choice. But the question for this Court is how should that be defined as a denial of a Sixth Amendment right. Should it be something that is automatically reversible so that even if Respondent had --",
  "This Court has made clear that the right to self-representation is unique.",
  "It is a much greater right because it protects autonomy interests that are --",
  "It protects it, but in a much --",
  "There's a modest element of autonomy in the right of counsel of choice, but the right of self-representation is complete autonomy. There is no substitute for the individual defendant's voice in the courtroom. There is no representative that could give him that right. And this Court has also recognized that the right to self-representation is usually a right that redounds negatively for the defendant. It tends to produce worse trial outcomes for the defendant. And in recognition of the autonomy as independent of fair trial interests that are protected by the right of self-representation, this Court has placed it in that very small group of rights in which automatic reversal is appropriate.",
  "Our position is that if there were a clear abuse of discretion, in accordance with the ordinary mandamus standards --",
  "The Government's position is that he could seek a writ of mandamus, and if he qualified under the standards for mandamus, then he could obtain relief. This Court has already held in the Flanagan decision that there's no automatic right of interlocutory review from the denial of counsel of choice, and the Court did that in recognition of the fact that either the right could be vindicated at the end of the trial or it's not totally separable from the merits.",
  "I don't think it's really up to the Government. The defendant can seek mandamus, and if the --",
  "The Government's position is that it would depend on whether the defendant could satisfy the high standards required for mandamus. And certainly if the Government believed that the disqualification was --",
  "The Government doesn't dispute that as in this -- as this Court held in Wheat, there's a presumption in favor of counsel of choice. Every court has rules that govern how lawyers are to enter their appearances and represent defendants, and district courts can make --",
  "Not anytime, Justice Kennedy. I think that would effectively overturn this Court's holding in Flanagan, that there's no right of taking a collateral order appeal in every single case involving the disqualification of counsel. But what's critical here, I think, is to compare the position of a defendant who has no counsel at all, the position of a defendant who has counsel who's laboring under a conflict of interest, the position of a defendant who has a counsel who's not performing competently, who's making professionally unreasonable decisions. Only in the first of those instances has this Court held that automatic reversal without any showing of prejudice at all is warranted.",
  "Justice Scalia, Flanagan held that there was no collateral order appeal. It didn't address the mandamus question.",
  "In rejecting --",
  "What this Court said in Flanagan is that if the defendant, at the end of the day -- and if was the operative word -- could obtain automatic reversal, then the defendant's interests could be vindicated at the end of trial. And if, alternatively, the defendant had to establish prejudice, then the interlocutory appeal would fail the requirement that the issue be totally separate from the merits, and therefore, there was no collateral order appeal. And Flanagan didn't address this issue, but in addressing it, I suggest that this Court should look at the way that it has protected other criminal defendants' rights under the Sixth Amendment.",
  "Correct.",
  "Our -- our standard of prejudice, our preferred standard of prejudice, is the same as under Strickland. We would not require the defendant to show that his second-choice retained counsel performed incompetently. Second-choice retained counsel can perform fully competently and have made a significantly different strategic course of action than the counsel who actually went to trial, and that could easily be established by having an affidavit or testimony submitted. It's actually easier than conducting a Strickland inquiry because in Strickland, you're looking at the way counsel performed and your hypothesizing how a competent counsel would perform.",
  "Justice Alito, I don't think that it is that difficult. I think, in fact, it's easier than Strickland because in Strickland, you have to look at one lawyer and decide whether his performance was not competent and then hypothesize what a competent lawyer would have done, and then conduct the counter-factual inquiry of how it would have affected the trial.",
  "This almost invariably occurs in every Strickland case. And my fundamental submission here is that a defendant who is saddled with a lawyer who performs in an unprofessionally incompetent manner cannot overturn his conviction without --",
  "No, but I think that -- that Your Honor's question reveals that different lawyers will make different strategic judgments and assessing the impact of those on the trial --",
  "Well, the -- the remedy that -- that this Court has chosen when counsel is not competent requires I think a -- a systematic inquiry. I wouldn't call it entirely speculative. It's a focused inquiry into what the impact would have been had counsel performed differently.",
  "Well, I think it becomes considerably more than an ineffective assistance case. And the autonomy interest that's being protected here needs to be viewed in relation to the fact that the defendant can still retain his counsel. It's not that he's denied all choice of counsel. He's denied his first-choice counsel which --",
  "He may very well be denied that choice, Justice Souter, if he tries to retain that lawyer and that lawyer has a conflict of interest.",
  "Well, it isn't necessarily second-best. And the irony of Respondent --",
  "Well, if -- if he retains somebody else and that person obtains a complete acquittal, that -- that individual is, no doubt, going to be very satisfied. And the historical example --",
  "Justice Souter, I think what it illustrates is that the right to choose counsel is connected with the desirability, as Justice Scalia pointed out, of a favorable outcome. And it is not complete --",
  "There's --",
  "Yes, and I'm not suggesting that the Court apply the criteria in Strickland. And this Court has a variety of other standards that it could choose if it concluded that the Eighth Circuit's rule of automatic reversal provides an unjustified windfall for a defendant when it's considered that defendants who -- this would basically be equating the right of counsel of choice, which is available only to about 10 percent of our defendants in the criminal justice system, because the other 90 percent don't have the funds. Therefore, they're not hiring anyone.",
  "I'm not suggesting that it be taken away. I think that it needs to be protected.",
  "I'm saying that they have it, but in order for this Court to conclude that reversal of a trial that can be presumed fundamentally fair, because the defendant, in fact, went to trial with counsel who he had chosen, albeit as his second choice, should not occur with all of the societal impacts that that has, the potential for victims to have to go through a retrial.",
  "And -- and we're not disputing that that entitlement exists. The question is whether it should be remedied automatically, which puts it in a --",
  "I think the autonomy interest is deserving of protection, as this Court has held, but --",
  "No, I -- I don't agree that it's -- that it really has a function in the Sixth Amendment that's independent of what the Sixth Amendment itself says, which is the assistance of counsel for his defense. And this Court has made clear that in the context in which it's looked at and involving conflicted counsel, involving ineffective counsel, involving total denial of counsel, involving appointment of counsel or even the retention of counsel in a situation where no lawyer could be expected to perform in a competent manner and protect the defendant's rights, that all of those rights and interests are tied to the basic purpose of the Assistance of Counsel Clause. It is not a expressive clause in the middle of the Constitution. It is not a mini First Amendment. It is a right that is tied to the purpose of the Sixth Amendment guarantee in helping assure fair trial outcomes.",
  "That's right.",
  "That is correct. And that is why this Court, in construing this right, in the context of what I think is probably the most critical aspect of the right, once you have a lawyer in the criminal justice system, namely the right to the effective assistance of counsel, the Court has looked to the impact on the fairness of the trial. Now, this Court --",
  "No, you could not say that, Justice Scalia. This Court did not infer the right of self-representation from the Assistance of Counsel Clause. It inferred it from the network of rights that are provided in the Sixth Amendment --",
  "I don't think that's accurate, Justice Scalia, because what the Court made clear in its self-representation cases is that there was an important historical tradition that was being protected, and it's being protected independent of the defendant's interest in a successful outcome. It's allowing the defendant to speak to the jury in his own voice because there's something deemed fundamentally unfair about a system in which a defendant needs to go to prison without ever having been able to speak in his own voice to a courtroom.",
  "I don't deny that there's a historical tradition, Justice Souter.",
  "But it's a very qualified one.",
  "There -- the point that the Court relied on in concluding that automatic reversal was appropriate for denial of the right to self- representation included the critical fact that this is not a right that proceeds in connection with the fairness of the trial. Its -- its sole existence is --",
  "I think that it is a right that should be -- an interest that should be recognized, and it is, of course, recognized in Wheat by saying that it's comprehended within the Sixth Amendment. There is a qualified interest that a defendant has in retaining counsel of choice. But should it be elevated to be equated with the total denial of counsel?",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I think the Court has before it three options for some standard that would not consist of an automatic reversal standard. The first, and the Government's preferred position, is that the defendant should come in and show what counsel of first choice would have done as a matter of strategy and show that if he had pursued that, it would create a reasonable probability of a different outcome, the same test as in Strickland.",
  "More favorable --",
  "That's right. The same -- same test as in Strickland. It doesn't require proof that more likely than not the defendant would have been acquitted, but it undermines confidence in the outcome.",
  "I think, Justice Scalia, you'd have to actually look at the specific facts of the case and make a determination.",
  "And if that's because any court would conclude that that defense was not likely to prevail, then I would submit that the proper accommodation of the societal interest in respecting a final judgment and protecting the interest -- the qualified interest in counsel of choice is properly resolved.",
  "Correct.",
  "The second option would be the standard that the Seventh Circuit selected in Rodriguez v. Chandler, which requires a showing that the second- choice lawyer was deficient in some important qualification or would -- pursued a different strategic interest and a different strategic approach than first- choice counsel, and that's it. More analogous to this Court's conflicts jurisprudence where, when there is simultaneous multiple representation, it's sufficient for the defendant to show a different strategic approach that was not taken because the conflict caused the -- the lawyer not to do that, and there's no requirement of outcome determinativeness that goes along with that. And the third alternative would simply be to provide a harmless error standard, instead of deeming this to be structural error, equating it with a biased judge, total denial of counsel, racial discrimination in the grand jury. This Court could provide a standard in which it's the Government's burden to show that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, which in cases of overwhelming evidence, the Government could establish. And although, I acknowledge, Justice Souter, that the autonomy interest would be, to a certain extent, lost in that instance, there are many rights, many interests that are sacrificed and not deemed remediable when the error is found harmless.",
  "Justice Souter, I -- I do want to reserve the remainder of my time, but the point is that a defendant who has his second-choice opportunity of counsel is able to express his autonomy interests in a much more significant way than a defendant who is denied the right to self-representation.",
  "I'd like to reserve my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Respondent's submission in the Eighth Circuit's holding in this case is fundamentally anomalous in two respects. The first is that it is anomalous when compared to the other rights that this Court has acknowledged protection of under the Sixth Amendment because it accords to a defendant who had the full opportunity to select his counsel and to select a backup counsel the same remedy as a defendant who had no lawyer at all. And it's anomalous factually because a defendant who is deprived of his first-choice counsel may have selected that counsel improvidently, may select his second-choice counsel with much greater care, may obtain a lawyer who is far more competent and far more effective, and all of those things have to be discarded on Respondent's view and the Eighth Circuit's holding and automatic reversal ordered, forcing society to bear the costs of a retrial even when there is no reasonable probability or it is a beyond a reasonable doubt that no lawyer could have made a difference. And the proper accommodation of the values that are at stake in this case is to recognize that some form of prejudice inquiry is appropriate before this Court imposes on the judicial system the extreme consequence of automatic reversal.",
  "No. The Seventh Circuit made perfectly clear in the Rodriguez case that it was rejecting on the merits the view that automatic reversal is warranted. And the view that automatic reversal is warranted largely arose from a misunderstanding of this Court's Flanagan decision in which dictum was quoted as if it were a holding and because the courts failed to triangulate the right in question here with the right that this Court has recognized in the ineffectiveness context and in the conflicts context. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Neder versus United States, this Court held that the omission of an offense element from petit jury instructions can be harmless error, even though that omission violates the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. Our submission is that the same analysis applies to the omission of an offense element from a grand jury's indictment. Such an error violates the Fifth Amendment, but it is harmless when the petit jury, having been properly instructed on all of the elements of the offense, returns a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.",
  "That's correct, Justice Kennedy. In fact, parties do move to dismiss indictments for failure to allege all of the elements of the offense. That happened here. The motion was erroneously denied by the trial judge. The trial judge, under Ninth Circuit law, under the assumption that the Ninth Circuit has properly interpreted the law, should have concluded that this indictment failed to allege the substantial step that was part of the attempt. And if the judge had done that, then the Government would have gotten back to the grand jury and obtained a superseding indictment. Instead what the judge did was deny the motion, finding that the indictment itself was sufficient, and then instructed the jury on all of the elements that the Ninth Circuit requires as part of this offense. And so we have now a petit jury verdict beyond a reasonable doubt finding that the attempt did involve a substantial step towards the completion of the offense.",
  "Well, first of all, Justice Souter, motions like this are typically made long in advance of trial, as this one was. Waiting until the day of trial is far from the optimum practice.",
  "Well, I think what it reinforces is that the judge has enough time to look at it and conscientiously attempt to get the law right without the need for the court to apply the heavy hand of automatic reversal.",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that is our position.",
  "My response, Mr. Chief Justice, is the same response that this Court gave in United States versus Mechanik, where it was confronted with an analogous problem. And that was in that case, a violation of the rule that allowed two witnesses to testify at the same time before the grand jury. And the Court was specifically confronted with the question: Was this harmless error because the petit jury has now found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt? And it answered that question yes. And en route to that answer, it said, we could logically be persuaded that what we're supposed to do is compare the evidence in front of the grand jury to the error and see whether the error was prejudicially consequential for the grand jury's decision. But we're not going to do that, the Court explicitly said in Mechanik, because once there is a finding of beyond a reasonable doubt, the question of probable cause is shown a fortiori and - -",
  "No, Justice Scalia, the district court should decide this question in advance of trial when it's properly raised and, if the indictment is defective, dismiss it. And this Court has recognized that trial judges don't need incentives of an automatic reversal rule to get them to comply with the law. And I want to amend - -",
  "In this case?",
  "Yes. And the Ninth Circuit's ruling that this indictment was defective was really - - bolt out-of-the-blue might be too strong. But it was an extension of its prior precedents in a way that wasn't directly foreseeable. The United States Attorney's office had every reason to believe, based on language in prior Ninth Circuit cases, that alleging an attempt to enter was adequate to allege the offense.",
  "Justice Alito - -",
  "We did not challenge in our certiorari petition, which this Court granted, the Ninth Circuit's holding that in order for an attempt to be accomplished there needs to be a substantial step, and in an indictment under section 1326, there needs to be an allegation of what that substantial step is.",
  "Well, it is common law - -",
  "Well, that's certainly the Government's position, Justice Kennedy. But it is well settled in the common law that attempts require a substantial step towards the completion. There are variations that different jurisdictions use. That's the Model Penal Code formulation. The Ninth Circuit I think has gone beyond where some other courts have gone, as Justice Alito was noting, by saying that the indictment needs to spell out the factual basis for that substantial step.",
  "The indictment would have to say that he attempted to enter the United States and took a substantial step towards the completion of that crime, to wit he approached the border and came to the guard and presented false identifications to the guard and lied about his intended destination.",
  "Well, Justice Alito, I'm not going to defend what the Ninth Circuit did here, but I will be clear about the following: There is a generic legal issue at stake in this case that we face in the Ninth Circuit and in other courts around the country because indictments are not always written perfectly. And whether it's an element that the Ninth Circuit has improperly read into it or an element that a court has properly read into a statute, we do face the situation where - -",
  "They did, Justice Breyer.",
  "No.",
  "We didn't really have a lot of choice about it. I mean, the Ninth Circuit decided to read the statute this way and it reversed the conviction. There's not a circuit split under section 1326. We have to bring thousands of indictments in the Ninth Circuit, so we're not exactly going to set up test cases to risk our convictions based on the Ninth Circuit's rule.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, it's not unusual for this Court to decide a case where the Government does not challenge the underlying constitutional ruling and make some remedial argument. Two very notable examples are United States versus Leon, where the Government did not challenge the underlying Fourth Amendment claim that was found to be valid by the lower court, but instead simply asked for a modification of the exclusionary rule; and another example is Rose versus Clark, which involves a fairly analogous issue to this one, whether it can be harmless error to fail to incorporate into the jury instructions the actual element and instead rely on a mandatory rebuttable presumption. In that case the State did not challenge whether the instruction violated the Constitution. This Court didn't decide it. Instead, what it decided was the remedial question of harmless error, which is an important question and I submit doesn't change in character depending on the nature of the underlying error.",
  "It may have a different atmosphere, but I don't think that it has any different legal analysis behind it.",
  "Well, I think our fundamental submission here is that with respect to the probable cause determination, there is no prejudice because of the petit jury's verdict. With respect to notice, we would acknowledge that a defendant could argue that the defect in a grand jury indictment in a particular case could fail to give him adequate notice such that he might have a case-specific claim of prejudice and be able to overturn the conviction. On the facts of this case, I agree with you, Justice Stevens, that would not be a very strong argument. There really is no reason to think that there was any notice problem with this very discrete transaction which was alleged in the indictment as occurring on a particular date in a particular place.",
  "Justice Breyer, I think that an empirical perspective might be helpful here. And I think an empirical perspective, if you look around the circuits and you see the number of issues, cases, in which this issue is raised, it becomes clear that there are a large number of situations in which mistakes get made. I mean, we're talking about a Federal system here in which 70 to 80,000 cases are indicted a year. Mistakes will happen, and they will happen both by the trial judge and by the prosecutor. And there will be situations in which the circuits change the law or the interpretation of the law after the decision in question. I think that this is a good example of that, where the Ninth Circuit extended its prior precedents to find that an indictment that didn't allege the overt act was inadequate. And then the Government is stuck, and the rule of automatic reversal, which the Court may appear to think in this case is particularly disproportionate since the indictment looks fine, functions identically even if there's a conceded violation that every member of the Court would say yes, there's a missing element here. The fundamental problem is that the grand jury sits to decide probable cause. It does not decide whether the defendant is actually guilty.",
  "Well, I actually do not agree that there's any stronger evidence, Mr. Chief Justice, that grand juries didn't indict when the Government had adequate evidence than there is historical evidence that petit juries did not convict when there's proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In both instances, you can point to historical instances in which grand juries and petit juries played a role of in effect nullifying when there was adequate evidence. But it's clear from the Neder decision that that history has not led to the conclusion that this Court cannot evaluate petit jury defects for harmlessness, and the same conclusion ought to be true a fortiori for the grand jury.",
  "Well, Justice Souter, experience doesn't show that, in fact, district courts don't grant these motions. They grant them, as Justice Breyer indicated, when the indictment is not sufficient.",
  "Well, I do think we can assume that Article III judges are a hearty enough species so that they can make up their minds and they can rule. But to the extent that there is a risk here that judges might reserve the motion, that is the same risk that the Court fessed up to and acknowledged in the Mechanik case, where in fact the judge did reserve the motion.",
  "Well, given that this issue arises only when you have a petit jury verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, it seems overwhelmingly likely that any grand jury would have found probable cause.",
  "The grand jury transcript is not in this record, Justice Ginsburg, and we do not suggest that the Court adopt a rule in which it reviews the adequacy of the evidentiary showing before the grand jury. There are important values in grand jury secrecy. They will, of course, be compromised at the trial stage if witnesses testify and the testimony is turned over in that context. But more important than the practical aspect is exactly the logic that the Court used in Mechanik. The point of the grand jury indictment is to determine is there enough to take this person to trial. Once the person has been taken to trial and been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, we know that if the Government went back to the grand jury it would be able to get an indictment.",
  "No, I would not go that far, Justice Alito. I would draw the same line that this Court drew in the Midland Asphalt case where it was looking at a somewhat analogous problem of an interlocutory appeal and the same line that it drew in Neder itself. In Neder the Court said if the judge directs a verdict of guilty, that's an impermissible act and it cannot be rendered harmless no matter how overwhelming the evidence is. In the Midland Asphalt case, this Court dealt with whether the language of the Fifth Amendment created a right not to be tried. And it does say \"No person shall be held to answer absent an indictment issued by a grand jury,\" and the Court said if you have a defect that causes an indictment not to be an indictment or, as in your hypothetical, Justice Alito, no indictment at all, or if you have a defect that causes the grand jury not to be a grand jury, those are the kind of fundamental errors that would give rise to a right not to be tried such that you could take an appeal before trial, an interlocutory appeal. And I would submit that the same kind of principle would apply here.",
  "I'm borrowing the language from the Midland Asphalt opinion, but I think that it was a poetic way of putting the point that if you don't have - -",
  "When you don't have one.",
  "You could push the logic of that argument that far.",
  "Just as in the Neder case, you could say that it would be harmless error if a judge directed a jury verdict when the evidence was overwhelming on all of the elements. But the Court did draw a distinction between those two situations. And I think that it's one that responds to a kind of common - sense view of how fundamental an intrusion is there.",
  "Well, chances are he did know what crime he was accused of.",
  "And we submit - -",
  "Well, it isn't quite like that, I hope, Justice Breyer. I mean, notice defects are very commonly alleged by defendants and courts know how to look for prejudice. They know how to say whether the defendant was denied an opportunity to prepare his defense or misled by the indictment in some fashion or another. And that's a very common case by case sort of prejudice inquiry that fits with the nature of the violation.",
  "Well, what you get are cases where there needs to be an effect on interstate commerce and it's not alleged and then the Government comes up with proof. I'm not saying that there is going to be a vast pool of cases in which defendants would validly be able to show prejudice from lack of notice; and that's because we do have many other means in the criminal justice system to alert the defendant to what he's facing. There's discovery, there's the opportunities for a bill of particulars to be filed. Those are the kinds of conventional harmless error inquiries that are appropriate when you have a claim that the indictment fails to give adequate notice. But what is not appropriate is for the Ninth Circuit to impose a rule on the Government and on the system of justice that says we will automatically reverse, because there are important values at stake here whenever a rule of automatic reversal is contemplated. And this was true in the Mickens versus Taylor case where the Court rejected a rule of automatic reversal when a judge didn't ask a question in response to an obvious conflict - -",
  "There are two aspects to our rule, Justice Kennedy. The first is that to the extent that the claim of a defective indictment goes to the question of was there probable cause, that error and that constitutional value is not a basis for reversal once a petit jury has found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on the same point. To the extent that the defect in the indictment goes to inadequate notice, a defendant can make such a claim post trial that the indictment prejudiced him because it was inadequately framed. But that should be done on a case-specific basis rather than on a rule of automatic reversal.",
  "Yes, Justice Scalia. I don't believe there would be any double jeopardy bar to reindicting him since he is the one who's challenged his conviction. I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "It's a substantive offense. It is an attempt offense. I wouldn't necessarily describe it as lesser included, but Rule 31 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure does allow a trial judge to submit an attempt offense to the petit jury when attempt is a violation of the substantive law. I should say that the Government's position is that there does not need to be a separate charge of attempt in the indictment in order to permit Rule 31 to operate, but there is a circuit split over whether lesser included offenses can be submitted to the jury unless they are included in the indictment. So we're not operating under a uniform rule that would always allow us to do that, and I'm not sure which way the Ninth Circuit goes on that, although I could hazard a guess. The problem that we have here is that we are living under a rule of law in the Ninth Circuit and in at least one other circuit that forces the Government to pay a tremendous penalty when a mistake is made in an indictment, and it does happen. Justice Souter, I can assure you that judges dismiss plenty of indictments for failure to dismiss -- state elements, but they don't get them all.",
  "Well, the Government is often quite confident that it's correct. And I think if you put yourself in the position of the prosecutors in this case, you can see why that's true. But there are myriad rules and sub-rules of substantive law that this Court will never review, that require the Government to conform with various pleading obligations. They're all below the radar screen. But when you have a rule of automatic reversal like this, they jump up to prominence. And the reason that they do is because the entire criminal justice system, victims, witnesses, the judge, the prosecutors, the defense bar, jurors, everybody is being asked to go through a trial that was conducted on an error-free basis by hypothesis, simply because there was a mistake at the charging phase. And the petit jury's verdict we submit makes it clear that that mistake does not entitle the judicial system to say let's throw it all out and start again simply as a prophylactic mechanism.",
  "Well, I hope that if the Court does not choose to decide the question on which it granted certiorari, that it does hold that the Ninth Circuit's substantive rule of law here is incorrect, and that there was nothing wrong with the indictment.",
  "Oh, I think this Court can do anything it chooses, regardless of the Government's concession. But we're not conceding that the Ninth Circuit was correct. We simply didn't challenge it because the important question for us is the rule of law on harmless error. This pleading rule is something that we can comply with. It may be wrong, but it's something, like many wrong rules of law, we live with.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court in Booker concluded that the remedial severing of the statute's provision for mandatory application of the guidelines and a provision governing the standards of review on appeal rendered the statute constitutional. It further implied a standard of review of reasonableness of guideline sentences on appeal, and it did not elaborate what that reasonableness requirement means. The Government submits that the best interpretation of a reasonableness form of review would be one that conforms as closely as it can to Congress's original intent of minimizing and eliminating unwarranted sentencing disparities between similarly situated defendants.",
  "Justice Scalia, as I think we talked about in the last argument, in theory it could be if this Court concludes that judicial determinations on appeal are equivalent to guidelines promulgated by a commission or statute, and if what the court of appeals does is essentially function as a sentencing commission, literally prescribing particular levels of punishment for recurring sets of facts. The Government's submission here is not that the court of appeals has to do that in order to apply a proportionality principle. A proportionality principle will look to all of the facts of the case and will try to get a handle on, is this a reasonable sentence in response to all of the facts and circumstances that the judge articulated within - -",
  "Well, he doesn't, Justice Scalia, because the second defendant may not encounter a judge who concludes that that quantity warrants the same level of leniency or any leniency at all. That judge will retain the judge's classic discretion to look at the totality of the facts and conclude whether a sentence that would be below the range is a reasonable sentence. And unlike a situation that some of us might prefer in which the court of appeals would ensure that like cases are treated with reasonable consistency, the system of reasonableness review on top of advisory guidelines will not produce perfect levels of consistency. And what the defendant is entitled to under the Sixth Amendment rulings of this Court is knowing that if the law says if I commit this crime and these are the facts that support it, my level of sentence is this and no higher, that any higher sentence that's produced by a fact finding gives him a jury trial entitlement. That's what the Sixth Amendment entitles you. But no defendant who commits a crack offense can say that even after a series of court of appeals rulings that mark out various points of reasonableness. That defendant will not know whether the judge that he or she appears in front of will give the same kind of weight to those facts as some other judge did who was affirmed or reversed. Nor will that judge be able to say what is the constellation of policy and factual reasons that this particular judge will find in announcing the judge's sentence. So I don't think that a proportionality principle runs afoul of the Sixth Amendment. And I don't think that it runs afoul of anything in 3553(a) or any other part of the statute. What the Court is left with is the task of interpreting reasonableness, and I submit it should ask the same question that it asked in Booker itself: Which alternative, the Petitioner's alternative in this case or the Government's, conforms more closely to Congress's original claim in the Sentencing Reform Act? The Petitioner's version of appellate review as I understand it is very light review, if at all, of the substance of what the district judge does. It may reach a truly extreme case such as if a judge said a second degree murderer, I think probation is the appropriate sentence. Perhaps the Petitioner would concede that that would be arbitrary and irrational; but beyond such an extreme case that it is so unlikely to arise that Petitioner can feel free to give it away, Petitioner gives the Court nothing, and gives the courts of appeals nothing to apply standards to determine whether a particular sentence is reasonable. And that is what the court of appeals have been reaching for when eight of them have adopted this proportionality principle.",
  "I think at a high level of generality, that is true. Because what the sentencing commission is good at is taking paradigmatic circumstances and assigning them a numerical weight that will transfer into a sentence. And what the strength of the district judge is is looking at the defendant in front of that particular judge and seeing how that person's characteristics may map onto the policies of sentencing. But I don't agree that that distinction would support a two-track form of appellate review that would give the district judge greater deference to take personal characteristics into account and to impose widely varying sentences. That is exactly the situation that we had in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era when any district judge could choose whatever policies of sentencing appeal to that judge, find the facts, and impose a widely disparate sentence. And as the Court well knows, there was no appellate review of that exercise of discretion unless it could be shown that the judge didn't exercise discretion at all. Now it is not an exercise of discretion if a judge simply says for this crime, I always give the same sentence. That would not take into account the full range of facts and factors that are present in the sentencing court and as a result, that wouldn't be an exercise of discretion. But in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era, the judge had pretty much plenary reign to decide what facts mattered. If we continue with that same sort of deference on appeal in the Booker remedial opinion, then it's hard for me to see how appellate review can serve any valid purpose of channeling and ensuring some consistency and uniformity in the way district judges impose sentencing.",
  "I agree.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, if the system that you're describing is a replica of the system that existed under Koon versus United States - -",
  "-- then it runs into the same problem that led to the constitutional problem in Booker. Where I think I would amend Your Honor's proposal is that if the judge concludes that this is a typical case but the guideline really doesn't prescribe what I think is a reasonable sentence and here are the reasons why, in the pre-Sentencing -- in the pre-Booker system, that could have been problematic legally. Today, it is not forbidden. But what it should be subject to is a reasonableness review check on appeal that take a look at what are the reasons that the district judge articulated for that sentence.",
  "That's correct.",
  "I do think, though, that the Court should be concerned about each district judge formulating his or her own set of personal sentencing guidelines and then applying them in the court to the cases that appear on that judge's docket without any check on appellate review to ensure that, although the sentence might be in some possible world reasonable, it's out of whack with what the Sentencing Commission has prescribed and what other district judges are doing. If there is no check on appeal, then I do think that the clock has been turned back to the 1983 era before the Sentencing Reform Act; and that does not seem to me a reasonable interpretation of what the Booker remedial opinion thought it was accomplishing. What the Booker remedial opinion said that it was accomplishing was providing an important mechanism that Congress itself had intended, namely appellate review, in order to iron out sentencing differences. And our submission is that inherently means some form of substantive proportionality review.",
  "I think what is proportional is a matter of common sense, and the eight circuits that have been using this rule have not had a great deal of difficulty in noting that you look at the extent to which the sentence varies from the guidelines range, you look at the absolute amount of time that's involved, and have a sense of is this a significant deviation away from what the guidelines would actually describe.",
  "If the sentencing court articulates a bad reason, namely a reason that's irrational or one that does not respond to facts of the case, then that really shouldn't justify the sentence at all and what the court of appeals should do is vacate it, send it back for resentencing, and allow the district court to articulate the reasons why the sentence that the court now chooses to impose is an appropriate sentence under 3553(a).",
  "That's right. And I think, Justice Ginsburg, you've done a better job of articulating a justification for the sentence than the judge's own articulation, which did not focus on family separation and employment to the degree that you have now articulated it. What the judge did was focus on the quantity of drugs and the fact that the defendant didn't have any criminal history and that he qualified for the safety valve. She also said, without specifying any other cases, that other cases that have come before my court have had -- you know -- perhaps larger quantity of drugs and very different sentences. When a court of appeals is asked to review that line of reasoning and try to decide whether the outside the guidelines sentence is reasonable, it makes sense for the court to ask, do we know anything, for example, about what this judge is saying about other cases with other drug quantities? There's no specifics in the record that enable the Court of Appeals to measure the accuracy or the validity of that observation. It's also relevant for the court of appeals to say the guidelines range itself has taken into account all of the factors that this judge has previously noted and what has happened in the sentence is that the judge has varied widely from the sentence for reasons that the commission already took into account. Now, that doesn't prohibit the judge from relying on those facts, but it does mean that the farther the sentence goes from the guidelines range the more likely there is to be unwarranted disparity.",
  "Well, this brings me to my last point about this particular sentencing, which is that in this very case Judge Jackson looked at the defendant. She said, candidly I don't know really very much about you other than what I've learned about in the presentence report and I can't tell whether you're unlucky or you're stupid, and then effectively gave him a sentence that reflected, you know, a tremendous indulgence of a presumption that maybe this kid needs a wakeup call and nothing more. What she ignored is his own proffer in the safety valve that he had been on a street corner for 2-1/2 months selling crack cocaine, that he was arrested and placed into the State system, put into a pretrial diversion program through a drug court, in essence being said, here's your chance, you know, straighten up, we are going to be lenient on you, we're going to give you an opportunity to reintegrate with your family, and what did the defendant do but get caught within 6 months with 5 grams of crack. And on that record -- and this is what the court of appeals said -- there's a disconnect between the judge's conclusion that, with little information more than what she had in the PSR, the kid deserved leniency versus the fact that he had already had that chance and he had not - -",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, we're not relying on the inference of the - -",
  "Well, supported by the record is something of a judgment call. You'd have to assume that Mr. Claiborne was found by the police, 6 months after he had previously been arrested for crack offenses, holding a 5-gram bag of crack and that was the very first time after his arrest that he had been in possession of drugs, that just he got extremely unlikely, the police caught him.",
  "That's right. And I would say that a reasonable fact-finder could draw that conclusion.",
  "Not in my view. And I think on this record that's not a fact that we're relying on. It's not a fact that the Government - -",
  "This aspect of the court of appeals opinion in my view is not essential to the judgment that it reached, which is correct.",
  "It may have, but what they did not mention is an equally validate reason for concluding that this is a defendant who is in effect a recidivist even though he had no criminal history. He had been previously arrested for crack distribution crimes. He had admitted that this was not -- the occasion of his arrest wasn't the first opportunity that he had to deal crack. He'd been doing it for 2-1/2 months. And the judge essentially turned all of those facts off. She did not really factor that into her sentence at all. And the court of appeals, although it may have fastened on the wrong time frame in concluding that this defendant was in effect a recidivist and not the sort of blameless ingenue that the trial judge had treated him as, the record does indeed support the court of appeals' central conclusion, which is this defendant, despite his criminal history, really looks more like a recidivist. And when you're talking about a defendant whose mandatory minimum sentence would have been 5 years, but who gets out of that sentence because he satisfies the safety valve which allows defendant who is a first-time offender and meets certain other requirements to get a sentence under the mandatory minimum, that defendant's culpability had already been substantially reduced under the guidelines because of the safety valve and because of his criminal history. And the judge basically said: I'm going to take a chance with him and give him a much lower sentence than what the guidelines described. Our view is the judge can look at the facts she looked at, but she went down to a level that is productive of unwarranted disparity.",
  "That's correct. We're not arguing for a presumption of unreasonableness on appeal. We're arguing for a presumption of reasonableness for a guidelines sentence. For an out of guidelines sentence there is no presumption that it is unreasonable, but the court of appeals under a proportionality analysis would look and require increasingly strong reasons with the increasing degree of variance from - -",
  "I think you want a better reason for a sentence that is farther away from some mean.",
  "Justice Scalia, I don't think that the courts of appeals are, at least absent very unusual circumstances, to act as sentencers to specify a sentence. There have been a couple of instances where courts of appeals have said this is really the bottom sentence that we can see that would be reasonable on this particular constellation of facts. I think that reflect as sense of potential impatience with a ping-pong game that would occur if the court of appeals says your sentence is unreasonable, Mr. District Judge, and the district judge imposes a sentence that's one day lower. Another solution to that problem would be reassignment to a different judge who would start with a clean slate and could read the court of appeals' opinion and apply the section 3553 factors. We are not suggesting that the court of appeals should assume the sentencing role here. All we're suggesting is that the court of appeals needs to have some intelligible legal principles that allow it to identify and select unreasonable sentences versus reasonable sentences; and when you have wide statutory ranges as you do in the Federal system, if you don't have the guidelines describing at least a benchmark, it's not more, then I don't think courts of appeals have a good, coherent, consistent way of fulfilling their tasks. And if the courts of appeals can do that, can look more with greater scrutiny at a sentence the farther that it goes outside the guidelines range, without violating the statute and without violating the Constitution, then it seems to me the only thing for the Court to ask at that point is which approach, that approach of proportionality, or and approach that basically says appellate review is procedural only, absent the most glaringly aberrant sentences, conforms to Congress's intent of producing a greater degree of uniformity and consistency.",
  "That -- that is true. But I submit that -- I would like to hear what Petitioner has to say. If Petitioner's client had been given 10 years in this case, I have no doubt that Petitioner would be arguing that's an unreasonable sentence. But I don't see how you reach that judgment assuming that the court has articulated a rationale that's consistent with section 3553 and a rational interpretation of the facts, unless you have the guidelines as an anchor for the analysis. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals appropriately applied a presumption of reasonableness in reviewing the sentence imposed pursuant to the advisory guidelines system that this Court announced in United States versus Booker. The guidelines represent the integration of the multiple purposes of sentencing reflected in section 3553(a) that the district court is obligated to consider. The commission also represents an expert body that has considered the various parameters of sentencing and the fact patterns that arise in the Federal system and has made an effort over time to arrive at an appropriate - -",
  "Justice Stevens, the commission considered that factor and then determined that it was not generally appropriate to a sentence outside the guidelines.",
  "The guidelines specifically do not give weight to it. They permit a judge - -",
  "Under Booker the judge should do that. That is the difference between an advisory guidelines system and a mandatory guidelines system. The judge can give weight to factors That the commission decided should not have weight in the sentencing process. That is the essence of what it means for the guidelines - -",
  "He can do that, too, Justice Scalia.",
  "I think we're back, Justice Breyer, to a further point even than the first set of guidelines, because even under the first set of guidelines application of the guidelines was mandatory unless the court found an aggravating or mitigating circumstance that wasn't taken into account.",
  "I understand that, Justice Breyer.",
  "I think that the reconciliation of this Court's merits opinion in Booker and its remedial opinion in Booker does dictate that the judge has additional freedom to impose a sentence that's different from what's described in the guidelines.",
  "Justice Breyer, I think we have to distinguish between what the job of the district court is and what the job of the appellate court is; and in this case, the Government is arguing for a presumption of reasonableness on appeal. Once the district judge has determined that the guidelines sentence aligns with his own application of the section 3553(a) factors, our submission here is that a court of appeals can generally presume that that is a reasonable sentence. The defendant of course has the opportunity, or the Government if the Government has appealed, to show that that presumption is overcome.",
  "Justice Souter, I'm not sure that that would be true even if what we were talking about was a direction to the district judge to presume that he would impose a guidelines sentence. But that's not what we're talking about. The district judge does not operate and does not have to operate under the position that we're arguing for with a presumption that the judge will impose a guidelines sentence unless persuaded otherwise. The judge's obligation is to - -",
  "I would think that what the judge wants to do is be sure that he's complied with his statutory obligations.",
  "Well, we are.",
  "That's true, Justice Kennedy. But I think what it reflects at the appellate level is that the court of appeals enters the case with an attitude that, our job is to decide whether what the district judge did was reasonable. We can operate - -",
  "Yes, I think that it's not so different from the court of appeals saying we can enter this case feeling pretty confident that we can affirm a guidelines sentence unless the person who challenges that shows us a good reason otherwise.",
  "The latter, Justice Souter. And I think that in that regard there is a range of reasonable sentences that could be imposed based on a given set of facts.",
  "The court of appeals can uphold both of them if it concludes that the actual sentence that's imposed is reasonable. And in the second case that the Court is going to hear today the Government argues for a proportionality principle that should govern the review of sentencing.",
  "It is, and it's not the first choice of the Government, either. But it strikes me that it is something of an inevitability once this Court has declared that mandatory guidelines are impermissible under the Constitution if judicial factfinding - -",
  "It probably does not, Justice Alito. But what happened in the first part of Booker is that the Court declared that the guidelines are advisory and advice. It's advice that can be accepted or rejected.",
  "Let me try to address that and try to address Justice Alito's point about the question of how much sentencing philosophy can be decreed by the sentencing commission or Congress before a Sixth Amendment problem arises. As I understand this Court's sequence of opinions from Apprendi leading up to the most recent decision in Cunningham, if the law establishes a level of punishment that may be imposed based on the facts found by the jury and says to the judge, judge, you may not go above it unless you find a particular fact, that fact is subject to the Sixth Amendment rule that the Court has announced and must be found by a jury.",
  "Any fact at all, as a matter of fact is what the Court has said, although I understand that to mean facts pertaining to the offense and the offender, not facts about the world such as the prevalence of crime. Now, what that leads me to conclude is that in order to escape the bright line rule that's been announced in this sequence of cases, including Booker itself and most recently Cunningham, a judge must be able to look at the set of facts that the jury found, determine what level of punishment would be advised by, say, a guidelines system, and not be bound to impose that level of punishment if the judge feels that a different level of punishment is appropriate. If that is a correct understanding of what this Court has held, it necessarily implies that a judge does have a certain amount of freedom in an advisory guidelines system to disagree with what the Sentencing Commission has found, give the judge's reasons, and then is subject to appellate review for the reasonableness of that explanation and, the Government submits, subject to a proportionality principle, so that the sentence that's imposed outside the guidelines is a reasonable one and not an arbitrary one. Now, if I'm wrong about that and it is not necessary for the court to have the legal freedom to be able to disagree with what the Sentencing Commission said, that would be very good from the Government's perspective. But as I understand the complementary rules that are established by Booker, what an advisory guidelines system requires is that the guidelines be treated as advice rather than mandate. So while the guidelines have determined that military service is not ordinarily relevant to the level of punishment, a judge may determine in a particular case that he disagrees.",
  "I think the court of appeals should correct the judge on a mistaken apprehension of law, which is that the judge - -",
  "In the circumstance, Justice Stevens, I think that you put your finger on two different types of review. In the circumstance in which a district judge operates with what I'll call legal blinders on that prevent him from complying with - -",
  "I'm hoping that it's a misunderstanding of what the court of appeals has said, because the court of appeals should not have told the judge you're obligated to impose a guideline sentence.",
  "Judges are still obligated to comply with 3553(a), which requires them to exercise discretion. Now if a judge decides I might as a personal matter if I were writing the guidelines write them differently, and I might give great weight to military service, but one of the things that I'm required to do under section 3553(a) is to consider the need to avoid unwarranted disparity between defendants who have been convicted of similar criminal conduct and have similar records. And therefore, I am going to moderate my own personal preference and not impose a significant outside the range sentence, in order to ensure that I fully have taken into account the fact that we are in a Federal system with 674 Federal district judges, and we cannot have all our own personal guidelines systems. Now if a judge does that, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think that judge has actually complied with - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I think there's a difference between a sentence that varies from what other judges would do and a sentence that is unreasonable. If the sentence that is different from what other judges would do is not supported by a cogent and coherent explanation, and it is unduly productive of disparity because, say, it takes a guidelines range like this one, of 33 months to 41 months, and the judge says in my view military service means that this defendant gets probation. Or to take an example that's on the other side, suppose that the judge says this defendant actually didn't get any extra credit in his criminal history for his prior crime, but he has been convicted before of lying to the Government about his gun charges. I'm now going to take him up to the statutory maximum or near it and give him eight years. I think in those circumstances a court of appeals can and should say, hold on, this is a view that the district judge is entitled to take on the merits. He's entitled to give greater weight to that factor, whether it's aggravating or mitigating, than what the guidelines did, but not to this extent, or we're going to be left with a system in which disuniformity is the main principle.",
  "That to me sounds identical to the system that pre-existed Booker's holding.",
  "This Court hasn't specifically addressed - -",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I would like to be able to answer the question yes and say that courts of appeals can establish their own sub-legal rules as - -",
  "Justice Breyer, if do you that, what you have is each court of appeals functioning as a sentencing commission.",
  "Exactly.",
  "I assume too under the rationale - -",
  "I understand this dialogue. And what we have - - I too have been with the dissenters in these cases, and what I'm trying to argue for here is a set of principles that appellate courts can apply and that district courts can look to when sentencing, that will come as close as is reasonably possible to achieving Congress's aims in the Sentencing Reform Act without crossing over the bright line rule that this Court has announced - -",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not arguing for any proposition that I think would raise concern. I do think that a general tenet of abuse of discretion review is that the court of appeals can affirm a result that it would not necessarily have reached itself.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I don't think there was anything problematic with what this district judge did. As Your Honor noted, this was a sentence that was imposed after a lengthy sentencing hearing in which the court engaged in a dialogue with defense counsel about the three bases and the exclusive bases on which defense counsel asked for a downward departure. The judge at least four times in this transcript brought up Section 3553, recognizing that the judge was well aware of his obligation to imply the purposes of sentencing and the factors that were presented to him. Now he did that and he made comments along the way that indicate why he did not find physical condition, military service, or asserted vulnerability in prison to be reasons that would justify giving this defendant a lower sentence. And in his ultimate explanation, though it is brief, he pointed to two of the Section 3553 factors explicitly. He pointed to the seriousness of the offense and he pointed to the need for public protection. Now if you look at the legal obligations that the judge had under Section 3553(c) to explain himself, the statute actually sets up a hierarchy of three different levels of explanation. First, in any case the judge is to state the reasons for the sentence. Second, if the sentencing range is greater than 24 months, the judge is supposed to explain the particular reason for giving a sentence at one end or another end of the range. And finally, if the sentence is outside the range, the judge is to give the specific reason for a sentence outside the range. That statutory framework makes it entirely plausible to say that if a judge imposes a guideline sentence and explains, I see no reason not to impose a guideline sentence, he has met his burden of explanation without having to respond literally and in sequence to each argument that the defendant has made.",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, our position is more complicated than that, because within a guidelines range if a sentence is imposed, the Government - -",
  "Because sentences that are outside the guidelines range are more likely to be the cause of or a source of unwarranted disparity than a sentence within the range. And that is why that if the court of appeals is interested in fulfilling what Booker said the role of the court of appeals is, which is to iron out sentencing differences, there is more reason for the - -",
  "Well, there isn't any one correct sentence usually.",
  "Because there are more legal elements that go into sentencing and sentencing review than just those that you've named, Justice Stevens. Section 3553(a) itself, which is the guidepost for review, mandates that the district court consider the guidelines, consider the policy - -",
  "What happens when a sentence is imposed outside the range is that there is a greater risk of infringing the main purpose of the Sentencing Reform Act, which was to avoid unwarranted disparities; and in contrast to a sentence within the range which does not merely run that risk to the same degree, a sentence outside the range may well. It's different from what the sentencing commission with its expertise and its experience has recommended as the appropriate sentence, given those facts.",
  "I wouldn't put it as strongly as that, Justice Scalia. What I would say is that the further that a sentence diverges from the guidelines range, the greater the possibility of unwarranted disparity; and as a result of that, a court of appeals should look more critically at the reasons that the district court gave and ensure that the constellation of reasons and facts that's presented is not so likely to be a disproportionate sentence than - -",
  "But Justice Scalia, reasonableness review connotes that the court of appeals will review the reasons that the district court gave for that disagreement.",
  "It does for an out of range sentence, Justice Souter. I think that for a sentence within the range, the judge's statement that I have considered the guidelines range and I think it's appropriate does explain why that judge has given the sentence that he's given. It's consistent with the statute and it's consistent with the Constitution. Now when - -",
  "There is a distinction between them but I think they are complementary rules and in the next case the Government will argue for a presumption that is precisely what you have articulated, Justice Souter. A greater and more extensive and more persuasive explanation is needed the further that you go from the guidelines range.",
  "It wouldn't be identical but I agree with you, Mr. Chief Justice, that a sentence within the guidelines can be unreasonable if there is a compelling case for a sentence outside the range because the guidelines simply don't fit in that circumstance. The sentencing commission itself recognized that the guidelines were generalizations; they carved out a heartland in the language of the sentencing commission's first set of guidelines, and that there will be circumstances that would justify different sentences.",
  "Yes, Justice Scalia. It is quite - -",
  "It is different precisely on the area that, that you yourself articulated. The judge can disagree with the sentencing guidelines and determine that on the basis of the facts that the jury found, the judge would impose a different sentence, and that conclusion is then subject for reasonableness review and we submit based on a proportionality principle.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please - -",
  "Justice Stevens, this is a record in which the trial judge showed that he was meticulously careful in applying the standard from Wainwright versus Witt. In the joint appendix, I believe at pages 7 through 9, there's an extensive discussion of how the judge is going to apply the Witt standard evenhandedly. He's going to eliminate those jurors who are like-biased. He's going to eliminate those jurors who - -",
  "I don't think so, Justice Stevens, because it's very clear that he told the parties, if you have any question, if you have any problem with any of the objections that are made, speak up and I will intervene and question the juror myself and clarify it. And this is a judge who, against the background of the entire voir dire, clearly was making a good faith effort to apply the Witt standard. There were 12 objections by the prosecution to various jurors that they should be excused for cause because of inability to apply the law as Washington gives it. The defense objected, I believe, to seven of those; and the prosecution lost on five of those occasions. So the judge basically went with the defense when the defense spoke up and objected. There were two jurors that were excused over the defense objection. The transcript is also in the voir dire on those and it shows that the defense objected and said these jurors can apply the standard under the law, and the judge found that they could not and excused them. In the case of Juror Deal there is no absolutely reason to believe that the judge wouldn't have done exactly the same thing if the defense had objected.",
  "Said \"We have no objection.\" And I think that this is one of the three significant legal errors that the Ninth Circuit made in disposing of this challenge. This Court made clear in Wainwright versus Witt that the absence of a defense objection is very critical in assessing whether a judge's implied finding of bias is to be upheld on appeal. And it's for the reason that my colleague mentioned in part: If the judge is not asked to give a fuller explanation, there is no reason - -",
  "Justice Breyer, I think your question goes to the heart of the case.",
  "But the reason it goes to the heart of the case, Justice Breyer, is that you and I and every other appellate lawyer and judge who have looked at this is dealing with a cold record, but the only person who actually saw and heard this juror give the responses was the trial judge.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer - -",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, there were five separate occasions during Juror Deal's voir dire in which he expressed either uncertainty or a misconception about what the death penalty should be exposed for when measured against Washington law. And the overarching point that I make before I talk about those five instances is that this is a record in which there is confusion and uncertainty about whether Juror Deal really can adhere to the law. And in those circumstances, the only judge who can truly resolve that and determine whether he should be credited is the trial judge. And this Court has made that point over and over again in describing its voir dire.",
  "Confusion alone is not. If it's confusion it must rise to a level of preventing or impairing the juror's ability to follow the law.",
  "I think that that's right, Justice Ginsburg. It doesn't mean that there is no judicial review at all, in response to Justice Souter's question and I think the concern underlying your own. There has to be fair support in the record for the conclusion that the trial judge could have resolved the question of a juror's competence to sit in the way that he did. And if you had a record in which everything that juror said was consistent with complying with State law, which I don't think this record is, and the prosecutor objected, and the judge says granted, and there's no explanation, I think that would be difficult to uphold, even if it is possible that everyone in the courtroom knew that the judge was relying on demeanor.",
  "What is -- no. There's nothing explicit. But this Court has said over and over again that there does not have to be because in this case, in particular, since there was no objection, the judge did not elaborate on his reasons at all. But the Court has gone further in Witt and in Darden and building on cases like Patton versus Yount, and made clear that it is implicit in a judge's action in response to an objection that he has relied on the totality of the law and his observations. And here there were two instances during the defense colloquy in which the juror specifically said that his example of when the death penalty is appropriate is a circumstance when somebody is incorrigible and will reoffend if released. And then three times during the prosecution's voir dire, he volunteered, first of all, that it would have to be in my mind very obvious that the person would reoffend. And this was a particularly significant answer because it wasn't given in response to a death penalty question, it was given in response to whether he could apply the reasonable doubt standard to the crime. He again comes back to the reoffend notion after having State law explained to him again, and said, could you consider imposing the death penalty, he said I have to give that some thought.",
  "No, but I think the important point, Justice Souter, is that under Washington law there were really two alternatives, life without parole or death.",
  "The concern that I think the prosecutor had and that the judge accepted is that this juror's vision of when capital punishment is appropriate is when somebody will get out and kill again. And under that analysis, you would never impose capital punishment under Washington law, because the defendant is never going to get - -",
  "Not -- not automatically, Justice Stevens. I mean, this is an juror - -",
  "No. What has to be the case, and this Court in Witt made clear it is not going to apply an unmistakable certainty requirement, is that the judge has to conclude that juror's views would prevent or substantially impair juror in applying the law. And the judge had to make a call based on what he saw and what none of us did, of whether this juror's views - -",
  "Yeah.",
  "Yes, they there are. And - -",
  "Well the judge found one. By excusing him after having - -",
  "Well he made clear, if I may conclude, he made clear at the outset as I think I did when I started my presentation, that this record shows a judge who was conscientiously applying the Witt standard.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court: The question in this case is essentially, can a district court reasonably disagree with the judgment of Congress concerning the ratio between the quantity-based sentences for crack and powder.",
  "Justice Stevens, let me start with the Neal decision, because I think Neal is fundamentally unlike this case. In Neal this Court had to determine whether its prior construction of a statute, Section 841, survived the Commission's decision - -",
  "Justice Stevens, the only question presented in Neal was, did the Commission's weight guideline for LSD require this Court to change its interpretation of Section 841. And the Court held no. There was no question before the Court about whether the Sentencing Commission had legitimately adopted a different formula than the mixture or substance rule that this Court had held governed the statute. The LSD guideline was not in play in Neal. The government never challenged it. Its rationality was not at issue. All the Court had to hold was that whatever the Sentencing Commission did - -",
  "Well, I disagree with that, Justice Stevens, because no one challenged the guideline in Neal. There was nothing at issue in the Court to decide about whether that Guideline was valid. But even if the Court thought that Neal does involve some sort of a principle that the Sentencing Commission has greater freedom to vary from the procedures laid out in a mandatory minimum sentencing statute, Neal does not control this case, because there is more data about what Congress intended the ratio between crack and powder to be, and because Congress changed the basic, organic statute that governs the Sentencing Commission's - -",
  "Well, the statute, itself, Section 841, establishes the ratio of a 100 to 1. When the Commission first considered creating drug guidelines - -",
  "Well I disagree with that, Justice Stevens, and I'm trying to explain why the legal context is different from the legal context in Neal. Let me start with a couple of points about this. First of all, when the Commission promulgated the drug Guideline initially, it conformed it to the 100 to 1 ratio that existed under the mandatory minimum sentencing statute, because it recognized -- and these were the Commission's words -- that a logical and coherent sentencing scheme required that there be consistent proportionality throughout the sentencing process. When the Commission later studied the crack-powder ratio and concluded that Congress had gotten it wrong and, therefore, the Commission, itself, had gotten it wrong by conforming to what Congress did, it proposed a Guideline that would have changed the ratio for Guideline's purposes only to one to one between crack and powder. And Congress, for the first time in the history of its review of Guidelines amendments, rejected that proposal; and it did so with legislation that made clear that it believed that if the commission wanted to come back with something new, it should propose something that would change both the Guidelines and the sentencing statutes so that they would continue to work in tandem -- that it would preserve a higher ratio of punishment for crack than powder because it believed that crack was more serious, and that it believed that any ratio should apply consistently across the Guidelines and the statute.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Correct.",
  "This, Mr. Chief Justice, is what Congress instructed the Commission to consider in making recommendations to change the existing state of the law. We don't dispute - -",
  "But they have never changed the 100 to 1 ratio. And what I think is significant about this statute is what it continues to say, and this is on page 124-A of the government's brief -- that \"the recommendations concerning an appropriate change to the ratio that the Commission might believe is warranted shall apply both to the relevant statutes and to the Guidelines.\" This is on the carryover sentence on pages 24-A to 25-A. And what I think that this reflects is Congress' recognition that, so long as the mandatory minimum statutes are pegged at 100 to 1, the Guidelines need to follow suit. Now if they're going to change, that's fine. But they should change in a manner that's consistent so as to avoid unwarranted disparities between defendants who are governed by the literal mandatory minimum statute and defendants who are not. The alternative is you end up with various serious cliff effects which the Commission itself was trying to avoid, where a defendant who has 50 grams of crack is sentenced to a minimum of 10 years. But if you drop the ratio to one to one, a defendant who has 49.9 grams - -",
  "But this Court didn't consider whether those cliff effects were legally valid in Neal because it had no guideline before it. And I did went to get to the other point that I think distinguishes the legal context in Neal from the legal context today, and that is, in 2003, Congress amended the organic statute that governs the Sentencing Commission's promulgation of Guidelines to require that the commission make AUDIO STARTS its Guidelines consistent with all pertinent provisions of the United States Code. At the time of Neal, that statute only required the commission to be consistent with Title 18 and Title 28, and the drug statute is found in Title 21. And the legislative evolution of this provision reflects that there was concern that the commission did not have to honor - -",
  "It did not, and the government --",
  "I think it should have, and I think that the commission's decoupling of its guidelines from the mandatory minimums that Congress has provided produces an irrational disconnect between guideline sentencing and sentencing - -",
  "Justice Breyer, as a general matter, the government accepts that a sentencing judge can revisit, challenge the Sentencing Commission's policy determinations as an intrinsic feature of an advisory guideline system. It's not because we welcome that result, but because we think that it followed from this Court's decision in Cunningham and that was expressly stated in Rita. But this is not an area where the sentencing courts would be merely second-guessing a commission judgment. They would be second-guessing a judgment of Congress itself.",
  "But, Justice Breyer, the one time when the commission tried to do that - -",
  "They wanted to make it one to one, and Congress recognized that that would produce severe cliffs and said not appropriate; if you want to change the sentencing statutes and guidelines in tandem, that's fine, make a recommendation. And so the government's fundamental position here is that Congress has made a judgment that until it says otherwise, sentencing ratios of 100 to 1 are appropriate to reflect the increased harms of crack.",
  "Yes, it - -",
  "The two of them work together in tandem, I think.",
  "Well, I think I want to rely on what the Sentencing Commission itself did before it concluded that it disagreed with the 100 to 1 ratio in the statute. And this is set forward -- forth at page 50A of the same brief, the Kimbrough brief. This was the commission's original commentary where it explained, in the first full paragraph, how it set the basic levels for drug crimes. And it said that it set them because they were either provided directly by Section 841 of Title 21 or, quote, \"are proportional to the levels established by statute,\" and it said, further refinement of the drug amounts beyond those mandatory minimums was essential to provide a logical sentencing structure for drug offenses. And I think what the commission - -",
  "2003, I believe.",
  "It's 2003.",
  "What distinguishes this area, Justice Scalia, I believe, from other guidelines is that the backdrop for sentencing for drug crimes is a mandatory minimum statute that goes directly to the sentencing court. It's not subject to the commission's intervention and it's not subject to a district court's power to disagree with. The sentencing court must use a 100 to 1 ratio in applying the mandatory minimums.",
  "Well, I'm happy to do just - -",
  "Well, if -- if it's sufficient for the Court that Section 841 itself establishes the 100 to 1 ratio and that's something that's off-limits for the district courts to disagree with, I'm content. I think there is additional data that indicates that Congress vetoed attempts by the Sentencing Commission to vary from that range and made it clear that the Guidelines formulations and the statute worked in tandem, which together expresses a notion of quantity proportionality tied to the 100 to 1 ratio.",
  "And I agree with that, Justice Scalia. And the upshot of disagreeing with that, which is what various district courts have done but no court of appeals has endorsed, is that every district court could come up with its own ratio and that that ratio would have to be accepted as reasonable so long as there is a cogent, logical data support for it. And here - -",
  "There's a floor in the mandatory minimum, but I think that there are quite a few sentences that are above the mandatory minimum and there are sentences that are below the mandatory minimum. And in those cases - -",
  "I didn't get that out of my attempt to plumb the data, Justice Stevens. The Sentencing Commission's most recent report has a chart that didn't, to my mind, break down adequately the figures so I could answer your question. But I do think that, even if it's true, even if 80 percent were at the mandatory minimum, that would mean that as to those 20 percent that are not governed by a mandatory minimum, you could have one district judge say, I'm going to use one to one, like the commission proposed in 1995. Another could say I'm going to use five to one, like the commission proposed in 1997. A third could use 20 to 1, as the commission proposed in 2002. And each one of those would have a reasonable - -",
  "I don't think so, because I think here we're talking about a matter of statutory construction. Because the courts of appeals are reviewing sentences for reasonableness.",
  "That wasn't the two statutes I was thinking of. What I was thinking of is that Congress itself has said a 100 to 1 disparity - -",
  "Our position here, I think, is consistent with our view that you read statutes both for what they say and for what they mean. And here we are not relying just on Section 841, although I'm certainly happy if members of the Court believe that 841 alone dictates a proportionality rule, I'm also relying on the fact that Congress vetoed the Commission's attempt to break apart the Guidelines in the sentencing - -",
  "At least the Court should do this much, that when a court of appeals is reviewing for reasonableness a sentence imposed by a district judge, the court of appeals should refract the Section 3553(a) factors through Congress' existing judgment that a 100 to 1 ratio is warranted.",
  "It doesn't. But, Justice Breyer, that's, for two different reasons, not an apt analogy for this. First of all, Congress applied the 100 to 1 ratio at two different points in the sentencing spectrum. Then if there was a rational basis for viewing shotgun culpability as turning on the length of the barrel, then perhaps there would be a better analogy. But I think here what Congress was focused on was the relative culpability of crack offenders and powder offenders.",
  "No, but I think that Congress doesn't view the Guidelines quantity determinations as being independent from its mandatory minimum determinations. And that's why it vetoed the Commission's unilateral attempt to impose a one to one ratio - -",
  "They do come down to the same thing, Justice Ginsburg, in the sense that the guideline as it exists today incorporates the 100 to 1 ratio. And I believe that Congress well understood that it was preserving a guideline that maintains fidelity and consistency with its sentencing statute while sending the Commission back to the drawing board and saying if we're going to change this scheme, let's change it in a consistent coherent way. And every district court does not get the power to say we're going to change what Congress has prohibited the Commission from changing, even though we can't change the mandatory minimum statute. That is Congress' sentencing policy. We have to impose that in cases at the mandatory minimum. But in cases that aren't at the mandatory minimum, the position of the petitioner is basically district judges can say to Congress, you're completely wrong. And our position is that under a sympathetic attempt to construct reasonableness review that is consistent with Congressional intent, a district court can't do that.",
  "Because they had no reason to do it. Until this Court decided Booker, the Guidelines were mandatory. And they fully understood by leaving in place a crack guideline that mirrored the statutory - -",
  "I'm not aware that they have legislated in this area after Booker, Mr. Chief Justice. And I think that since all the court of appeals have agreed with the single position that district courts are not free to substitute their own ratios for the 100 to 1 ratio, Congress would not have had a great deal of reason to intervene in this area. And what this case will tell Congress and sentencing courts is within an advisory guidelines regime, can Congress make certain policy judgments and place certain limits on what a district court can do that it otherwise would have freedom to do in an advisory range.",
  "The only requirement, I believe, that exists under Booker is that judge not in all cases be required to find a fact in order to exceed the guidelines range that would be based on the jury verdict alone or the admission of guilt alone. Booker did not say that Congress had to tolerate every single policy judgment that individual district courts might make to vary upward. For example, socioeconomic status. If a particular judge felt in my courtroom college students and white collar professionals deserve an automatic bump up in their sentences above what I would give anyone else because they betrayed the advantages that they have, I think Congress could come along and say that's not right. We don't want socioeconomic status to be a variable that affects how long someone goes to prison.",
  "It is done in a logically proportional manner - -",
  "The Sentencing Commission at least started where Congress did.",
  "I don't think they do have to follow it through exactly the way the Sentencing Commission did it, because they don't -- sentencing courts today which are sentencing under advisory guidelines need not use exactly the same base offense levels when they come down to final sentences after they've considered what the Commission has done. But what they cannot do, I submit -- and it is more of a negative -- they cannot say fundamentally the Commission has pointed this out and Congress has enacted, but the crack and powder guidelines are way out of whack. I think that they're wrong. I think Congress was wrong. And I'm going to do everything I can to try to eliminate that degree of disparity. And I may not be able to do everything I want to. This judge here was limited by the 120 months that was the mandatory minimum. But essentially, he, as I read the sentencing transcript, thought it was crazy for Congress to treat crack and powder differently. For a judge to say Congress is crazy, I think, is a sort of textbook example of an unreasonable sentencing factor. The ultimate sentence will turn on how the judge applies all of the facts of the case to the particular - -",
  "True. But this is an area where I don't think Congress chose to rely on the administrative expertise of the commission. It made its own policy judgment on crack.",
  "Well, the drug guideline was based on - -",
  "No. But entire drug - -",
  "They are based on the fact that Congress made a supervening policy judgment. And in our system, the policy judgments ultimately pertaining to sentencing belong to Congress.",
  "Well, there are some other guidelines where Congress has directly intervened, but my fundamental point here is that so long as Congress has made a determination that it has not changed, that it wants 100 to 1 as a mandatory minimum set point, district courts should not be free to say I think Congress got it wrong, I'm going to sentence on a different paradigm. The Commission didn't think that was appropriate when it promulgated the original drug guideline, which is why that guideline is not based on the same sorts of empirical data that other guidelines might be deemed to be responsive to. But that only reflected that the Commission in its original guideline respected that its role was to carry out congressional policy, not to disagree with or supplant congressional policy, and so long as the Commission was operating in that vein -- which I think was correct -- it follows a fortiori that sentencing courts should do the same thing.",
  "Well, I would put it differently, Justice Kennedy. I would say that Congress has made a legislative judgment that for crack purposes, this ratio is what is needed to have a sufficient sentence, and the Congress that decided that might be wrong. And if the present-day Congress decides to change that, a new policy will be established, but I think that reading the two statutes together, Section 3553(a) and Section 841, produces the conclusion that this is a legislative judgment of reasonableness; and even if every judge in the Federal system holds a different personal view, that doesn't mean that the statute has validated their position over the one that Congress expressed in Title 21, in a manner that binds sentencing courts irrespective of how the Commission sorts out its policy judgments.",
  "Well, I don't think that the Court can interpret Congress in Section 3553(a) to make unreasonable what Congress did in Section 841. I think reading all of the statutes together would produce the conclusion that Congress deemed that this was the way to achieve the purposes of sentencing. Crack is more corrosive in the inner cities. It has different kinds of problems than powder. They should be addressed in this more severe sentencing manner, and if that's a policy judgment that warrants being revisited, the appropriate body to do it is Congress, not each individual sentencing judge, formulating his or her own ratio, subject to blanket affirmance by the court of appeals. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Appellate courts confronted with the task of conducting reasonableness review need some benchmarks for how to distinguish between sentences that are outside the Guidelines and reasonable and sentences that are outside the Guidelines and are not. The question presented here is whether an appellate court can reasonably decide that it should take a harder look at a case that is significantly or extraordinarily outside the Guidelines and look to see whether that sentence is supported by - -",
  "Justice Stevens, we don't have a fixed percentage. We don't endorse that kind of analysis. I think that the appropriate way to look at it is to see all different factors converging in order to determine whether it warrants this harder look. It could be a different type of sentence. Here you have a probation sentence as opposed to a prison sentence when the Guidelines call for up to three years of imprisonment. It could be couched in the number of levels that the judge has - -",
  "I don't. But I would say - -",
  "The courts of appeals have generally relied on a \"I know it when I see it\" kind of approach, which I think is reasonable in this area of the law, because you see sentences that are simply out of kilter with what the Guidelines range is, and it raises a question in the court's mind, why? If you saw a judge who said the Guidelines range here is 30 to 37 months for petitioner and I'm going to sentence him to 24 months and the judge gives the same reasons as he gave here, no court of appeals is going to think this requires a particularly hard look or any greater justification than what the judge did. The court will understand that that's what abuse of discretion review means in an advisory system.",
  "He is, Justice Scalia.",
  "Because, Justice Scalia, I start with a fundamentally different concept of reasonableness review than merely is it possible to articulate a reasoned basis for sentencing the defendant that way. I start with the proposition that this Court adopted reasonableness review in Booker as a means of helping to achieve Congress's objective of increased uniformity without attempting to attain the degree of uniformity that had prevailed under the mandatory - -",
  "I think there's a difference, Justice Scalia, from saying that the Guidelines are advisory and therefore a court can give a different sentence than what the Guidelines call for, and saying that basically advisory guidelines means the judge can do whatever policy judgment the judge wants, without regard to what degree of variance you achieve. From - -",
  "No, you can disagree fundamentally, and I think at one level every variance is a disagreement with the sentence that the Guidelines would produce.",
  "It fits in with my prior statement because what'S at issue in a case like this is not whether the judge can disagree with the judgment of the Guidelines and say youth matters, but whether the judge can do so to such an extent that the result is unwarranted disparity beyond what needs to be tolerated in order to achieve a system that complies with the Sixth Amendment.",
  "I'm saying that - -",
  "There has to be a substantive fairness component, Justice Souter, and I think that there has to be a substantive excessiveness component. In other words - -",
  "I actually view it as the broader category but I think the two of them work together.",
  "This is the fundamental difference that I think exists between what Petitioner is offering and what the government is offering. We all agree that irrational sentences and procedurally defective sentences are to be set aside on reasonableness review. But where we disagree, I think, is whether a judge on a court of appeals panel can look at the results reached by the district judge and conclude, this is an excessive sentence on the facts of this case. We think that the judge can do that on a court of appeals and that in order to determine whether a sentence is excessive, a starting point is to compare what the judge did to what the Guidelines range does.",
  "Unless, Justice Scalia, the judge offers sufficiently cogent, persuasive reasons so that the court of appeals concludes that this is indeed a reasonable sentence, given the reasons that the judge has articulated as a matter of policy and the facts before him.",
  "He -- he did say that Justice Scalia. But appellate review is conducted through the lens of 3553(a) and 3553(a) directs the judge to consider a variety of things in addition to the history and characteristics of the defendant, which is where youth comes in. It also directs the court to consider the severity of the offense and the need for just punishment. It directs the court to consider deterrence considerations, and it directs the court to consider the need to avoid unwarranted disparities between similarly situated defendants, and that's where this court fell down. It's not that what the court said was wholly unreasonable, although in one respect, I think, with the emphasis on withdrawal for the reasons that Justice Ginsburg mentioned, the judge did overstate the point. But the judge lost sight of the fact that this is a defendant who over a 7-month period engaged in a sustained drug conspiracy at age 21, not as an adolescent, and made 30 to $40,000 for that. And the result is that this judge concluded that defendant - -",
  "Yes. I think that there are cases throughout the Federal system that have resulted in probation for defendants who committed similar crimes to this, maybe not as severe as this defendant. I'm not sure - -",
  "Well, the ones that, I think, have been the most appealing for probation sentences are cases in which the defendant's culpability is very low. The defendant played a minor role in the offense, perhaps assisting a boyfriend or a friend - -",
  "The only cases that I can think of -- and I was trying to get to this point, Justice Stevens -- are ones in which courts conclude there are compelling family circumstances where individuals will be very badly hurt in the defendant's family if no one is available to take care of them, and the defendant has really devoted his activities to doing that, and there's no replacement; and the costs to society would be too high in those circumstances, courts have concluded, to justify a sentence of imprisonment. I'm not saying that Petitioner is the most culpable defendant that could be sentenced under this statute. This is a statute that carries a range - -",
  "Let me try to draw one distinction and make a point about proportionality that I think is not encompassed within what you said. There is a distinction between a judge forming a view based on the defendant's character and behavior in front of the court and the history as revealed in the presentence report where the judge has an institutional advantage over an appellate court for obvious reasons. And this was recognized in Koon versus United States. It hasn't changed today. On the other hand, a district court has a disadvantage, really, in formulating broad policy as compared to the Sentencing Commission. Because the Sentencing Commission has the ability to absorb vast amounts of data and to consider the views of all segments of the criminal justice community and to respond to Congress. And it is really the component of the sentencing process where you would expect broad policy to be, as an initial matter, best formulated. Now - -",
  "As I said to Justice Scalia, they're not mandatory, and the judge does have the freedom to challenge the judgment that the Sentencing Commission has drawn. But on appellate review, the normal factors that go into which institutional actor is best situated to decide a question tilts in favor of a more rigorous form of review for pure policy disagreements for not only the reason that the Sentencing Commission is better, but for the reason that if you license all district courts to come up with their own broad, abstract policies, you end up with 474 sentencing commissions who are operating - -",
  "I hope not, Justice Breyer. And I hope to - -",
  "As I said, the Section 3553(a) process is a holistic one. There are seven different factors listed in Section 3553(a); and the commission, when it formulated the Guidelines, looked at the same sorts of factors and attempted to balance them. This judge here did not devote particularly significant consideration at all to the fact that Petitioner sold 10,000 ecstasy pills, which have the potential for causing significant harm. And he earned a great deal of money out of it. He didn't give the money back. He may have invested it in the house that he bought.",
  "Reasonableness requires more of a balance of the policies and a consideration of the overall goal of the system of achieving uniformity. And I think perhaps the best way to illustrate the point is through a hypothetical similar to the one that Justice Kennedy posed. Suppose that a district judge, confronting Petitioner, said: You were a college student. You had every advantage in life. You were 21; you weren't a kid. You made $40,000 over seven months. And when it suited you, you pulled out, and you did nothing to disrupt the conspiracy. Now, I have a statutory range here of zero to 20. And, although the guidelines call only for 30 to 37 months, I think you should go to jail for 15 years. I don't see Petitioner as really offering a court of appeals or the criminal-justice system as a whole a way for someone to step in and say that's excessive. It doesn't leave room to make reasoned distinctions among the kinds of defendants who violate this statute, and it doesn't provide any check on aberrant or outlier outcomes.",
  "Justice Scalia, the competing rule of mere rationality or the judge did something that's reasonable is pretty much a one-way ticket to disparity. Because it means that every district judge would get the opportunity to say: I've seen the guidelines, but I don't agree; and, as a result, I'm giving the 15-year sentence to Mr. Gall versus all the way down to probation, and the courts of appeals would have to affirm both. Now, I am trying - -",
  "Well, the question I think here is how advisory do they have to be in order to comply with this Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence and the remedial opinion in Booker, as I understand it, answered that question by saying they're not mandatory, but the features of the appellate review and continued existence of the sentencing commission are going to work significantly to achieving Congress's objectives of increased uniformity. And the nine courts of appeals that have adopted proportionality review, even if they may have used slightly different words to express it, are -- I think, responding to a fundamental intuition, which is how do I know if the sentence in front of me is likely to be significantly outside the norm. And second, if it is, should I not look for more to sustain it than a sentence that's co-extensive with the guidelines sentence. I think this case is really the counterpart case to the Rita case that the Court decided last term when that judgment of the sentencing court and the district judge -- the sentencing commission and the district judge coincide, courts of appeals can assume it's likely, although not definitely true -- but likely that the sentence is a reasonable one. But when the sentence is significantly outside what the guidelines would call for on an average case of that type - -",
  "I am not able to give the Court a rigid definition of it.",
  "I don't treat what I'm arguing for as a presumption, but if the Court wants to conclude that it does function like a presumption, I would still submit it is a perfectly valid presumption under these circumstances. It is not that the court of appeals - -",
  "Correct.",
  "They do.",
  "Well, the presumption of unreasonableness goes a little bit farther than that, Mr. Chief Justice, because it allows the court of appeals to take notice that this is a sentence that if upheld holds the potential for unwarranted disparity. And it may be that the sentence doesn't pose that risk at all. But the reasons that the judge gave to justify that sentence should be somewhat commensurate or proportionate to the degree of the variance, otherwise you're basically back to a system where so long as the judge can go through the facts of the case and give a rational explanation of why a sentence should be at that level, there's nothing for the appellate court to do but to affirm.",
  "What you'd be doing I think, Justice Breyer, is sweeping aside the approach that nine circuits have taken.",
  "Which have usefully facilitated their appellate review. They didn't select the standard because they drew it out of an opinion from this Court. They selected the standard because they considered it essentially a rule of reason. The rule being that under an advisory guideline system, we must accept that there will be considerably less uniformity than under a mandatory system. That's appropriate. But we don't have to accept the proposition that materially outlier sentences that are not supported by an adequate explanation should stand. And if the courts of appeals are told, you go back to the drawing board now, you can't use any kind of proportionality test, I think unless the Court gives them something that will allow them to distinguish between a materially out of guideline sentence that is reasonable and one that is not, the ultimate result will be every district judge knowing that in their courtroom, they can decide whatever they like about the fundamental policies of sentences, and it will stand. The reason why the sentencing guidelines system was originally adopted was to eliminate each district judge operating purely on that judge's philosophy.",
  "No. I think that what the district judges need to understand is that they're not bound by the guidelines, but the guidelines remain something that is a reference point, that if deviations or variances are warranted, they should be explained, and they should be explained in a way that's consistent with the degree of the variance. Because the alternative of wholesale abdication to the district judge to assess the individual facts of the case means that one district judge can conclude that a defendant like Mr. Gall warrants probation, and another one can conclude that he warrants 10 or 15 years, and there'll be no remedy on appeal because it will all be very case-specific. It won't be policy driven disagreements. Most of what goes on in Federal sentencing is not fundamentally a deep-rooted policy disagreement of the nature of the kind that Justice Scalia and I were discussing, about whether white collar defendants should go to jail at all. Most of it is about how do the particular features of this individual defendant match up with the policy considerations - -",
  "It is more of a wholistic and judgmental process than a mathematical one, Justice Stevens. And I am reluctant to offer percentages because I don't want to be mistaken for saying there is some litmus test with superguidelines, ranges -- but I can say that courts of appeals that find a variance to warrant a substantial or extraordinary justification are typically looking at 40 to 50 to 60 percent away from the guidelines range, not sentences that - -",
  "It calls for one that makes sense given the degree of the various - -",
  "Linguistically, the words used are, you need a compelling reason for an extraordinary departure -- an extraordinary reason for an extraordinary departure or variance. So in that sense, I agree with you. But the court of appeals have not attempted to create a mathematical grid, because such an exercise would be both contrary to the notion of advisory guidelines, and also one that is inherently arbitrary. And that's why I said that it is unfortunately more in the nature of, I know it when I see it, but I don't think that this is as bad as the predicament the Court found itself in in obscenity cases, because it really isn't that hard to tell the difference between a variance that is a few months outside the range or even a variance in the facts of this Gall case, say down to 15 months, and a sentence that just wipes out all prison time altogether. I don't think the Court should have any difficulty saying that if a judge is just going to wipe out all prison time - -",
  "Well, in this case, because the government believes that the guidelines provide a reference point for proportionality review, a sentence - -",
  "Stronger, I would say, because if the guidelines - -",
  "Excuse me.",
  "Yes, I think that -- that's why I don't think you can confine it to percentage. I think if the guidelines are calling for a very substantial period of imprisonment, and a judge says, I just don't think the culpability of white collar offenders ever warrants sending them to jail, I think the better approach is you have them go out and make speeches to fellow potential defendants about how terrible their experience was, that is something that's going to produce a very widespread potential for disparity.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, Justice Scalia. I don't think that courts of appeals conducting reasonableness review should in effect construct their own guidelines system. They should respond to the reasons and the facts that are before them.",
  "Well, I -- I think you're not accomplishing that kind of a common law system in reasonableness review for many of the reasons that the Court has already identified in describing why an abuse-of-discretion approach is warranted. The court of appeals will not be saying that this is the maximum sentence you could give on these facts. It would say these -- this is an unreasonable or a reasonable sentence based on the policy considerations that the judge articulated and the facts that he relied on.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I think that the fundamental question of whether there is substantive reasonableness review for excessiveness was settled in the Rita an opinion in which -- Rita recognized that Booker contemplated - -",
  "Well, my response -- and if I could answer Mr. Chief Justice -- is that the fundamental point of this Court's Apprendi line of cases is that, so long as the statutory maximum is legally available to the judge, the judge can find facts within that range that justify the sentence, and that's all the Booker remedial opinion authorizes judges to do. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The States and the Federal Government may for a variety of reasons enact restrictions on officer authority that exceed the requirements of the Fourth Amendment as this Court has articulated them. When such State law or Federal law extra-constitutional restrictions are violated, it is a matter for the government that enacted them to determine what remedy appropriately flows from that violation.",
  "This Court has never - -",
  "Well, certainly, Justice Scalia, such an individual wouldn't have positive law authority to engage in an arrest.",
  "The question would then be whether that means that it's automatically a constitutional violation. I think in some situations even a governmental official can act in a private capacity by acting outside the boundaries of that individual's responsibility.",
  "And if you assume that the Court would have two options. It could either federalize some sort of an amorphous requirement that there must be law enforcement authority in an official in order for that official to engage in Fourth Amendment activity, or it could hold that, what I think is the more reasonable approach, which is that the bedrock requirements of the Fourth Amendment protect against arbitrariness, and the crucial one here is the existence of probable cause based on the facts to believe that the individual has violated a law. If that criteria is met, it is not constitutionally unreasonable, absent where an extraordinary intrusion for the individual's liberty or privacy interests to be compromised. It may be the most flagrant violation of departmental regulations in the world, and in that case the department that has those regulations can take action, just as here Virginia says if you violate the arrestable offense rule under Virginia law, the consequence is not to exclude evidence. Virginia will not exclude evidence under its own State law for a violation of this provision. But it does say under State law that a person can resist an unlawful arrest, The officer can be sued for engaging in an unlawful arrest under State law, and that the officer can be fired or disciplined. And those are the sanctions that the State has chosen to do. Now, what the Virginia Supreme Court has done is come along and say, even though you do not intend this rule to trigger the exclusionary rule under Virginia law, you have no choice. As a matter of Federal constitutional law, if Virginia decides to exceed the constitutional minimum as this Court announced in Atwater and place additional restrictions on the arrest authority, it must pay a constitutional price of having the evidence excluded if that rule is violated. At the outset, it's clear that imposing such a Fourth Amendment rule would do nothing other than discourage the States from providing additional restrictions as a matter of their own State's law that may serve to protect citizen privacy interests above the floor that this Court has identified as required by the Fourth Amendment.",
  "I don't know that it gave a false signal, Justice Ginsburg, but a GVR doesn't indicate this Court's disposition of the merits once all of the arguments are presented to it. And, admittedly, I think neither side is able to point to a case that squarely addressed and conclusively resolved the issue that's before this Court. What the Court has done, I think, under related issues under Fourth Amendment law is announce pretty clearly that the fact that a State has either renounced an interest in taking a particular law enforcement action that it could otherwise constitutionally take or positively prohibited a law enforcement action does not mean that the action is unconstitutional. As long ago as the Cooper v. California case, the Court dealt with the situation where an officer was not authorized to undertake an inventory search, and the California courts treat it as a violation of their own law. This Court said it was still a reasonable search under the Fourth Amendment; and unless Respondent -- excuse me, unless -- well, Respondent concludes that there should be a different Fourth Amendment rule for searches than procedures, Cooper stands for the proposition that a violation of State law does not ipso facto equate to a violation of the Federal Constitution.",
  "Yes, Justice Kennedy. California v. Greenwood is the next case in the line where the Court recognized that California had made it illegal to conduct garbage searches. And you could make the same argument that Respondent is making here today: That California had renounced any interest in conducting garbage searches, therefore there's nothing on the State side of the line to balance against the individual's invasion of privacy, and therefore the State should lose. And this Court held precisely the opposite in California v. Greenwood, finding that it was constitutionally reasonable to engage in the garbage search because there was no federally recognized expectation of privacy, even though the State had decided to go further and grant an additional layer of protection to its citizens.",
  "I'm venturing a little bit outside of my expertise under State law, but I think that that's correct. Because State law provided that this was not an arrestable offense unless one of the exceptions to the offense existed. And I should note that one of the offenses here -- excuse me -- one of the exceptions here is that a court of general jurisdiction could have entered an exemption from the arrestable offense rule and then officers within that jurisdiction would have been constitutionally and under State law - -",
  "I know that it has done it. I don't know that there are any restrictions on when it would do it. The point, I think, of giving the general courts the authority to do this is that these kinds of laws are not necessarily enacted, as Respondent posits, to be supplementary protection for privacy. They do not necessarily represent a judgment that law enforcement officers should never bring people in for minor traffic misdemeanors. They may represent a judgment that law enforcement officers should be out on the beat policing more important crimes and it's a waste of social resources and scarce police resources to have them bringing people downtown for these kinds of offenses. In a particular jurisdiction, law enforcement may make a case that actually it's important enough to deter various traffic violations and to ensure that the individuals show up, that officers should have plenary authority to make arrests.",
  "The McNabb-Mallory rule - -",
  "-- is uniquely Federal. The closest analog -- and this may be what Your Honor has in mind -- is that in the County of Riverside case the Court set a 48-hour outside limit for when you have to bring an arrested individual before a magistrate for a probable cause hearing. Under Respondent's position - -",
  "No, and that's precisely, I think, the point. All of the rules that this Court has announced under the Fourth Amendment, the search incident to arrest rule, which is triggered as a bright-line rule without regard to whether the specifics of the case support it, under Respondent's theory Virginia could overrule that by saying officers shall not conduct a search incident to arrest without a specific exigency in that case. States could overrule within their own jurisdictions the Federal rule that this Court announced in Riverside. It could say that individuals have to be brought before a magistrate within 12 hours or they have to be released. And under Respondent's theory that you absorb State law into the reasonableness inquiry, this Court's Federal court decision would be overruled. And most directly here, Atwater would be overruled with respect to non-arrestable offenses if Respondent's position is correct that when the State has said that we don't want to undertake an arrest for a minor offense, therefore, there's no longer any State interest in undertaking the arrest. The reality is that this Court has balanced as a matter of Fourth Amendment law what is constitutionally necessary as a uniform Federal matter to protect people against arbitrary law enforcement action, and it's drawn the line at probable cause. And as this Court said in Whren, absent rare circumstances when probable cause exists, a search or seizure is reasonable. And the kind of rare circumstances that the Court gave the example of in Whren were heightened intrusions on individual privacy or liberties such as surgery to remove evidence or an unannounced entry into a home. We don't have anything like that here and the standard Federal rule should govern.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are instances in the trial courts, particularly with respect to mentally ill defendants, where a defendant may have the degree of rational understanding to satisfy the relatively low standard of competence established in Dusky and reaffirmed thereafter, but not have the capability of carrying out the tasks that are needed to be performed in order to try a case without it degenerating into a farce. And I think, as Justice Scalia pointed out, it would be well within the power of the trial court at the time that that occurred to terminate self-representation in order to further the State's strong and important interest in fairness and the appearance of fairness. The question is whether a judge can also make that decision ex ante before the trial has begun and insist that the defendant be represented through counsel. We think the answer is that a State or the Federal Government would have a sufficient interest in terminating self- representation or in denying a motion for self-representation - -",
  "Well, Justice Scalia - -",
  "We agree with that, Justice Scalia. And our view is that the Court should not necessarily resolve this by adopting a specific test that focuses on the ability to communicate, but should, instead, look at whether the State has a sufficient interest that would be served by denying self - representation. The defendant's lack of ability to communicate can certainly serve that interest. There may be instances in which the defendant lacks the memory to be able to remember from day to day what happened in the trial; and if you were called upon to perform all the myriad tasks of trial counsel, he would break down.",
  "Well, I think - -",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I think that the tests serve different purposes. The competency threshold, as the Court has noted, is a minimal threshold. It is designed to ferret out whether the defendant has the minimal degree of rational understanding to assist his counsel and to understand what's happening. And he then, if he wants to waive counsel, has to have a knowing and intelligent waiver, which means he has to understand what he's doing. But those inquiries don't focus on whether he, in fact, could carry out the substantially more demanding task, both mentally and as far as the ability to communicate goes, of presenting a case to the jury during a trial. There are many examples of mentally ill defendants whose world views may be substantially skewed in many respects, but the competency threshold focuses on whether they can understand the case in front of them. For example, if you have a defendant who is on trial for making certain specific threats against identified people, he may have the ability to understand what the charge is and to assist counsel in whether he said those things and what he intended by them, even if his world view in many respects is extremely skewed; he has paranoid delusions; and his ability to communicate coherently on his own is very diminished. And that is why the competency threshold does not fully address the very important interest that a State has in presenting to the world that the trial is a fair one. This has both the dimension of actual fairness as well as perceived fairness because if the public sees the spectacle of a mentally ill defendant, who may well be able to cooperate with counsel and with the assistance of counsel get through a trial, attempt to communicate to the jury on his own in a very delusional way, it really casts the justice system into disrepute.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I think under existing law that could not be done if the Respondent's view of Faretta is adopted as an absolute rule.",
  "Well, I think it depends on what you mean by \"turning into a farce.\" It is well-established now that if the defendant actually obstructs the proceeding, stands up out of order, disregards the judge's procedural rulings and in - - violates the decorum of the courtroom, self-representation can be terminated. And that, I think, is an important fact that establishes that the Faretta right is not an absolute right. But here we're talking about turning it into a farce in a different way. For example, in Colin Ferguson's trial for murder in New York, he got up, and he told the jury in his opening statement: I've been charged with 93 counts because it is the year 1993. If it were the year 1928, I would have been charged with 28 counts. And that doesn't violate the decorum of the room, but it really casts doubt on what is the State doing here: Putting somebody on trial, having them represent themselves with no lawyer, when that's the mental ability that they have to understand what's going on.",
  "No, I don't think so, Justice Stevens. I think a translator could deal with a non-English-speaking defendant. I think a defendant with a speech impediment can be assisted in other ways. We actually think that the Court could approach this case by looking at the most acute phase of this problem, in our view and experience, which is a defendant who is mentally ill. Because then you have a concrete connection, particularly with serious mental illness, between the defendant's diagnosed state and the abilities and capacities that he may have when he takes the floor as his own lawyer.",
  "Yes, you certainly could, Justice Kennedy. And I think that that would be an important step in the right direction. I think in cases where the judge has, as he did in this case, a very firm foundation for understanding that this defendant could not present a coherent defense to the jury and, if allowed to represent himself, would create a potential shambles - - not that the trial couldn't go forward in the sense there would nobody courtroom decorum, but in the sense that what the defendant would say to the jury would make no sense.",
  "I think to force the State to have the train wreck occur, when the evidence is very firm and reliable that it will occur, infringes the State's interests in starting the trial from the beginning in a coherent and orderly way and not basically subjecting the defendant to the risk of an unfair trial based on the defendant's own incompetence. And this record is about as good as you are going to get on that. The defendant's communications, which are in the jury -- which are in the joint appendix and which Justice Ginsburg has mentioned and they are reproduced in the Petitioner's brief, show that although the psychiatrists ultimately concluded that he could work with his lawyer, when you put him on his own and ask him to articulate anything to the judge, which he did in great extent, it made no sense whatsoever.",
  "That's correct. And this judge had also seen the defendant firsthand during the first trial. There had been years of competency proceedings. With the aid of medication, the defendant was brought to an extent where he was competent to assist his counsel. But that in no way gave him the competency to actually carry out the trial. And this judge, I think, did the responsible thing. Rather than allow the defendant to sort of allow himself to commit State-assisted suicide by going before a trial in a way that had no capacity of producing a result that would truly be regarded as fair, the judge said: I'm not going to do it; I'm going to terminate self-representation because I think that's in the best interest of justice.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The exclusionary rule under this Court's cases has always been a balance between the interest in achieving some deterrence of police misconduct and the high cost of excluding probative evidence of criminal activity. The exclusionary rule does not put the error back in the box. It does not correct it. It serves only as incentives for future compliance to avoid future Fourth Amendment errors. In this case, where nothing is shown other than a negligent and isolated clerical error in the maintenance of warrants, there is no showing that suppression of evidence will achieve the kind of appreciable deterrence that this Court has said is necessary before the exclusionary rule is applied.",
  "The district court did find that there was negligence. There is very little in the record, Mr. Chief Justice, that explains precisely what did happen. But I would take issue with my colleague's comment that the record shows that there were no auditing procedures. The record simply was not made on whether there were auditing procedures. What the district court did find based on testimony is that the Dale County Clerk's Office and the Dale County Sheriff's Office both had a reliable system of recordkeeping on which law enforcement could rely. That's a finding of the district court.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I actually think that negligence alone should not be enough to justify suppression, because it would not produce the appreciable form of deterrence that this Court has said is warranted. But I also think that - -",
  "I'm not sure that it won't affect conduct to some degree, Justice Souter. I think the exclusionary rule requires far more than saying that it might affect conduct, and I think that what the Court should look at - -",
  "I think the incremental change in police behavior will be modest at best, and I think this is crucial to my view of the case.",
  "That's precisely so.",
  "Justice Scalia, if you take it --",
  "-- if you take it - -",
  "They do. But from an ex ante perspective, Justice Souter, they can't know that, but they do have - -",
  "No, I think that - -",
  "Justice Souter, what I think it's important for the Court to know is that the police have ample incentives as it stands to try to make their recordkeeping systems as accurately as possible. The police do not have an interest in believing that there is an outstanding warrant for someone's arrest when there is not. The first reason is that an arrest situation is a highly dangerous encounter for police officers. It's not one to be undertaken lightly. That's why this Court has rules that govern searches incident to arrest in order to remove potential weapons from suspects. The police don't want to convert what would be an otherwise routine traffic stop or no stop at all into a felony encounter that could go bad for all concerned. Second, there is - -",
  "On the facts of this case, Justice Kennedy, I would not say there is 1983 liability. It's a litigable issue whether there would be the potential for a plaintiff to show, as the defendant in this case did not try to show, that there was a degree of deliberate indifference to a need to have a reliable recordkeeping system such that some official would be personally liable for the failure to have that.",
  "Yes. I think a 1983 suit, and there is ample evidence that many such suits have been brought, and we cite cases in our brief and the Petitioner cites cases in his brief.",
  "Well, that assumes, I think, contrary to this Court's assumption of good faith on governmental actors - -",
  "No. There are three reasons why they would not. The first is the danger factor, as I mentioned.",
  "Oh, it certainly does, because it converts what would otherwise be not a stop at all or a reasonable suspicion stop into a felony arrest. And when the police are undertaking an arrest, this Court has recognized that suspects often have an incentive to escape or to use weapons to resist - -",
  "If there is no warrant, there will be no arrest. And that's why the police have an incentive to clean up the records so that they don't send out the police on warrant situations when there is no warrant.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I assume that the Court will make its decision not based on the conduct of Officer Anderson in this case, but in an assessment nationwide of whether the exclusionary rule is necessary because the police lack incentives to keep warrant systems up to date. And I'm giving reasons why institutionally the police do have that incentive and, therefore, undertake those kinds of efforts.",
  "The second reason is police resources. It takes a lot of time and energy to undertake a felony arrest. Many jurisdictions have dedicated warrant forces which seek to serve outstanding warrants, and they don't want to spend their time doing it on warrants that have been recalled. Similarly, in a case like this, the police happened to find drugs on Petitioner's person and a gun in his car, but if they had found nothing and taken him down to the station house and booked him, that would have been taking two police officers off the street for an afternoon, wasting their resources so that they're not engaged in the kind of protection of the community that the police force wants to do. And the third reason is that it does not create community goodwill to undertake arrests when people do not have warrants and simply because of a mistake in police records they're hauled downtown. That's the kind of thing that creates friction between the police and communities.",
  "Justice Breyer - -",
  "Well, my first answer, Justice Breyer, is that this Court's exclusionary rule jurisprudence already draws a number of careful lines based on the balance that - -",
  "Well, the rule, to state it simply, that I think should govern this case is: An isolated and negligent police clerical error in the maintenance of warrant records should not lead to suppression. And the reason for that is there are ample incentive for the police to attempt to correct their own records such that the exclusionary rule would not approve - -",
  "I think it's highly administrable. It doesn't create that many problems. This exclusionary rule hearing is an illustration. The warrant clerk for Dale County was on the witness stand. The warrant clerk for Coffee County was on the witness stand. The arresting officer was on the witness stand. All of those people were asked, do these errors occur with frequency? They said: They don't; our system is reliable.",
  "That's correct, Justice Kennedy.",

  "No, it's actually not Leon. It's Whiteley versus Warden. And I'm positing a warrant that was completely based on a bare-bones affidavit. So it would not pass the Leon test.",
  "I don't think it's so clear from this Court's cases.",
  "Well, not in this Court.",
  "I'm not so aware that there are so many of them in the lower courts where it's negligence. Most often the kind of mistakes that's made, the courts say it's within the realm of probable cause if it's a reasonable mistake. If it's an unreasonable mistake, negligent mistake, I would be prepared to say that the lower courts are probably today suppressing. And this Court doesn't have to decide whether that's correct in order to decide this case. This case - -",
  "I don't think the Court needs to use the word \"good faith.\" The Court used the words \"good faith\" in Leon. It's repeated it in all of its so-called good faith exclusionary rule exceptions. We're talking about an objective rule, and the line that I think that the Court should draw today is between isolated negligent errors and errors that result from a more systematic or widespread pattern, the kind that Justice O'Connor referred to in her concurrence in Arizona v. Evans.",
  "I don't want it. I'm saying that the Court doesn't have to reach the issue today of whether a widespread pattern of errors or complete neglect - -",
  "Yes. That's not to say - -",
  "I think that's a very different -- well, whether it violates the Fourth Amendment or not would turn on whether there is in fact probable cause. If there is no probable cause, and I understood your question, Justice Souter - -",
  "Yes.",
  "I think it's simply a different inquiry, Justice Souter, because, as I tried to explain, in this area the Court can note a number of incentives that law enforcement has to keep its warrant databases accurate and up to speed.",
  "In my experience, Justice Stevens, not that frequently.",
  "And I think - -",
  "Well, I think that the practical importance of it and the legal importance of it is what, kind of a balance is the Court going to strike under the exclusionary rule. We heard a lot from Petitioner today about how the exclusionary rule would help make police engage in better practices. We heard nothing about the costs of the exclusionary rule. Compared to, for example, to - -",
  "Some in the lower courts have involved violent crime, and I think this case would look and feel very different if evidence of a murder had been discovered in the car. And that just accentuates the point that the exclusionary rule comes with a price to society. It's not free.",
  "Well, that's all that the district court found. The district court had evidence and made a finding that there was no pattern of violations like this, that the system of recordkeeping was generally reliable. This is the findings of the district court that are on page 17a and 18a of the Petitioner appendix. The district court concluded: \"There is no credible evidence of routine problems with disposing of warrants and the warrant clerk herself could not recall other instances like this.\"",
  "Well, there was no record made whatsoever on what Alabama's overall - -",
  "Unless -- if the Court is prepared to say that the exclusionary rule is going to function differently on a State by State basis depending on the statewide error rate, which I think is an unusual thing for the Court to do - -",
  "Upon a -- Not just upon a showing of an error rate, but upon a showing that a particular recordkeeping system that produced an error was conducted in a manner so that you could say much more than negligence was involved here.",
  "You do. I would concede you have a good prima facie case. I would want to know more to know what that really means because with a lot of these statistics - -",
  "If the Court adopts a rule that says that a showing of more than isolated negligence would justify suppression, you're correct. I would note, though, that - -",
  "No. I think I clarified to Justice Scalia that I think all the Court needs to decide today is that an isolated negligent error in police recordkeeping should not result in suppression. It should not hold today because it's not confronted with today - -",
  "I would reserve the right to argue that the exclusionary rule's costs outweigh its benefits even if that is shown in a particular case because there are a myriad of other reasons why the police would have an incentive to improve that.",
  "Well I think - -",
  "It's manifested in it every case in which reliable probative evidence is suppressed.",
  "I don't think, Justice Souter, that the Court has ever looked for an empirical count of how many cases.",
  "If the Court wants one in order to justify the exclusionary rule, then it probably needs to go back to scratch and start all over again.",
  "I will say this, Justice Souter. If the cost is very low because very few cases result in suppression, then deterrence is also very low because there are very few cases in which evidence is being suppressed.",
  "But my argument today does not require the Court to take that step at all because this is an area in which there is a local geography of incentive pertaining to the accuracy of warrants that allows the Court to conduct the balance in a way distinct from what it might do if it's confronted with police negligence or if it's confronted with a widespread pattern of negligence.",
  "Yes, but I think, Justice Stevens, that form of looking at the question has been rejected in this Court's cases that have recognized that the exclusionary rule has to pay its way because in every case in which it results in suppression there is a cost to society and the benefit therefore needs to be appreciable and this Court needs to be confident of that before it concludes that what the Court called the \"massive remedy of exclusion\" is applied in any particular case.",
  "Correct. There was benefit in this very case and cost if the evidence is suppressed.",
  "I think that that's correct, Justice Souter, but I'm not aware of any case in which the Court has said the exclusionary rule has costs and now we need to see the numbers of statistically how many cases result in suppression. I'm just not aware of any case in which the Court has done that.",
  "Well, Justice Souter what my case comes down to today I believe is the proposition that when we are talking about clerical errors made by the police, there are ample incentives for the police not to make those clerical errors that I've described earlier, such that the incremental benefit of the exclusionary rule which we know has a cost; it has a tangible cost in every case in which it's applied; does not pay its own way. In other words, there is no sufficient incremental deterrence to warrant taking an isolated negligent error in a generally reliable system and saying we need to suppress evidence anyway; and Petitioner's argument goes farther than the isolated negligent error case. It says even if the police have driven the error rate down as low as it's humanly possible by committing mass amounts of are resources to warrant database systems in order to avoid suppression, which is what the Petitioner's theory posits, you should still suppress; and that seems to me nothing other than the return to the theory when there is a Fourth Amendment violation, suppression automatically follows; and this Court - -",
  "Well, it does matter, Justice Ginsburg, because the police officers that I'm familiar with and the agencies that I'm familiar with as exemplified by the NCIC which is the national database, says that the last thing that we want to do is send officers mistakenly out on a felony arrest where they are going to be placed in a potentially dangerous situation spending community police resources to arrest somebody who should not be arrested. This is not what they want to do. They have a good reason to avoid being placed in that situation and I would caution the Court against relying on a 13 percent figure in a study that's submitted in a brief to this Court for the first time without any kind of adversarial testing. That is not I this think a reliable basis for the Court to infer that this particular police department had that kind of an error rate or that the exclusionary rule is necessary to prevent it from having that kind of an error rate or even that there were no procedures in place to prevent errors and warrants from remaining in the system. The record simply doesn't show that. The warrant clerks were on the stand and neither party asked them the question so this Court doesn't have the information to say today was there a system that would have ferreted this out. We know that if there was it failed in this case.",
  "Yes, Justice Kennedy; the Court did just that and it began with the outset that the massive remedy of suppression of evidence is a high social cost that should not be borne by society, not just the police, by all of us, unless appreciable deterrence will result as a benefit; and the Court then examined the incentives that the police had not to make illegal no-knock entries and to add that whatever incremental benefit there might be from exclusion was not justified in light of the possibility of 198e liability and the increased professionalism of the police which has made it less necessary to make the exclusionary rule a remedy of first resort rather than last resort. While this Court could conceptualize the case as one in which the government is looking for an exception to the exclusionary rule, I think it's more accurately one where the Court should extend the exclusionary rule to cover negligent police clerical errors. For the first time, at this day and age when 1983 recoveries have become effective - -",
  "No one knows, Justice Ginsburg, because a great many of these cases will settle out of court, but our brief does provide examples of conduct that was more serious and more egregious than anything involved in this case resulting in situations where courts denied summary judgments to the defendants and ordered the cases to go to trial. And I'm not suggesting that in a case like this -- may I complete the answer -- there should be a 1983 remedy, but I am suggesting that civil remedies will provide incentives to the police to avoid the bog of litigation by putting into place systems that will prevent this kind of error.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court recognized absolute prosecutorial immunity for line prosecutors who are charged with violating an obligation that falls uniquely on prosecutors, namely the obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence. The Respondents in this case are seeking to circumvent that absolute prosecutorial immunity by reformulating the claim as one against supervisors who allegedly failed to fulfill duties under the Constitution to collect information that would enable the line prosecutors to comply with the core duty under Giglio and Brady.",
  "Not in our view, Mr. Chief Justice. In our view the Brady obligation is one that falls on the Government. Giglio is an extension of Brady with respect to impeachment information. It's designed to ensure the fairness of the trial. It is violated only when the Government has suppressed material exculpatory evidence, that is, evidence that can undermine the fairness of the trial. It's intimately linked in a way that really nothing else in the adversary system is to preserving the fairness of the trial. It's an obligation on the prosecutor to go beyond the normal role of an advocate to zealously advocate for his cause, and it puts the advocate in the position of supplying the judicial system with information needed to be submitted in order to have a fair proceeding.",
  "Well, it certainly is true that if there were a constitutional obligation under Giglio and Brady, it would be one that is intimately tied to the judicial process, and it should receive absolute prosecutorial immunity.",
  "Absolutely, Justice Kennedy, and I think that a formulation of policies to achieve that, whether or not required by the Constitution, is something that relates directly and intimately to the prosecutor's duties to assure - -",
  "Only in the sense, I think, that -- that a supervisor who has the power to cause or prevent constitutional violations may be under some obligation not to cause constitutional violations. But the claim here is - -",
  "You certainly should not.",
  "But I think that the deliberated indifference question that you raise, Justice Kennedy, is really a direct counterpart of the absolute immunity argument that we are making here. We are making here the argument that supervisory prosecutors should not be subject to suit based on broad policies that they have adopted that will directly have impact on individual cases in the way that Brady and Giglio obligations are fulfilled.",
  "I remember it, Justice Stevens, and I think that the -- I agree with Mr. Coates on this one. The supervisory prosecutor who formulates the policy is the only one who has the unique --",
  "Yes.",
  "That's the allegation, of course. And the first thing that I want to say is that if you allow suits based on allegations that you think are really bad, you open the door to allegations that will have to be sorted out throughout the judicial system.",
  "But I think that the point is that the immunity prevents the prosecutors from having to fear that they will be subject to those kind of suits. But to answer your question directly, the layperson, if he causes a constitutional violation, isn't shielded by the constitutional -- excuse me -- by the prosecutorial immunity that attaches only to prosecutors. And that's because if you go back to the roots in Imbler, what you see is that prosecutorial immunity is really - -",
  "I think the flaw in Respondent's theory is the attempt to bifurcate what the prosecutor is doing into an administrative function and a prosecutorial function. And that's the same, I think, maneuver in your hypothetical, to say that the prosecutor is really doing something administrative and Imbler said administrative things are non-prosecutorial; therefore, we can sue him. I think the problem with that is illustrated by a hypothetical about judicial immunity. Suppose - - judges of course have immunity from sitting on cases, and if a judge sat on a case that involved a conflict of interest he could not be sued or she could not be sued for having done so, even if it violated the Constitution. Suppose that the litigant reformulated the suit and said: Well, the judge should have had a policy to ensure a check of conflicts in all the cases that the judge sat on. And that would have been an administrative duty, set up some notebook that has all the judge's investments and direct some underling to ensure that no party in any case has an interest where the judge has an investment. That was purely administrative, so we ought to be able to sue. The judge for that. And I think that obviously should fail. It would end-run all of the policy reasons for being able to assert absolute judicial immunity; and I think that that is identical in form to what the Respondents are trying to do here. They are trying to divorce the role of the office in maintaining some sort of a system to ensure that information is available to prosecutors to disclose under Giglio from the obligation under Giglio to ensure the fairness of the judicial process, which is an obligation that falls uniquely on the prosecutor and which Imbler makes clear is subject to absolute immunity. And you just can't do that. If you do that, you end up exposing the supervisory prosecutors to evils that cannot occur to the line prosecutor himself. And it produces anomalies. The line prosecutor, even if he intentionally violates Giglio, cannot be sued, but under Respondent's theory the supervisory prosecutor, even if what he did is no more than deliberately indifferent or perhaps even negligent, could be sued. The line prosecutor who handles a certain number of cases cannot be sued, in part because it would ensure a distraction of the duties of the prosecutor and would divert him from performing his role of enforcing the criminal law. The supervisor, who is responsible for far more cases and is subject to far more disappointed litigants who would like to sue him, that person can be sued. And it would have an even more disruptive effect on an office if supervisory prosecutors, who have the responsibility, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, of trying to come up with policies that will prevent constitutional violations, and that will ensure that the office functions in an efficient and an effective manner, they will be the ones who are most deterred -- most deterred from acting, because they will suffer the possibility of thinking of their own individual liability rather than focusing on what they are supposed to do, the public interest, both disclosing information that needs to be disclosed, bringing suits that need to be brought, and using witnesses regardless of fears that someone later on is going to discover information that should have been disclosed and sue the supervisor, saying, \"We know we can't sue the individual prosecutor, but you, supervisor, failed to develop effective policies to get that information to the court.\" That kind of circumvention of Imbler plays no role of fulfilling the policies that absolute prosecutorial immunity is designed to fulfill. If the Court has no further questions - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It's important in this case to go back and look at the original Rule of Exclusion that this Court developed in the McNabb case in 1943 and then reiterated in the Mallory case in 1957. Both of those cases considered a pre-Miranda regime in which there was no constitutional law that required that a suspect be advised of his rights. Under Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and under statutes that preceded it that were in effect at the time of McNabb, the only way to ensure that a suspect was informed of his rights to silence and counsel was to bring him before a magistrate, and the magistrate would advise him of those rights. This Court in McNabb and Mallory thus fashioned a judicial rule of evidence, an exclusionary rule under the Court's supervisory power not as an effectuation of something that Congress specifically intended but of its own force as a way to backstop the Rule 5 requirement. In the government's view, two acts that came subsequently to McNabb and Mallory, section 3501 and Rule 402 of the Federal Rules - -",
  "Justice Stevens, I am not sure that there is any evidentiary sanction.",
  "None has risen in the case law that I can point Your Honor to. I think the primary safeguard of the enforcement of Rule 5 is the obligation that is placed on the government and on government agents to comply with rules of criminal procedure that are valid.",
  "No, I don't think that they are, Justice Stevens, because the -- the critical thing that the Court was doing in Mallory and McNabb was trying to come up with a way to ensure that suspects were advised of their rights to protect against abuses in the interrogation process. And the Court's ultimate constitutional solution to that lay years in the future. It came in the form of Miranda.",
  "I think that what the Court was after -",
  "Well, I think that it was not the sole motivating factor in McNabb.",
  "No, I would not agree that it would have equal strength.",
  "Well, certainly, Justice - -",
  "Yes, excessive delay can be a -- it is by statute a factor that will be taken into account in determining - -",
  "I think it is unenforceable by the exclusion of a confession that results from what a court concludes is unnecessary delay. And I think that that is true for two reasons, by virtue of congressional action and rulemaking action. And I think that as an additional actor this Court, which struck that supervisory powered balance in a pre-Miranda era, would do well to consider whether the factors that motivated it to suppress confessions in McNabb and Mallory should still be evaluated the same way today.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, what happened in this case is that the suspect was given his Miranda rights and waived them and agreed to give a confession. There are three circuits and the D.C. local court which all have concluded that a waiver of Miranda rights waives the right to prompt presentment. So the question of whether there was in fact unnecessary delay that would constitute a violation of Rule 5 has not been litigated in this case.",
  "That's correct.",
  "It is certainly challengeable on voluntariness grounds. Now, the Court's motive -",
  "Well, they do have something --",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, to the extent that it is correct that a waiver of Miranda rights waives the prompt presentment right and prevents an objection based on whatever survives of McNabb-Mallory, the officers are doing nothing wrong if they obtain a valid Miranda waiver; and this was just not a factor that the Court had on the horizon when it decided McNabb and Mallory.",
  "Well, Justice Souter, I think that is purely a question of policy of whether there should be such a strong exclusionary rule that mandates the barring from admission into evidence of a purely voluntary confession where there's no dispute about its voluntariness because the officers delayed beyond six hours.",
  "It's a policy context that I think Congress has decided in two different enactments, and I think that if this Court were to reach it as a matter of policy, it should revisit the balance that it reached in McNabb-Mallory because of the changed legal context. But this is a case about section 3501 and about Federal Rule of Evidence 402.",
  "I am glad that I have finally reached it.",
  "Section 3501 on its face says nothing about excluding any evidence. What it says is that in section (a) voluntary confessions are admissible. In section (b) it says that in determining voluntariness, a court will consider a variety of factors under the totality of the circumstances, including prearraignment delay. Then in subsection (c), it attacks more directly the McNabb-Mallory rule. And as originally formulated it would have wiped out McNabb-Mallory altogether; there is no dispute about that. After the bill was introduced there was a modification of it on the floor of the Senate in which a six-hour limitation was put in. Now, the effect of that six hours is to say that within six hours after the arrest delay by itself can never be an exclusive grounds for suppression; it just can't. And to that extent it overrules McNabb-Mallory to the extent that McNabb-Mallory would have allowed less than six hours of delay to serve as a basis for suppressing evidence. Outside of six hours, it does not say that evidence is suppressed. It simply leaves that determination to other sources of law. In the government's view, the primary source of law that controls the answer to that question is subsection (a), which says that voluntary confessions are admissible, and I believe that, as Justice - -",
  "Congress never needed (c); (c) in the government's view was always superfluous, even at the time when it directly said delays shall never be the grounds for suppressing a confession. There was already a provision in (a) that said voluntary confessions are admissible and it was well understood that McNabb-Mallory -- and this Court was very explicit on the point -- excluded totally voluntary confessions. So if this Court has nothing before it but the text of the statute, subsection (a) makes voluntary confessions admissible, and the only way that Petitioner can get around that is to say that section 3501(c) carved something out of subsection (a).",
  "That's the limitation on a - - the period during which a court cannot rely exclusively on delay within the meaning of the statute. It simply -- it carves out six hours from McNabb-Mallory plus reasonable transportation delays, and it leaves the six-hour -- after the six-hour period to other sources of law. Now, one source of law -- and this is where Petitioner looks -- would be McNabb-Mallory. But McNabb-Mallory is not a constitutional rule of decision. This Court has been clear, most recently in the Sanchez-Llamas decision, that it is a rule of supervisory power created by this Court.",
  "That's correct, but the modification, Justice Ginsburg, is that I think Congress has displaced McNabb-Mallory. It obviously cannot overrule a decision of this Court, but it can prescribe a rule of law that takes precedence over a decision of this Court that rests on its supervisory power. Petitioner does not contend that McNabb-Mallory was an interpretation of Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and I don't think that he could do that. This Court was explicit that the predecessor statute that existed before Rule 5 and provided the prompt presentment requirement did not address the issue of remedy. And it's notable I think that in the preliminary draft of the Rules of Criminal Procedure a rule of exclusion was explicitly provided. The rule would have said: \"No statement made by a defendant in response to interrogation by an officer or agent of the government shall be admissible in evidence against him if the interrogation occurs while the defendant was held in custody in violation of this rule.\"",
  "I think that's right, Justice Breyer.",
  "No, Justice Breyer.",
  "If the - -",
  "Well, that's precisely my point, Justice Breyer. The other rules that might permit exclusion of a voluntary confession in the Rules of Evidence are explicit, or they are there because the courts interpreted that rule to require it. That's not what happened in McNabb-Mallory, and I don't think that - -",
  "Well, McNabb and Mallory are not constitutional decisions of this Court.",
  "They were attempts to effectuate a particular policy choice. That policy choice was one that Congress was free to revisit, and I submit it did revisit in two different provisions, one in 3501(a) and the other in Federal Rule of Evidence 402.",
  "No, Justice Breyer, and I will concede to you the legislative history on the point that section (a) was considered to overrule Miranda and subsection (c) was addressed to McNabb-Mallory.",
  "I think in theory Rule 403 is such a rule. Rule 16, which requires discovery obligations, contains its own authorization for an exclusionary rule. And my answer to Justice Breyer on those rules is that they are explicitly provided by Congress. The difference in a Rule 5 - -",
  "No, Justice Alito.",
  "Yes.",
  "I think the general principle is what the Court ought to be focused on here. And the general principle is, yes, if there is some specific provision that should be together with subsection (a) - -",
  "I think it would be quite extraordinary for the Court to decide to revive its supervisory power decisions in McNabb and Mallory. They clearly were aimed at the problem of incommunicado detention with a suspect who did not know his Miranda rights.",
  "I think the statute, as we read it, contains some overlap in voluntariness requirement, and we interpret the voluntariness reference in subsection (c) to really mean otherwise voluntary; in other words, not to be deemed involuntary solely on the basis of delay, but otherwise voluntary. And in that sense section 3501(c) does contain - -",
  "Right.",
  "It's a -- it's a limitation on the time during which a judge may not rely on delay alone to find a confession inadmissible. That's all subsection (c) does. It says, judge, you may not find the confession to be inadmissible solely because of delay if it's within six hours plus reasonable transportation delays. And our interpretation of that language is that the inadmissibility as you mentioned, Justice Scalia, refers back to subsection (a), which speaks about confessions that are admissible if they are voluntarily given.",
  "It is, and I think the reason that it was written that way, Justice Souter, is it was a direct attempt to make clear that McNabb-Mallory shall not operate in the six-hour period after arrests and before presentment. It was an attempt to displace McNabb-Mallory explicitly. Originally it was to displace it altogether. As it ended up being written, it displaced it for six hours. And our submission is that you read the rest of the statute to determine what happens to confessions that are taken outside of six hours. And I would recognize that this makes subsection (c) in certain respects unnecessary to achieve the result that voluntariness controls. But the most that Petitioner argues and he made it very clear today, the most that he argues is that section 3501(c) leaves McNabb-Mallory to live another day for confessions outside of six hours. And if that is true, then the government's position is that Congress, in 1975 in Rule 402 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provided the bases on which relevant evidence can be excluded. And it listed four sources and they are the Constitution, an act of Congress, a rule of evidence, or -- and this is the relevant one -- other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. And what Congress meant by that were rules that this Court promulgates pursuant to Rules Enabling Act authority. It did not - -",
  "No. Rule 5 it certainly prescribed pursuant to Rules Enabling Act authority, although it was originally enacted by Congress. But Rule 5 contains no exclusionary rule.",
  "Justice Ginsburg - -",
  "There is a crucial difference between this Court deciding that there is a command in the Rules of Criminal Procedure and we as a court are going to back it up by an enforcement mechanism, which is the supervisory power route, and Congress saying what we intend is that a violation of this rule produced inadmissibility of a confession. Congress has never said the latter. This Court, in promulgating rules of evidence, have never said the latter. And what that leaves the Court with is the option of persisting in McNabb-Mallory as a supervisory powers decision or following the text of Rule 402 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which says that there isn't any authority to say that relevant evidence is out of the case simply because of the Court's views on supervisory powers - -",
  "Yes, I do, Justice Stevens.",
  "Well, Congress focused on the problem of confessions in section 3501 and it dealt with McNabb-Mallory in section 3501(c). We submit that the text of the statute provides an answer to McNabb-Mallory in section 3501(a).",
  "It came many years before, Justice Stevens. In 1968 when Congress reacted to this Court's Miranda decision and to McNabb-Mallory, it passed section 3501. Rule 402 is a very general rule that says the policy of the federal courts is that we are not going to have evidence rules made any more by case-by-case decision by the Supreme Court. We are going to have them promulgated in a code of Federal rules, and if the Court wants to change them, it can do that through the revisory committee process, and it would be open to Congress at any point, which has superior ability to gather facts and to survey the impact of whether there is a pattern of violations of rule 5 that warrants the very strong - -",
  "No.",
  "No, I think the Court did that and quite properly did it, Justice Stevens, because rule 502 of the Federal Rules of Evidence -- 501 or 502 says that principles of privilege shall be developed in light of reason and experience, and so it was a specific grant to this Court of the authority to do that. But beyond that Congress did not intend that the Court use supervisory powers to exclude relevant evidence. There is a rulemaking process; if the bench and bar want to get together and conclude as they did not conclude in 1943 -- this is the point I was trying to make to Justice Breyer -- in 1943 after this Court's decision in McNabb, there was explicit consideration of an exclusionary rule provision in rule 5; it engendered enormous controversy; it was rejected; it was taken out of the rule and it was never promulgated. So McNabb-Mallory exists not by virtue of the rulemaking process but by virtue of a supervisory decision of this Court more than half a century ago in an entirely different legal climate, in a climate where the costs of excluding a reliable, probative confession were not balanced against the benefits, if any, to be achieved by enforcing of a prompt present requirement through exclusion. Since that time this Court's Miranda jurisprudence has made it far more inappropriate for the Court to conclude that the enforcement of a rule-based mechanism which serves as a prophylactic to protect voluntariness should now result in exclusion of a confession when rule 501 says voluntary confessions come in and section -- and rule 402 says that relevant evidence comes in unless excluded by four sources - - not -",
  "No, I -- Justice Ginsburg, the rules advisory committee notes I think reflect an expectation that McNabb-Mallory was the law. Our submission is that the text of 402 is simply inconsistent with that, because it is quite explicit in limiting the sources of rules that can bar the admission of admissible evidence; and the phrase that is in 402, which is on page 29 of our brief, is \"rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority.\" Now the advisory committee drafters may have thought that that subsumed rule 5, but I think that is a legal question for this Court, and the correct answer to that is McNabb-Mallory is a rule of supervisory power, not a rule promulgated by this Court.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Two separate lines of double jeopardy analysis lead to the conclusion that the government can retry hung counts that occur in a verdict simultaneously with acquittals. The first is the principle that the government may, under the doctrine of continuing jeopardy, try to obtain a verdict when a jury is hung. The basic principle there is that the government is entitled to one full and fair opportunity to convict and that the hung counts, when the jury cannot agree, interrupt and prevent the government from achieving that. Double jeopardy therefore does not bar the government from completing its opportunity to obtain a verdict. The second doctrinal line is that which grows out of the Powell case. Collateral estoppel is premised on the idea that the jury has acted rationally.",
  "No. Powell was a case in which the Court rejected the doctrine of collateral estoppel as a means of upsetting a mixed verdict of acquittals and convictions.",
  "Well, I don't think that it undermines that determination, Mr. Chief Justice, because the acquittals will stand as acquittals, and they will bar reprosecution on that offense. To the extent that there are determinations that are made by the acquittals that are independent of any inconsistency with the hung counts, that too can have collateral estoppel effect in a successive prosecution. But I think the crucial thing here is that this is not properly viewed as a successive prosecution for double jeopardy purposes. Ashe v. Swenson and the cases - -",
  "No, it is not in the sense, I think, Justice Stevens that the Court used that in Ashe.",
  "Well, that indictment simply embodies non-jeopardy-barred counts that - -",
  "Well, no, I think that there is, Justice Stevens, if on the theory that the Petitioner propounds the verdict on the acquittals is inconsistent with the mistrial. And that's the only way in which collateral estoppel could apply, only if the jury had necessarily determined a fact on the acquittals that should have led to acquittals on the insider trading counts.",
  "Well, I -- Petitioner's theory would be identical if there were one insider trading count. And I think that for purposes of this case, the Court should not get too distracted by the number of counts, because all of the insider trading counts turned on a common core of fact. They were all resolved identically - -",
  "We're not questioning the integrity of the acquittal as far as it has direct double jeopardy application. The question is whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel ought to be applied.",
  "The reason, Justice Breyer, is that the hung counts do not constitute a resolution in favor of the defendant.",
  "But there's a reason for that, Justice Breyer, that is grounded in double jeopardy policies. And I think it goes to the question that Justice Souter asked as well, why the Court should prefer the double jeopardy doctrine that allows the government to retry the hung counts when they are all brought together in the same proceeding? And that is this -- and I think it's made most vivid by imagining Ashe v. Swenson in a slightly different posture. Ashe v. Swenson involved robbery of six individuals at a poker game. The government indicted each one of them as a separate robbery and the government tried one of them first. And in that one, the jury's acquittal was understood to mean that the defendant was not the robber. If the government could go sequentially through and try the other five, it has the opportunity to try to wear the defendant down or refine its case or improve its case in a way that the Court regarded as impermissible. But suppose that in Ashe the government hadn't done that, it had brought all six robbery prosecutions together, and the jury returned one verdict of acquittal on one robber and on the other five it hung? In that situation I think -- which is the situation we have here - -",
  "But, Justice Stevens, that is identical to this case. There is no difference to this case - -",
  "No. But, Justice Stevens, if you would question the integrity of the acquittal, if the jury acquits on one robber and hangs on five, that is this case. The only difference in this case is it's a securities fraud case.",
  "Correct.",
  "There are two reasons for that, Justice Breyer. The first is that the Double Jeopardy Clause is not aimed at preventing the government from attempting to bring its -- all of its charges in one indictment against the defendant. What the collateral estoppel component is aimed at is the government going sequentially, carving its prosecution up into pieces, and trying in different attempts.",
  "My response to that, Justice Souter, is that double jeopardy has always consisted of a balance of values. There is of course the interest that Your Honor has identified, but the countervailing interest is that the government should have one full and fair opportunity to convict a defendant on charges that have been preferred by a grand jury on a showing of probable cause, and that does not occur when the hung counts deprive the government of that one opportunity.",
  "Well, let me -- let me give two answers to that, Justice Souter. First of all, the position for which Petitioner argues does not depend on the number of counts. If there had been two counts in the indictment - -",
  "-- it would be the same. But more fundamentally, I think that the number of counts in this indictment should not lead the Court to think that this was a case in which the government overcharged in some nefarious effort. First of all, nefarious efforts like that tend to backfire on the government, and that's why sound prosecution policy dictates against overcharging. Here I don't think it's fair to regard the number of counts as a proxy for overcharging, and that is because they break up into logically distinct units.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg, because all of the insider trading counts turn on the same fact: did Petitioner have inside information, did he know that the Enron broadband system that he was integrally involved in, was the strategic manager in charge of, wasn't working? If he had that knowledge and he traded, the number of counts is really irrelevant, and I think that the fact that the jury resolved all of the insider trading counts the same way and the money laundering counts just had to do with the disposition of the proceeds, they're all resolved the same way. The jury obviously deadlocked on whether some fact that the government needed to prove for those counts was established. And the bizarre thing, I think, about Petitioner's position is that he seeks to get through a legal doctrine, collateral estoppel, which is a big extension from what the Double Jeopardy Clause textually prohibits, exactly what the jury would not give him. The jury - -",
  "No, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that the Court needs to revisit Ashe v. Swenson in order to resolve this case, but I think it's fair to say that Ashe v. Swenson is a doctrine that transposed certain civil policies that are -- are expressed through the doctrine of issue preclusion into the double jeopardy context in a way that was not supported by the history of the Fifth Amendment and is not supported by the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause, which requires the same events.",
  "Well, I - -",
  "I think that it is because it says that the same offense is what you're protected against for double jeopardy, and the offenses in this case are distinct under Blockburger. But my point about - -",
  "Well, this Court has made clear that the jeopardy continues until the government has the opportunity to obtain a verdict. So the fact that his jeopardy began is not what entitles him to - -",
  "I think it then becomes a question of what is the meaning of jeopardy. But insofar as the Court imported collateral estoppel into the Double Jeopardy Clause, it should keep in mind in deciding whether to extend that doctrine that in the civil context a crucial predicate for collateral estoppel is the ability of the adversely affected party to appeal, and that is because before we rely on collateral estoppel, we want to have some assurances that there actually is integrity to the necessarily determined fact that is going to preclude litigation in another case.",
  "Well, I think that this Court's decisions since - -",
  "Since 1824 this Court has defined the government's full and fair opportunity to include the right to retry if the jury hangs, and here what the defendant - -",
  "No, I don't -- I don't agree that it's in the same position - -",
  "-- as if it had not bought it.",
  "It's -- it -- in this case what the government did was to bring all of its cases together. And I return to the hypothetical about Ashe v. Swenson because I think it strikes everyone as very strange to say that if the jury in Ashe v. Swenson had been presented with all six robbers and had acquitted on only one and had a returned -- you know, an inability to reach a verdict - -",
  "I'm not relying on Dunn in this hypothetical. I'm presupposing that the jury hung with respect to the other five robbers. And all the government would come back and say is: For two separate reasons, we should be able to retry those counts against the other five robbers. One is that when there is a hung jury it's settled double jeopardy law that the government has an opportunity to retry; and the other is if you accept the proposition that the jury's action was inconsistent because one of the robbers earned an acquittal and the other five logically should have been the same if the jury had found that the defendant wasn't the robber, the jury was unable to return a verdict. Collateral estoppel depends on the idea that there is a rational jury, and if the jury has acted inconsistently, we don't have that basis of rationality that supports the policy justifications of collateral estoppel.",
  "Yes, such as lenity for the defendant. The government doesn't get the opportunity to appeal an acquittal. The government doesn't get the opportunity to go behind the acquittal and ask whether the jury acted rationally. All of things -- those things are true in civil cases where the doctrine of issue preclusion applies.",
  "Not under - -",
  "Well, the government should not be worse off.",
  "I think the reason is that when, Justice Breyer, you said double jeopardy is not involved in the cases involving the government's ability to retry on a hung count, that's not accurate. The Court has regarded the doctrine of double jeopardy as a balance of policies, and one of the fundamental policies is when the jury cannot agree, the government has the right to retry.",
  "Well, I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, because I think you still have to focus on the intrinsic character of the doctrine of issue preclusion, which does depend on a rational jury. Let's apply it to the facts of this case, because there is - -",
  "No, Justice Ginsburg, there is not. The government's theory here was that on the substantive securities fraud count, which related to the January 20th, 2000, analysts meeting, Mr. Yeager was integrally involved in formulating the message and was therefore accountable for misstatements to the marketplace about Enron broadband communications efficacy and effectiveness and technological value. The jury, if it rejected that, would acquit on those counts -- on that count, without reaching the question did Mr. Yeager know factually that the statements that were made by others at that analysts conference and in the press releases subsequently were inaccurate? If the answer to that question is yes, he had the information, then he could be liable for insider trading even though he is not liable for substantive securities fraud because he had nothing to do with creating the statements or misstatements to the marketplace. And I think I do take issue with Petitioner's suggestion that the theory of this case was an omissions theory. The way that Mr. Yeager argued the case to the jury was that I didn't have any involvement in preparing or making statements at that January 20th analysts conference; you can't convict me of what other people may have said. And the jury instructions advised the jury that it had to find that he participated in the scheme and that he either made the statements or caused the statements or omissions to be made. If it rejected that, it easily acquits on the securities fraud. And as a result even if this Court were inclined to apply collateral estoppel across mixed counts in a verdict of acquittals and hung counts, which we submit it should not do, the defendant still has to carry his burden of showing necessarily that the jury resolved an issue of fact in his favor that would preclude the next prosecution.",
  "But the court of appeals relied on the view that Mr. Yeager did not contest that he participated in the planning and preparation and statements that were made.",
  "Well, I think it's included in our ability to defend the judgment. The District Court in this case made it quite clear that collateral estoppel did not apply because the acquittals could rest on the basis that Mr. Yeager did not participate in the analysts conference and in the press statements that were the basis for the wire fraud and the securities fraud omissions.",
  "Well, you could resolve it. I would hope that you would resolve it in a favor of a disposition that doesn't require you to reach the factual issue, but if the Court resolves the legal issue against us, I think it should revisit the analysis of the court of appeals because government isn't defending the precise way in which the court of appeals went about analyzing the double jeopardy issue, and its question of what facts were necessarily determined was resolved incorrectly, I think, as a matter of clear error. I don't even think Mr. Yeager will stand up on rebuttal and tell you that he didn't argue to the jury that his client was not involved in -- in the creation of the statements at that analyst meeting because he did make that argument. And I do think that it's important that if the Court is going to go down a track of allowing collateral estoppel for mixed verdicts, that it encourage rigor in the way that courts determine whether a fact was necessarily decided by the jury.",
  "They have not reasoned it the way that the government reasons it, but I think that the Fifth Circuit's result is equivalent to what the government argued as well as the D.C. Circuit.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Kennedy, because I think the interest that's being vindicated here is a balance of interests, and it's - - as I responded to the Chief Justice and -- and referred to Justice Souter's question earlier, double jeopardy has never been a jurisprudence of black and white. You could you read the clause as saying one trial for a defendant. If the defendant is -- doesn't get a conviction at that trial, game over. But the Court has never done that because the double jeopardy clause has always involved a balance of the society's very important interests in having the opportunity for a decision up or down on whether a defendant is guilty.",
  "If the -- if the jury hangs, the government can retry, and there have been cases where - -",
  "I am not aware whether any States do, but certainly as a matter of double jeopardy, this Court has never suggested that there is. I think as a matter of common sense, prosecutors who are unable to achieve a verdict after a certain number of trials do tend to conclude that it's not in the interest of society to keep trying. But certainly one hung jury followed by a retrial is customary rather than an exception to the rule, and the reason why that's - -",
  "But the - -",
  "Well, I -- I -- Justice Stevens, all I can say is that if the first jury had really believed that Mr. Yeager acted in good faith and was completely innocent, it should have acquitted on all counts.",
  "We should have -- we should presume that, as we do in other areas of the law, that the jury followed the instructions that it was given, and the instructions that it was given - -",
  "But I think that there is no reason for the fact that a jury takes irrational action to then be used for the jury's acquittal to block complete prosecution.",
  "Well, they acted irrationally in the sense that if a fact necessarily determined acquittals on the -- on the insider trading counts - -",
  "But the point is they should have agreed logically if they believed that Mr. Yeager never had inside information or acted in good faith. And the jury is instructed to consider each count, count by count, it was given instructions at the Allen phase of the case that it should strive to achieve a verdict, that Mr. Yeager is entitled to a verdict of not guilty if, in fact, the jury believes that he is not guilty and that it should make every effort to reach the verdict. Now, the fact that it didn't, and it would have been very easy for it to do, if it had determined logically that he did not have inside information, is a reason for hesitating before extrapolating out from those acquittals and blocking the government's opportunity to retry the hung counts. Mr. Yeager's position logically - -",
  "I -- I don't think it is that difficult of an issue. I think the district court which was closer to it, which had presided over the trial and which read the closing arguments, made findings that make it quite clear what Mr. Yeager argued and how those arguments were totally consistent - -",
  "I'm not sure that - -",
  "If the jury was confused and it acted in an irrational manner, that's a reason not to apply collateral estoppel, not a reason to do it. What Mr. Yeager's theory implies is that if the jury had come back and -- under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure it can return partial verdicts. If the jury had come back and said we're struggling on some of the counts, we have a partial verdict on others of them, and the judge said, okay, we'll take the partial verdict; and the jury came in and said, we acquit on five counts, that Mr. Yeager's theory would be that the judge should say that's great, collateral estoppel now means you don't get to finish the deliberations on the counts on which you said you can't agree. And that result makes no sense, neither does blocking retrial in this case.",
  "I assume I can answer your question, Mr. Chief Justice?",
  "No, because the -- the logic of the situation here is that in order for collateral estoppel to apply, there needs to be a rational jury verdict. And Ashe versus Swenson tells us that in attempting to decide what the jury rationally resolved, we look at all evidence in the record, not just some. So it isn't necessary to treat the jury's hung counts as if they are verdicts of a sort. They simply are data which show that if the jury had been rational and it had resolved a fact in favor of the defendant that was necessary for the government to prove on the other counts, it would have resolved those as acquittals as well. And once you take into account that total record, the doctrine of collateral estoppel with its premise of rationality cannot be applied.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is a fundamental difference between Petitioner's claim that defense counsel has a duty to advise his client about all of the myriad collateral consequences that may stem from a criminal conviction, which the government does not think that a defense counsel has under the Sixth Amendment, and the claim that is focused more precisely on misadvice given by defense counsel on a material collateral consequence to a defendant.",
  "Well, I think it's certainly not an affirmative misrepresentation. In context, what the defense lawyer's purpose is, is to counter the government's criminal case. That’s what the Sixth Amendment provides a lawyer to do. The government appears through its expert adversary. The Sixth Amendment provides a counterweight to that in the form of a lawyer to deal with the criminal aspects of the case.",
  "What we think, Justice Kennedy, is that the defense lawyer has two relevant duties here: One is to counter the government's case, which means to provide advice to the defendant about his rights, the nature of the charges, the evidence, and the affirmative defenses that may exist. And that is a task that is somewhat broader than the court has in conducting a Rule 11 colloquy. The court does not go into strategic matters in a criminal case with the defendant. Defense counsel must.",
  "That's right.",
  "Certainly not by virtue --",
  "-- of the Sixth Amendment, Mr. Chief Justice. And --",
  "Because --",
  "I think it's because the lawyer has an additional duty in the context of advising his client whether to take a guilty plea, and that is the duty to respect that the decision whether to plead guilty belongs to the defendant personally. It's not a decision that can be exercised by proxy by the lawyer. And the lawyer's duty to respect that, whatever advice he gives, the defendant must be able to make his own personal decision, imposes a concomitant duty not to interfere with or undermine the defendant's ability to make an intelligent decision with the information he has. So if a lawyer chooses, when asked about collateral consequences, as many aliens will do –- will I get deported? -- the lawyer is perfectly free to say: I am not your immigration counsel. You need a lawyer to advise you about immigration. I am your criminal lawyer. And that's perfectly fine. But if a lawyer goes beyond that and says, don't worry about it; you've been in the country so long; you are not going to get deported -- with the understanding and the backdrop that this is an important factor in whether this defendant is going to decide to take a guilty plea or to go to trial -- then the lawyer has used his professional skills to undermine a personal decision that belongs to the defendant alone.",
  "I would put them, Justice Scalia, all in the same general basket, which is to say, misadvice on a legal matter of importance to the defendant that could skew his decision to plead guilty may be deficient representation under Strickland. I think what was --",
  "Well, objective in the sense that --",
  "I actually think that would be quite relevant, because if any misadvice did not cause the defendant to plead guilty because it was irrelevant to him, then the defendant should not be able to get in the door with an ineffective assistance claim. And I also think if the defendant hasn't manifested in some way that the particular collateral consequence is important to that defendant, then the lawyer certainly has no obligation even under professional standards --",
  "No, I don’t --",
  "No, I don't think that it will lead to sort of defensive malpractice type of counseling where lawyers do not do the job that they feel that they should do, and experience tends to support that. The rule right now in 10 Federal circuits is there’s no duty to advise about collateral consequences. Seven Federal circuits have a rule that affirmative misadvice about collateral consequences can support a claim.",
  "Justice Breyer, we have not abandoned Strickland's approach. What we have focused on is, what is the Sixth Amendment right in the first place? The Sixth Amendment right is not a right to have a State-provided lawyer who will advise you about child custody or about deportation or about --",
  "I think, Justice Breyer --",
  "Justice Breyer, I think that the fundamental point is that this is the first time that the Court has been asked to adopt a rule under Strickland that would require a lawyer, pursuant to Sixth Amendment norms, to give advice that pertains --",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, the -- the lower courts that have looked at this I think have correctly recognized that there’s a distinction between saying that Strickland is a case-by-case inquiry into lawyer competence and saying that Strickland requires the lawyer to provide advice about collateral consequences that are not the criminal case --",
  "Well, Justice Alito, I don't think that he has a right under the Sixth Amendment to a lawyer who will counsel him about the potential immigration consequences of a guilty plea. That’s not what the Sixth Amendment was designed for.",
  "I don't know that anything happens to the lawyer, Justice Scalia.",
  "Well, I think that --",
  "There’s the professional --",
  "There is a professional incentive to provide advice where you are competent to provide advice and not to provide it where you are not competent. And I think that the focus on immigration consequences illustrates two things: One is this is an extraordinarily complicated area of the law, where it is very difficult to give advice. And for a lawyer to be expected to master not only the criminal aspects of the case but also the immigration aspects of the case will only tend to divert attention from what the lawyer is really there to do, advise --",
  "Well, the former part is certainly something that the Court could in its rulemaking capacity do. The latter part is a Sixth Amendment question. And I think it's highly notable that the rules committee for the criminal rules has twice considered whether to amend Rule 11, and is going to consider it again contemporaneously with this case, to require the judge to say to an alien defendant, you may want to take into account removal consequences of a criminal conviction. In other words, there are rule-based ways to address some of the concerns that Justice Alito raised without constitutionalizing a new area of collateral consequences that would impose new duties that actually would divert the lawyer from his criminal law function, whereas the misadvice line has not created those problems. And as I started to say earlier, the fact that 10 Federal circuits have said no duty to advise on collateral consequences, while 7 have recognized that misadvice on collateral consequences can provide relief, has not led to a series of difficult Strickland hearings that are unmanageable. Justice Alito --",
  "Then the client does not get relief for two reasons: One is because we believe there’s no duty to give that advice. But even if the Court disagreed with me on that, such a defendant could hardly show prejudice because he knew that he went into his guilty plea with uncertainty, at best, about removal. And I think it would be very difficult to show what he should have to show to establish prejudice: First, that subjectively he would not have pleaded guilty had he been given correct immigration advice; and, second, that a reasonable defendant would have had a basis not to plead guilty, because if the defendant is going to be convicted after a trial in any event, the same collateral consequence is going to ensue. The defendant will not evade the collateral consequences of removal if the defendant was going to be convicted at a trial anyway. And perhaps --",
  "Well, I think courts will evaluate that kind of a claim just the way they evaluate any other Strickland claim and decide whether there was any reasonable probability that such a defense could have prevailed.",
  "This is the typical regime that the Court has dictated under Strickland, and it has not proved unmanageable in the courts that have adopted the limited misadvice rule that the government supports.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. It's good to be back.",
  "The one thing that I think the parties, the cases, and this Court, in its description of section 1346 in Cleveland, agree on is that the purpose of the statute was to restore at least some part of the pre-McNally doctrine of intangible rights. It, therefore, makes sense to take a look at the theory of intangible rights violation that Mr. Ayer very ably argued for the government when he argued the McNally case.",
  "And that case -- that theory --",
  "That's what the document that you are reading from said, Justice Ginsburg. One week later, the government filed a clarification of its -- of its position in response to Petitioner's briefing of the issue, and this appears at pages 68 and 69 of the joint appendix. And in that filing, the government made clear that its theory, consistent with the theory that I am arguing here today, is that when the legislator takes official action having an undisclosed conflict of interest, that's when he violates the honest services statute under the nondisclosure theory. We are not here to urge that there is a general duty of disclosure that is separate and apart from any official act that the official takes. We are not here to argue that there’s a free-standing Federal duty of disclosure that applies in all cases, regardless of the other elements of the mail fraud statute.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think that’s -- that’s a shorthand summary of the nondisclosure theory. The more accurate summary of the government's theory is on page 20a, on the first full paragraph that begins with the bracketed 9. And it says, \"Here, Weyhrauch allegedly voted and took other official acts on legislation at the direction of VECO while engaged in undisclosed negotiations for future legal work from VECO.\" And then it goes on to say, \"These allegations describe an undisclosed conflict of interest and could also support an inference of a quid pro quo.” Furthermore, Petitioner --",
  "On the bottom of page 68, Justice Scalia, there’s a italicized word, \"first.\" And it describes --",
  "-- the more detailed theory that the government is elaborating, and then on page 69, it says, quote, \"By introducing amendments to and voting on legislation that each defendant knew would affect Company A, an entity with whom each defendant either had or was negotiating for a financial relationship, each defendant knowingly breached that duty of disclosure.\" So I think the government tied up the nondisclosure to the official act and that the Ninth Circuit was not under an incorrect impression about that. And more fundamentally, Petitioner says -- I believe it's in footnote 6 of his opening brief -- that that's not the issue before the Court, how to instruct the jury on the duty of disclosure. That's an issue that will arise, and I think Petitioner's counsel said this to the district court -- it's in a page of the joint appendix that I don't have at my fingertips -- that's a matter for jury instructions. And we agree.",
  "No, it's not enough, Justice Ginsburg, not standing alone. It's when the official takes action that furthers his undisclosed interest without telling the decision-making body to which he belongs that he becomes a fraud. It's just like O'Hagan, Justice Ginsburg. When O'Hagan, the lawyer, took the information from his firm, posed as a loyal employee, the partner who comes to work every day just doing his job, it became a fraud when he took that information and used it in his own securities trading. Here, too, this is not a pure nondisclosure theory. This is another form of corruption. It's the kind of --",
  "If he did not further his undisclosed interests, then he does not breach the duty that the government alleges.",
  "Correct. And --",
  "You -- you could do it that way, Justice Alito, but the way that the mail fraud statute does it is it looks for the kind of personal conflicting financial interest that, in the universal view of the common law, raised a problem. Those are interests that are different from the public at large and that are not widely held by a large segment of the community.",
  "I think that when we are talking about State legislative officers, when we are talking about public officials, they know that they are fiduciaries. They have a set of fiduciary obligations. But to answer most directly, Justice Breyer, your concern, which I believe goes to notice, and whether a State legislator can be held criminally liable for violating a standard stated as I have just stated it, the government must prove in a criminal case an intent to defraud. That means that the government must show that the defendant sought to deceive the body to which he belongs.",
  "And that he knew he was breaching a duty. He does not need to know the legal source of the duty. That’s conventional law as in Bryan v. United States. You can know that you are acting illegally without knowing that it’s Federal law, State law, or local law --",
  "-- but the government needs to show that. And that means that in the typical case, the government will point to some external standard, be it a State criminal law, a State civil law, and --",
  "Well, there’s --",
  "Well, we would have to show, first of all, that he knew that he was breaching a legal duty.",
  "Okay.",
  "Then my answer is we live in a dual system in which citizens are governed by and accountable both by their States and by the Federal government.",
  "But this is fundamental to the government's position here, Mr. Chief Justice. It's not imposing a criminal penalty for violation of the State law duty. There is an independent Federal duty. Congress was well aware that --",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor, what I am trying to say to this Court this morning is that what 1346 reinstated was the notion that if fiduciaries have a duty not to further their own personal conflicting financial interests by taking official action, it becomes a Federal crime only when there is both materiality and intent to defraud. And to prove the intent to defraud element that the individual intended to deprive the citizens of their right of honest services, the government has to know -- show that he knew he was breaching a fiduciary duty. And the government can do that by offering evidence, for example, that State law precluded the action that he took -- the underlying action in this case by Mr. Weyhrauch was prohibited by State law. You are not permitted to vote on legislation when you were negotiating for employment.",
  "Yes, it does, Justice Stevens. He has to be furthering his undisclosed interest. And in this case he did it --",
  "He did it in violation of a State substantive duty, and the government's burden will be to show he knew he was acting wrongfully. And often we will do that by pointing to State law and saying he violated State law or he violated an ethics code that attached to him as a fiduciary. If not, we are going to have to find some evidence of circumvention, structuring transactions, nominee accounts, surreptitious meetings, things that indicate that an individual knows that he is acting fraudulently.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "Something like that.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I --",
  "Justice Breyer --",
  "-- I really don't think that this Court needs to worry about that as a type of honest services prosecution, because this was a defined universe of cases --",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I -- I think --",
  "To say that we picked them randomly --",
  "-- ignores the story of McNally. And I think that if I could take a minute to walk the Court through the legal history that brought us to this, I think it would be helpful. Before McNally, there was a body of case law that made very clear that there was a substratum fiduciary duty -- and I’ll limit this to the public official context for now, because that’s the most critical and important context. If you look at the common law in every State, public officials are fiduciaries. The core obligation of a fiduciary is the duty of loyalty, the duty not to advance your personal interests at the expense of the government who you serve. That core understanding of the duty of loyalty informed the honest services cases that arose in the courts of appeals, and for the most part, they involved, as their core set of violations, bribes, in which somebody is selling his office, so he’s clearly not serving the public; kickbacks, where the individual is profiting at the expense of the government, oftentimes in his official capacity, and sometimes not profiting at the expense of the government, because the government couldn't be harmed in a pecuniary way by the kickback; and undisclosed conflicts of interest when the official takes action to further that interest. And that’s --",
  "Justice -- Justice Scalia, the phrase \"intangible rights\" is at the center of the McNally majority opinion. The language \"honest services\" is in the McNally dissent and in many of the pre-McNally opinions. For those --",
  "Well, I --",
  "I think we would all agree, Justice Scalia, that had Congress taken your counsel, I would not be here today --",
  "-- defending what the Congress attempted to do. But I think that Congress viewed it as a permissible and in some ways clearer way of getting to the result it wanted, to point to the body of case law with the recognition that it was understood in its core aspects to cover what I have just described. And --",
  "I understand that, Justice Breyer --",
  "-- but this would not -- this is not an isolated area where the Court has recognized that criminal sanctions need to take into account decisional law.",
  "Well, I think the principle is that the Court has recognized -- and it has done so most prominently in the Sherman Act and in the civil rights statutes, 18 U.S.C., Section 241 and 242, that these are broad statutes with general language, and in order to be made susceptible of criminal punishment, you need two things. You need clarifying judicial decisions that articulate the rights, and you need a standard of scienter that will allow the government to convict only those people who are on fair notice and act with a -- the bad purpose --",
  "Well, I wasn't citing the Sherman Act as an example of formulating a common law of crimes, but there is only one Due Process Clause, Justice Scalia, so if it is constitutional to prosecute under the civil rights statutes and under the Sherman Act, then it is constitutional for this Court to divine from the pre-McNally case law principles and to articulate them.",
  "I think I’ve got it down to around eight.",
  "Let me -- let me just mention, in the civil rights area, it may not answer your concerns, Justice Scalia, but I think the Court should know that, in the United States v. Kozminski, the Court recognized -- and I am going to quote here -- that, \"Congress intended the statute to incorporate, by reference, a large body of potentially evolving federal law.\" And the Court recognized that that was a dilemma because you cannot have citizens criminally prosecuted for evolving law of which the citizens have no notice. And the Court's response was to say that, when the right has been made specific by a decision of this Court and there’s the requisite level of scienter, there is no due process problem in prosecuting --",
  "Justice Scalia --",
  "That's not what this --",
  "That's not what this law says, and that's not what this Court has done in response to other criminal law.",
  "But that’s common. This Court takes common law terms of art, such as fraud, and it reads into them elements that are not on their face on the basis of the common law. Take, for example, 18 U.S.C. 1111, which is the federal murder statute. It uses the phrase \"malice aforethought.\"",
  "But it is a term of art that had reference to a specific body of case law that could not have been given a higher degree of prominence than it was by this Court's decision in McNally, which acknowledged that body of law, rejected it because it said the mail fraud statute did not protect intangible rights.",
  "I don't recall, either, Mr. Chief Justice --",
  "-- whether the phrase --",
  "Well, I can't --",
  "In McNally, this Court said that body of law was not a valid implementation of the mail fraud statute, and it invited Congress to come back and legislate if it wanted to protect intangible rights, and Congress did that in a way that doesn't have the commendable clarity of the statute that you just drafted for us, Justice Scalia, but it does refer -- and I think, for those members of the Court who read legislative history, legislative history was replete with references to the key cases on which we rely here, such as United States v. Mandel and United States v. Margiotta. And it said this is a term of art. We know that this is a term of art. It's been shaped by the judiciary, but it doesn't just sit there as a pre-standing duty that had no antecedents in the law whatsoever.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I don't think that the Court should decide whether Congress validly accepted this Court's invitation to reinstate an important public corruption principle by looking to what one United States attorney, one set of federal prosecutors said in a pleading that was filed on very short notice and that was --",
  "Well, this body of law evolved post-McNally, without this Court's intervention and guidance to provide clarification. I think that the core understanding of what honest services is may have been strayed from in some of those cases, and some courts of appeals affirmed it. That doesn't mean that the statute is vague. This Court accepted review in Cleveland v. United States because the courts of appeals were divided on whether defrauding a government agency of a license constituted a deprivation of money or property. The U.S. attorneys on one side of the split were very aggressively pushing that theory. This Court held that it wasn't a valid interpretation. I think that it's the role of this Court and the -- within the proper disposition of this Court's authority to attempt to figure out what Congress did, and then to implement it in accordance with doctrines that are standard tools of the trade here -- rule of lenity, concerns about federalism -- and recognize that there is a core that Congress was looking at in the pre- McNally cases, and that that core can be implemented consistent with concerns about notice and clarity of definition, without either creating a statute that is totally freeform or without invalidating Congress's effort to respond to the Court's invitation in McNally. And, if I could turn to the question presented in this case, which is whether State law duties need to be violated, State law disclosure obligations need to be violated in order to sustain a valid mail fraud prosecution. The pre-McNally cases and McNally itself answers that because, in the McNally decision, this Court acknowledged that the government's theory of prosecution was that McNally and his cohorts were accepting kickbacks in the form of commissions on insurance contracts. And the courts recognized that the government's theory was they failed to disclose their interest to persons in State government who were in a position to take action with respect to that information. And the Court specifically said: We should assume that there was no violation of any State law obligations in holding those interests or no violation of any State law duty to disclose. That was the theory of prosecution that the Court recognized the government was pursuing, and it was entirely consistent with the pre-McNally cases, Mandel and Margiotta, which were repeatedly cited in the legislative history. And I won't take the Court's time to read language -- we’ve cited it in our brief -- where those cases clearly said no State law duty was required to be breached in order to state a prosecution. There is still protection in this statute against prosecutions of citizens without notice because, as I said earlier, the government has to prove a violation of the duty to disclose by the officials taking action to further his undisclosed personal interest, and the citizen cannot be prosecuted and convicted without the government being able to show that he knew that he was violating a duty to disclose.",
  "Justice Breyer, until Mr. Skilling files his brief and explains the kind of argument that he wants to make, I can't answer you that question. All I know is that in one of --",
  "Certainly. And I don't –- the government is not shying away from the question of vagueness. The question of vagueness has been raised by members of this Court as a legitimate concern. I think it's a legitimate concern. That is why the government has offered to this Court a theory based on the prototypical and paradigm pre-McNally cases that explains what Congress said when it effectively pointed at that body of law and said those are the intangible rights that we want to protect.",
  "It doesn't have to be quid pro quo, Justice Stevens, because even if Mr. Weyhrauch had not made an agreement with VECO that he was going to vote the way that VECO wanted him to, and the government does allege that, but even if he didn't do that, he knew that he had a personal financial interest in securing employment with VECO.",
  "He has to take official action. That's where the breach of his duty and loyalty –-",
  "Official action that furthers his undisclosed interest. And to criminally prosecute him, he has to know that’s what he is doing, and just to top it off, there are materiality ingredients both in the conflict of interest and in the implied misrepresentation of --",
  "Substantive State law prohibited him from taking official action with respect to a company whose interests would be benefited when he was negotiating employment --",
  "It’s accepted Justice Scalia that there’s no duty to disclose under State law.",
  "That is solely what Petitioner argues as being the deficiency in the government's case; there’s no State law duty to disclose.",
  "My response is naturally there’s no duty under State law to disclose as a matter of express State law.",
  "State laws prohibit --",
  "He's supposed to abstain. When he has a conflict of interest, he is supposed to note that conflict and he's supposed to abstain. And we argued --",
  "That's not the sort of theory of honest services that we're arguing for, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "A personal, conflicting financial interest. It may involve --",
  "That's right.",
  "That's right. These -- the core of public corruption is about adverse pecuniary interests or benefits that an official is taking at the expense of the citizenry by virtue of his position.",
  "I think it says it, Mr. Chief Justice, by looking at the body of case law that involved violations of the right of honest services and seeing that that's what the government was after, personal conflicting financial interests. And this is not a subtle or obscure principle of fiduciary law -- if I might finish my last sentence.",
  "This is a bedrock principle of the common law that exists in all 50 States, and the mistake that the lower courts made in the pre-McNally era was in thinking that the mail fraud statute protected it, but there was no obscurity whatever that the fiduciaries owe an obligation of undivided loyalty to their principal. That's what this statute is about.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The Petitioner today has sought to present a question to this Court that he chose not to include in his questions presented, whether the statute is unconstitutionally vague in all of its applications. What he did present in his question presented to this Court is whether there is an element of contemplated economic harm inherent in the concept of fraud in Section 1341, so that any honest services prosecution must show contemplated or foreseeable economic harm in order to be sustained.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia - -",
  "Maybe you should wait for a Petitioner who presents the question, rather than granting relief to a Petitioner who chose not to raise the constitutional issue in this Court - -",
  "Well - -",
  "I think that the Court should reach that issue, the issue whether there is contemplated economic harm as a requirement for the statute, and the government briefed that issue, and I disagree with Petitioner that contemplated economic harm is either an element of the statute or necessary to save its constitutionality.",
  "What this statute is, Justice Kennedy, is Congress's effort to reinstate the body of law that this Court held was not a valid construction of the mail fraud statute.",
  "If the Court wished to address the constitutionality of the statute, the government would brief it more fully, including by making the points that - -",
  "The Skilling case raises the question of whether if this Court does not interpret - -",

  "That's probably a fair characterization of language in his brief, but it does bear note that he never asked this Court to decide that question. Now, the question that is before the Court, and I think it will illuminate the vagueness concerns that are on the Justice's minds, is: What does the statute mean? And the way to understand this statute is to recognize that when this Court held in McNally that the mail fraud statute did not protect intangible rights, Congress came back in response to this Court's invitation and said: Yes, it does; it protects the intangible right of honest services which had assumed the status of a term of art in - -",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I think the description of the lower courts as massively confused is not correct. It's not a fair description of the cases.",
  "All of the lower courts used essential synonyms for what Congress sought to reinstate. They refer to the right of honest services, faithful and honest services, loyal and honest services, and they were talking about one thing: Divided loyalties of an agent or a fiduciary.",
  "Justice Breyer, I hope you give me a moment to explain my theory of the statute in response to your question. The statute covers bribes, kickbacks, and undisclosed conflicts of interest by an agent or fiduciary who takes action to further that interest. These were well-recognized categories of honest services violations. Virtually every circuit that examined the pre-McNally case law said these are the prototypical cases. Bribes, kickbacks, undisclosed conflicts of interest by an agent or fiduciary who takes action to further that interest. These are not - -",
  "Legal, Your Honor.",
  "Let me make two points in response to that, Mr. Chief Justice. The obligation under 1346 is a Federal obligation. Congress, by reinstating this body of law, by virtue of 1346, created a Federal obligation that is not dependent on State law. And I think we will address this more in the Weyhrauch case, where that issue is specifically presented, but it should not be understood as a State law obligation. Second, the core - -",

The employee is not exercising the official powers of his office or job, and that is what was critical.",
  "He is still not exercising the powers of his company, he is off on a frolic and detour. What the pre-McNally cases were looking at were agents who - -",
  "It is related to it, Justice Ginsburg, in that in a business setting materiality will be in most cases coextensive with economic harm at least if economic harm is conceived as I conceive it, and as the cases have conceived of it as extending to things like harm to reputation that will interfere with a business's ability to go forward.",
  "Justice Scalia - -",
  "Fraud.",
  "In -- the first line of response to this, Justice Scalia, is that these are all -- what you are describing are all money or property frauds that could be charged if the government so chose so long as the mails or the wires were involved. The mail fraud statute doesn't by itself carve out de minimus frauds. The concept of materiality, though, in my concept of the divided loyalties that lies at the heart of honest services fraud, includes in itself the concept of an undisclosed interest that is important in some way, because the obligation of the employee, the agent, the fiduciary, the company executive, the politician who has been elected to office, is defined by a bedrock substratum of fiduciary duties that are universally recognized in the common law, that were - -",

He - -",
  "The right refers, Mr. Chief Justice, to the acknowledgment that there was a common law fiduciary duty that was assimilated into the law of fraud, really, beyond dispute. I haven't understood - -",
  "No, it certainly is not, Mr. Chief Justice. Congress intended to basically say to this Court, you have determined that intangible rights are not protected under the mail fraud statute. Only money or property is. Congress desired to correct the statute by protecting frauds that involve intangible rights, and it did that by using a term of art that was replete throughout the legislative debates, for those who read them, as referring to the same core body of cases that we rely on here. And those cases -- any -- any legal rule will have cases at the margins, in which reasonable jurists will debate whether - -",
  "There was a larger body of public sector cases. There was a very substantial body of private sector cases, many of which were cited in Your Honor's dissent in the McNally case. And those cases, I think, as Mr. -- the Chief Justice indicated earlier, contained, but a single opinion, the Lemire opinion from the D.C. circuit, that talked about contemplated economic harm. Petitioner seeks to assimilate that, somehow, into the notion of an intent to defraud that he says was inherent in the mail fraud statute everywhere and always before McNally. But if he seriously believes in that theory, then he would have to say that a -- an intangible rights defendant would have to contemplate economic harm, foresee economic harm in any intangible rights case, which would knock out, immediately, many of the critical pre-McNally public official cases, in which a legislator takes a bribe for action that doesn't implicate the pecuniary interests of the holder or the fiduciary duty or in which a union official accepts payment for someone who wants to apply for membership. Membership fees are fixed. It's not as if the union is losing money. And it's really inconceivable that Congress would have passed a statute to say, we don't want this law to be limited to property rights. And somehow, through the back door, smuggle in the same test of contemplated economic harm. What the right way to handle this issue is -- is to look at it under the rubric of materiality because materiality is flexible. It considers what the rights are of the particular fiduciary - -",
  "But the point, Justice Breyer, is - -",
  "-- that materiality would function much like the Petitioner's contemplated economic harm requirement in private sector, private enterprise cases.",
  "No, not immediately, because there needs to be an intent to defraud, which includes -- Mr. Chief Justice, if I might finish.",
  "-- which includes knowledge of the legal duty that the employee is violating and will include materiality. And these are the issues that screen conflicts and prosecutions in a variety of public corruption type cases, and across the board economic harm requirement, which I understood today Petitioner to disavow would devastate the application statute in its core areas of public corruption cases.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Judge Lake approached this case with the question of how to select a jury, he had 15 years of experience in selecting juries, and he informed the parties that it was his experience that voir dire conducted by the trial judge is more effective at eliciting the potential biases of a juror than the oftentimes tendentious voir dire that’s conducted by the parties. He did not ignore the fact that the Enron collapse had a significant impact on the Houston community. He worked with the parties to develop a 14- page questionnaire, which I encourage the Court to look at, if the Court has not already done so. It's extraordinarily detailed. It has more than 70 questions designed to ferret out any possible connections between the individual jurors and the Enron collapse. It asked for their views about the Enron collapse. It asked for whether --",
  "Judge -- Justice Sotomayor, I’m not familiar with the length of voir dire in particular cases. But I think that there is no --",
  "No, I’m not aware of any, but I don't think that there is any problem with this voir dire, and I think there is really --",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I think that there was a fair trial in this case, and I think that a full reading of the voir dire reveals that individuals sitting from this vantage point with a cold record who were not there may have different viewpoints about --",
  "I don't think that there’s any per se disqualification. But even if there was, that juror did not sit, and this Court held in United States v. Martinez-Salazar that one of the purposes of peremptories is to protect against the occasional accidental error.",
  "Well, none sat in this case. I don't think there is any claim that they did.",
  "I don't think that a -- what this Court may perceive as an error in the denial of one for-cause challenge --",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I think that reading the entire voir dire reflects that the judge was interested in determining whether these jurors were qualified to sit. He was not interested in having the voir dire used as a lobbying or a argumentative exercise by the lawyers. And as a result, he relied on the very extensive questionnaires to pinpoint the examples of areas in which further questioning was necessary. And then he went and he, I think, did fairly allow sufficient inquiry into whether these jurors could sit. And I think one of the best examples of that is actually juror number 63, who Petitioner says was not properly voir-dired. And I think what juror number 63 illustrates -- and this is in the Joint Appendix at page 935a and then following -- is that, as this Court has remarked many times, the question of --",
  "935a. This is in volume 2 of the Joint Appendix.",
  "They did not challenge 63 for cause, but they -- but they came to this Court today and tried to use 63 as an object lesson of what was wrong with the voir dire. I actually think juror 63 illustrates not only what was right with the voir dire, but the immense distortion that Petitioners have attempted to perpetrate by putting together effectively a highlight reel of every bad headline in every Houston publication and claiming that the entire jurisdiction, all 4.5 million people virtually, were infected with some sort of a pervasive prejudice that could not be ferreted out in voir dire. If you look at what happened in juror number 63, she happens to be a 24-year-old who comes to court. She filled out a questionnaire that she said: I can be impartial. She did have the statement: I -- I think that probably Skilling is guilty of some crime. When the voir dire proceeds, it turns out that she's not one of these jurors who has been in the Houston culture pervasively exposed to what Petitioner says is prejudicial publicity. She was living in Austin at the time, going to school. Then she's asked, “Are you watching major networks?” And she says, “No, I don't really watch the news at all. I'm a turtle person.” “Do you recall anything that may have -- you've seen -- that you may have seen or heard on television about this case?” “No.” And then the judge, after some more questioning about her that reveals that, among other things, Ken Lay is a member of the country club that her parents belong to, he asks her about the very question that Petitioners focus on as problematic: “Do you have any opinion about the guilt or innocence -- and you say, I think they probably were breaking the law?” And her answer is: \"I don't know. The only thing I can say is, anything I've ever heard even peripherally has not been, you know -- but that's what people say and, I mean, it's hard to know. People don't know what they are talking about.\" to find out what you think.” She says, \"I don't have an opinion either way.\"",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, this Court has recognized -- and it has recognized this as long ago as Chief Justice Marshall in the Burr case -- that people come to court with opinions in highly publicized cases. We expect our jurors to be somewhat informed of civic affairs. They receive information through the media or through their friends, and they have light opinions. And they come to court, and the trial judge instructs them: This is a legal proceeding; you’re going to hear evidence in court. What happened outside of the courtroom no longer matters. What matters is what has been presented in here. I'm going to instruct you that defendants have a presumption of innocence. Can you follow that? And then the judge is the only person on the scene. We're not there, the court of appeals is not there; the judge is the only person on the scene to judge the jurors' inflection, the jurors' demeanor, the jurors' apprehension of the seriousness of the duty. And this Court has held that the standard for review of a determination of no removable bias for cause is manifest error.",
  "They were not --",
  "That's correct, Justice Kennedy. This was not a case like Mu'Min, where in your concurrence -- your dissent, you pointed out that the colloquy occurred in the full presence of the -- of every other juror, and there was no individualized voir dire. Here there was individualized voir dire. Judge Lake had that juror right in front of him, eyeball to eyeball, and was able to make the kind of credibility assessment, taking into account all of the context, that no other judge can do. And it's not to say that there’s no judicial review of that on appeal. In the Irvin case, Irvin v. Dowd, which is really the Court's first case in this line, the Court noticed that there -- 90 percent of the jurors had an opinion that the defendant was guilty. It involved a highly sensationalized murder in rural counties in southern Indiana. There was a barrage of pretrial publicity. Eight of the 12 jurors said they had an opinion that the defendant was guilty. The Court, after meticulously reviewing the voir dire, concluded that the judge had committed manifest error in accepting the representations of the jurors that they could be impartial. But this is nothing like that.",
  "I think that what Judge --",
  "I -- I think that's not necessarily correct at all, and it would not have been the case that in a normal trial there would have been as detailed a 14-page questionnaire as there was in this case, that was designed to elicit any and all connections to Enron. Now, whether there may have been some individualized mistakes along the way, whether some of us would have preferred that the voir dire be more extensive, is not the issue; and unless this Court is prepared to set standards that are based either on a stopwatch or some sort of, you know, notion of how many days voir dire has to occur, it's going to be very difficult to administer a standard that says this was too little. The Oklahoma City bombing case, it is true, took many, many days, but that was a capital case, and I know that this Court is well familiar that there are numerous --",
  "It did, and Denver itself was exposed, probably almost as much as Oklahoma City, to the pretrial publicity, and a terrorist act of that magnitude, Mr. Chief Justice, really strikes at the heart of the entire nation. Judge Matsch, who sits in Denver --",
  "Agreed. It was 168 deaths. Many of them were children. There was a sense of -- of victimization in the part of the community that I don't think is comparable to what happened with a financial meltdown in Houston, a 4.5 million city with a robust economy and a trial that took place 4 years later, after numerous other Enron trials had already taken place in Houston, resulting in favorable verdicts for defendants, mistrials, acquittals of one defendant. This very trial itself of Mr. Skilling resulted in nine acquittals on insider trading counts. Now, if you would think that the jury had some sort of a substratum of subterranean bias that was ineradicable by the conventional techniques of voir dire that we have been using for 200 years, then insider trading where the defendant pockets personally, as a result of the exploitation of insider information -- you would think that would be the first place the jurors would go to vent --",
  "I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, because the honest services component actually, and the component of this trial, was really a subset of the securities fraud. The essential gravamen of Petitioner's crimes were lying to Enron, lying to its shareholders about the health of the company in a financial sense, when, in fact, he knew that he had been engaging in numerous manipulations of earnings and schemes that are detailed in the briefs, in order to avoid Enron having to recognize that portions of its business were imploding. And the victimization was of shareholders. That was expressed through securities fraud; it was expressed through insider trading. There were counts involving liars -- lying to auditors, and one object of a multi-count conspiracy charge involved an honest services object as well as a money or property fraud object, and as well as a securities fraud object. Now, in our view Petitioner has essentially conceded that the honest services statute is not vague as applied and, therefore, facially unconstitutional. He all but acknowledges that bribes and kickbacks, which constitute the bulk of pre-McNally honest services cases, can be defined with precision. There is not an unconstitutional vagueness in it. And so I think at a minimum --",
  "I don't think that in this case, Justice Kennedy, the Court needs to rewrite the statute so much as to recognize that what happened in McNally was this Court said that the mail fraud statute has two clauses, scheme to defraud and scheme for obtaining money or property by false representations and pretenses. The government's position, in accordance with all of the lower courts, was that these two clauses set forth two separate crimes. Scheme to defraud was not limited to money or property. This Court disagreed, and it said, oh, yes, it was. invoke words that had appeared in this Court's decision in McNally, in the dissent written by Justice Stevens, in the lower court opinions, and intentionally -- as this Court put it in Cleveland v. United States -- cover one of the intangible rights that the lower courts had recognized before McNally, and that was the right to -- intangible",
  "No, Justice Scalia, but --",
  "But this is not like a statute, Justice Scalia, that says prohibiting any bad thing. It's a statute that responded to a decision of this Court in which a term of art, the intangible right of honest services, featured prominently. And Congress has --",
  "I think that there was a solid enough content for this Court to be able to respond to the McNally decision by giving shape to the crime in accordance with the paradigm cases that the lower courts had done and logical implications of those cases, just as if it had concluded, in accordance with Justice Stevens's dissent, that the statute did protect intangible rights in the phrase “scheme to defraud.”",
  "I think it's a term of art in the sense that it referred to a -- a body of law that until quite recently, when defendants began making vagueness arguments, was understood to refer to the kinds of schemes that had been prosecuted before this Court held that \"scheme to defraud\" was limited to money or property. And it --",
  "I think it's clear enough at the core, this Court can say so and can provide definition, and it can use its standard tools of interpretation of criminal statutes to dispose of cases that are at the periphery and ensure that there is --",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think it puts a defendant in a very bad position at all, because this statute is only triggered when there's an intent to deceive, an intentional fraudulent act taken to deprive the victim of whatever right exists in question.",
  "Well, the jury instruction, Justice Ginsburg, appears on page 1086a of the Joint Appendix. That’s in volume 3 of the Joint Appendix. And I will describe the jury instruction, too, but I want to say at the outset that this jury instruction was drafted against the background of Fifth Circuit law, which I think did take a somewhat broader view of the honest services crime than the government has taken in this Court, and it has to be read against that background. But the -- the instruction said that “to show that defendants deprived Enron and its shareholders of their right of honest services, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that, in rendering some particular service or services, the defendant knew that his actions were not in the best interests of Enron and its shareholders or that he consciously contemplated or intended such actions, and that Enron and its shareholders suffered a detriment from the defendant's breach of his duty to render honest services.” So -- and this was against a background --",
  "The -- I would agree, Justice Scalia. I’ve read this phrase many times, and it does seem a little circular to me. The introduction to this jury instruction says, \"Honest services are the services required by the defendant's fiduciary duty to Enron and its shareholders under State law.\" So this was tried in a circuit that followed the State law government defined the fiduciary duty in that way. But the essence of the fraud was that -- that Petitioner had a fiduciary duty to the shareholders of Enron to act in their best interests, and he betrayed that by acting contrary to the best interests of the shareholders, fraudulently upholding the price, and ultimately that constituted the crime. Now, I think there's a --",
  "Well, whether the employee had a fiduciary duty in that respect would be, I think, quite a litigable question. This case doesn't involve any subtle or arcane fiduciary duty. This is one of the basic fiduciary duties that any chief executive has, not to lie to shareholders about the financial condition of the company.",
  "Not all employees are fiduciaries, no, Justice Scalia. I mean, most fiduciaries have a sort of heightened duty towards the --",
  "I think that it's inherent in that --",
  "Well --",
  "I think, Justice Scalia, that you cannot successfully attempt to understand Congress's reaction to this Court's decision in McNally without some cognizance of the McNally decision and the preexisting law.",
  "That would be a standard agency law principle, Justice Kennedy, and --",
  "Normally, Justice Kennedy, no such complexities are necessary, and I think that this Court can resolve this case without introducing such complexities, because the core duties of loyalty that have formed the core of the honest services prosecutions are universal. They are equally applicable to agency.",
  "But that's not an honest services case. The honest services cases are about conflicting interests and the misuse of official position. I'm not even sure, in the personal computer use case, that the government could successfully show that the employee had misused his official position. This case is quite typical in that respect. Petitioner absolutely misused his official position to serve what we say was his private interest in private gain.",
  "There were not to my knowledge, Justice Alito, and I would frankly acknowledge that this case is a logical extension of the basic principle that we have urged the Court to adopt in the nondisclosure cases. And the Court can evaluate whether it believes that that is legitimately within the scope of an honest services violation or not. But it should not obscure our fundamental submission, which is that there was a definable category of undisclosed conflict of interest cases, that a person furthered through his official actions that constituted honest services fraud. A good example of that is United States v. Keane, which was a Seventh Circuit decision. Petitioner, in his reply brief, claims that Keane involved financial injury to Chicago as a result of an alderman's concealment of his interest in properties that the City was selling. Actually there were three separate schemes in Keane. In one of them, the court was quite clear that, even though the alderman got the same deal that every member of the public would have gotten, it still was honest services fraud because he did not disclose his financial interest in that property to the council when the council was voting on it.",
  "It may well be, Justice Sotomayor. It depends, I think, on whether the tax break was something that basically all general members of the public were in a position to benefit from, which may well be the case if it's just a private residence, versus if it's a particularized business property interest that you have either acquired --",
  "I think in the first instance, you will inevitably, as a councilperson, turn to your local law. And I think this brings up an important point that was discussed in the Weyhrauch decision, which is that the mail fraud statute does not criminalize breaches of duty without more. There has to be a showing of scienter, of a mens rea element of intent to deceive. And unless the government can point to something which shows that the individual knew that they had a duty to disclose and did not do that --",
  "-- or -- if I could just finish this part of the answer -- or can point to circumvention-type activity, using of shell companies to conceal an interest, then the government is not going to be able to have an indictable case on honest services fraud. And I think what --",
  "But this Court has recognized in numerous cases, Justice Scalia, that a mens rea element requiring an intent to deceive, an intent to violate the law, is exactly what helps prevent statutes that might otherwise be considered too vague from falling --",
  "I'm not saying that, Justice Breyer.",
  "I'm saying that in the ordinary case --",
  "Well, I think that what happens, Justice Breyer, is that unless the government does have some sort of legal platform like that to show that there was knowledge of a duty, it's not possible for the government to bring its proof to the court and establish that the individual acted with the requisite mens rea, unless there is activity that reveals an intent to circumvent the law and to withhold the information, as in Justice Sotomayor's example, information about a property interest that might well affect the deliberations of the council. And that kind of evidence often requires use of offshore accounts --",
  "I don’t see any of those --",
  "Justice Breyer, I think if you look at the cases in which this has happened, there is -- there’s not like a deliberation on somebody's part -- oh, do I have to disclose or not disclose? What these cases are, are really outright criminal conduct in the form of conflicting interests that every fiduciary knows you need to disclose this before you take official action to further that interest. That --",
  "It involves the sale of shares as well. That was part of the compensation, and it’s linked to it. But, Justice Ginsburg, if you look at the government's opening statement in this case, the government opened by saying, “You will see that defendants Lay and Skilling knew few -- a few key facts about the true condition of Enron, facts that the investing public did not know. With that information, defendants Lay and Skilling sold tens of millions of dollars of their own Enron stock.” And then continued: “When an investor buys a share of stock, an investor buys some rights in a publicly traded company. When an investor buys a share of stock, they buy the right to hear and receive truth from the chief executive officer. And, importantly, they buy the right to have their interests placed ahead of the chief executor officer every day of the week.” So there was, baked into this case at the outset, the notion that these officials were not acting in the best interests of the shareholders. They were furthering their own interests by maintaining a high stock price so that they could profit from it. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As Petitioner confirmed this morning, the central claim that he is making about the unconstitutionality of section 229 is that it exceeds Congress's enumerated powers. He may wish to raise as part of that claim a argument that it invades the province that belongs to the States concerning criminal law. He can do that. He has the authority to make such a challenge. The Third Circuit erred in holding to the contrary. Now, the Third Circuit in reaching the contrary conclusion relied on this Court's decision in Tennessee Electric v. TVA, and we think that the court of appeals misread that case in concluding that it barred standing, not because it lacks a holding that does bar standing of certain types of claims that allege an invasion of State sovereignty, but because the kind of claim that Petitioner is making is not a Tenth Amendment reserved rights claim, but instead an enumerated powers claim.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that the defendant needs to be put in any trouble in this case because the kind of claim that counsel is making on her behalf does assert her right not to be subject to criminal punishment under a law that he says, counsel says, Congress lacks the authority to enact.",
  "It falls into the enumerated powers category, Justice Alito, just as last term in United States v. Comstock one of the elements that this Court looked at when it decided whether the law authorizing civil commitment in that case was within Congress's enumerated authority plus the Necessary and Proper Clause, the Court looked at the extent to which the law accommodated State interests or, alternatively, invaded them in an unlawful manner, which is what Mr. Comstock had alleged in that case.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, I -- I don't take issue with almost everything that you said. The structural protections of the Constitution can be enforced by individuals under the cases that you have cited. What we are dealing with here is two things. First of all, a statement that this Court made in TVA that was part of its holding, addressed to what the Court perceived as an attack based on a specific aspect of State sovereignty that belonged to the States. Now, today, we might not understand the claim that was made in that case as implicating a specific sovereign right that's protected under the Tenth Amendment. Today we might look at it and say this is nothing other than a conventional preemption claim.",
  "That may be, Justice Alito. I think that it's a little bit difficult to parse precisely what the Petitioner in Tennessee Electric was arguing, but this Court understood the claim as one that -- that bore on Federal regulation of purely local matters in a matter that regulated the internal affairs of the State; and I agree with you that today we might not view that as a Tenth Amendment-specific claim, but this Court did in 1939.",
  "Justice Breyer -­",
  "I understand that, Justice Breyer.",
  "Well I think if you intrude today's analytical model -­",
  "-- under today's jurisprudence, that is how the case would be viewed. But it was not how it was viewed at the time of TVA.",
  "The language from the sentence, Justice Breyer, that you in fact read -­",
  "-- discussing whether the presence or absence of a State objection mattered, the Court said: As we've seen there's no objection from the State, and if this were not so the appellants, absent the States or their officers, have no standing to raise any objection under the amendment.",
  "That is not an anti­ commandeering claim. That is the kind of claim that today we would conceptualize as an enumerated powers claim.",
  "This will take me back to -­ to Justice Kennedy's question, because I wanted to answer the part that I thought distinguished a commandeering case from what Justice Kennedy was talking about. And the point is best made in the context of an example. Under the Sex Offender Registration Act, defendants have challenged the law on numerous grounds, including, number one, Congress lacks its constitutional authority under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause to criminalize the individual registration requirement imposed on them. All courts that have addressed that have said that's a claim that's within the cognizance of a defendant to bring. Defendants have also said the SORNA statute violates Federal law because it requires States to accept sex offender registrations. It commandeers the States into requiring them to set up a sex offender database.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, this is the absolutely crucial point that distinguishes commandeering from most of the structural constitutional provisions that we've been discussing this morning. A State can choose to establish a sex offender database and to receive registrations from people who are required to register under Federal law; and invalidating a Federal law that commanded them to do that does not deprive the State of its ability to say, we want to have, in our autonomous sovereign interest, a sex offender database that will receive these applications, and as a result -­",
  "That's correct.",
  "There -- the reason why in that hypothetical the defendant should not raise the issue is because there will be no violation -­",
  "You could say that, Justice Kagan, but I think that part of the enduring force of TVA is that it adopted a third-party standing rule that is still part of this Court's jurisprudence.",
  "Well, the Court did say that there was no standing on the grounds that when the specific argument was made, this takes away the right of the State to regulate because the Federal Government is regulating.",
  "That is a major factor in third-party standing generally, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "They can do that. Justice Kennedy, there's nothing -­",
  "No, Justice Kennedy. But a State in its sovereign decisionmaking process can elect to participate in a Federal program. At least, that was what Justice O'Connor said in her concurrence in Printz.",
  "That is a perfectly acceptable route of analysis.",
  "Well, I don't think they're different, Justice Scalia. They both concern who holds the right and whether there's any redressability -­",
  "I think, Justice Scalia, that all the Government is doing in this case is applying conventional standing principles of redressability and third-party standing in a specific context, which as Mr. Clement has made clear, is not before the Court today. This is not a commandeering case. That happens to be the only specific aspect of a State sovereignty claim that is distinct from an enumerated powers claim that the Court has recognized in recent decades. Whether some other sort of claim of State sovereignty might some day be recognized and require its own analysis is well beyond the scope of this case. Our point is a much more basic one. We agree with Petitioner's counsel that he can raise the claim that he has tried to raise. We think that the Third Circuit misunderstood what the TVA decision purported to say when it rejected standing for a type of State sovereignty claim. And we think that the currently recognized State sovereignty claim of commandeering fits into the description of the analytical category that was addressed in TVA.",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor, I believe that the statute is valid under either the Treaty Clause plus the Necessary and Proper Clause analysis under Missouri v. Holland. It also can be sustained in our view under the Commerce Clause, which follows directly from what this Court said in Raich when the Court said that the intrastate regulation of a commodity that's used in commerce is a customary, typical method that Congress utilizes. It gave as examples of that the nuclear, biological, and plastic explosives statutes which were enacted to implement treaty obligations of the United States.",
  "I'm not sure, Justice Alito. I will assume with you that it is. The statute -­",
  "I'm not sure that vinegar is a chemical weapon.",
  "I'm willing to make the assumption with you and accept that it is a broad-reaching statute, but it was adopted as a broad-reaching statute because this is an area, like the medical marijuana instance in Raich, where effective control of the interstate market requires control of an intrastate market. The statute exempts peaceful uses for agricultural and pharmaceutical purposes of these chemicals, it has other exemptions as well. It was intended to be a comprehensive ban that implemented the United States treaty obligations to eliminate the use of chemical weapons both in military instances and in terrorism, and -­",
  "Well, I think it's pretty well recognized, Justice Alito, that when Congress seeks to regulate an interstate market as to which there cannot be any question under the Commerce Clause Congress could do, it can control the interstate market as necessary in order to assure that its prohibition is effective.",
  "No, of course not.",
  "A lot further than I had intended, Justice Ginsburg. The merits of the case, though, involve both a Commerce Clause argument, a treaty-based argument. As far as the standing principles go, I don't think that there is any difference between them. Missouri v. Holland was a case in which this Court adjudicated whether a law exceeded Congress's enumerated authority. It did that at the behest of a State, but there is no reason why under cases like Lopez and Sabri and Perez that an enumerated powers argument is in any way off limits to a criminal defendant. It's not. If this case does go back down to the Third Circuit, a petitioner can make the argument that this law exceeds the enumerated powers. We can rely on the Treaty Clause. It doesn't affect standing in any way. I think that the amicus in support of the judgment makes the assumption that because Missouri v. Holland is good law, there's no possible claim that Petitioner can make that the law would exceed Congress's enumerated authority. Therefore, the amicus says this must be some sort of a special State sovereignty claim of a genre that looks like commandeering, perhaps not articulated quite light that. We don't understand Petitioner to be making that argument. I think Petitioner confirmed today that's not what she's trying to do, and there is no Tenth Amendment claim based on a specific aspect of State sovereignty that Petitioner has ever made. In fact, if you look at Petitioner's brief in support of the rehearing petition, Petitioner said the Tenth Amendment argument raised by Bond was not critical to Bond's other constitutional challenges. It is ancillary to Bond's main argument that Congress acted outside of its enumerated powers. I think that's a correct understanding of what Petitioner has sought to argue in the court below. In our view, she is entitled to make that argument. That argument should also fail on the merits, but that is not an issue that this Court granted certiorari to decide.",
  "Well, as Justice Alito pointed out, the Court has indicated that moving a State capital, a direction to move the State capital, might be an intrusion on sovereignty.",
  "Highly unlikely.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Because the exclusionary rule has severe consequences for the truth-seeking function of a criminal trial, this Court has restricted its application to those situations in which it's necessary to further the deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule, namely to shape police conduct. The Court has repeatedly rejected efforts to expand the exclusionary rule to serve other purposes, such as schooling judges who issue warrants on the need to respect the Fourth Amendment, reminding legislatures about their obligations under the Fourth Amendment, and for other purposes such as to preserve judicial integrity.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, let me give two responses to that. First of all, the rule that the Eleventh Circuit adopted in this case, and that is the only rule before the Court, involves a situation in which there is binding appellant precedent that instructs the officer, tells the officer, what you're about to do complies with the Fourth Amendment. The state of the law in Arizona would not necessarily have risen to that level, in light of the dissonance in that court's opinions, in the Arizona Supreme Court opinions, about the reach and scope of Belton. So the question about whether the rule that we're urging here would have applied in Arizona is a separate question from the one that the Eleventh Circuit resolved.",
  "Gant obtained relief. This Court granted certiorari in Gant limited to the Fourth Amendment question, and Arizona never raised any good faith exception to the exclusionary rule in that case, so the Court did not address the good faith issue.",
  "The logic of our position would be that, to the extent that Gant was seeking Belton to be overruled, he would not be able to impugn the actions of the officers who relied on it. To the extent that he was doing what he actually did do and which this Court's opinion in Gant accepted, which is to say that the Gant opinion, that the Belton opinion did not resolve the fact pattern in Gant, he would not be automatically governed by the good faith exception. And as a result, Gant is really the best illustration of how unusual it is for a lawyer to come to this Court and say, please outright overrule a Fourth Amendment decision.",
  "Yes, Justice Kagan, I believe the Court could grant that petition, although it's highly likely that any criminal defendant who filed it would couple it with a claim that this Court should either reverse, modify, or limit any holding that came out.",
  "Certainly the Court would have Article III authority, because it's always free to limit, modify or abrogate one of its precedents, including a holding, if one issued from this decision, that the good faith rule applies when the Court overrules its decision. Litigants can all the time be faced with impossible arguments under existing precedent, but that doesn't preclude this Court's Article III jurisdiction to adjudicate challenges to that precedent. That's indeed the very premise of Petitioner's argument.",
  "That's correct, Justice Scalia, and I think it illustrates why there is no Article III impediment. Now, this Court may prudentially be reluctant to take a case in which it knows that its resolution of the Fourth Amendment issue would not dictate a reversal of the judgment, even if the Fourth Amendment issue went in favor of the defendant, but it is not that dissimilar from the situation in qualified immunity, when there is no law on the books that governs an issue and a petitioner asks the Court to resolve the Fourth Amendment issue.",
  "It would be remote, but not zero.",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor, we're not kind -- trying to come in through the back door with qualified immunity as a standard in this case. If we ever were to urge that, it would be through the front door. We would make the argument overtly. This case doesn't involve that issue. Judge Kravitch's opinion for the Eleventh Circuit very carefully distinguished between cases in which governing precedent instructed the officers, your conduct is lawful if you do this, from cases in which the law is unclear and there is no governing precedent.",
  "Not directly under the exclusionary rule. United States v. Peltier considered the factors that now go into the good faith exception under the rubric of then-prevailing retroactivity law.",
  "Not returning to Linkletter, Justice Sotomayor, because Linkletter was an across-the-board rule that said that this Court had the authority to render -­",
  "Before -­",
  "That's true, but that's a direct consequence of the logic of the good faith exception itself; and the considerations that had informed this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence in the Peltier decision were taken out of the law of retroactivity when the Court decided Griffith v. Kentucky; but those same considerations became relevant to the good faith exception, which is tied to the question of whether there is a need to deter police misconduct because the police have disregarded the governing law.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I think nine of the people who will understand it are on this Court.",
  "I'm an optimist.",
  "The principle is very straightforward. The principle is that the exclusionary rule applies only when it can deter police misconduct. When police rely on a warrant issued by a magistrate, a statute or a judicial decision issued by a court of appeals that governs their conduct, they are not making a decision about what the Fourth Amendment requires. They are following a different actor in the system, and this Court has held that there is no deterrent value to suppress evidence with an important cost to the truth-seeking function of the criminal trial, which is why, even if it makes for a simpler rule, the Court does not automatically suppress evidence just to achieve simplicity. It does -­",
  "It would be an extremely simple system.",
  "Not in this case, because this case represents only an application of existing doctrine in the Court with respect to the purposes of the exclusionary rule.",
  "The defendant in these cases is not the object of the Court's protection. I think, as Justice Kagan's question made clear, the exclusionary rule is not a personal individual right. It's not a constitutional right at all. It is a remedy that this Court has devised, not to protect the defendant's interests as such. The Fourth Amendment violation has happened out of court. It cannot be repaired. The purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future conduct by other counterparts of that police officer or the police officer himself, so that when he confronts the situation in the future he will be more solicitous of Fourth Amendment rights.",
  "Justice Sotomayor, we don't expect police officers to attempt to define the content of the Fourth Amendment on their own. They are recipients of the status of the law from the courts that govern their activities; training programs will be instituted based on that law. I'm sure that careful training programs will advise officers that there may be some legal risk if there's a circuit split, and that a decision may ultimately be reversed; but we don't expect police departments to try to make the Fourth Amendment decision on their own. And there's some sound -­",
  "Well -­",
  "Yes, but the reason that the Fourth Amendment balance has been struck in any given way in a particular court is because that is felt to be the reasonable way for officers to operate. In other words -­",
  "Justice Scalia, that's exactly right. The officers are seeking to protect the public interest, and by not taking advantage of decisions in their circuits that explain that certain behavior is reasonable, they can be putting the public interest at risk by relinquishing procedures that have been held to comply with the Fourth Amendment and yet allow the police to solve crime or to arrest suspects. Now, there's been a lot of discussion in Petitioner's argument about the need to provide an incentive to counsel to raise Fourth Amendment challenges to existing precedent. I think it's useful at the outset to look a little bit empirically at that question, because some members of the Court have expressed concern about that possibility. From as best as I can tell, this Court has not overruled one of its Fourth Amendment precedents in a manner that favored defendants' interests since 1969. Despite whatever incentives may have existed as a result of the exclusionary rule, defendants will typically understand that stare decisis is the normal course that this Court follows, and as a result, they are highly likely to structure their arguments in a manner that will seek to distinguish, limit, or undermine a precedent rather than calling for its outright overruling.",
  "No, Justice Alito, there is nothing to prevent this Court from inventing that exception. That exception would serve the purpose of encouraging litigants to ask the Court to overrule its decisions and thereby to receive a benefit when they do so. If it's limited to the first individual who actually succeeds in that endeavor, it would limit the costs of the exclusionary rule, which, after all, result in the exclusion of reliable probative evidence of guilt in every case where it's applied. And the Court could tailor the exclusionary rule in that manner. If it did so, it would certainly minimize the costs, and it would represent the least amount of intrusion on the purposes of the exclusionary rule. But I would caution the Court in this respect. If the Court were to adopt another purpose for the exclusionary rule, namely creating incentives for counsel to challenge existing precedent, that will represent a substantial departure from this Court's consistent holdings that the only function of the exclusionary rule is to deter police misconduct, and once the Court has acknowledged that an additional exception to the exclusionary rule is justified, even if in these rare situations, it will create pressure for litigants to urge that additional policy interests of the administration of justice would be served if the Court would create yet another exception.",
  "Yes.",
  "I think the strongest argument against -­",
  "-- the proposal, Justice Scalia, would be an appearance of arbitrariness in the Court's actions.",
  "Justice Breyer, it hasn't caused havoc, for several reasons. One is it's extraordinarily rare for this Court to overrule its own Fourth Amendment precedent. It's apparently equally rare, or almost equally rare, for the courts of appeals to overrule their precedent and adopt a more defendant-friendly Fourth Amendment rule. I cannot claim to have done an exhaustive survey of all of the courts of appeals decisions that possibly overruled Fourth Amendment holdings, but the results of my research disclose only one case in which a court of appeals overruled its precedent to favor a defendant, and that occurred in 1987 in the Fifth Circuit, and the Fifth Circuit adopted a good faith exception precisely like the one that the government is urging the court to adopt today and declined to suppress the evidence for that reason. No other circuit has apparently confronted the question of whether overruling a decision triggers the good faith exception.",
  "Yes, Justice Breyer.",
  "No. That is the retroactivity question, and the retroactivity question is -­",
  "This Court has acknowledged that the exclusionary rule is not an individual right, it's a remedy. It doesn't involve any violation of constitutional rights of the defendant. It's a remedy that this Court devised after finding a Fourth Amendment. And I think, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, in Judge Kravitch's opinion for the Eleventh Circuit, Judge Kravitch acknowledged that Gant is the law; the search in that case was unconstitutional. The next question is an entirely separate issue of remedy, and that remedy issue is governed by this Court's good faith precedents. The rarity with which courts of appeals have confronted this simply reflects the fact that, even without the lack of incentive that Petitioner says will result if the Court agrees with the government today, holdings that overrule Fourth Amendment decisions squarely and favor defendants do not occur all that often.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, before the litigation that occurred in the wake of Gant, there was only one precedent on the books in any circuit that I'm aware of that had applied the -- in the Federal system -- that had applied a good faith rule to overrule judicial decisions. That was United States v. Jackson in the Fifth Circuit. It's cited in the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in this case. It happened in 1987. So I think it's fair to say that prosecutors and government officials were not raising good faith exclusionary rule arguments in the cases that were held for Gant. I don't believe that the United States had done so, and as a result, it was perfectly logical and in accordance with this Court's normal practice to grant, vacate, and remand those cases for further consideration under Gant. But in the wake of Gant, courts began to think of the logic of Leon and Krull and this Court's recent decision in Herring v. United States and attempt to apply the logic of those decisions to a circumstance in which a police officer relies on a binding and governing appellate precedent, and they concluded that courts that announce precedents have every reason to expect that litigants will rely on them and that police officers will rely on them. Therefore, there is no deterrent purpose to be served by suppressing the evidence. It's all cost. And the cost would be that individuals whose convictions have been obtained based on evidence that was seized in reasonable good faith reliance on existing appellate precedent will now be able to overturn their convictions, and that's a heavy cost to the administration of justice. It's why the exclusionary rule has been confined to particularized circumstances where it's thought that it will actually achieve a benefit, and it has not been expanded beyond those purposes. So given that litigants, criminal defendants, have a tremendous incentive to challenge their convictions and to try to navigate around precedents while simultaneously showing that those precedents may have underlying material flaws, this Court is highly unlikely to be deprived of cases in which litigants attempt to undermine precedents without actually calling for their overruling. That is what happened, for example, in Batson v. Kentucky, where the Petitioner in that case did not want to head-on confront Swain v. Alabama and ask for its overruling, and as a result asserted that racially discriminatory peremptory challenges were invalid under the Sixth Amendment, rather than the Equal Protection Clause. This Court got the case and concluded that the proper analysis was the Equal Protection Clause and it accordingly overruled Swain in relevant part. So it's highly unlikely that if, in fact, a precedent of this Court is beginning to fray around the edges and justices of this Court have written concurrences or dissents that explain that they no longer believe that the logic of that is sound, litigants will exploit those statements in an effort to narrow the precedent and ultimately expose its flaws, so that if this Court determines it can overrule the precedent, and it can do so even if the exclusionary remedy will not follow.",
  "This case, Justice Alito, only involves the example of binding appellate precedent, and Judge Kravitch's opinion for the Eleventh Circuit distinguished between the two situations. In the situation in which there is no precedent, such that an officer would not be instructed that his conduct is affirmatively unconstitutional, qualified immunity applies, and there would be arguments that there is nothing to deter if an officer acts within that empty space. But there is a countervailing argument, and the countervailing argument, which Judge Kravitch talked about in the Eleventh Circuit, opinion, would be that when there's no law on the books courts should give officers to -- an incentive to act in favor of the more constitutionally protective manner, rather than taking a flier on what might turn out to be unconstitutional.",
  "No, Justice Ginsburg, I would not submit to the Court that the United States necessarily agrees with that. I think that this case doesn't involve that problem and, as I said, there are contrary arguments that could be advanced based on this Court's description in Herring of the purpose of the exclusionary rule to reach conduct that is either reckless or intentional or at the least systematically negligent. And, so, some day this Court may have to confront whether the narrow limitation that Judge Kravitch adapted -- adopted in her opinion is the correct rule of law versus a broader view that exclusion is only appropriate when the officers have engaged in truly culpable conduct. But that's not a bridge that the Court needs to cross in this case. It's not an argument that the United States is advancing for affirmance of the judgment. This judgment can be affirmed simply by holding that the syllogism that the court of appeals adopted that, absent a deterrent purpose there is no basis for exclusion, there is no deterrent purpose here, that's sufficient to resolve this case and the Court can leave for another day, if it agrees with that proposition, whether the exclusionary rule should have any broader exception for good faith behavior. If the Court has no further questions -­",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Since this Court's decision in Katz v. United States, the Court has recognized a basic dichotomy under the Fourth Amendment. What a person seeks to preserve as private in the enclave of his own home or in a private letter or inside of his vehicle when he is traveling is a subject of Fourth Amendment protection. But what he reveals to the world, such as his movements in a car on a public roadway, is not. In Knotts v. United States, this Court applied that principle to hold that visual and beeper surveillance of a vehicle traveling on the public roadways infringed no Fourth Amendment expectation of privacy.",
  "The technology is different, Mr. Chief Justice, but a crucial fact in Knotts that shows that this was not simply amplified visual surveillance is that the officers actually feared detection in Knotts as the car crossed from Minnesota to Wisconsin. The driver began to do certain U-turns and, the police broke off visual surveillance. They lost track of the car for a full hour. They only were able to discover it by having a beeper receiver in a helicopter that detected the beeps from the radio transmitter in the can of chloroform.",
  "But it doesn't expose anything, Mr. Chief Justice, that isn't already exposed to public view for anyone who wanted to watch, and that was the crucial principle that the Court applied - -",
  "Probably not, Justice Kennedy; and the reason is that this Court in Karo v. United States -- United States v. Karo -- specifically distinguished the possibility of following a car on a public roadways from determining the location of an object in a place where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy.",

  "It changes it, Justice Scalia. And I think the case that most clearly illustrates the distinction between trespass and Fourth Amendment protection is Oliver v. United States, the case that reaffirmed the open fields doctrine. In that case, there was absolutely no doubt that the police committed a trespass under local law. They entered, they crossed fences, they ignored big \"no trespassing\" signs; and this Court held that the interests that are protected by trespass law are distinct from the interests protected by the Fourth Amendment.",
  "No, the rationale was that - -",

It is possible to envision broader advances in technology that would allow more public information to be amassed and put into computer systems. But I think that the remedy for that -- if this Court agrees with the principles in Knotts and Karo and applies them to this case, the remedy is through legislation, just as when the Court held that amassing pen register data, all of the numbers that you dial on your telephone, the lengths of the times of the calls.

  "I first want to address the suggestion that you could draw a line somewhere between a month and a trip and have a workable standard for police officers to use. Police officers use a variety of investigative techniques which in the aggregate produce an enormous amount of information. Pen registers, trash pulls. They look at financial records. They conduct visual surveillance. And under a principle of law that says 1 trip is okay but 30 trips is not, there is absolutely no guidance for law enforcement in how they are - -",

It authorized entering the car in order to install it, which wasn't necessary here. It also authorized monitoring the car in a location where there was a reasonable expectation of privacy. This case is only about monitoring a car on public streets. But I think it's very important to keep in mind that the -- the principal use of this kind of surveillance is when the police have not yet acquired probable cause but have a situation that does call for monitoring. And I'd like to give an example. If the police get an anonymous phone call that a bomb threat is going to be carried out at a mosque by people who work at a small company, the bomb threat on an anonymous call will not provide even reasonable suspicion under this Court's decision in Florida v.

And monitoring an individual through their clothing poses an extremely high likelihood that they will enter a place where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy.",

You go into a phone booth, you're in public; making your calls within the phone booth is subject to a reasonable expectation of privacy. But this Court, with full awareness of that holding, in Knotts and in Karo recognized that surveillance of a vehicle traveling on the public roadways doesn't fit that description.",

  "Justice Ginsburg, it's not very hard for police to follow somebody and find a traffic violation if they want to do that. But to answer in part Justice Breyer's earlier concern about limiting principles, this Court recognized in the Whren decision that, although the Fourth Amendment is not a restriction on discriminatory or arbitrary or oppressive stops that are based on invidious characteristics, the Equal Protection Clause is. The First Amendment also stands as a protection. If this Court believes that there is an excessive chill created by an actual law or universal practice of monitoring people through GPS, there are other constitutional principles that are available.",
  "I'm quite sure, Justice Ginsburg, that if you ask citizens whether the police could freely pick up their trash for a month and paw through it, looking for evidence of a crime, or keep a record of every telephone call that they made for the duration and the number that it went through, or conduct intense visual surveillance of them, that citizens would probably also find that to be, in the word that Respondents choose to use - -",
  "I think - -",
  "All right. Justice Breyer, two things on that. First of all, I think the line-drawing problems that the Court would create for itself would be intolerable, and better that the Court should address the so-called 1984 scenarios if they come to pass, rather than using this case as a vehicle for doing so. Second, if the Court - -",
  "If the Court - -",
  "Oh, I think that would be - -",
  "Well, I think it would be virtually impossible to use the kinds of tracking devices that were used in this case on everyone because - -",
  "I think that -- Justice Scalia, the legislature is a safeguard, and if the Court believes that there needs to be a Fourth Amendment safeguard as well, we have urged as a fallback position that the Court adopt a reasonable suspicion standard which would allow the police to conduct surveillance of individuals in their movements on public roadways, which they can do visually in any event, and would allow the police to investigate leads and tips that arise under circumstances where there is not probable cause.",
  "As in most reasonable suspicion cases, it's the police at the front end and it's the courts at the back end if there are motions to suppress evidence. But fundamentally, just as in the pen register example and in the financial records example, if this Court concludes, consistent with its earlier cases, that this is not a search, yet all Americans find it to be an omen of 1984, Congress would stand ready to provide appropriate protection. If I may save the rest of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, advancing technology cuts in two directions. Technological advances can make the police more efficient at what they do through some of the examples that were discussed today: Cameras, airplanes, beepers, GPS. At the same time, technology and how it's used can change our expectations of privacy in the ways that Justice Alito was alluding to. Today perhaps GPS can be portrayed as a 1984-type invasion, but as people use GPS in their lives and for other purposes, our expectations of privacy surrounding our location may also change. For that - -",
  "Justice Kagan, I think the Court should decide that case when it comes to it. This was my fundamental point: This case does not involve universal surveillance of every member of this Court or every member of the society. It involves limited surveillance of somebody who was suspected of drug activity - -",
  "I'm willing to assume that it might be, Justice Kennedy, but I don't think that this Court measures the metes and bounds of the Fourth Amendment by State law invasions of privacy. The Court has - -",
  "Yes, but in Greenwood, the Court dealt with a case where California had outlawed taking somebody's garbage, and this Court said that did not define an expectation of privacy for purposes of the Fourth Amendment - -",
  "Correct.",
  "Oh - -",
  "No, I don't think so. And - - and the fact that something may be a tort for a private person doesn't mean that it's a problem for the police to do it. For example, in the Dow Chemical case, where the police used -- EPA in that case actually used cameras to surveil an industrial plant. There was a claim that it would have violated trade secret law for anybody else to do that. And the Court accepted that and said tort law doesn't define the boundaries of the Fourth Amendment. In Knotts, the Court was very careful to reserve the possibility of 24-hour surveillance of every citizen in their persons and in their residences, saying we haven't seen that kind of abuse. If that kind of abuse comes up, the legislature is the best-equipped to deal with it, if in fact our society regards that as an unreasonable restriction on - -",
  "The Federal Government I can speak to, and it's in the low thousands annually. It's not a massive universal use of an investigative technique. The FBI requires that there be some reasonable basis for using GPS before it installs it. And as a result, this is a technique that basically supplements visual surveillance rather than supplanting it all together. There was visual surveillance that was directed at Respondent. The GPS allowed it to be more effective. As Justice Kennedy and, I think, Justice Scalia's hypotheticals illustrated, Respondent is essentially conceding that around-the-clock visual surveillance through teams of agents would not have invaded any expectation of privacy. This Court said in Knotts that police efficiency has never been equated with police unconstitutionality. The fact that GPS makes it more efficient for the police to put a tail on somebody invades no additional expectation of privacy that they otherwise would have had. The technology doesn't make something private that was previously public. When we go out in our cars, our cars have driver's licenses that we carry. We have license plates on the car. These are for the purpose of identification - -",
  "Oh, I think there would probably be some sort of State law possessory interest -- Mr. Chief Justice, may I finish? But there is no seizure for the very reason that Justice Breyer described under the Katz case. This Court has said that trespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to create a Fourth Amendment violation.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Sandra Lambatos's testimony really has to be analyzed as having two components to it. The first component is the match, the match between the data reflecting the allele charts from Cellmark and the data that was produced in analyzing Petitioner's blood. As to that component of her testimony, she's a live witness. She's subject to cross-examination. I don't think that anyone asserts there's a Confrontation Clause issue. But as several members of the Court have pointed out, that testimony is entirely irrelevant and nonprobative unless it can be linked to the semen that was taken from the victim and that was subsequently analyzed to generate a DNA profile. As to that issue, Illinois State law provides that her testimony cannot prove for the truth of the matter asserted what Cellmark did. She cannot repeat on the witness stand, when she gives the basis for her testimony, things that Cellmark said and have them be taken for the truth --",
  "Well, first of all, Justice Sotomayor, that did come in on cross-examination, and I don't think that Petitioner is contending that evidence that he himself elicits on cross-examination --",
  "-- would violate the Confrontation Clause.",
  "Can I focus on --",
  "Can I focus on your question? I think, because she clearly did link the DNA that she compared to the blood DNA to the semen that was sent to Cellmark, and I think that several members of the Court have raised the question, is she implicitly thereby repeating what Cellmark said and then making Cellmark the out-of-court witness? My answer to that is twofold. First of all, as a matter of Illinois State law, she could not do that. She is not permitted to give the basis for her opinion in that respect and have it taken for the truth.",
  "And this brings me to my second reason for saying that this is not a Confrontation Clause problem. It's in essence what the Chief Justice described and what Justice Alito referred to as the circumstantial way in which the factfinder can infer that Cellmark tested the DNA in the semen that was sent to it. There's a shipping manifest that shows that the semen goes out to the lab; there's a shipping manifest that shows that it comes back. And Cellmark tenders a --",
  "Correct. And that is I think the crucial point here. The State may have a very weak case if it doesn't produce a witness from the lab who can attest to the fact that the lab did what it was supposed to do and conducted a properly authorized DNA examination. It has to get by with the very skimpy circumstantial showing of we sent the material out --",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "And it did that here by saying that Cellmark is an accredited laboratory and Sandra Lambatos participated in designing proficiency examination. But she had to admit on cross-examination that she had no idea what Cellmark actually did in this case. She could draw inferences. And the inferences that she drew are what enable her to say my opinion is there is a match between the DNA in the semen and the DNA in the blood.",
  "It would have been relatively stronger had a witness been able to actually come from Cellmark and validate that Cellmark is an accredited laboratory and conducts procedures in a certain way. But the crucial point here --",
  "Only if as a matter of State law there was a sufficient foundation for the factfinder to conclude that the DNA actually came from the blood and the DNA came from the semen.",
  "The Confrontation Clause, Justice Scalia, does not obligate the State to present a strong case. It does not prevent the State from presenting a relatively weaker case, so long as it does not rely on testimonial statements to prove the truth of the matter asserted. This Court held, in Bruton v. United States, that there is a very narrow exception to the almost invariable presumption that juries will follow the instructions that they're given. If they are told not to take evidence for the truth of the matter asserted, they are presumed to follow that instruction. Here Illinois State law supplies that filter. Everything that the judge heard, he filtered through Illinois State law that says the basis for the expert's opinion doesn't prove its truth. So, the State gave up the right to say you can believe that this DNA report is reliable and trustworthy because Cellmark says so. The State doesn't get that benefit, and as a result of not getting that benefit, it is not obligated to treat Cellmark as if it's a witness. Cellmark --",
  "No. I think, Justice Kagan, when you consider the things that this Court has held juries can properly apply limiting instructions to, they can hear the fact that evidence was seized from the defendant, marijuana was found at his house. The defendant gets up on the stand and says, no, it wasn't. The State can introduce that marijuana to impeach his testimony. And the jury is instructed you may not use that as proof that he possessed marijuana, only to impeach his testimony. The same is true with unwarned statements in violation of Miranda.",
  "There's no instruction here, Justice Scalia, because this is a bench trial. And in a bench trial, the judge is presumed to follow the law, and as my colleague read to the Court --",
  "Well, the Illinois --",
  "The Illinois Supreme Court found as a matter of State law that he did comply with State evidentiary rules and he did not take the Cellmark report for the truth of the matter asserted. And there is in this case an alternative route of proof which is circumstantial. And I take the Chief Justice's amendment of my description of the facts to include that Cellmark is an accredited laboratory. That does add to the probative value. But it's a much weaker chain of support to conclude that the DNA male profile came from the semen than if they had produced Cellmark. But not having produced Cellmark, they do not need to afford confrontation on Cellmark.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case, like Oregon v. Ice, involves the kind of finding that the common law never entrusted to the jury. There is, therefore, no erosion or encroachment on the jury function by assigning the function of determining the days of violation to the court for the purpose of determining the criminal fine.",
  "The Court's statement in Ice -- that if a purely algebraic application of Apprendi were followed, it would sweep in things such as fines and restitution -- was not necessary to the judgment, Mr. Chief Justice, but it was part of the Court's rationale in adopting a different take on the meaning of the Apprendi line of cases than had previously been espoused. Up until --",
  "That is true, Justice Ginsburg. But I think that the author of the opinion in Ice was citing to an amicus brief filed by States, which supplied illustrations of fine statutes that it believed would be imperiled by a purely programmatic rule-based application of Apprendi. And two of the State statutes that were cited in that amicus brief, that of New Jersey and Alaska, involved the kind of gain or loss statute that has been discussed this morning, in which the judge, following the rendition of a guilty verdict, determined the amount of gain or loss and then applied either a double or triple amount as the maximum fine.",
  "Correct, Justice Scalia.",
  "Yes, Justice Scalia.",
  "Justice Scalia, the tradition with respect to monetary fines is different than the tradition that the Court analyzed in Apprendi. With respect to fines, restitution, and forfeiture, the jury was never given a substantive role at common law. And the law today is with respect to forfeiture --",
  "Justice Sotomayor, I think what Apprendi relied on primarily was the linkage between charge and penalty in English law, which was, for felonies, death. The Court distinguished in a footnote the tradition with respect to misdemeanors, which it acknowledged was judicial discretion with respect to fines and whippings, and it did not rely on that history in fashioning the Apprendi rule. What it relied on were two things: First, the traditional linkage between charge and authorized penalty in English common law; and, second, the tradition in America that when the legislature had put a cap on the amount of the penalty, the judge had discretion within it not to go above it. But neither of those aspects of Apprendi addressed the issue that's before the Court today, which is whether it would be an expansion beyond the domain that was covered in Apprendi to apply it to monetary penalties in --",
  "It's difficult to do that, Justice Sotomayor, because the Court fashioned the Apprendi rule from history, and it limited it based on history in Ice. It doesn't operate as an algorithm that simply applies automatic --",
  "Yes, and that -- that was the argument of the Ice dissenters, that Apprendi states a rule that knows no exceptions for history or the impact on the States. And Ice does represent I think a -- shows where the high-water mark of Apprendi was. The high-water mark was with respect to the penalty of imprisonment.",
  "Well, of course, the death penalty in Ring v. Arizona. The Court held that facts that expose a defendant to the death penalty must be found by the jury. So, the Court has extended Apprendi to those core liberty areas. But even with respect to the implications for the length of imprisonment, the quantum of punishment that a defendant faces when he's convicted of multiple offenses, this Court in Ice looked to history and the impact on the administration of justice before being willing to extend Apprendi outside of its core domain. And I think it's highly relevant --",
  "Well, it is, of course, relevant, Justice Kagan, but --",
  "Because the Court went on several paragraphs later in its opinion to describe what it would mean to adopt a formulaic application of Apprendi, treating it just as a rule divorced from history. And one of the consequences that the Court considered was the impact it would have on sentencing accoutrements, two of which are directly related to this case because they are financial penalties, fines and restitution. Now, I've talked about how the amicus brief that prompted that paragraph, the concern about the implications of expanding Apprendi, referred to fine statutes that operate on a gain or loss basis, which necessarily requires judicial factfinding after the guilty verdict comes in. But if the Court isn't satisfied with those, restitution which is explicitly mentioned in Apprendi -- excuse me -- in Ice, classically operates based on findings about victim loss that occur after the guilty verdict has come in. This Court is well familiar that oftentimes courts have to postpone sentencing in order to allow the victim to gather evidence and to present it. Now, the Court could, I suppose, do as the lower courts have done and say restitution is different because it's designed simply to compensate for loss; and, therefore, it's in one sense remedial. But that will have to deal with the fact that in cases like Pasquantino v. United States and Pennsylvania v. Davenport, the Court has described restitution as a criminal penalty. Now, the other way in which lower courts have said that restitution isn't swept up by Apprendi is to say it's a rule that has no maximum. Whatever the amount of harm to the victim is, that can be compensated through restitution. But, again, if one is applying an algebraic understanding of the relevant statutory maximum from the Blakely decision, restitution would be hard to justify because the jury verdict does not contain findings about harm to victims. The jury verdict finds guilt. Afterwards, the judge finds an additional fact, namely the amount of harm, and imposes restitution. And --",
  "Yes.",
  "Probably --",
  "Well, probably, Mr. Chief Justice, such a statute would be construed to make that fact one for the jury, since it dictates imprisonment increases as well as fine increases. And so, the constitutional question is unlikely to arise. Congress would have been deemed to have intended that that kind of a fact go to the jury. That's not what -- the case in this statute. This statute provides a 5-year maximum penalty, and then it provides a fine amount that's graduated to the days of the violation. The violation in this case was one single violation. The judge did not find that there were multiple violations; the judge simply looked at the record, and his task is to decide how long did that violation --",
  "We do presume --",
  "This Court has never recognized jury nullification as a constitutionally protected right. We presume a rational jury. We presume that if the jury is confronted with the evidence and the law as given to it by the court, it will apply that law in a rational manner. And the question here is whether that is something that the jury is constitutionally entitled to do. Now, coming back to the historical foundations of the Apprendi rule and the extension that's requested here, with all due respect to Petitioner, I think United States v. Tyler is much more significant than Petitioner gives it credit for. This is a case decided in 1812 on a Court that had on it Chief Justice Marshall and Justice Story. These were people who were well steeped in common law traditions and well familiar with how judges would find facts at the time of the founding. And in Tyler, there was a charge that the defendant had unlawfully exported, in violation of an embargo law, an amount of pearl ashes that were worth $600. And the jury came back with a verdict that said we find that the defendant unlawfully exported pot ashes worth $280. And the question is: Could a verdict be imposed on this, and could the judge set the fine? The two judges on the circuit court disagreed, and so it was certified to the Supreme Court. And this Court held unanimously that finding a valuation was a judge function, not a jury function. No valuation was necessary in order for the court to impose the proper fine. And it's difficult to understand how this Court could have said that, if there were such a well-settled constitutionally protected entitlement to a jury verdict on facts that dictated a fine, if indeed this statute assigned the role to the judge and the Court was fully comfortable with that role being carried out. And Tyler is a decision of this Court. There is no decision of this Court with respect to imprisonment that is anything like Tyler. The traditions with respect to imprisonment would surely be understood in a different manner than with respect to fines. And when one looks at fines, restitution, and forfeiture as a package of possible financial penalties and asks the question, did the Framers envision that these matters would be within the jury's domain as opposed to the judge's in imposing the appropriate sentence after a jury verdict, I think that the answer is they would not have viewed it as a matter protected by the Sixth Amendment, because there was no factual predicate in the common Law that would have led them to believe the jury's function would be eroded if those matters were not.",
  "We could have done it here, Mr. Chief Justice. The broader concern is cases that involve gain or loss, in which the question of how much loss may have been suffered by hundreds or even thousands of victims of fraud is typically not undertaken -- the process of quantifying them isn't done until the guilty verdict is in because it's an enormously difficult and complicated task. As Justice Breyer pointed out, the judge isn't even required to do it at sentencing if it proves to be too complicated. And for jury trials to do it, there may well be a need for bifurcation. And this Court in Oregon v. Ice declined to impose on the States the need to bifurcate trials to determine whether a sentence should be run consecutively or concurrently, because that would intrude upon a valuable reform that was designed to provide some restraints on judicial discretion. The same kind of thing would operate here if this Court adopts an across-the-board rule that fines have to be proved to a jury. If it extended it to restitution and to forfeiture, that would involve overruling the Court's decision in Libretti v. United States, which held that forfeiture is a sentencing function. But upon a strict application of Apprendi, a mathematically, geometrically accurate application of the rule stated in Apprendi, it's difficult to see why forfeiture is not something that has to be --",
  "Correct.",
  "Well, I don't agree with -- that it's later been characterized that way. It was characterized in a decision that was written by Justice Story --",
  "-- in the same year. Justice Story was on Tyler. He wrote -- he sat on circuit in a case called United States v. Mann.",
  "And this is in our brief. And he -- he interpreted Tyler and said the court would not have given the direction that it did, that a judgment could be entered based on the fine amount, unless they were satisfied that an indictment lay and that the fine was to be imposed by the court and not found by the jury as a penalty.",
  "The jury --",
  "Because the Court stated that the part of the verdict which is subject -- which we're discussing right now is to be regarded as surplusage. In other words, this -- Tyler explains that although it was submitted to the jury, it wasn't necessary to be submitted to the jury. The charge had asked for $600 of value which would then be subject to the fine. The jury found only $280. And as I interpret the Court's decision and I think as Justice Story interpreted it sitting on circuit in Mann, it said this isn't a jury function.",
  "Well, the -- again, I would readily concede, Justice Scalia, that the Sixth Amendment does not appear --",
  "-- in the Court's decision in Tyler, but it's difficult for me to understand that a Court that included Chief Justice Marshall, Justice Story, and other members who were well familiar with how common law operated would have adopted an interpretation of a statute that was facially unconstitutional. I -- I don't submit that this decision grapples with what we now know to be the Apprendi doctrine. I simply submit it as evidence that this Court --",
  "No. I -- they didn't have the benefit of having read Apprendi in order to render their decision. They -- they were deciding the question that was certified up to them. My submission is that they wouldn't have decided the case that way if they thought, based on their familiarity with the common law, that fines were the kind of thing that had to go to a jury.",
  "I think they felt they did not need it, because the matter was sufficiently obvious that all members of the Court could agree on it.",
  "There are three of them.",
  "There are three of them. The earliest one is Commonwealth v. Smith. It's a Massachusetts case.",
  "And the Court in that case -- its analysis I think is even briefer than the analysis we've just discussed in Tyler.",
  "Justice Scalia, I'd have to go back and look at the opinion to tell you whether it was an argued case. There's no citation of any constitutional law in -- in that decision.",
  "I doubt that I would say that, Justice Sotomayor. The -- the jurisprudence of the former colonies/new States is not uniform. I -- the -- there is something I think of mythology in speaking about the common law as one indivisible body of law.",
  "And I don't disagree with you on that point, Justice Sotomayor; but I think that there is one fact that truly stands out about fines, and that is they were historically at common law products of judicial discretion.",
  "Imprisonment was rare. Imprisonment was hardly ever imposed in the early colonies and in England, because --",
  "I -- I'm sorry.",
  "A few did. And I've attempted to read up on the law of North Carolina, the law of Pennsylvania, the law of Massachusetts, the law of New York. It's all varied and complicated, but there were a few of them there.",
  "Well, the fact that there were --",
  "Well, none of those statutes assigned the role of finding fines to juries. There may be an example or two that one could find if you dig through the mass of colonial records, but the dominant trend, and it was acknowledged by Blackstone, was that the common law never assigned the responsibility of fines to the jury, and statutes did so rarely. Imprisonment simply doesn't help very much in this area, because the resources required to imprison just didn't exist, and imprisonment really is a product that developed in the late --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Another one of them is Massachusetts.",
  "Yes. We have Hope -- Hope in 1845, which cites back to Smith and relied on it, and then there is an -- an arson case called Ritchey from Indiana in which the court did seem to think that in order to sustain a proper prosecution where the fine amount varied based on the destruction of the property, the jury had to find the amount of the property valuation. But this is 1845. It's not something that would have been present to the mind of the Framers. It doesn't indicate clearly what the source of law is, whether it's a common law tradition, whether it's following something like Smith. Smith itself I think is also best understood as a larceny case, and there was more of an established tradition that in larceny cases, the value of the property taken was relevant to the jury's findings because it made the difference between a capital offense -- a capital offense that could be given with benefit of clergy, which was basically a way for the English judges to mitigate a death-eligible crime to a non-death penalty, or petty larceny, which was punished by fines and whipping. So, it graded the offense in a way that, for example, the fine penalty at issue in this case does not. Petitioner is guilty of a felony by virtue of the jury verdict. That imposes the stigma of being a felon on Petitioner. The judge's role is then to decide what was charged in the indictment and what was the length of that violation, not to find Petitioner guilty of numerous additional violations.",
  "The jury's acquittal would end the criminal case.",
  "Well, in that case --",
  "Unless the -- the judge finds that the evidence is insufficient under Jackson v. Virginia, he's bound by the jury.",
  "Then I think that he would be bound by the day of violation, $50,000 limit, subject to another provision of Federal law, 3573(c), which provides in the case of an organization that a felony exposes the defendant to a $500,000 fine. So, there -- there would be other limits applicable in Federal law that would explain what the judge is supposed to do in that situation. The judge, of course, is operating in a different way than the jury. The jury is finding guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge is applying a preponderance of the evidence standard. This Court in United States v. Watts has recognized that judges can find facts that the jury may have rejected under the higher standard.",
  "It's only the whole problem, Justice --",
  "The only --",
  "It's only a problem, Justice Scalia, if the Sixth Amendment protects a defendant's right to it. And the question that was -- as framed in Ice, is whether the legislative innovation, the reform aimed to structure the discretion of a court which at the Founding era might have been impose whatever fine you like with no limits whatsoever, except the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment -- Congress has come along, as have the State legislatures, and sought to structure the deliberations with respect to financial penalties. Fines, restitution, and forfeiture are now structured in a way that basically sends the decision to the judge or lowers the standard of proof to a preponderance in the case of forfeiture amounts that -- that are decided by a Federal jury without the constraints of the Apprendi rule. And that distinction between financial penalties and infringements on life or liberty is consistent with a Sixth Amendment theme. Deprivations of life or liberty attract a greater degree of protection than fine amounts or other financial penalties. There is substantive constitutional protection in the Eighth Amendment --",
  "In the right to counsel area, the Court has held that for misdemeanors, if the defendant goes to prison, he's entitled to counsel; if the defendant does not, he is not entitled to counsel. With respect to jury trials, a petty offense which is generally one punishable by less than 6 months in prison, there is no jury trial right. A penalty of greater than 6 months in prison indicates a more serious offense.",
  "It is still a misdemeanor because the primary indication --",
  "That is -- that is this Court's jurisprudence. This Court in Scott and Argersinger drew the line at actual imprisonment, recognizing that deprivations of liberty have a more serious criminal implication than financial penalties. And --",
  "There is, of course, an important constitutional value in deprivations of property. It's protected by due process, and the Excessive Fines Clause explicitly addresses the possibility that the judge may impose an unjustified penalty. There are also nonconstitutional sources of protection such as reasonableness review, which Petitioner got in this case, and the First Circuit upheld the amount of the fine as reasonable. The only question here is whether, despite the lack of a historical pedigree and despite this Court's decision in Tyler and despite the adverse effect on the administration of justice, the Apprendi rule needs to be expanded where it has never been applied previously to encompass fines. And I --",
  "Well, liberty in the sense of imprisonment is not involved. Corporations I don't think can be deprived of --",
  "I don't think a corporation can be deprived of liberty within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. It can't be put in prison; it can't be restricted from, you know, activities that are comprehended --",
  "Well, I don't think corporations can appear in court except through counsel. They don't have a sort of distinct --",
  "No, this -- this is a rule that is responsive to the history with respect to financial punishments.",
  "May I answer?",
  "Justice Breyer, we're not asking the Court to reconsider its Apprendi line of cases. We're asking it to apply the analysis that limited Apprendi in Oregon v. Ice. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fair Sentencing Act manifests the requisite fair and necessary implication that Congress intended that its new mandatory minimum thresholds apply in all sentencings after the date of the Act.",

If Congress had written in the Fair Sentencing Act, henceforth, after the date of this Act, probation officers shall prepare presentence reports and submit them to courts in which they shall calculate the mandatory minimum penalties under the standards announced in this Act, I think this Court would draw the structural inference that it did not intend that probation officers prepare that information for nothing.

Section 8 is all over the briefs, but I have it in the Government's gray brief at page 10a. This is the section that directs the Sentencing Commission to promulgate new guidelines and to exercise its emergency authority -- and I'm going to quote here -- \"to make such conforming amendments to the Federal sentencing guidelines as the Commission deems necessary to achieve consistency with other guidelines provisions and\" -- here's the critical phrase -­ \"applicable law.\" That phrase, \"applicable law,\" can only mean sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act, which are the provisions that increased the thresholds of quantities necessary to trigger the mandatory minimum sentences.",
  "But -­",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I want to put this in the structural context of the Sentencing Reform Act. The Sentencing Reform Act directs courts to apply the version of the Sentencing Guidelines that is in effect on the day of sentencing. It's not a time of offense rule; it's a time of sentencing rule. And there -- that means that everybody who comes before the sentencing court after the date of the Fair Sentencing Act when the new guidelines are in place will have those guidelines applied to those defendants. Those guidelines are supposed to be conformed to applicable law. The only applicable law that there could be is the new mandatory minimum standard.",
  "But that would mean, Justice Scalia, that the guidelines would not be conformed to applicable law for the defendants who are sentenced after the FSA. They would be conformed to inapplicable law. And Congress knew when it set up section 3553(a) that the guidelines that would be applied are the ones that are in force at the time of sentencing.",
  "Well, it was a little bit more complex than that, because what -- what the FSA did was two things: It lowered the mandatory minimums by increasing the crack thresholds, and it targeted role in the offense of the defendant for increased sentencing and mitigating factors for decreased sentencing. And the Commission had to translate that into new guidelines. It acted quickly. It was told to act as soon as practicable. It was entirely possible under the statute, and probably would have been desired by Congress, that new guidelines would have gone into effect on August 4th. At that point, the only people in front of the sentencing court would have been pre-FSA offenders.",

  "30a -- I'm sorry, 39a.",
  "Sorry about that. The -- the Sentencing Reform Act provides that the applicable set of guidelines that will be applied are those that are in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced. This is 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii). And that provision has been in the Sentencing Reform Act since the -- since the time the Sentencing Reform Act was enacted. And Congress explained, for those who read legislative history, that it wanted -- and I am going to quote here from the legislative history: \"The guidelines and policy statements to be applied are those in effect at the time of sentencing.\" Congress's reason for that was it wanted the most sophisticated statements available that will most appropriately carry out the purposes of sentencing, and to impose a sentence under outmoded guidelines will foster irrationality in sentencing and would be contrary to the goal of consistency in sentencing.

  "That provides that if a case is reversed on appeal and sent back for resentencing, the original set of guidelines that were applied at the date of the initial sentencing shall be used. It's an exception to the general rule.",

The retroactivity that it was concerned about would have reopened final sentences. There's no question here about reopening final sentences. So, that bill was explicit: We don't want to reopen final sentences. The Government is not asking for reopening of final sentences.",
  "Correct.",
  "No, I don't think so, because that -- that bill was designed to postpone the effective date for 180 days.

And it wanted those guidelines to be conformed to applicable law. And it is very strange to say that it wanted new guidelines in effect to be conformed to inapplicable law such that there would be the incongruous result that the new guidelines that finally fixed this egregious problem in the criminal justice system would be irrelevant for many defendants because they would still be living under the 100-to-1 racially disparate impact effect of the guidelines, of these -­",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, may I answer the question?",
  "Justice Sotomayor, what's unique about this context is that there's a confluence between the way that the guidelines treated crack and the way that the statutes treated crack. And for years, the Sentencing Commission had said: We can't fix this problem with the guidelines alone; we need the help of Congress to alter the mandatory minimums. And once you do that, give us emergency authority so that we can put new guidelines into place that will work hand-in-glove with the new mandatory minimums, as the Chief Justice explained, so that all defendants who come before the Court will not be subject to the discredited crack policy that Congress had repealed.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Padilla v. Kentucky this Court announced a new rule within the meaning of Teague v. Lane. Because --",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor, this Court in Padilla didn't distinguish between misadvice and omissions to give advice. And it therefore adopted --",
  "As for -- as for Padilla's rationale, the answer is yes, but there is a rationale that governed, in our view, misadvice claims that existed before Padilla. It wasn't addressed or embraced in Padilla. It was addressed in Justice Alito's concurring opinion. Justice Alito gave two reasons which essentially mirrored the reasons that had been given in the lower courts for treating misadvice differently. And that is, affirmative misadvice violated a more basic duty of counsel that was well established, which is not to represent that you're competent on a matter that you are not competent. And the second distinction between misadvice and failure to give any advice is that a client has a constitutional right to make his or her own decision about whether to plead guilty; and a lawyer has a constitutional duty not to get in the way of that by affirmatively skewing the client's ability to make that choice. And so I would probably not disagree that misadvice claim was not new before Padilla and it's not really addressed by Padilla's rationale. It has its own independent sources, and the courts that had adopted that --",
  "It's a different professional norm and it's a different aspect of the Sixth Amendment right. And all of the courts that had adopted misadvice -- there were three of them that had done it in the removal context; there were three more that had done it in the parole eligibility context -- they all simultaneously adhered to the view that as a general matter there is no obligation to give advice about collateral consequences. And they did this, I might add, despite the fact that, as Justice Kennedy alluded, the ABA, which was cited as one of the key sources of prevailing professional norms, stated in Standard 14.3.2, in the criminal justice pleas of guilty standards: \"To the extent possible, defense counsel should determine and advise the defendant sufficiently in advance of any plea as to the possible collateral consequences that might ensue from entry of the contemplated plea.\" So there was an aspirational professional norm that collateral consequences would be on the table, but all Federal courts that had looked at this question before Padilla had concluded that collateral consequences are outside of the duty of criminal defense counsel.",
  "No, Justice Sotomayor.",
  "No, Justice Sotomayor. And I think this is the key point about Strickland. Justice Kennedy made this point in a concurrence in Wright v. West, and it was later cited by the Court as -- as reflecting an accurate understanding of Strickland. It is a basic norm of professional competence, and it does not turn on professional -- prevailing professional norms in publications such as the ABA. They are informative. And those norms can evolve. The Court can then announce Sixth Amendment applications of them that will be not -- not new rules. This Court has decided close to 30 Strickland cases, according to our count since the 1984 decision in Strickland.",
  "No, I say no, Justice Scalia, because professional norms are judged as of the time of the attorney's action. So although the professional norms can evolve, Strickland always looks to an actor at the time of the decision.",
  "I think you probably should ask my opponent what he contends, but Strickland is fairly clear that professional norms at the time of the attorney's action are what governs.",
  "Well, the ABA doesn't state this Court's interpretation of the Sixth Amendment. This Court made that very clear in Roe versus --",
  "Well, first of all, Justice Breyer, that's not what the Court did in Padilla. What the Court did in Padilla, as Justice Kagan explained, in section two of its opinion was first to address the question whether a criminal defense lawyer had any obligation to give advice about a consequence that would not be administered in the criminal case itself. No decision of this Court had ever held that the obligations of a criminal defense lawyer under the Sixth Amendment extended to that.",
  "That was not the basis of the Court's decision. The Court --",
  "Most of the cases involved well-settled duties, like the duty to investigate, applied to particular sets of facts. That doesn't generate a new rule. What was unique in Padilla is that the Court had to address something that it had never done before, whether the criminal defense lawyer had to give advice about a consequence that the sentencing court had no control over. And in resolving that question, this Court did not cite professional norms. It did not cite the ABA. It did not cite any of the defense manuals that recommend that lawyers advise aliens about the possibility of deportation. It instead traced the statutory evolution of the relationship between deportation and criminal justice, it examined its own cases that had discussed what a competent defense lawyer ought to think about, and it discussed statutory evolution. And it drew from that the principle that deportation is uniquely tied to the criminal prosecution in a way that no other collateral consequence possibly is, and, therefore, the Court did not decide any other collateral consequence.",
  "Yes.",
  "Common sense may evolve --",
  "Justice Kennedy, I think the Court relied on the idea that any lawyer worth his salt would inform a defendant about a particularly important consequence, a momentous consequence of pleading guilty. You probably would say the same thing to somebody who you knew was an avowed hunter and would lose the right to have firearms, or a politician that would lose the right to hold office, or a doctor who would lose a medical license, all of which can be automatic consequences of a conviction; actually, more automatic than deportation, because deportation is administered by a separate body, oftentimes by a separate sovereign that has discretion whether to even institute deportation proceedings. And so the fact that we might all share an intuition that good lawyers should advise their clients about the panoply of consequences that they will experience by pleading guilty, the reality is that until Padilla, the Court had never veered from the track of saying the lawyer's duty is to help the client figure out what his odds are of prevailing at trial, what the sentencing consequences are, whether there are any affirmative defenses, and what the rights are that the client would give up by pleading guilty.",
  "No, Justice Ginsburg, because this Court held in Danforth v. Minnesota that Teague is an interpretation of the Federal habeas statute. It's an implied delegation to the Court to frame appropriate rules for Federal collateral review.",
  "Well, this --",
  "Well, Danforth made clear that states have discretion whether to adopt Teague-like rules. They do not have to. They can allow their citizens to have the benefit of new rules in state convictions. And this Court is doing nothing other than honoring the state's own policy choice.",
  "I think Kentucky does have a Teague-type rule, but the Kentucky Supreme Court decided the issue on the merits. The state never raised Teague here. Teague is waivable. So even if you do not agree with me, Justice Ginsburg, that Danforth means that Teague had no relevance whatsoever, Teague was waived by the state. The state never addressed it. And this --",
  "Could have, but didn't. There is nothing in the majority opinion that says that Teague is an issue. Now, again, when I say could have, but didn't, that reflects the -- the reality that this Court can do certain things sua sponte. I do not think that in a case coming from a state system Teague has anything to do with it. Whether this Court is reviewing the case on direct review from a state system or reviewing a state collateral proceeding, Teague is not an issue. It's solely an issue when you have a 2254 proceeding or a 2255 proceeding.",
  "Justice Kennedy, my test is not a new rule. My test for Teague new rules is this Court's test: Whether the decision was dictated by precedent so that any reasonable jurist would have reached that result, or, to put it another way, that no reasonable jurist could not have.",
  "It's similar. I think the Court has said that things that don't count as new rules under Teague can also be cognizable under AEDPA. AEDPA has a contrary to provision, as well as an unreasonable application provision, as Mr. Fisher pointed out; but, as far as the contrary to provision works, it parallels Teague. So we're not asking the Court to make any new rules up about Teague. We're asking the Court to -- to apply Teague. And in the application of Teague, the government is relying on this Court's form of analysis, which is you look at the state of the law at the time of the decision in question, when the decision became final, and you ask whether precedent compelled the result that a later decision reached. And --",
  "This Court has not, except in the sense that in Bousley v. United States, the Court ran through a Teague analysis before holding that a substantive interpretation of a Federal statute is not captured by Teague. So, in that sense, the Court has presumed the applicability, but it hasn't squarely held it.",
  "True, Justice Ginsburg, but this Court has also recognized that Federal courts have an interest in the finality of Federal convictions that's every bit as strong as state courts. And so, for example, in United States v. Frady, the Court applied the procedural default rule exactly the same as it applies in state cases to Federal 2255 proceedings.",
  "Well, there are two becauses. One is no court had held, as this Court did in Padilla, that deportation, though not administered by the sentencing court, was so intimately tied to the criminal case that the direct collateral distinction was not useful in this context. There was no precedent that dictated that. And then, more generally, as you're suggesting, Justice Kennedy, the lower courts had all adopted the direct collateral reviews. Ten courts of appeals in published decisions, the Sixth Circuit in an unpublished decision, 28 states and the District of Columbia had all adhered to that line.",
  "I would not suggest that the Court adopt a mechanical approach. Here, all of the factors that the Court has looked at all align in the same direction. The lower courts, Federal courts, had all agreed that deportation was not the subject of a duty of advice. The majority of the States had held the same. This Court's decision in Padilla was significantly splintered, with four justices challenging the majority's rule as a dramatic expansion and upheaval in Sixth Amendment law. And then when you actually look at the Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, Padilla did not claim that any decision was controlling of its holding. The closest case was the Hill case, Hill v. Lockhart, and in that case the Court approached a collateral consequence, namely, parole eligibility dates, and it said: We don't have to decide that issue on whether parole eligibility dates can be the subject of a Strickland claim, because Hill had failed to show prejudice. And therefore, it was recognized as an open issue whether a consequence that's not administered by the sentencing court could be within Strickland. So when you have the coalescence of all of those factors, I don't think that's a case where the Court has to draw a fine line between when a sufficient split below is enough to --",
  "Correct.",
  "Justice Breyer, let me give you a merits answer to that question, and then an answer on why I do not think Petitioner has fairly preserved or presented that issue to this Court. The merits answer is that Teague reflects a fundamental judgment that when a case is final on its direct review, society has a strong interest in protecting that judgment. And the exception to that is when the state or the Federal government has not conformed to existing constitutional law. Now, bringing that down to earth for ineffective assistance claims, at the time that Ms. Chaidez's conviction became final, and all convictions that became final before Padilla, jurisdictions had no reason to think that they needed to protect against the possibility that a criminal defense lawyer would not have advised about deportation, because the unanimous view was that's not something that's the Sixth Amendment duty. Immediately after Padilla came down reflecting that it was, the Criminal Rules Committee began considering an amendment to Rule 11, which is now pending before the Judicial Conference, that would require judges to advise defendants about the possibility of deportation consequences. In other words --",
  "I will accept that, if that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. The point is that as soon as Padilla made it clear that a constitutional rule about defense counsel could threaten the finality of guilty pleas, the Rules Committee has taken steps to protect the integrity of federal judgments through a Rule 11 amendment. It had no opportunity or reason to do that -- I can't say no opportunity, but it had no reason to do that as a constitutional matter until the Court decided Padilla. And so there is a logical relationship between --",
  "Yes. I --",
  "I don't think that it's quite identical, Justice Breyer, but there are additional considerations that are at stake here, too. First of all, Massaro, which Mr. Fisher relies on, doesn't preclude a defendant from raising a claim on direct review. It says that it's not a procedural default if he does not do that. A criminal defendant will probably not be in great shape to raise a -- a new rule claim on direct review, but he also will not be in great shape to raise it on collateral review. Unless this Court alters its Sixth Amendment holdings, such a defendant will be pro se, they will not have a lawyer, they will be pretty much in the same fix that they are in on direct review. Now, if this Court announces that new rules under Strickland are not going to be applied to defendants whose convictions became final, then those defendants who want to raise a new rule claim are on notice that they'll need to do it on direct review. Courts of appeals will be on notice that if someone raises such a claim, the appropriate thing to do is to adjudicate it or remand for its adjudication. Now, right now the D.C. Circuit doesn't follow Massaro. It does remand ineffective assistance claims. Mr. Fisher said he was unable to locate any cases where this actually happened. You don't have to look any further than down the road to the arguments next week in Smith v. United States, which involves a different issue, but the D.C. Circuit remanded an ineffectiveness claim in that case to the district court in direct review. It has a practice of doing that. This is actually a much easier process to administer than a general exception to Massaro, because --",
  "It's not a preferred process for ineffectiveness claims generally. I think Massaro makes that clear. But you have to understand how rare a new rule under Strickland really is, the way that the Court has administered Strickland to date. Applications of the existing Strickland standard to particular sets of facts are not new rules. That's why in the 28 years since Strickland none of this Court's decisions, and there are about 30 of them, under Strickland added up to a new rule. Padilla broke ground because it answered the question, not how does Strickland apply, but whether it applies at all to something outside the compass of the sentencing court. And so in that respect, there's no reason why the standard practice under Massaro should change if this Court were to address the issue and make clearer that new rules are not going to be applied on collateral review.",
  "It could be something more than that, because if the Court announces a new rule and makes it retroactive to a case on collateral review, (f)(3) of the statute of limitations provision gives the defendant another 1 year. And I think this case actually illustrates the mischief of that. This case doesn't arise on collateral review. It arises on coram nobis 5 years after the conviction became final. Now, if Petitioner were really serious that this Court should carve out from Teague ineffectiveness claims and adopt a rule just like the one that it did in Martinez v. Ryan, which is what he says on page 31 of his brief, then the Court should not give him the benefit of that rule, because Ms. Chaidez was on probation for 4 years after her conviction, she could have raised this claim after her conviction and sued. She did not do that. She had her opportunity. She didn't take advantage of it. And I think this helps underscore why, if I can turn to this issue not being properly presented in the Court. Petitioner did not raise the ineffective assistance of counsel type carve-out from Teague that Mr. Fisher raises in this case. That debuted for the first time in his merits brief after certiorari was granted. The government acquiesced to get resolution of the new rule question that had divided the circuits and that will exist. However this Court resolves this case, if it chooses to resolve it on the Massaro grounds, the new rule issue will still be salient for the States, it's still a circuit conflict that the Court needs to address. It was not raised below, it wasn't raised in the certiorari petition. The en banc petition raised a very general argument that Teague should not apply to federal convictions along the lines of what Justice Ginsburg asked me about, whether comity concerns and their absence meant there should be a difference. So you've got an argument that, so far as I can tell, has never been made to any Federal court before it's been made to this Court, and it would be remarkable for the Court to adopt that and then have to figure out, how does it apply. Does Teague ever kick in? Is it a permanent exemption for ineffective assistance claims? Lots of questions that no lower court has looked at, and that I would suggest this Court should not be the first to answer. It also raises an entirely new set of questions about whether Brady -- which also are kinds of claims that are typically raised on collateral review -- should now be exempt from Teague jurisprudence? I think the Court would really be engaging in kind of a sort of examination of Teague that had never happened before. It's sort of like experimental surgery on Teague. Shouldn't really happen in this Court in the first instance.",
  "True, but Petitioner is not pressing that basis on this Court. He's all but disavowed it. He's not seriously argued it in response to our brief that opposed his brand new ineffectiveness carveout from Teague. What he has done instead is concentrated much more on an analogy to Massaro. If I could give one more reason why I think the Court should refrain from entertaining that Massaro-based analogy here, the Court has just begun to embark in the Martinez v. Ryan line of cases on trying to figure out how ineffectiveness claims should be handled on collateral review. It grants its certiorari on Monday in Trevino v. Thaler, where it's going to explore how does Martinez apply in a jurisdiction that may be more like the Federal system in that ineffective assistance of counsel claims aren't channeled only to direct review, they can be asserted on direct -- I'm sorry -- only to collateral review, they can be asserted on direct review. They are channeled largely to collateral review, but not as a matter of law. So the Court has a lot of work to do in figuring out what that decision means. And I think rather than embark on a brand new process of applying that kind of reasoning in a case where it was never raised below, where the government never really had the opportunity to counter any of those arguments, and the lower court never had the opportunity to consider them, it's not a wise use of the Court's resources. Instead, resolving the new rule question that has divided the circuits would provide an answer for us and the 28 states that filed an amicus brief that supported the United States on the new rule question, and would result, I think, appropriately, in concluding that Padilla was a new rule, unique among this Court's Strickland jurisprudence up to that time, and is not available to cases on collateral review.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court should adhere to its decision in Harris v. United States, which reaffirmed McMillan v. Pennsylvania because those decisions properly respected the fact that a mandatory minimum divests the defendant of the right to judicial leniency.",
  "Justice Sotomayor, the government's argument here is not that juries are incapable of finding facts under the Federal statutes that involve mandatory minimums. It's that Congress has sound reasons for wishing to allocate that factfinding to the sentencing process and that it is not unconstitutional for Congress to do so.",
  "The -- the constitutional question, in my view, Justice Sotomayor, turns on whether there is a right to the mercy of a tenderhearted judge. That is what a defendant loses when a judge finds a mandatory minimum fact.",
  "Correct.",
  "Justice Breyer, yes.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, we have a chart in our brief that I think is addressed explicitly to the question that you are asking, and it's on page 36 of our brief. And it illustrates the difference between an Apprendi situation and a Harris-McMillan situation. So the government's gray brief. And the point of the chart is this --",
  "This is page 36 of the government's brief.",
  "Okay. The point of Apprendi is a jury cannot be reduced to low-level gatekeeping. Congress cannot pass a statute that says it is a crime to assault someone, and that's punishable by one year in prison. But if the crime involves rape, then it's punishable by 10 years in prison. Or if the crime involves attempted murder, then it's punishable by up to life. Congress can't do that because it would diminish the role of the jury in finding the critical facts that constitute the crime that sets the defendant's maximum exposure. Apprendi protects against that. In a Harris situation, the defendant is already exposed to the maximum penalty that the defendant incurs under the statute, and that's what the second column illustrates. The defendant who commits a Section 924(c) crime knows that the defendant faces up to life in prison. When the mandatory minimum comes along, it doesn't increase the defendant's exposure to the most severe punishment he can get. It divests the defendant of a degree of judicial discretion. But the Sixth Amendment does not protect a right to judicial discretion.",
  "It's not just in my mind, Justice --",
  "And when he cannot --",
  "It matters because the Sixth Amendment protects a right to a jury trial; it does not protect a right to judicial leniency.",
  "No, because, in -- in the other situation, it protects the right of the jury to determine the ingredients of the crime that Congress has determined exposed the defendant --",
  "Well, we know --",
  "Well --",
  "They weren't relevant in the first situation because, if there is no cap from the maximum that a judge could impose based on judicial factfinding, the role of a jury can be shrunk to what the Court has called low-level gatekeeping. That can never happen under a statute that increases only the mandatory minimum.",
  "Well, it certainly doesn't increase the maximum punishment that's authorized under the statute. And it doesn't prevent the judge from making the exact same finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the jury did not make beyond a reasonable doubt and giving seven years, even if there were no mandatory minimums.",
  "Well, it's, first of all, not entirely accurate that judges do not give higher sentences than the minimum. There are plenty of cases in which they do so. If the 920 --",
  "But taking away judicial discretion to treat a fact within the range differently than what Congress wants doesn't infringe the jury trial right. The jury can find facts by a -- beyond a reasonable doubt, but, when the judge is at sentencing, he is not operating under that burden, so the factfinding role of the jury --",
  "I don't think that it's quite true that everything that I said applies to the maximum, Justice Kennedy, because, as the plurality opinion in Harris explained, once the court has been confronted with a defendant who's convicted, the judge's discretion extends up to the statutory maximum. He can't use his factfinding ability to increase the defendant's exposure to criminal punishment. Mandatory minimums can never do that. The defendant is already exposed to the sentence that the judge could give. And I grant you, Justice Kagan, that some judges might choose to give a lower sentence. But the fact that they might choose to reflects judicial leniency, tenderheartedness, something that the Sixth Amendment does not speak to.",
  "I think, Justice Ginsburg, that the judge said he would be intellectually honest and not ignore the fact that the -- the finding of brandishing did trigger the mandatory minimum. He did not say, I otherwise would have given five. And I think that this case --",
  "It's not the usual case, Justice Scalia.",
  "Correct.",
  "No, there is no inconsistency between -- and I think, if you look at the way this case evolves, it's not even clear that the jury rejected brandishing. What's very interesting about this case is it's possibly the best illustration of the unfairness problem that Justice Alito alluded to and that Justice Breyer has written about in his opinions. The issue at trial in this case was identity. Was the defendant actually the person sitting in the car, while his accomplice walked up to the victim and -- and put a revolver into his neck and asked for money? That was the issue at trial. There was no discussion of brandishing whatsoever. Nobody focused on it, and it allowed the defendant, after the jury rejected his identity argument, to go to the judge and say, even though the jury has now found that my guy did it, he could not have foreseen that a gun would have been used.",
  "Justice --",
  "I think, Justice Sotomayor, that the Court recognized, in Apprendi, that its rule was limited and to certain extent could be evaded by legislatures, if they were inclined to do so.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I agree in part with both you and Justice Sotomayor on history. In fact, if you look at the 1790 Crimes Act that the First Congress passed, many of the set sentences are determinant sentences. Others of the sentences were -- were prescribed up to a certain amount of years. And, within that, it was well understood that judges would find facts to graduate the penalties according to the gravity of the crime. And what the legislatures have done in the 20th Century innovation of mandatory minimums within an otherwise authorized range, as you have with 924(c), is say, we would prefer that judges take into account brandishing and discharging, as under Justice Kagan's hypothetical statute, but we would like to -- to do that in a uniform manner. We know that they can find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that brandishing exists. We know that many, if not most, judges would consider that worse than simple possession of a firearm in a crime of violence, and we want judges to behave consistently. By proscribing consistency, they are acting in accord with the historical tradition of having determinate sentences, a tradition that this Court held in Chapman v. --",
  "And there was no judicial discretion, which I think makes --",
  "The judicial discretion is what the defendant is losing. He is not losing the right to a jury trial because the very same verdict authorizes the judge to find brandishing and impose seven years.",
  "To have the jury find it by a preponderance of the --",
  "It's not just my position that it's constitutional for a -- a judge to find mandatory minimum triggering facts by a preponderance. I'm sure that a legislature could allocate that to a jury, if it wishes to.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. And I think that -- that not only does it not contradict any decision of this Court to allow the judge to make those findings, it doesn't contradict the principle behind the jury trial right or the right to proof beyond a reasonable doubt.",
  "Correct.",
  "And that's the difference between this and Apprendi.",
  "Well --",
  "That's --",
  "It's descriptively accurate, but it says nothing about the constitutionality of the procedure. And I think that it's very important to focus not only on the fact that stare decisis is in play, but that Apprendi has been a very history-driven area of the law. Last term, when the Court extended Apprendi to fines, it has found an ample historical basis for doing so. In this case, by comparison, there is no historical showing that would justify extending Apprendi to fines. Not only is there no direct analogy to a 924(c) type statute, but the three pillars of their historical argument are extremely weak and strained analogies. The first one is simply that, to get a statutory crime that was parallel to a common law crime, but differed, the prosecutor had to charge all of the elements of the statutory crime in the indictment. That says nothing about mandatory minimum sentencing. The sentence -- second pillar of their historical argument is the procedure called benefit of clergy, which was a form of what Blackstone called a statute pardon, that allowed a defendant to avoid a capital sentence. In the First Crimes Act, in Section 31, in 1790, Congress said, \"Benefit of clergy shall not exist in the United States for any crime punishable by a capital sentence.\" Benefit of clergy has never been part of this -- this country's Sixth Amendment heritage. It was abolished before the Sixth Amendment was even ratified. And the third pillar of their historical argument are three late 19th Century cases, Jones, Garcia, and Lacy, each of which involve statutes that both raised the maximum and the minimum, not a single one of them spoke about the Constitution. None of them purported to define what a legislature could do if it wanted to raise only the minimum, and that's it. And I would suggest to the Court that this kind of Gertrude Stein history, where there's really no \"there\" there, is not sufficient to overturn the legislative prerogative to make uniform the findings of fact within a range --",
  "The constitutional argument is the same. I think this Court's decision in O'Brien suggests that, unless the legislature were absolutely clear about it, the Court would conclude that those would be deemed elements.",
  "\"Deemed elements.\" Under the decision in O'Brien, where the machine gun finding raised the minimum to 30 years, the Court held that it should be deemed to be an element, but --",
  "No.",
  "I wouldn't suggest that the jury is being a low-level gatekeeper in that situation because the jury's verdict alone -- and this is a serious crime -- exposes the defendant to a life sentence. This is a crime that involves either a predicate Federal crime of violence or a Federal drug trafficking crime, plus the use of the gun in it. And I think Congress could reasonably expect that the worse the use of the gun, the more extreme, the higher the corresponding penalty. And, indeed, if a 924(c) violation is charged by itself, and a defendant is an armed career criminal, then his sentencing range goes up to 360 months to life --",
  "It's not incongruous if you look at it from the point of view of the fact that the jury verdict itself allows a life sentence. And if the defendant draws the proverbial hanging judge who, in his discretion -- or her discretion, wants to give that life sentence, the defendant knew, from day one, when he committed the crime, that, if the jury finds him guilty of it, he's exposed to a life sentence. And the Court, in Apprendi, said structural democratic constraints will preclude legislatures -- or at least discourage them from assigning maximum sentences to crimes that are higher than what the legislature deemed --",
  "No, I think that --",
  "In that situation, the democratic process would have concluded that firearms brandishing, discharge, or use of a machine gun is an extremely serious component of this crime. We know judges will take that into account in sentencing. We simply want them to take that into account in the same particularly harsh way. And in -- in trying to achieve uniformity among judicial actors, when finding facts at sentencing, which everybody knows that they will do, does not deprive the defendant of a right to a jury trial on the elements of the crime; it deprives him of the right to a judge who might show mercy under a particular set of facts. And that simply is not the right that's embodied in the Sixth Amendment.",
  "Well, I agree that you can say them, Justice Breyer --",
  "Respectfully, no. We -- the critical point about Apprendi is, by assigning the role of constitutional element status to a fact that increases the maximum, the Court has preserved the jury trial right against its reduction to, essentially, a formality on a particular subset of elements. And the relationship of a crime that's covered by Apprendi and the so-called base crime is like a greater included offense and a lesser included offense. Whereas, in the mandatory minimum situation, we know that the judge will be engaged in sentencing. We know that the judge will find facts that extend beyond the elements of the crime to inform himself about how the basic crime is committed. We also know that different judges may treat those facts differently after finding them by the preponderance of the evidence. The mandatory minimum changes only one thing. It says, Judge, if you find this fact, brandishing or discharge, you will impose the same sentence as your neighboring judge down the hall, not a different one based on your different perception of sentencing philosophy. So it allows the legislature to intervene after having defined a sufficiently serious enough crime and determine how the judges will treat those facts.",
  "The legislature --",
  "There are many ways --",
  "There are many ways that a legislature could achieve a goal that allows the judge's factfinding to carry more weight. For one thing, it could extend the maximum punishments and convert everything into an affirmative defense, which this Court said last week is constitutional. The point is whether the defendant has really been divested of a jury trial right when he loses the right to the mercy of a judge. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Arrestees are in a unique category. They are on the gateway into the criminal justice system. They are no longer like free citizens who are wandering around on the streets retaining full intact Fourth Amendment rights. The arrest itself substantially reduces the individual's expectation of privacy. The arrestee can be searched and sent to arrest. His property, whether or not connected with a crime, can be inventoried. When he's taken into the jail situation, he can be subjected to a visual strip search. If he's admitted to the population of the jail, he'll be given a TB test and a thorough medical screen. These are not individuals who are like free citizens, and they are not like free citizens in another significant respect. Arrestees are rarely arrested for the first time. They tend to be repeat customers in the criminal justice system. Up to 70 percent of arrestees have been previously arrested.",
  "That is certainly correct, Chief Justice Roberts, and the reason for that is going into the house will expose a substantial number of highly private things to the view of the State. Taking a DNA sample is not of that character. It is far more like taking a fingerprint.",
  "Well, by law, the -- the government, under CODIS, and the States cannot look at anything except identification information. The sample contains the entire genome. The sample cannot be looked at as a matter of law. And I think it's critical to this case to -- for the Court to understand that, if the Court concludes, as is probably correct, that the individual will retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in the genomic material that does not reveal identity, then additional Fourth Amendment scrutiny would be required before the government could make use of the rest of the genome. Here, it's making use of an identity indicator that is highly similar to fingerprints with one significant difference: It is far more accurate. When Respondent committed his rape --",
  "You are not wrong, Justice Kagan, but the future is very close to where there will be rapid DNA analyzers that are devices that can analyze and produce the identification material in -- in the DNA within 90 minutes. And the design of this program is to put them at the booking station, so that DNA can be taken, and, within 90 minutes, that information is known. In that circumstance, it will be highly relevant to the immediate release/custody decision, which it already can play a role in --",
  "Yes, Justice Breyer -- Yes, Justice Breyer. There is no question it can be done quickly because of the volumes. I'm not contending that, today, it is --",
  "Fingerprint histories tend to come back quickly, except if the prints are unrecognizable or unreadable. It is very significant, I think, that fingerprints are used for crime solution, as well as --",
  "Correct.",
  "That, I cannot tell you, Justice Alito. It is now in use. It is in use both for identification, and, contrary to the representation of Respondent in his brief, fingerprints are run against the latent fingerprint database, which reflects fingerprints from crime scenes. It returns about 50,000 hits a year.",
  "No, I certainly do not think that it would have been unconstitutional at any point because the State has a compelling interest in taking biometric identification information from the individual that is arrested and using it for a myriad of purposes, determining criminal history, attempting to solve crimes, funneling that information back --",
  "That is correct.",
  "That is the routine method under CODIS, yes.",
  "I do not know precisely whether Maryland does that. The Federal system does not routinely do that. Upgrades to the software system will permit it to do that, and many States do it.",
  "I agree with that, and I think that, in California, the brief for the States indicates that many States do that, and California itself uses it to resolve discrepancies in identity when a fingerprint comes back and it returns to multiple names, or the fingerprint is not good enough to permit an identification. California cross-checks, so it does perform an identification function. And, as I suggested, with the advent of rapid DNA, it's not that it is unconstitutional before rapid DNA, but rapid DNA will permit DNA identification to replace fingerprint identification because it's far more accurate, and it has far more utility in the secondary purpose of fingerprints, which is to match them to latent prints and solve crimes. And this is highly relevant to both of the major purposes for taking DNA, crime solution and facilitating the release/custody determination. Any judge who is looking at a bail case would like to know -- I have a guy who has been arrested on grand theft auto. He has no criminal history. Should I release him back on the street? Well, it's a first offense, he has family ties, maybe yes. If that judge --",
  "That serves an enhanced reliability function, to ensure that there is no mix-up, and it provides an evidentiary function of permitting the new DNA match to be admitted in a sample that is taken under the warrant. It has nothing to do with undercutting the value of taking DNA on the spot because I was indicating the judge who would know this defendant's DNA came back and returned a cold case hit to a murder-rape. He's not such a good risk to be put back on the street.",
  "No, Mr. Chief Justice --",
  "No, but bail can be revoked, and the government will go back in and make a motion to revoke bail, if new information emerges that indicates this individual is a danger to the community. And the whole point of this is we are talking about arrestees, somebody who has taken a step into the gateway of the criminal justice system. The criminal justice system, at that point, has to deal with this person. It has to know who is this person, which includes what has this person done, so we know whether to release him and, if we keep him, in what situations do we keep him.",
  "Yes, it does, Justice --",
  "We are not asking for that, and I don't think that the Court's balancing test suggests that these two cases are equivalent. My first submission is that because we are talking about --",
  "I'm saying that because an arrestee is someone whose conduct has given rise to probable cause that he committed a crime, he's in a different position from ordinary citizens. And this Court does, as it did in Samson and in Knights, balance the expectations of privacy against the governmental interests. And, here, the expectation of privacy is minimal in the cheek swab, and the information obtained. It's identical --",
  "Well, they're differently situated in that respect, Mr. Chief Justice. And I will acknowledge that there is no case on my side that decides the case this way. And there's no case that - - on Respondent's side that decides the case for him. The Court, I think, has treated the category of what he calls special needs cases -- what the Court has called special needs cases -- as dealing with suspicionless or warrantless intrusions on ordinary citizens.",
  "Well, we have a strong law enforcement interest with respect to people who are arrested based on probable cause. They are no longer similarly situated to other people. They can be deprived of their liberty. Their property can be searched upon entry into the jail.",
  "We're not asking for a new exception. What we're asking for is for the Court to apply what it called \"the key principle of the Fourth Amendment.\" It said that in Bell v. Wolfish. It said that in Martinez --",
  "No, Justice Kennedy, it's not. That stands on its own doctrinal footing. But we do think the fact that --",
  "It is certainly a search --",
  "You can certainly look at it as an incident of the arrest. The Court's search incident to arrest cases have been bottomed on different justifications than the ones that we're advancing here. I'm entirely happy if you, Justice Kennedy, view it as an incident to arrest in that sense because I think that it is appropriately viewed as something that the government has a compelling interest in doing once a person has been arrested, and that is, knowing who that person is, which includes knowing what the person has done. And DNA does that in a far more powerful way than fingerprints has done --",
  "That's inaccurate, Justice Scalia. A search incident to arrest allows a full search of the person for any destructible evidence because a person who has been arrested has a tremendous incentive to destroy evidence. And I just want to come back --",
  "Yes, on -- on the individual's person. The crime of arrest limitation appears only in Arizona v. Gant, and it relates to cars. But I think it's critical to note that Respondent has conceded that an individual can have their DNA taken once convicted. Suppose we have the same individual who's picked up on grand theft auto, and that individual knows that, if he's convicted of grand theft auto, he is going to have his DNA taken, but he also knows that he's committed a string of rapes. And, if the government cannot take his DNA now, it will not connect him -- may I complete the sentence -- it will not connect him to those rapes. So he has a tremendous incentive to flee. The government has a tremendous need for this information at the time of arrest to solve crimes, exonerate the innocent, and give closure to victims. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Convicted sex offenders pose a serious threat to public safety. When those convictions are entered under Federal law, Congress has the authority to impose both a criminal and a civil sanction for that conduct in order to protect the public. The Fifth Circuit in this case applied a per se rule that once Respondent had completed his military sentence, Congress lost authority to apply a civil sanction for that violation of Federal law. That per se rule is wrong. Nothing in Article I prevents Congress from legislating retroactively with respect to civil remedies for past violations of Federal law. The Ex Post Facto Clause, the Due Process Clause, and Article I analysis under the Necessary and Proper Clause all provide some degree of protection against retroactive provisions, but no per se rule bars Congress from applying sex offender registration requirements, which this Court has held to be civil remedies not barred by the Ex Post Facto Clause to past Federal criminal convictions. Now --",
  "Well, certainly, Justice Sotomayor --",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor, there are independent constitutional limits both outside of Article I and within Article I that mean that I will answer your question no, it's not the case that my position today means there are no limits. There are limits. If we --",
  "The -- the principal limitation on retroactive legislation is the Ex Post Facto Clause. Indeed, there would have been no need for an Ex Post Facto Clause if the Fifth Circuit were correct.",
  "So if -- if the Court agrees that it's not a punitive measure and it is a remedial measure --",
  "Well, if you don't agree with it, then you'll be going on the Ex Post Facto Clause, and you won't be getting to Article I.",
  "It is settled law, and that means that sex offender registration provisions aren't punitive. The question here is, are they within Article I. And the Court in United States v. Comstock went through an elaborate Necessary and Proper Clause analysis --",
  "No. This provision, Mr. Chief Justice, rests on a different analysis than Comstock. In Comstock, the problem was caused by Federal custody that, as Your Honor has said, broke the relationship between the individual and some State that might take cognizance of him for purposes of sex offender civil commitment. The basis for the statute in Comstock was that people in Federal custody, regardless of the nature of their prior convictions, might pose threats if released. The basis for the statute in this case is not that the individual was in Federal custody. Federal custody is irrelevant to it. The basis for the statute in this case is that this is a sex offender in violation of Federal law, and Congress has the authority to impose, as was done in this case, criminal punishment, but it also has the authority to impose civil regulatory sanctions.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, there is no per se rule in Article I that forbids retroactive civil regulations imposed on a Federal offender. So the question --",
  "Well, I think the whole point in this case is that it's retroactive because there isn't any serious dispute that if somebody commits a Federal sex offense they can be placed on supervised release for life so --",
  "Well, so is this.",
  "Well, but Congress's power is not limited to preventing and punishing crimes through criminal law. Except for a brief interlude under United States v. Halper where this Court viewed double jeopardy as precluding multiple criminal and civil sanctions, the Court has recognized that when someone violates Federal law they're exposed both to criminal punishment and to civil sanctions. The criminal punishment has to comply with the Ex Post Facto Clause. The civil sanctions do not. So what the --",
  "That's precisely --",
  "-- what makes it a civil sanction. But, Justice Scalia, Your Honor is presupposing that Congress can only react to a sex crime through the criminal law and that it must have those laws in place at the time of the punishment, and there is no such Article I precept.",
  "This case turns entirely on the fact that the defendant is a Federal offender. The source of power in question was the power to regulate the armed forces. This is an individual who committed a sex crime while in the armed forces. And Congress's power to address that and to prescribe remedies for it both civil and criminal is entirely tied to the Federal nature of the offense.",
  "Justice Alito, I think the most helpful way to do that would be for me -- for me to progress through a series of examples that illustrate how protecting the public against a Federal sex offender is a legitimate aim under the Necessary and Proper Clause to implement the underlying constitutional authority.",
  "So start with a sex offender who commits a sex offense in the military, is tried, court-martialed, and sentenced. Subject to cruel and unusual punishment limitations, due process limitations, et cetera, that individual can be incarcerated, placed on supervised release potentially up to life. A condition of supervised release, well-recognized and now mandated by Federal law, is that that individual register as a sex offender. And the reason that that is tied to Federal law is that when an individual violates Federal law it is a legitimate purpose of Congress to protect the public against recidivism by that individual. So that's the criminal example that I believe is undisputed. Now, suppose that the Federal government didn't actually get the sex offender while he was in the military. It missed the crime, but later information comes to light still within the statute of limitations that shows that while this person was in the military they committed a sex offense. This court in United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles made clear that that individual can be tried in an Article III court for his criminal violation even though he's out of the military. It's enforcing the rules that were impressed upon him at the time while he was in the military. Now let me give a civil example and then I will bring it right back to this case. Suppose that Congress concludes that sex offenses in the military are a very serious problem and that there are a lot of people who have escaped prosecution because of lax interest in pursuing those crimes. And after a period of years, it sets up a board of inquiry and it says this board of inquiry is going to look into sex offenses that were committed at the time that people were in the military, even if they're out of the military, and we're going to subpoena people to testify, and if individuals are determined in a civil proceeding to have committed sex offenses they may have their military records revised, they may lose military benefits, and they may have other civil sanctions imposed upon them.",
  "Yes, noncriminal. Noncriminal.",
  "Not going to be a criminal punishment that's imposed at the end of the day.",
  "That's an acceptable level of proof for the civil law. And if Congress can do that in order to protect the integrity of the military and to promote confidence in the military, then it's a very small step, if any step at all, to SORNA.",
  "Yes, absolute -- well, Mr. Chief Justice, it's not linked to the incarceration. This is the difference between this case and Comstock, and this is why the Solicitor General's concession in Comstock on which the Fifth Circuit heavily relied has no applicability here. In Comstock, it was irrelevant what offense the individual had been committed. The problem was he was in Federal custody, he was sexually dangerous at the time he would be released. Ties had been broken between him and the community, and if he were released it would pose a threat to public safety that the Federal government had power to protect against.",
  "Right.",
  "That's correct. But Federal law did as well and Federal law provided encouragement. This is actually a primary example of partnership between State governments and the Federal government. The Federal government offers financial support, it offers logistical assistance, it offers tremendous resources of the U.S. marshals to track down sex offenders. And as this Court said in Carr v. United States, it was entirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned a special responsibility for prosecuting Federal sex offenders who failed to register. This was integral to this Court's reasoning in Carr, where the Court was confronted with two provisions of 2250, the criminal sex offense provision under SORNA. For State offenders, there had to be travel in interstate commerce, for Federal offenders there didn't. The government argued that the provisions ought to be given as co-extensive a reach as possible so that the coverage of the statute would be equally comprehensive for both State and Federal. And this Court --",
  "Yes, it is, I believe, Justice Kennedy. In an opinion that you wrote for the Court, Smith v. Doe, which considered the retroactivity of Alaska's sex offender registration and notification provisions, which are similar but not identical, to the Federal provisions, the Court went through the established analysis to determine whether the legislature had intended a punitive effect and if it didn't, whether there was the clearest proof that it was punishment in purpose and effect. Notwithstanding the legislature's intent, the Court upheld the retroactive applicability of sex offender registration and notification, making clear that it is not governed by the Ex Post Facto Clause. Now, that's not to say that an individual couldn't argue that SORNA is different or an individual couldn't argue that the Due Process Clause makes it either irrational or substantively off limits to impose this kind of civil remedy. The individual can also argue that running this through the Comstock factors, it's not reasonably adapted to fulfilling Congress's aim. But what the Fifth Circuit did is apply a per se rule that it drew, I think, from the Solicitor General's statement in Comstock that once an individual got out of custody and was back in the control of the State and within its jurisdiction and population, then the Federal government couldn't reach out and commit him as a sex offender. And there are two main distinctions between that concession and this case. The first is, as I've already alluded to, the government's argument in Comstock was based on custody. This case is based on the consequences of the conviction itself. The second distinction is that committing somebody civilly is a massive intrusion on that individual's relationship with the State. The individual has been brought within Federal custody, they have no relationship with the State anymore. Whereas sex offender notification is far more accommodating of State interests.",
  "It's not per se barred by Article I, Justice Scalia. The question of whether it's constitutional is really a question of individual rights analysis and whether it passes through the necessary and proper gate under the considerations similar to what the Court looked at in Comstock.",
  "Well, there's no --",
  "Well, it's not eliminated. It still is available for an individual to argue, as Respondent did in this case in the district court but abandoned long before he got to the court of appeals, that it violates due process, that it violates ex post facto.",
  "He can argue that. I submit that he will lose.",
  "If it in fact is civil and passes through this Court's analysis, then yes.",
  "Well, it's actually quite well established as a principle of double jeopardy law in cases like Hudson v. United States and United States v. Ursery. It's established in ex post facto law as a consequence of Smith v. Doe. It's the foundation for deciding whether a proceeding requires preponderance of the evidence versus proof beyond a reasonable of doubt. The Court has articulated this line in a variety of contexts.",
  "No. As long --",
  "Well, that would probably fail a Necessary and Proper Clause analysis, in which there has to be a showing that the measure is plainly adapted to furthering the underlying power. This is not a difficult problem that the Court has never confronted before. It has resulted in difficult permutations on particular facts, but the Court has always recognized that there is broad Necessary and Proper Clause authority subject to limits. Those limits --",
  "Justice Sotomayor --",
  "There is a sufficient Federal interest in protecting the public from someone who committed a Federal crime. Supervised release essentially performs that function.",
  "It's a valid --",
  "Justice Sotomayor, really, the answer to your question is the same. The answer to all of your questions is the same, which is that there is an analysis that the Court went through in Comstock where it took into consideration history, it took into consideration the nature of the fit between the purpose of Congress and the activity that it was regulated. It took into account the degree to which the State interests were accommodated, and it took into account the degree of attenuation between the regulation and the underlying offense. And it -- it didn't open up Congress to say any offense you've ever committed means Congress owns you for life, it can do whatever you want. It has to pass through an analysis. But the Fifth Circuit never conducted that analysis except for believing that once the individual had completed military service, once the individual had completed his criminal sentence, Congress lost all authority.",
  "Well, it does because when the criminal law finds someone who has violated Federal law, many of the purposes of the sanctions that are imposed on that individual are public protection purposes and anti-recidivism purposes. Most of the things that are done on supervised release fulfill those purposes. If those purposes were not validly connected to taking someone who's violated criminal law and imposing a suite of sanctions on them, then supervised release would apparently be beyond Congress's authority.",
  "As the Court has pointed out numerous times, including in Comstock, there is very little authority in the Constitution in an enumerated way for criminal law at all. All of criminal law, with the exception of a handful of instances that are specified in the Constitution, comes in by virtue of the Necessary and Proper Clause.",
  "But part --",
  "That is inherent in taking somebody who violated Federal law and imposing appropriate sanctions on them for that violation.",
  "It would look essentially the same, Justice Kagan. Somebody who violates a Federal law that's premised on the Commerce Clause, say a sex offender who travels in interstate commerce with the intent to commit a sex offense, has placed himself within the regulatory authority of the Federal government. Now, that individual can be criminally prosecuted for that violation, and that violation furthers Congress's interests in regulating interstate commerce. Congress could also decide, you know, for some of these sex offenders, criminal punishment is not the right approach. The right approach is mandate sex offender rehabilitative counseling. And it might discover that that's so effective for a class of offenders that it's going to apply that even to people whose offenses were committed before the law in question is passed. It can't punish those people based on retroactive legislation, but it can reach them with a civil remedial measure so long as it passes through the Comstock-type analysis of the Necessary and Proper Clause.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I believe that the Fifth Circuit was wrong on that too. As we describe in our brief, Title 42 Section 14072(i)(3) and (4) did, in our view, impose criminal punishment on Respondent for failing to register as a sex offender at the time he was in the military. We think the Fifth Circuit was wrong on that statutory analysis, but, more fundamentally, the Fifth Circuit was wrong in thinking that it mattered whether he was under some sort of Federal criminal jurisdiction at the time that he was released from Federal custody. And if I could reserve the rest of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. As I understand Respondent's argument, Respondent concedes that he could have been put under a lifetime requirement to register with State authorities and punished federally if he did not, if only that requirement had been imposed on him either at the time of sentencing or in a parallel civil proceeding that occurred while he was in the military. This case, therefore, reduces to a question of timing. The essential argument that Respondent is making is that Congress had its -- had its authority expire because it didn't exercise it. There's some sort of notion that Congress must speak now or forever hold its peace.",
  "Well, that's just wrong, Justice Scalia, because this Court made clear in United States ex rel Toth v. Quarles that if an individual has left the military, but hasn't been prosecuted, they can't be court-martialed, but they can be prosecuted in an Article III clause.",
  "But sex offender registration is a consequence of the military crime. That was committed while they were in the military. It's a civil remedy that may, consistent with other constitutional provisions, be imposed retroactively. And this case comes down not to whether any member of the Court agrees with the Ex Post Facto Doctrine analysis in Smith v. Doe or whether there might be due process or other concerns out there, it comes down to whether Congress has Article I authority to say --",
  "Let me make two points about that, Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, a standard condition of Federal supervised release is that the individual shall not violate any Federal, State or local law, and for many sex offenders, supervised release runs for life.",
  "I don't see any relevance that has to Article I authority. It has relevance to other constitutional provisions. So insofar as supervised release does contemplate this longstanding, continuous jurisdiction, that's a feature of Federal law that the Court ought to keep in mind in the way that it writes this opinion. But, second, if Congress passed such a law, it's not that it has carte blanche to do that, it's just that there's no per se rule that says it can't. The Court would --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not going to say no to that question because I don't want to foreclose options that Congress may decide it's appropriate to pass, but the Court --",
  "But the Court does not have to agree that that is constitutional -- may I complete my sentence?",
  "-- in order to uphold this narrowly focused, tailored law that looks at a specific crime and imposes a specific requirement that's directly tied to the nature of that crime.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For over 200 years, the rule in this Court and in all lower courts have been that the grand jury's determination of probable cause is conclusive for purposes of the criminal case, and that rule has been extended, not only to bringing the defendant to trial, but also depriving the defendant of liberty, imposing occupational restrictions on the defendant, imposing firearms restrictions on the defendant.",
  "Well, the parallels, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, illustrate that the process for determining probable cause by a grand jury has been deemed sufficiently reliable, so that further judicial inquiry is not warranted. And that is borne out by two features of the grand jury: One, the way it operates; and, the second, the empirical realities of what it has produced. The grand jury is set up as an independent body to protect the defendant from unfounded prosecutions. It is structurally independent from the prosecution and the courts. And it's composed of ­­",
  "Well, it is a protection in the following sense, Mr. Chief Justice: If the court is seriously considering departing from the universal rule up till now in its cases and in other English­speaking courts and allowing a review of whether there is probable cause after the grand jury has found it, it ought at least to have a good reason for doing so, namely some reason to think that defendants will prevail in a ­­",

Monsanto, considered against the backdrop of Caplin & Drysdale, which said forfeiture of funds that were desired to be used for attorney’s fees is constitutional, then turned to the question of can those funds be restrained, so they will be available for forfeiture at the end of the day.",
  "It's seeking to contradict the determination of probable cause ­­",
  "But it is seeking to contradict the other determination because it's asking the judge to find that there is no probable cause when the grand jury has found that there is probable cause. And the grand jury's determination not only allows the government to bring the defendant to trial, which would be very odd if the court had found that there is really no probable cause for these charges, they are legally invalid.",
  "I think United States v. Monsanto essentially rejected the argument that there is any discretion not to restrain the funds.",
  "I understand that, Justice Breyer. There was analysis of the statute ­­",
  "Exactly.",
  "I­I don't think that there is any serious question that Monsanto meant to preclude free floating discretion. What it did was focus on the question of probable cause, and the Court squarely held that assets in the defendant's possession may be restrained in the way that they were here, based on a finding of probable cause to believe that the assets were forfeitable.",
  "Let­ let me start with the fact that I think that there is harm, and there is very little benefit, and I want to turn to both sides of that empirical equation. Before the Court concludes that, for the first time, a grand jury indictment can be contradicted by a judicial finding that there is no probable cause, albeit on different evidence, the Court should have a good reason to think that grand juries go awry in a sufficient number of cases, so that this hearing which will have costs, as I'll describe, is worth doing. There is no evidence to that effect in the 20 years since Monsanto. Petitioners can point to not a single instance in which a court has concluded there is no probable cause, even though the grand jury found that there is probable cause.",
  "They do this, Mr. Chief Justice, usually with the lawyers who want to get the funds, so they­ they can be hired. And they try to get hearings, and as Justice Kagan pointed out, we have 25 reported cases. I would amend Justice Kagan's statement about those cases in only one respect. In 24 of them, the defendants lost outright. In the 25th one, they won, and they were reversed on appeal. That is accurate. But the district court did not actually find that a grand jury had erred in finding probable cause because that case involved a civil complaint, not a grand jury indictment. What we have is thousands of indictments ­­ hundreds of thousands of indictments over the 10­year period that Respondents have canvassed in talking about Hyde amendment fee awards where courts have found no probable cause for a prosecution. He has pointed to four cases. There have been 660,000 indictments during that time period. The ratio between the cases in which the system didn't work and the grand jury malfunctioned and the cases where it did and where the defendant gets the opportunity for discovery, fishing expeditions ­­",
  "I'm talking about two things, Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, in the D.C. Circuit, Second Circuit, Seventh Circuit, and elsewhere in the country, where the law is not established, defendants can seek these hearings. In the 20 years that they have been available to be sought, not one has produced a finding of no probable cause.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I agree with you that those cases exist. Anecdotally, they exist, where the government determines that the cost of exposing its witnesses, the dangers to witnesses, the potential undermining of the integrity of the trial, makes it too high a price to go through this hearing or ­­",
  "No. That doesn't always work, Mr. Chief Justice. Let's keep in mind that this statute operates, in its core, in drug trafficking cases, in serious organized criminal cases, where the exposure of the identities of the government's witnesses can lead to serious problems of obstruction of justice. This is the real cost of these kinds of hearings.",
  "We do face them. I cannot quantify them ­­",
  "You're correct, I did ask, and I received anecdotal responses.",
  "I received several specific anecdotes of instances in which the government elected not to proceed with a hearing.",
  "There are group numbers, in which offices reported, we have encountered this a number of times.",
  "No, it's­ it’s not just that, Mr. Chief Justice. These assets are generally used to pay restitution to victims of crime.",
  "And if the assets are paid out to attorneys, although in theory, as Justice Scalia explained, it is possible, under the relation back principle, to go into the attorneys' files and into their assets and recover them, in practice, it is not so easy to do because ­­",
  "What's wrong with it is that it basically compels the government to try the entire case in a preliminary hearing before the case has even resulted in a ­­",
  "The frequency of these hearings is limited, in part, because it's rare that defendants are able to show that they have no other assets ­­",
  "And also, the stark unlikelihood that the defense will prevail, unless the government is forced not to go through with the hearing because of concerns about which ­­",
  "I­ I don't, Justice Breyer. I do know that one of the main purposes in seeking funds for forfeiture, particularly in white collar cases like this, is to pay restitution.",
  "No, I'm not sure that it is a fair comment. In this case, for example, the government does believe that the medical providers from which these medical supplies were obtained and then sold into the black market by agents of a company are victims of the crime. They received restitution in the prosecution of one of the co­conspirators in this case, and that is the way the government is planning to proceed. If the defense is able to come up and, based on case law that really has very little to do with any situation like this, has to do with the idea that public officials who receive bribes haven't deprived the State of its entitlement to that bribe money ­­ that's the lead case that the defendants argue.",
  "If the defendant seeks one, yes. And there was the opportunity in this case for a hearing and the defendants ­­",
  "Yes. The defendants are entitled to show that the assets that are restrained are not actually the proceeds of the charged criminal offense or another way ­­",
  "That would be up to this Court's decision.",
  "I'd be happy to have the defendants bear the burden of proof, but I think the courts, typically, have placed the burden of proof on the government to show traceability, and the government, therefore, presents limited evidence, but it's all against the background of the crime not being called into question.",
  "I think typically, Justice Kennedy, the government makes a proffer of the evidence that it intends to use. The proffer is very limited, it's hearsay, it's a description of the crime, rather than a detailed evidentiary presentation of the kind that Petitioners want here.",
  "I do not think that ­­ typically resting on the indictment alone will satisfy the weight of the evidence factor. But the hearing that is provided for in Salerno is not a hearing that this Court has said, you must do as a matter of due process. It is what Congress has established as a requirement in the Bail Reform Act. When it comes to due process ­­",
  "It's not the same inquiry. The Bail Act hearings are usually very summary. They don’t involve calling witnesses. They do not involve sworn testimony.",
  "They can do both of those things. This is largely within the discretion of district courts. The Second Circuit, which probably has the most experience with these hearings under Monsanto, has held that hearsay evidence is sufficient to meet the government's burden of probable cause. What happens, then, are frequently excruciating fishing expedition, cross­examinations of the government agent in the defense efforts to attempt to find out more about the government's case, to ask for additional documents, to make later claims that Brady evidence wasn't produced in connection with the Monsanto hearing and various sanctions should fall on the government. And the hearings do generally take the form of efforts by defense to obtain some strategic advantage. They have never resulted in the finding of no probable cause. And the­ the court's question, I think, here is, really, is there anything on the defendant's side of the scale, other than the abstract desire to use money that the government says is forfeitable to pay for attorneys?",
  "The difficulty is that we have to actually trace the specific assets into the defendant's own accounts , and if the defendant's lawyer has spent that money and has used ­­ you know, paid it out in salary, paid it out in expenses, it's gone, the government can't make that tracing argument. It can't forfeit substitute assets from the attorney, so it has to go under some State law theory and then sue the lawyers and then argue that the funds were held in constructive trust for the government. State law varies widely on this. It's a big, messy, uncertain project, and as a result, it doesn't happen very often. Typically, if the funds are released to the attorneys, they will be gone. And if the defendant is, at the end of the day, convicted of a serious financial crime and the government wants those assets available to compensate investors, to compensate victims of Food and Drug violations, the funds are not there. They have been spent on an attorney. And under this Court's decision in Caplin & Drysdale, those funds were never the defendant's funds at all. What happens is that they may have been released because the government chose, at a hearing, not to contest probable cause because it would suffer the kinds of ill effects that Justice Alito referred to, and that kind of ­­ \"blackmail\" may be too strong of a word, but it does put the government in a very ­­",
  "Well, that would be ­­",
  "Those high bars would be helpful. But once the defendant clears them, the government faces the same pressures. And at the end of the day, the same consequence is going to occur, that if the judge does find in that one in a million case, which has not yet been encountered, that there was no probable cause for the indictment, you will have the defendant proceeding on to trial in a judicial system that is honoring the finding of the grand jury after the judge has concluded to the contrary. And ­­",
  "It's different in the bail context because the ­­ the judge at the bail hearing is never questioning probable cause. He's only questioning whether the evidence is sufficient to justify restraining the defendant. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 302 cannot be read in isolation from the remainder of the labor laws. The United States does not dispute that if all this Court had to look at was the words \"thing of value\" in Section 302, the promises that were at issue in this case could be viewed as things of value and, with a little bit of stretching of the language, could be viewed as paid, lent, or delivered.",
  "We don't, Justice Alito. The Eleventh Circuit did hold that Mulhall had standing and there ­­ we raised a question of whether the case is moot at the certiorari stage as a reason why this Court may not want to take the case. But we have not drilled deeply enough into it to have a position on that question.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, it seems to have been accepted historically and, as my co­counsel mentioned, it was referenced in dictum by this Court; it's been accepted by the lower courts. I think if this Court were looking at the language of the statute today, Section 10(e) of Section 302(e) of the statute, which is on page 11a of ­­ of our brief, gives the district courts jurisdiction to hear violations of this case ­­ of this statute, and courts have assumed that private parties could invoke that. If the Court were looking at that afresh, I'm not sure that it would reach that result. But there is a lot of ink on the page with respect to it. The Eleventh Circuit did not reach that issue and it doesn't seem to be squarely presented here. But what is squarely presented here is whether the Court should read Section 302 as a freestanding provision divorced from the central policy of the labor laws and the remaining provisions in the labor laws. Now, as Justice Sotomayor ­­",
  "I think ­­",
  "Well, under this statute, the government's position is that the three terms that are at issue ­­ \"neutrality,\" \"access,\" and \"employee list\" ­­ are not prohibited by Section 302. Probably the best way to reach that conclusion is to determine that Congress did not intend that these three things be viewed as things of value under the statute. Certainly, read in isolation, the words \"thing of value\" are very broad. In other statutes, they cover intangibles. We would have no problem treating the things here as things of value under statutes or under 302 if that's the only thing that existed.",
  "Yes, I think it is, Justice Sotomayor. What the Court has to do here, as it did in the Billing case, is read multiple statutes together in order to harmonize them. And just as in Billing, the Court said, well, the antitrust laws literally do apply here, the securities underwriting activity could violate the antitrust laws. The Court looked at it in light of other policies reflected in the securities laws and determined that Congress, having established an intricate framework for regulation of the very same activity in the securities laws, would not have intended the antitrust laws to come along and supplant it. And here what you have are ­­",
  "I don't think that ­­",
  "Billing is simply an application of this Court's responsibility to divine Congress's intent based on language, structure, and history and policy of the relevant laws. And here, all of those things when read together indicate that agreements by parties to set the ground rules for an organizing campaign do not constitute prohibited things.",
  "Yes. That would be a violation.",
  "Neutrality.",
  "Two things, Justice Breyer, and they're both equally important. First of all, the ­­ the provision of money is useful to the union in any number of ways and gives rise to the dangers of misuse.",
  "It can't be ­­ it can't be restricted in that way because the origins of Section 302 came from ­­",
  "The other is that reading the policies of the Act as a whole, we start from the proposition, which is undisputed by Respondent and reveals that his purportedly literal application of Section 302 just does not wash. We start from the proposition that voluntary recognition of a union is not only permissible under the National Labor Relations Act, it's a favored element of national labor policy. The voluntary reconciliation of agreement, of disputes between labor and management is what this Act drives at.",
  "If I could just finish this one point, Mr. Chief justice, to answer Justice Breyer's question.",
  "The three procedures that are at issue here are all procedures that are useful and geared towards facilitating voluntary recognition and are only useful for that purpose.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Well, this Court in the Gissel Packing case many years ago rejected that argument. The National Labors Relation Board has rejected that argument. Certainly ­­",
  "Card check agreements are inherently coercive, yes. That has been rejected.",
  "I don't think they're coercive at all inherently. They may be ­­",
  "Well, some would argue ­­",
  "Some would argue that employers also have big guys and it's very coercive to have your employer in there on the factory floor reminding employees daily that they're very anti­union and that there are a lot of costs to joining a union. And so the ­­ the process here is one in which, yes, the parties can go to the National Labor Relations Board and have an election. But this Court in the Gissel Packing case, backed up by decades of Board law, has validated that card check agreements are perfectly legitimate and may facilitate the employees' free exercise of their choice to have a union. The agreement in this case doesn't recognize the union. All the agreement does is establish a perfectly lawful process, which Respondent concedes would be a thing of value, but he then has to carve it out from Section 302, a voluntary recognition agreement. And the access that is given to the property, which is something that employers lawfully can do ­­ it's their property, they have the right to do it ­­ they provide it so that the employees can get information from the union about unionization. And the employee list serves the same thing. And these things ­­ access, employee list, neutrality ­­ have been elements of Federal labor policy for decades.",
  "All of the courts of appeals, Justice Ginsburg, have concluded that ground rules agreements are inherently lawful. The Eleventh Circuit added a motive­based limitation on it that responded to a policy that's just not reflected in the language of the Act.",
  "That's right. The union's promises are not comprehended by Section 302. All that's at issue here is whether it's a Federal crime for an employer to say to a union: You guys want to organize? I will let you come into my plant and address the employees. In fact, better yet, we will have a debate, management on one side, union on the other. Come into our hall to do that. That would be a Federal crime under Respondents' view. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As Justice Breyer indicated, there really are three stark choices before the Court in this case. Paroline's position is that, because of a proximate causation requirement, Amy can obtain nothing in restitution. Amy's position is that, because multiple people have contributed to her single loss, she can obtain the full restitution for all of her losses from every criminal defendant. The government's position is that there is a solution that tort law has developed for providing some restitution for Amy, not the entire restitution that would be owed on account of her entire loss.",
  "I agree with that, Justice Scalia.",
  "Okay. The ­­ the tort law issue is not really all that modern. It dates back to the Restatement (Second) of Torts in Section 443(a). And this Court applied that section in the Burlington Northern case, which was a CERCLA case, to hold that apportionment of the damages was required in a pollution case, where all the pollution had merged into a single ­­",
  "Justice Sotomayor, I think that the key to reading the statutory language is that the definition of \"victim\" refers to a victim of the offense in this case. So the term \"victim\" means the individual harmed as a result of a commission of a crime under this chapter. The government's burden of proof in Section 3664(e) refers to demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as a result of the offense. So it refers to the defendant's offense, not to the collective harm that the ­­",
  "I don't think so.",
  "I hope that the Court will read the \"as a result of\" language to require causation, but to interpret it in light of the way causation has been understood in the unique circumstances that you have here.",
  "There's collective, aggregate but­for cause. And the way that tort law dealt with this is not to accept Paroline's position that, even if it ­­ you took me out of the equation, Amy's harm would be very severe. Unquestionably true. What tort law said is that, if a multiplicity of actors inflict a single harm and one of them comes forward with a reason that, if accepted, would exonerate all of them, then that cannot be a proper test of causation. The proper test is aggregate causation, where the aggregate group of offenders is the but­for cause, and each one of the individuals in that set can be regarded as ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, that would allow assessment of some of the damages. I ­­ I don't think that it would allow assessment of the entire amount because, again, we regard this ­­ this statute as enacted against the backdrop of tort law principles that recognized you can have aggregate causation, but it's not appropriate to hold each person in the set responsible for all.",
  "If there's a specific amount of harm caused and if Amy could find an expert who would testify to that respect and it would require, say, six counseling sessions, and it would set her back in employment for a year, then I guess a court could, if it found that credible, conclude that a certain amount of loss is attributable directly ­­",
  "Justice Scalia, I think that is consistent with the conclusion that the government reaches, although we take a different route to it ­­",
  "­­ than Your Honor's position.",
  "Justice Alito, that is why the government has proposed a different approach to getting to the same conclusion.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, the courts have approved several different formulas as not being an abuse of discretion. One camp of courts approves a view in which the government submits the number of people who have been ordered to pay restitution to Amy, and that number is then divided into the total harm, measured by monetary means, that Amy has established. And that provides a starting point. So, for example, in this case, that starting point would be around $18,000, and then courts can adjust that.",
  "By considering the number of defendants who have been ordered to pay restitution to Amy because that provides some certainty in the face of, as Justice Alito pointed out, the great difficulty in determining how many people have actually viewed these pictures ­­",
  "­­ the number of people who have been ordered to pay to restitution represents a judicial finding that, in fact, her picture is involved in that person's offense.",
  "That is correct. And some courts, Justice Ginsburg, have, therefore, required that the formula be adjusted to make some sort of reasonable estimate of the total pool of violators. And so I ­­",
  "It doesn't work very well for the first person, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "And for that reason, I think there are other approaches that do work.",
  "The Court can certainly say that the statute requires reasonable apportionment ­­",
  "­­ and the districts courts have jurisdiction to experiment with different formulations.",
  "They could recommend a ­­ an approach. What the sentencing commission actually did was recommend to Congress that it fix it because the disagreements now pertain to the understanding of the statute. Our submission is that there are a variety of ways to approach this problem. None is perfect.",
  "The alternative that I would propose in that instance is to look at other similarly situated child pornography victims and take a look at what district courts have been awarding to those victims in similar types of cases and provide some sort of an average range.",
  "I hope that it's not quite as arbitrary as plucking it out of the air, but the reality is ­­",
  "On the first one, it's impossible to ­­",
  "They are using some theory.",
  "I think that, sometimes, they articulate various considerations, and other times, they rely on basically a consensus ­­ a judicial consensus that in a world in which perfect information and mathematical computations are not going to happen, a reasonable approximation that accords with the judgments of 200 other Federal judges is a sensible way to do this. And I ­­",
  "We would, as I indicated, start with a ­­ a division problem and approximate the ­­ the number of damages that are allocable to that individual and then adjust it because these defendants are not all identical.",
  "Not necessarily because, as I indicated, Mr. Chief Justice, the defendants aren't all identical. Mr. Paroline possessed two images. Some defendants may possess a hundred images. Some defendants may be distributors, as well as possessors, and courts have taken those factors into account.",
  "Yes, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "Well, his ­­ his restitution may have been predicated on a very early period, where it was not clear that Amy would be as victimized as she has turned out to be. The very vice of child pornography possession and distribution is that it continually re­inflicts the abuse on the victim, so that she cannot make a fresh start and say it's finally over, I've put this behind me, I can now move on with my life. The continuing re­victimization of her is what justifies and creates the increased harms.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, the ­­ the formula that I proposed is the one that the government has been suggesting to district courts around the country. Look at the number of convicted defendants who have been ordered to pay restitution to Amy, divide that into the total harm that the district court finds was the result of the community of child pornography possessors and then adjust it based on the severity of the offense. Courts of appeals have said that other formulations are also not abuses of the district court's discretion, and I would emphasize ­­",
  "That's the amount of money that Amy has asked for.",
  "Well, in criminal ­­",
  "Well, Justice Scalia ­­",
  "Post Booker ­­",
  "­­ post Booker, that is what happens in criminal sentencing. District judges have an enormous amount of discretion about how much imprisonment time and fine time to use to apply to a defendant. And there is appellate review that helps establish some norms that can look to sentencing guidelines as starting points. But in criminal sentencing, imprecision and estimation is the order of the day. And when you're dealing with ­­",
  "But there are two background principles that I think reinforce that a reasonable estimation is better than all or none. The first background principle is that, in criminal restitution, exactitude is not required. Reasonable estimates are the order of the day. Courts have recognized that. And it's reinforced here by the fact that this restitution provision is kind of a crime/tort hybrid. It's criminal sentencing, but it's enacted against the background of compensatory tort law. And in compensatory tort law, reasonable estimates have long been accepted. In the Burlington Northern case that I referred to earlier, the district court made an effort to do some calculations, and then, at the end, he applied a 50 percent \"fudge factor\" for estimations that reflected possible calculation errors.",
  "It is a criminal provision ­­",
  "­­ that is ­­ that is placed into criminal sentencing with a goal of both compensating victims and determining that each defendant comes face to face with the fact that that person has inflicted some harm on a particular victim. That's a valuable criminal sentencing purpose, and to the extent that the only thing that courts can do in this situation is attempt reasonable approximations, that will not be exact, it's a better solution than saying nothing, as Paroline would do, or saying Amy ­­ everything, as Amy would do. That is not proportionate to what the defendant has done, but zero is also grossly disproportionate to what the defendant has done. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think that it may be helpful to the Court, before exploring possible alternatives to a categorical Robinson rule, to at least briefly understand why there is a categorical Robinson rule and how cell phones implicate many of those concerns. The categorical Robinson rule responded to the fact that when a person is carrying something on their person and they are subject to a legitimate probable cause arrest, their expectations of privacy are considerably reduced. Not eliminated, but considerably reduced. And the government, on the other hand, has several very compelling interests at the moment of arrest that are vindicated by conducting a thorough search of the person and the things he has. It avoids the destruction of evidence. It protects officer safety. And it allows the discovery of evidence that's relevant to the crime of arrest to enable prosecution.",
  "So several answers to that, Justice Ginsburg. The first is that you could probably say the same thing about almost everything that is seized under Robinson and Edwards. Once it's in the police's hands, they can throw it in the back of the patrol car in the trunk, and it would be safe and they could go get a warrant. But the balance has always been struck at the moment of arrest to allow the officers to fulfill the compelling interests in the matters that I've previously described. The second, and I think very critical thing about cell phones is they do differ in the amount of information that a person can carry on them and the amount of revelation about a person's life. That is true. They also differ in that they greatly facilitate criminal activity. They contain a great deal of evidence, and most critically, they are subject to destruction in a way that ordinary physical items are not. Even if an officer has a cell phone in his hand, he cannot guarantee, unless it's disconnected from the network or somehow protected from the network, that there won't be a remote wipe signal sent to the phone that will wipe its data.",
  "I have anecdotal reports from the F.B.I. that that has happened, that they have looked into the question of to what extent can you protect a phone through the use of things like Faraday bags. I think one of the important things to notice, if you throw a phone into a Faraday bag, which is supposedly going to be able to block network signals, when you open it up, it has to be similarly shielded or it will pick up a signal from a cell tower, and that will wipe the phone. And the F.B.I. tried to build a Faraday room in a building that they later discovered Verizon had put up a cell tower on it, and that cell tower put out a strong enough signal to go right through the Faraday room.",
  "I can't speak, Justice Breyer, for the experience in those States.",
  "I don't have any access to the information about that.",
  "Well, I think that there is clearly the technology available and growing technology to wipe phones remotely. But the other critical problem that comes back to Justice Ginsburg's point about getting a warrant is encryption technology is increasingly being deployed in cell phones. That is something that clearly is on the rise. And when a phone is turned off or the lock kicks in and the phone encrypts, it can be almost impossible to get into it.",
  "Can I answer that one first?",
  "First of all, it is not always possible to find airplane mode on all the 500, 600 models of phones that are out there. The officer has a lot of things to do when he arrests suspects. Say he arrests five suspects in a car and they each have three cell phones. Trying to find and put each one of them into airplane mode and then go the further step and ­­",
  "Well, that's not necessarily true, Justice Sotomayor.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, you don't necessarily have enough time to get the warrant if you do it at the scene. That ­­ that's certainly true. I think even ­­",
  "Even if you bring it back ­­ the assumption that we're going to have airplane mode and that the Court should craft a constitutional rule around airplane mode assumes that cell phones are not going to be able to be used in airplanes in the next five years and that manufacturers will continue to make an easily available button for airplane mode. I don't think the Court should found a constitutional ruling on that assumption.",
  "I think what I'm trying to suggest, Justice Sotomayor, is the traditional justifications for search­incident­to­arrest include the potential for destruction of evidence. That is very real today. It's Petitioner who's asking for a new rule. We're asking for the application of the Robinson rule, and if the Court is not willing to apply the Robinson rule, then primarily, I think the best rule to apply would be the ­­",
  "The attorney's briefcase may present particularized problems because of attorney­client privilege.",
  "No. I was referring ­­",
  "I ­­ I was referring ­­ I was referring to the privilege rule. The lower courts that have looked at it; this Court has not. Lower courts that have looked at the question have said that if a person is arrested holding a briefcase, the police can open the briefcase, whether locked or unlocked, and look at its contents. They can't just go through the contents for prurient interest. They can look, however, for evidence that's relevant to criminal activity, and they do that in a way that is minimally invasive of privacy. They're not just doing it for the sake of doing it. They're looking for evidence.",
  "Yes, and I ­­ and I ­­ I would acknowledge, Justice Kennedy, that if the Court is looking for a rule that limits the ability of police to search cell phones, because cell phones are different from paper items in some respects, but not all, that the most reasonable rule to apply would be one that says when there is reason to believe that there's evidence of the crime of arrest on the phone, the officers can look for that. When there is not, they can't. That will ­­",
  "Justice Kagan, I would acknowledge that your reasoning is correct in certain circumstances and for certain crimes. It would not be the case for a jaywalking crime or a bar fight or many other of the minor crimes, seat belt violations, that are posited on the other side of the equation for Respondent's or Petitioner's narrower approach to cell phone searches. But I do think that a couple of things are worth thinking about. First, in a serious offense like a firearms offense in this case, a drug offense in Wurie, if the police didn't ­­ went, got a warrant, they would be looking at all the same things, because the only way to execute the warrant on the phone would be to engage in at least a cursory search of everything on the phone to see whether it related.",
  "Well, I ­­",
  "I ­­ I'm not sure that I would go so far as to say the neutral magistrate can narrow the warrant in any way that he sees appropriate. This Court's decisions in Grubbs and Dalia say that it's not appropriate for the magistrate to prescribe the manner of executing the search. But I think the more fundamental point, and this is why I tried to start with the basic bedrock of Robinson, is that there is a different balance ­­",
  "There is a different balance at the moment of the arrest. At that moment society's interests are at their apogee in locating evidence relating to the crime of arrest and apprehending related suspects, and the suspect has a highly reduced privacy interest.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The facts of this case, United States v. Wurie, I think, illustrate why any categorical rule that would preclude searches of cell phones incident to arrest would be inconsistent with historical practice and detrimental to law enforcement. This is a case where what the officers did was see a phone ringing. On the outside screen, the caller was identified as \"my house.\" The officers opened up the phone, pressed one button to see that the call came in from \"my house\" and pressed another to see what the phone number was. That's all they did. That kind of a search serves valid, time­honored functions in the search situation of helping to ascertain the identity of the offender. This was a crucial fact because a few minutes later, Wurie lied about where he lived, which was relevant to the police ultimately obtaining a warrant to search his house. They didn't know where he was. They would not be able to ­­",
  "Justice Sotomayor, you could almost always say in search­incident­to­arrest cases that the police could have gotten a warrant. It's ­­ I'm not talking about cases where somebody is carrying a gun and the police take the gun off them and ­­ and they secure it that way. But in all of the other cases that you could imagine that involve searches for evidence, letters, which occur in the historical cases; billfolds, which have been discussed here, once the officer has it, you could say the officer shouldn't be able to look in it because that could be done under a warrant. There's no time constraint. There's no destruction of evidence constraint. Here, in fact, there actually is a destruction­of­evidence threat with respect to the general category of cell phones, and that's what this Court has been asked to look at, the general category, cell phones and smartphones. We discussed earlier the threat of remote wiping and whether airplane mode is an effective counter to that. There is the other threat that I think is even more critical to law enforcement today, and that is encryption. Because if the phone turns off and becomes encrypted, officers can go to the magistrate and ask for a warrant, but it may be months or years or never if they can break through the encryption and actually obtain the evidence. So to the extent that the traditional destruction­of­evidence rationale justified the search of a cell phone or justified the search of traditional items, it applies even more strongly with respect to cell phones than it does with most of the items that might be seized from a person. So Wurie, I think ­­",
  "No. As best I understand it, Justice Sotomayor, many smartphones today are equipped with built­in encryption. Apple has hardware encryption and software encryption. Samsung and HTC and other brands are quickly following with strong encryption. The encryption is deployed in a way that if you don't have the key, the data that's on the phone is useless. The key is often stored in memory and it's accessible only when you can get into the phone. Now, if the phone is on and functioning because the person has been arrested while they are, for example, making a phone call, you can get access to the phone and you can attempt to get information from the phone without the encryption key being an obstacle. But if the encryption is deployed, that can sometimes be an insuperable barrier even to the manufacturer.",
  "Well, no. The ­­ the evidence is ­­ the information on the phone is encrypted ­­ this is my understanding, Justice Sotomayor ­­ but the phone itself has the key to decrypt it because the user obviously wants to get access to the information.",
  "So if you have an iPhone, Justice Breyer, and I don't know what kind of phone that you have ­­",
  "It's encrypted. And that's the problem. The phones are set up to protect the data and I think this is something also revealing about ­­",
  "Not all criminals are so clever that they manage ­­",
  "I think ­­",
  "Yeah. And I ­­ my response to you is that having tried to ascertain the empirical reality of this problem, it is greatly feared by law enforcement. We've documented that by the numerous studies, the National Institute of Standards and Technology study that talks about the grave concerns that encryption's raised. It's not the biggest problem if you get the phone in an active state and you can begin to look through it. It does have unpredictable capabilities of becoming encrypted if it's turned off or if certain apps are deployed on it. And for that reason ­­",
  "A lot of these searches occur, Justice Sotomayor, at the side of the road where the officer opens ­­ in the Riley case, the officer opened the phone right on the heels of the arrest and he immediately saw evidence that the individual was a gang member, something that he hadn't had personal knowledge of before, because every letter K was preceded by a C, which indicated to him it meant Crip killer, which indicated he was a member of the Bloods gang. So it's a very common thing for officers to take advantage of the information that's on a phone just the way that they would take advantage of the information that's on a person to find out who they are dealing with. And I think it was asked in the Riley argument whether there were instances in which phones have been used to trigger dangers. And there are instances in which people have used their cell phones right before an arrest to call in a posse of their accomplices to basically attack the police. And by looking at the cell phone quickly, if it's available to the ­­ to the officers, they can look quickly and see if there was a text sent in the last five minutes or a phone call that might actually protect their safety, which is another one of the traditional justifications of search incident to arrest. This is a categorical exception, as the Court recognized twice last term, both in Maryland v. King decision and in the McNeely decision, the Court recognized that search­incident­to­arrest was a categorical exception to the normal warrant requirement.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I would not be able to answer a question about what condition most cell phones are found in. The fact that this issue has arisen repeatedly in cases across the country indicates that at least in a significant number of cases, the phones are not locked and the officers are able to obtain access to the information. Now, if they are not able to obtain access to the information, I want to tie this back to things that could give the Court some comfort if the Court were concerned about the possibility for police searching too much evidence in cell phones that's not relevant to the crime for which the person is arrested or his identity. Now, we talked earlier about the crime of arrest limitation, which I think would screen out a great many, not all, minor crimes. The Court has, at least in the Welsh v. Wisconsin case, talking about exigent circumstances justifying an entry into the home, distinguished between serious and minor crimes. That's another possible line that the Court could explore. I'm not as much in favor of that one because I do think that the officers have an interest in determining, no matter who they have arrested, who that person is, because the person could pose an unknown threat even if they are stopped only for a traffic violation. Ascertaining their identity through their cell phone is a useful way to do that. There are also potential duration limits on a search­incident­to­arrest. As its name indicates, it's incident to the arrest, and this Court's decisions have described the lowering or reduction of expectation of privacy of an arrestee as occurring for a reasonable time and to a reasonable extent after the arrest, then other Fourth Amendment doctrines kick in. So to the extent that most of these searches are going to occur either at the scene of the arrest ­­",
  "Okay. Well, that ­ that is my last potential limiting principle. This Court need not consider in this case the consequences of downloading the entire contents of a cellphone to a UFED, a universal forensic extraction device which the briefs have talked about. That didn't happen in either of these cases. These cases involve manual searches of the information that's available to the user of the phone. Once the information has been captured into an electronic database separately in an extraction device, there is at least an argument that at that point the evidence is preserved and potentially the warrant requirement would have a different application, at least if the search of that forensic database was going to go beyond ascertaining identity and verifying officer safety considerations. The Court does not need to examine that in this case. It may well be that expectations of privacy do not exist as to information that the user himself can quickly access on a phone, the kind of thing the police are likely to look at when they make an arrest because they are interested in developing evidence that relates to the crime, protecting their safety and ascertaining identity. They are not really interested in going through all an arrestee's medical records and photographs and so forth.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, I think that would be something that officers would have to develop protocols based on changing technology to address. We do not claim here the authority to use the phone to access data that is not on the phone, in the cloud, and it may well be that in the future more information will migrate to the cloud, less will be on the phone, and that may shift what the officers can actually do.",
  "So to the extent that that is true, Justice Kagan, law enforcement officers, to ensure they're complying with the Fourth Amendment, would have to take the phone off the network. And that is best practices. It's discussed in all of the forensic manuals that we cited to the Court. You want to take the phone off the network to avoid the remote wiping problem, to avoid corruption of data through new data coming in. It's sound forensic practice to do that and it also serves what we think is a limiting principle. Again, the Court doesn't have to decide that limiting principle in this case. There's no claim that any cloud data was accessed in this case. We're only saying that the search­incident­to­arrest doctrine serves a valuable function, serves a particularly valuable function with cellphones, because they are so commonly used as the medium of the commission of crimes. They are carrying the same kind of information that the individual previously would have carried in paper and it seems somehow a little odd to say that because information has migrated from paper onto a smartphone that the officers have a critical need to obtain ­­",
  "Yes, Justice Kennedy, I do. The first one that I think has been discussed in both arguments and Justice Scalia has brought it up as well, is that the evidence to be searched, unless there's some exigency, should be relevant to the crime of arrest and the Court can articulate that in a way that would prevent roving searches or speculative searches.",
  "So I don't think it's necessarily ­­",
  "In the Riley case, the guns were under the hood and the arresting officers found a green bandana and some red and white Converse shoes, I believe.",
  "No. The crime of arrest was the firearms in Riley. It was only after they found ­­",
  "­­ the firearms in the impound search did they actually conduct the arrest. And at that point the ultimate search that occurred was because there was a known propensity of gang members to document their use of firearms in pictures. And so that's what the arresting officer was looking for. It's no different than what he would have looked for on the arrestee's person in his wallet. So it wasn't the kind of cloud­based search, search into health records. It was a scope­focused search. So I think that there are limiting principles, Justice Kennedy, that you referred to. One is when the officer is looking for crime of arrest­related material and there is evidence that can be plausibly said is crime of arrest­related material on the phone, he can look for that. The Court could couple that, if it wasn't satisfied that that was a sufficient limitation, with a scope­based limit which would say that you can't look everywhere on the phone where there's no realistic chance that there's going to be evidence related to the crime of arrest. You can't just rove through the phone. You need to keep a scope focus. And that can be enforced and would be enforced by defendants, I can assure you, through post hoc litigation and suppression. And the police would have to conform their conduct to the constraints of the Fourth Amendment in conducting the search.",
  "It would depend on the crime. So if you were looking for evidence related to the crime of possession of child pornography, you could certainly go through photographs. If you were looking for another crime, potentially drug trafficking, you would look for things like drug ledgers, recent contacts, lists of customers and not necessarily in videos.",
  "So, Mr. Chief Justice, to the extent that you think that's an inevitable generalization and there is a certain way of looking at it in which that's correct, then the interposition of a warrant requirement would do nothing because the warrant would say, search the cell phone for evidence related to drug trafficking and then the phone would be searched in exactly that manner.",
  "It may be in some places and not in others.",
  "I don't know that you are, Justice Breyer.",
  "So, Justice Breyer, it varies considerably in the 50 States and the Federal Government depending on where you are, the availability of magistrates, the complexity of the case. I would differentiate this from the McNeely case, where the Court was pretty confident that you could get a warrant quickly. The reason that the Court could be pretty confident about that is drunk driving is a very simple crime, and the officer has very simple observations in order to validate it and there are forms that can be prepared to get a warrant. With the great ­­ we're talking now about every crime for which people are arrested.",
  "And the facts are going to be more complicated.",
  "That is a special rule for the search­incident­to­arrest content. It's ­­ we've discussed a variety of special rules, but that rule completely compromises the interests in search­incident­to­arrest, because they have always assumed that the interest in police discovering evidence that could help them in the prosecution, that could protect their safety, and that would avoid destruction is paramount given the reduced expectations of privacy of the arrestee.",
  "No. And this is why I ­­ I hope that I can make this clearer, because the encryption problem is what makes it impossible for the police to be confident that you can take the time to go and get a warrant and you won't lose the data forever. Encryption kicks in when the phone is turned to a setting that automatically will occur on most modern cell phones that turns the phone off and then the phone's contents become encrypted and that's when you need the password to open it up. And if you don't have that password, you're not going to be able to do it. And law enforcement's forensic labs aren't going to be able to get around it in ­­ except with extraordinary efforts and extraordinary time. So we're not talking about the difference here between two minutes to get the warrant and looking at the information. It may be months if you don't take advantage of looking at it.",
  "Now, it ­­ I think that one of the interesting things that Petitioner did in the Riley case was append to the back of his brief a couple of pictures of Apple's iPhone 5 on how you could go into the phone, if the phone is configured in the way that it was in the pictures that he took, and disable the auto lock feature. What Petitioner did not do was provide similar information for the 500 or so other phones that are on the market and that will be on the market in the coming years so that police officers will be equipped with a manual that will probably be as thick as the New York City telephone book with the various procedures that are needed to prevent any phone from going into an encryption mode and becoming inaccessible. They don't know that at the time they seize the phone, Justice Breyer, and that's why exigent circumstances, unless it's done as a categorical rule, because I did not know whether this phone would encrypt, I searched it, unless you do that, then you are basically putting the officers at the mercy of technology, which will increasingly be able to defeat their ability to conduct the kind of routine searches that they have always conducted in the past.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, it's an arms race between the forensic capabilities of law enforcement labs and the abilities of cell phone manufacturers and criminals to devise technologies that will thwart them. And they will leapfrog each other at times and there may be periods when law enforcement has the advantage and there may be period where ­­ periods where those people who want to protect against revelation of data on the phone will succeed. And my only point here is that it would not be a wise rule for this Court to announce, based on today's technology and reasonable projections of technology, that the police will just easily be able to go and get a warrant, because my experience from the people that I had spoken with is that a lot of phones are arriving at the lab in a locked and encrypted state and it's very tough to deal with that. And if the Court does have concerns, as many members of the Court have expressed, about applying, lock stock and barrel, the traditional Robinson rule, there are weigh stations and compromise positions. This case, I think, as California pointed out, both this case and Riley, don't really involve totally unpacking somebody's life from their smartphone. And I'm not suggesting that the Court should resolve these cases by announcing a rule that's just limited to the facts of the cases. But if the Court is looking to preserve some areas for protection, we've talked about limiting the justification for a search, limiting the scope of a search, limiting the duration of a search, and limiting the intensity in the sense of confining it to what can be found manually on the phone.",
  "Justice Breyer, the reason why Robinson adopted a categorical rule is it concluded that such case­by­case adjudication for officers in the field is completely infeasible. And when balancing the important law enforcement interests against the reduced expectations of privacy, Robinson struck a categorical balance. Reverting to an exigent circumstances analysis here would unstabilize all of the law under Robinson.",
  "So, Justice Sotomayor, I'm not entirely sure how to articulate that principle, but if it fits within the crime of arrest plus identity principle, then I think it would be a reasonable fallback position. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A search incident to arrest has always been considered a reasonable search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and I think this case illustrates why that principle well applies to a cell phone.",
  "So Justice Sotomayor, the Fourth Amendment doesn't actually say you do need a warrant. It does protect the right against unreasonable seizures, and it describes what warrants must contain.",
  "That's exactly right. That's the textual prohibition. This Court has created language in its jurisprudence that prefers warrants in certain circumstances, but as the Court recognized in McNealey last term and in Maryland v. King, the search incident to arrest doctrine is a categorical exception and this case illustrates why. The information that was found on the phone was very time sensitive and important to law enforcement. It helped fulfill the typical purposes, the categorical purposes of the search incident to arrest doctrine. It helped verify identity, it helped solve the crime that ­­ for which the individual was arrested, and it was done in a reasonable and nonintrusive manner. There was nothing about this search that exposed reams of private data to view. To the extent that the data was not in a call log really subject to a reasonable expectation of privacy at all, it was discovered in a search but I think that underscores why the search was limited and reasonable. So this case really, I think, exemplifies why a categorical rule that respondent urges in this case would not be appropriate, and we submit that this Court should reverse the Court of Appeals. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court does have jurisdiction to decide the question of Miller's retroactivity, because Louisiana has voluntarily incorporated into its law a wholly Federal standard. And in this Court's decisions in Standard Oil, Merrell Dow, Three Affiliated Tribes, and most recently, Ohio v. Reiner, the Court has recognized that when a State chooses to adopt Federal law to guide its decisions and binds itself to Federal law, there is a Federal question.",
  "The United States ­­",
  "That's right.",
  "That's right. And the same is true in any Michigan v. Long case. What Michigan v. Long said is that this Court has jurisdiction under Section 1257 to resolve State court resolutions of Federal law, and it will presume that a State constitutional decision of a mirror image, say, of the Fourth Amendment, will be binding, but recognized that the only circumstance in which the Court will not treat Federal law as governing both questions is when the State makes clear that it would reach the same result under State constitutional law as it did under Federal law. It did not preclude the option of the State going back and reaching a different decision once enlightened by this Court as to the content of Federal law. Standard Oil is completely clear on this. It says the State chose to use Federal law to determine whether a Federal post exchange was a Federal instrumentality. And we're going to correct its understanding of Federal law. But on remand, the State can now, freed from its misapprehensions of Federal law, decide what it thinks State law requires. And if it does that, then there may be a Federal constitutional question.",
  "So I ­­ I ­­",
  "Well, I doubt ­­ I doubt that that would satisfy the Court. There's a theoretical answer, and then there's a practical answer. Let me give the practical answer first. The States that copy the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil ­­",
  "­­ Procedure pretty uniformly say, we will treat Federal precedent as guidance in our decisions as ­­ for its persuasive value. They recognize that there are State rules of procedure and State rules of evidence that will belong to the State.",
  "Well, I ­­ I think that ­­",
  "There ­­ there is a distinction between this case and that that may suggest that this case, the Court has jurisdiction over, and that one, the Court does not.",
  "I think this is a stronger case.",
  "I'm doubtful that the Court would have jurisdiction or choose to exercise it, because ­­ I accept, for premises of the argument, Your Honor's hypothetical. But in the real world, it doesn't happen.",
  "Well, I think the Court ­­",
  "So there are several reasons, Justice Alito. First of all, I don't think that it is that ­­ going to come up in that way to this Court, because that's not the way States treat their own rules of procedure. I don't think it will be very difficult. There is a principle in the Court's cases that when Federal law has been adopted as Federal law, the Court will review it even if the State could have chosen a different path. So ­­",
  "Well, I ­­ I think, Justice Kennedy ­­",
  "This is ­­ this is what I'm trying to ­­",
  "The State has adopted Teague for a reason that does not exist in any of these civil procedure cases, and that is that the State knows that that Federal law will be applied to the very case in a habeas case. So the State has decided consciously to synchronize its law with the law that it knows will be applied. And this actually serves a very important Federalism purpose. The State says, if we have to rectify in ­­ a ­­ a constitutional error in our case that's become final, we would like the opportunity to do it. And if the Federal habeas court is going to treat this decision as retroactive, we would like the first crack at it. California ­­",
  "No, because ­­",
  "No. There's an elementary reason why that's not so, Justice Scalia, and this answers Justice Ginsburg's question earlier. 2254(d) applies to State determinations on the merits. That's the only time that the deference provision kicks in. And a determination under Teague is a threshold determination that comes before the decision on the merits. This Court has said that in any number of cases. It's not a merits resolution of the case. So deference to a State determination on retroactivity would never occur. What I ­­",
  "Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice. The ­­ the rule in Miller v. Alabama, in our view, is a substantive rule, because it goes far beyond merely regulating the procedure by which youths are sentenced for homicide crimes. It compelled the State to adopt new substantive sentencing options, an option that is less severe than life without parole. The only other time that this Court has ever invalidated a mandatory sentencing provision was Woodson v. North Carolina in 1976. So we went something like 36 years before we had another decision that concluded that the law must change to accommodate the compelling interests in having the characteristics of youth that mitigate culpability considered in the sentencing process.",
  "Yes. I believe that it would be. That would be the same remedy that the Court ordered in a Graham v. Florida case for ­­ which is the case that held that youths who do not commit homicide but are convicted of other crimes cannot be sentenced to life without parole at all. And the Court's remedy for that problem could either be a sentence of term of years, but it could also be simply converting the life­without­parole sentence to a life­with­parole sentence. So that would be ­­",
  "So I ­­ I think, Justice Sotomayor, the key difference is that, with respect to the guidelines, there was always a ­­ a minimum and a maximum set by statute. And the guidelines, even when they were mandatory, did not preclude judges from sentencing outside the guidelines, depending upon the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors that weren't taken into account. And as Justice Alito's opinion for the Court in United States v. Rodriguez recognized, even the top of a mandatory guidelines range was not truly mandatory. So even under the mandatory guidelines, which for Sixth Amendment purposes were treated as if they established elements of the offense, for the purposes that we're looking at here, they are not mandatory in the same way, so that Booker brought about a procedural change.",
  "Justice Sotomayor, I don't think there is any substantive, to use the word, daylight between Petitioner's position and ours. The description of the crime at issue as punishable by mandatory life imprisonment and treating that as a category, I think, sums up the reality of what is happening. We broke it out into its component parts because I think it facilitates the analysis of it to understand that Miller does have a procedural component. Sentencing courts must now consider the mitigating characteristics of age, but it also, and more fundamentally in our view, contains a substantive component that required a change in the law. Now, the change here was expanding the range of outcomes. Previously when this Court has analyzed substantive changes in the law, there have been changes that restricted the form of outcome; say, for example, in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, forbidding punishment at all. But I think that if you trace back the origins of the substantive category to Justice Harlan's opinion in Mackey, this is still faithful to what Justice Harlan had in mind. Justice Harlan said the clearest case of an injustice in not applying a rule retroactively is when it puts off­limits altogether criminal punishment. He did not say that it was the only case. And I think that if you consider what is going on in Miller and the reasons for the rule, the Court made very clear that it believed that of the 2,000 people that were in prison and under mandatory life for juvenile homicide, the Court believed that that penalty was frequently disproportionate, that it would be uncommonly imposed in the future, and that it was not a sentence that was consistent in most cases with the mitigating characteristics of youth that have been recognized in Roper and in Graham and then in Miller.",
  "Probably the last, Justice Alito. When ­­ when the Court characterized substantive rules, most recently in the Summerlin opinion ­­",
  "Well, I would put it in the words that the Court has used previously. The Court has said that a substantive rule creates a significant risk that the person is serving a sentence that's not appropriate for that person, maybe not even legally available for that purpose. It did not say absolutely conclusively proves it. It said significant risk. And in contrast, when the Court has talked about procedural rules, rules that govern the manner in which a case is adjudicated, it has said that the likelihood or potential for a different outcome is speculative. And I think if you put this case on the speculative­significant risk axis, this case falls in the significant risk domain precisely because of the reasons why the Court said it was deciding Miller. The reasons why the Court decided Miller had to do with the reduced culpability of youth and the capacity of youth to mature, change, and achieve a degree of rehabilitation that is consistent with something less than the most harsh sentence available for youths who commit murder ­­ a terrible crime, but still the harshest sentence, the Court thought, would be reserved for the worst of the worst, which is, in fact, what Louisiana said when it amended its statutes substantively to conform them to Miller. It said life without parole should be reserved for the worst offenders who commit the worst crimes. And so when you combine the fact that this is not a rule that ­­ that only governs procedure ­­ it doesn't just govern evidence; it also mandates changes in outcomes as an available option ­­ with the very genesis of the Miller rule in a conclusion that, for the people in this class, the appropriateness of the punishment of the harshest degree, life without parole, will be relatively uncommon, it seems clear that the Miller rule falls on the substantive side of the axis rather than on the procedural side of the axis.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. The majority of States ­­ it's a close call. I think it's maybe about ten to seven or ten to eight. But the majority of States that have reviewed this have concluded that Miller is retroactive. Most of them have done it as a matter of substantive law. There are a couple of opinions that talk about the watershed exception, which is not the way that we think that this case should be analyzed. But not only the ­­ the States have done that, but the United States has taken that position with respect to the juveniles that were sentenced before Miller to life without parole as a mandatory sentence. And in the resentencings of those that have taken place so far ­­ it's only been about ten, but those ­­ those defendants have almost uniformly received sentences that are terms of years significantly shorter than life.",
  "I haven't broken it down ­­ may I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?",
  "I have not broken it down numerically, Justice Ginsburg, but Michigan has not applied it retroactively, and it has a very large population of juveniles who are in the Miller class. And I don't think that Pennsylvania has resolved it, certainly not favorably yet for the defendants.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think that the appropriate starting point for this case is the last sentence of Monsanto, not because Monsanto specifically addressed substitute property, but because it adopted a principle that I believe resolves this case. And the last sentence of Monsanto says, \"If the government may, posttrial, forbid the use of forfeited assets to pay an attorney, then surely no constitutional violation occurs when after probable cause is adequately established, the government obtains an order barring a defendant from frustrating that end by dissipating his assets prior to trial.\"",
  "Yes, it did. And that's why I say that the principle that the court articulated in that sentence is what decides this case.",
  "Well ­­",
  "Justice Breyer, let me try to explain ­­",
  "Justice Breyer, I think that it's important to start with, actually, the principle that Monsanto adopted, not because it resolved the factual circumstances here, but because it's talking about the point in time after the government wins a judgment. And the principle is that if the government will have a right to forfeit that property at the end ­­",
  "­­ if it can show probable cause ­­",
  "So Justice Breyer, I think that the ­­ the embedded premise there is that people will not suffer restraints on their liberty or property before they have been convicted beyond a reasonable doubt.",
  "All right. So can I try to break that down a little bit? Because I do think that the principle in Monsanto is critical. The principle in Monsanto is that if the government will be able to forfeit the property at the end of the day, it has an interest in ensuring that it is available and not dissipated. It's the monetary equivalent of flight. It's asset flight. And this statute, Section 1345, was specifically designed, as Justice Ginsburg observed, for crimes in the banking and in the healthcare context in which money flows into accounts, money is fungible, very difficult to ­­",
  "So two things on that. I hope I get a chance to say both of them. First, I don't think that it is a serious constitutional question in light of Monsanto, so I don't really think that there's a serious avoidance concern here. Monsanto basically said that if the government has shown adequately that it will be able to forfeit the money at the conclusion of the case, the Sixth Amendment doesn't override the government's interests. After all, Justice Breyer, this is basically a zero­sum game. Either there will be money available at the end of the case for the victims or the money will have been spent on lawyers. And Congress made a judgment that the government can't come in in every case and simply restrain assets upon a showing of nothing. But it does have a statute in a very specific area that allows it to ­­",
  "Justice Kennedy, it's correct that our principle is not limited to the types of crimes that are in this case. It is limited to the government making an adequate showing that at the conclusion of the case, it will have the right to the money.",
  "Understood.",
  "That's correct. And, I ­­ again, I think that Monsanto resolved this question by saying that if the government can take title to the property at the conclusion of the case, it has an interest in ensuring that it is available, and the Sixth Amendment doesn't override it.",
  "That's correct.",
  "No, I think the defendant is often entitled to a hearing. The question is what issues the defendant may raise at the hearing. Here, for example, there was clearly an issue of whether the defendant was, in fact, dissipating assets. And that would have been something that the defendant ­­",
  "With ­­",
  "With respect to whether there's probable cause to believe that the defendant committed an offense. That's what Kaley said is controlled.",
  "It ­­ it was, Justice Sotomayor. And that ­­",
  "Although there were far fewer here because most of them had been dissipated. And I think that the reason why ­­",
  "We ­­ we stipulated ­­ it's technical, but we ­­ we stipulated that there may be some unquantified amount of untainted assets in the assets being restrained. We did not know, and did not attempt to figure out, and that would be an issue for a later day if the Court said that that mattered.",
  "Well, I ­­ I would hope that the Court sees that even if there are some uncomfortable aspects of Monsanto, it actually rests on a sound legal judgment. And I ­­ I realize I have said this, but I will keep coming back to this because I think it is the touchstone for Monsanto. Caplin & Drysdale was a postjudgment case. And it said once these funds are forfeitable, the defendant, if he pays his lawyer with them, is paying the lawyer with somebody else's money, namely, the government. Then the question is, can the government do anything to prevent dissipation of the assets before it obtains the judgment? And the Court said not automatically, not as a general rule it can always come in and say this is what we want, this is what we get. But with an appropriate hearing, the balance of interest does permit the government to preserve the equities. Now, this has an effect on counsel of choice. It has no effect on the ability of the defendant to be represented by counsel.",
  "Yes. I don't think there's an exception in the Sixth Amendment. Now, this is a statute in which the government proceeded through seeking a civil injunction and restraining order, and the district court does have discretion. It's not a flat rule that forbids the district court from releasing funds for counsel.",
  "Not as a matter of right. But this is a civil statute in which the judge can exercise equitable discretion. And if the defendant comes in and says ­­",
  "Well, I don't think automatically so. Here the judge said one consideration is, will the defendant have representation in the 1345 proceeding itself? The defendant did. Mr. Srebnick represented the defendant in that proceeding. So the court said, I don't need to worry about that. Then the court turned to the question of whether the defendant needed counsel in the criminal case and said, the defendant will be afforded counsel in the criminal case, by appointment if necessary.",
  "So this ­­",
  "I remember exactly what ­­",
  "So Justice Breyer ­­",
  "­­ I think I need to stop you here because it's not a TRO. The statute does not ­­",
  "That's correct.",
  "Well, I think that the ­­",
  "My second response is that this a statute that contains two basic provisions. I think petitioner describes it accurately. Section (a) describes the things the government can seek under the statute; Subsection (B) describes the procedure that's used. Subsection (A) first allows the government to get an injunction against fraud in (A)(1). In (A)(2) it allows it to restrain assets as the ultimate object of the suit, not as a temporary interim measure. Temporary interim measures are described in Subsection (B) where it specifically allows the Court to impose various restraints until the Court has concluded the proceeding. So it addresses temporary relief in (B). Subsection (A)(2) describes the things that the government can seek as the ultimate object of the case. Injunction against the person who has the funds, or a restraining order against any person to restrain the funds that are derived from illegal activity, or funds of equivalent value. And just to make one final point on that, the reason that makes sense in a banking context and in a healthcare context is dollars are fungible, as Justice Alito said earlier. They will flow into an account; they will flow out into other accounts. It's difficult to trace them. So Congress obviated the need to do that by saying you can restrain the defendant, but we're not going to rely only on restraining the defendant. You can also restrain the banks where the funds are. And you can restrain them not only in the amounts that represent the tainted funds, but represent the monetary equivalent of them. So in a sense ­­",
  "Well, I think, in a sense, this statute negates the premise that there is a clean line between tainted funds and untainted funds. The money is fungible once it's received by the defendant. There is Medicare fraud if the government establishes probable cause, and its financial interest is ensuring that it can have a judgment to make whole the Medicare trust fund or other victims at the conclusion of the case.",
  "So (a)(2) has two different sections, and it describes what the government can seek as the ultimate relief in the case. This started out as an antifraud injunction statute. Somebody is going around with the boiler room operation or a Ponzi scheme; it takes a while to get the evidence to indict. The government can come in and seek an injunction to prevent further fraud. Then Congress added (a)(2) on the theory that there's something else the government needs to do, ensure that money is available at the conclusion of whatever parallel criminal case or civil fraud case the government brings.",
  "Yes, but it's ­­ it's referring, again, to a person who has ­­ there is probable cause to believe has obtained money as a result of a criminal violation, and then it provides a mechanism for restraining it. It's not aimed at restraining people who have nothing to do with the case, unless they're holding the defendant's money.",
  "The innocent money versus tainted money all depends on a theory that they are economically pure. Now, the ­­ the only argument that Mr. Srebnick made to distinguish them, and I realize there may be members of the Court who think this is not a very good argument, and maybe the question is whether Monsanto is at root problematic, but at least insofar as that argument goes, it's based on a reading of the relation­backed doctrine that's contrary to this Court's cases. Monsanto itself made this very clear. It said that the government can restrain money that will become the government's property at the conclusion of the case.",
  "That's true.",
  "That's true for all ­­ that's true or all money, tainted and untainted.",
  "So ­­",
  "I think it does.",
  "So 853, Justice Sotomayor, does permit forfeiture of substitute property.",
  "Not ­­ not pretrial. This statute is different because it has a different function and a different purpose. But the basic concept of forfeiture is punishing the defendant by taking money through forfeiture that's equivalent to the tainted property if the tainted property is gone. That's the policy behind it. Now ­­",
  "It is true ­­",
  "Yes, but ­­ but the point is that the tainted property and the substitute property are similarly situated at the end of the forfeiture case. The government has a property right in each of them, but the ­­ I don't think the property right is really the essence of what's going on here. The fact that Section 853 permits pretrial restraint of tainted property, but it doesn't reference the subsection that deals with substitute property, is a feature of that statute, but I think that has nothing to do with the underlying point, which is that if the government is going to be able to collect on its forfeiture judgment, sometimes it will need to restrain property. Monsanto recognizes that, and I don't think that saying that the defendant has a interest in paying for counsel trumps the government's interest in being made whole at the conclusion of the case.",
  "Well, the ­­ the whole history of in personam forfeiture was dormant until 1970, and then Congress passed a statute that permitted this kind of activity. It improved the statute in 1984 to remedy defects in the pretrial restraint of assets. So it was relatively recently developed, targeting basically drug conspiracies and organized criminal activity.",
  "Well, the substitute assets provision was added to the ­­ the basic forfeiture statute, and it was there at least by 1984. I think that it may have been earlier as well. This provision is different, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, from the basic forfeiture statute in permitting pretrial restraint of any assets, but I think that it reflects the same basic underlying idea.",
  "So if ­­ if at the conclusion of the case ­­",
  "Well, I think that if there is a ­­ yes, if there is a monetary assessment that will become provable at the conclusion of the case and the government can show a need to preserve the assets so that they're available. I mean, think about the cases that you're talking about, Justice Kennedy. They are cases in which victims have been harmed. Serious medical costs may be at issue. If the funds are spent on an attorney, they will not be available for compensation.",
  "So I ­­ I do think the Court could draw distinctions among the types of fines and the purposes of the fines that are at issue. So it's not ­­",
  "So ­­ well, I ­­ I do think that I was trying to say to the Chief Justice that there could be distinctions that are drawn among various monetary exactions. I think the strongest case is when victim compensation is at issue. All the money in the ­­ the context of a Medicare fraud case like this, although it's not required by statute, it will be returned to the Medicare trust fund. This is a fraud against the people. $45 million is obtained, we allege, by fraud. Most of ­­",
  "Medicare trust fund, provided to the Medicare trust fund.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, the Medicare trust fund, which represents basically the fiscal interests of the people of the United States is the victim.",
  "The Medicare trust fund, from which the funds came that we say are obtained by fraud, is the victim. So the funds will be returned to the victim. That's the purpose of trying to freeze the funds in a health care case, so that they can be returned.",
  "So Justice Ginsburg, we don't think that any of the alternative readings are plausible. For the reasons that I explained to Justice Breyer, this statute doesn't limit the restraining order to temporary relief, nor would it make any logical sense to do that because the purpose of this statute was to preserve funds so that they would be available at the conclusion of the case. I also think that the amicus argument is not a tenable one because it simply reads \"or equivalent value\" out of the statute and without any reference to the context of the statute, which is to try to make the government be able to be made whole at the conclusion of a case if, in fact, it obtains a judgment given the very difficult process of segregating out money in banking and financial­type crimes.",
  "So I ­­ I think that that ­­ that is true. I think this Court understands, from arguments last week, that superfluity is no stranger to congressional statutes. They do have a different focus, though, and I think it was quite reasonable for Congress to make clear what that focus is. 2(A) is aimed at the person who's doing the dissipating themselves, the person who obtained the property by fraud, and (B) expands that out.",
  "Yes, but the ­­ it's not that this is a statute that anyone's reading gives off provisions of fact because the (b) section, 1345(b) permits restraining orders or prohibitions during the course of the case as are needed to protect the United States against the substantial injury. So that provision would subsume the ­­ the reading that my friend gives.",
  "No, I don't think there's any reading of the statute that exempts counsel. It does give discretion to the district court to entertain arguments. Those arguments were made here and rejected."
