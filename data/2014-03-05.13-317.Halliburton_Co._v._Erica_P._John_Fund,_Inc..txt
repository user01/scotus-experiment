1  P R O C E E D I N G S  2  (10:17 a.m.)  3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument  4 this morning in Case 13317, Halliburton Company v. The  5 Erica P. John Fund.  6  Mr. Streett.  7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON STREETT  8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS  9  MR. STREETT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it  10 please the Court:  11  Basic v. Levinson should be overruled  12 because it was wrong when it was decided and it is even  13 more clearly erroneous today.  Basic substituted  14 economic theory for the bedrock common law requirement  15 of actual reliance that Congress embraced in the most  16 analogous express cause of action.  17  Basic's judicially created presumption  18 preserves an unjustified exemption from Rule 23 that  19 benefits only securities plaintiffs.  Basic has proven  20 unworkable, has been undermined by later developments,  21 and has proven to have harmful consequences for  22 investors and companies alike.  23  The most direct course is to overrule Basic  24 altogether and require a showing of actual reliance.  25  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I believe that in Basic,
3

1 Justice Blackmun said that there is this economic  2 theory, but also the motivation for the Exchange Act and  3 probability and common sense would lead to this  4 presumption  this rebuttable presumption.  So he  5 wasn't relying strictly on an economic theory.  I think  6 two or three times in the opinion, he tries to make that  7 plain.  8  MR. STREETT:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but the  9 Court in Basic recognized that Section 18(a) was the  10 proper analog, but then it immediately turned to its own  11 notions of public policy and the best way to further  12 congressional policy, instead of asking what sort of  13 reliance does Section 18(a) require.  14  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where is that, that it  15 says that 18(a) is the proper  16  MR. STREETT:  I believe  17  JUSTICE GINSBURG:   reference?  18  MR. STREETT:  I believe it's on page 245  19 where the Court says, "We acknowledge the argument that  20 Section 18(a) is the proper analog, and we accept that  21 there is a reliance requirement under 10(b)."  22  But the Court then jumps to creating a  23 presumption of reliance, rather than asking what sort of  24 reliance Section 18(a) requires, which has always been  25 understood to be actual eyeball reliance.

1  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Streett, that argument,  2 of course, is just an argument that Basic was wrong  3 in  in  in not focusing on  on Section 18, and  4 that's contestable.  One could say actually, they were  5 right not to focus on Section 18, Section 9 is the  6 closer analog.  7  But let's put that aside.  Are you just  8 saying Basic is wrong, or are you saying that something  9 has changed since Basic?  Because usually that's what we  10 look for when we decide whether to reverse a case,  11 something that makes the question fundamentally  12 different now than when we decided it.  And that's  13 especially so in a case like this one where Congress has  14 had every opportunity, and has declined every  15 opportunity, to change Basic itself.  16  So what has changed, in your view?  17  MR. STREETT:  We're saying both that it was  18 wrong when decided and that certain things have changed.  19 At least three things, Your Honor.  20  First of all, this Court has fundamentally  21 changed its approach to interpreting the Section 10(b)  22 cause of action.  It's consistently construed it  23 narrowly, and Basic stands out like a sore thumb among  24 that jurisprudence.  25  Second, this Court has consistently held in
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Comcast and WalMart that there cannot be presumptions  2 of classwide issues; instead, classwide issues must be  3 proved in fact.  The Court addressed plaintiff's experts  4 in those cases who purported to establish class  5 classwide methodologies, and the Court tested those with  6 rigor to determine whether they proved, in fact, that  7 there were classwide issues.  8  And we're asking this Court to give the  9 Basic presumptions the same rigor that this Court gave  10 the expert reports in Comcast and WalMart, at the very  11 least because those  those expert reports only  12 generated one class action.  And this has underlined  13 all  14  JUSTICE KAGAN:  What is your third?  15  MR. STREETT:  Pardon?  16  JUSTICE KAGAN:  You said three.  What is  17 your third?  18  MR. STREETT:  Yes.  And my third is that the  19 economics have changed.  The economic premises of Basic,  20 in particular, the premise that investors rely in common  21 on the integrity of the market price.  The government  22 and the fund do not even contend, they don't even  23 contest that that's the case anymore.  Many investors,  24 such as hedge fund rapidfire volatility traders, index  25 fund investors, sophisticated value investors do not 
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 they have investment strategies that do not rely on the  2 integrity of the market price whatsoever.  So that sort  3 of reliance is the quintessential individualized  4 issue  5  JUSTICE KAGAN:  So  so you are not relying  6 anymore on the notion that the efficient markets  7 hypothesis has been undermined.  That is not one of the  8 three points that you're making because, essentially, I  9 think you  you admit this in your reply brief.  You  10 just say Halliburton has never said that market prices  11  has never contested that market prices generally  12 respond to new material information.  13  So you are agreeing with that, that market  14 prices generally do respond to new material information.  15  MR. STREETT:  Cited at that general  16 general level, we don't disagree with it.  17  The problem is that we now know that a  18 binary yesorno approach to market efficiency like the  19 sentence you read tells us very little about whether a  20 particular misrepresentation distorted the market price.  21 So Basic has become inconsistent with its own premises.  22  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but we don't have that  23 kind of binary approach.  What we allow plaintiffs to do  24 is to try to establish a presumption, which they do by  25 showing that a particular market is efficient, and then
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 we allow defendants to rebut that presumption.  2  So there's no binary on/off switch.  It's  3 actually  it's a presumption, but it's quite dependent  4 on the facts in a particular case as to whether there's  5 an exception to this general rule that market prices, in  6 fact, do generally respond to new material information.  7  MR. STREETT:  It's  it's binary in the  8 sense that the principal driver of class certification  9 is whether the market is efficient in a yesorno,  10 binary sense, and that's why we have raised our second  11 position, which is if the Court were inclined to keep  12 the presumption in some sense, it should at least place  13 the burden on the plaintiff to establish that the  14 misrepresentation actually distorted the market price,  15 or to give defendants the full right of rebuttal at the  16 class certification stage to establish the price was not  17 impacted.  18  JUSTICE ALITO:  Do we know how often  19 defendants have been successful in rebutting the  20 presumption?  21  MR. STREETT:  It is  it is virtually  22 impossible.  It's very unusual outside of the context of  23 the Second Circuit which allows rebuttal with respect to  24 price impact.  Outside of that circuit, I think as one  25 of the amicus briefs said, they're as rare as hen's
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 teeth.  2  And that is another development.  Certainly  3 this Court in Basic thought the fact that the  4 presumption was rebuttable was an essential part of that  5 holding, and it now turns out the courts, especially the  6 court below in this case, have treated it as essentially  7 irrebuttable, even with respect to the fundamental  8 premise of Basic, which is price impact.  9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could I ask you  10  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't the  isn't the  11 it's not a question of is it rebuttable.  I thought that  12 that's already claimed from Basic.  It's a question of  13 when.  You're arguing that it should be rebuttable at  14 the class certification stage.  The other side is  15 arguing, yeah, of course it's rebuttable, but that comes  16 in at the merits determination.  It doesn't go to the  17 question whether there are individual issues that  18 predominate over class issues.  19  MR. STREETT:  And we are not aware of a  20 single instance in which this Court allowed a  21 presumption to be invoked for the very purpose of one  22 stage of litigation, but held that the defendant's right  23 to rebut must be delayed to a later stage.  And there  24 can be no doubt that Basic created the presumption of  25 reliance, among other reasons, for the very purpose of
9

1 allowing class certification of securities fraud cases.  2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I  I understand  3 your friend on the other side to acknowledge that the  4 efficient market theory is not perfect, that there are  5 situations in which events are not reflected in the  6 market price.  7  I understand you to acknowledge that it's  8 accurate to some extent, but that the exceptions or  9 the  the extent to which it's not accurate over  10 override the extent to which it is.  In other words,  11 you're each sort of dealing with at the  at the  if  12 not at the margins, you know, most of the time it's  13 efficient; you say too much of the time it's not.  14  How am I supposed to review the economic  15 literature and decide which of you is correct on that?  16  MR. STREETT:  We don't think the Court needs  17 to do that.  We think the Court should get out of the  18 business of reviewing economic literature and requiring  19 district judges to make this binary, yesorno market  20 efficient  21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, your submission  22 is that we should jettison the Basic test because  23 economists now believe that the efficient market theory  24 is not sufficient  sufficiently accurate or true to  25 support it.  So I thought  I mean, you review a lot of
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the economic literature in your briefs.  I assume you  2 wanted me to look at it.  3  MR. STREETT:  Of course, our principal  4 submission is that no economic theory should supplant  5 what Congress enacted in Section 18(a) in the most  6 analogous cause of action.  The economic theory shows  7 that one of the basic premises is no longer even  8 defended.  The second premise, that investors rely in  9 common on the integrity of the market price, is not even  10 defended by the government and the Fund.  And with that  11 premise knocked out, there's no remaining shred of  12 transaction causation because you have no common  13 reliance even on the price as a transmitter of the  14 information.  And in that instance, then fraud becomes  15 the quintessential individualized question.  16  I'd like to get ­  17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Could you explain  18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In a class action, how  19 do you prove loss causation without proving price  20 impact?  I know that there are some individual cases  21 with individual misrepresentations that have a different  22 form of loss causation.  But I'm talking exclusively  23 on a  in a class.  How do you prove loss  proximate  24 cause or loss causation without proving price impact?  25  MR. STREETT:  A class under fraudonthe 26 market theory could not do that.  But the question under
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Amgen is whether there would be individuals within the  2 class who could show that they actually heard and relied  3 upon the statement and  4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but that makes no  5 sense.  6  MR. STREETT:  Well, let me  7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because if they relied  8 on their statement, then that's  they have to prove  9 loss causation in the same way that the class does.  10 It's only if they're relying on a separate statement,  11 which isn't part of the class, that would entitle them  12 to a different calculation of loss causation.  13  MR. STREETT:  A plaintiff within the class  14 could still establish loss causation without price  15 impact in the same way that a plaintiff in the class  16 could establish loss  17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How?  18  MR. STREETT:  By  19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  With the same  20 misstatement at issue?  21  MR. STREETT:  By purchasing in reliance on  22 that misstatement at a price that was not on the New  23 York Stock Exchange.  24  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then how is such a  25 plaintiff's claim typical of the class?  You have  you
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 admitted that the 23(a) factors are met, commonality and  2 typicality.  Well, if one is a member of this class that  3 says, we didn't rely individually, but we did rely on  4 the marketplace as being  as having integrity, if you  5 have someone to whom a direct representation was made,  6 that person is not a proper member of this class as a  7 discrete question, not one common to the class, not one  8 typical.  The typical investor in a Basic class is  9 somebody who no representation was made to that person  10 directly.  11  MR. STREETT:  I'm relying on a case where  12 the misrepresentation was made in a way that's typical  13 to the class, but individual class members purchased off  14 of the exchange, and therefore they purchased at a  15 different price, perhaps, than what was on the exchange.  16  But I think the real point is that this  17 Court emphasized and held in Amgen that plaintiffs  18 could  that plaintiffs did need to establish that the  19 market was efficient and that the statement was public.  20  JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you  can  to take a  21 totally different case, just thinking of the  22 announcement of the opinion I had, is a contract case.  23 We'll say it's the treaty that we're talking about.  And  24 a group of plaintiffs say:  We, Your Honor, would like  25 to show that the way that Argentina treated us was
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 unfair under the treaty.  All right.  And the other side  2 says:  Well, what we think it's fair; we don't think the  3 treaty covers this.  4  Now, what we have here is a common issue.  5 So we don't have to decide, to judge who's right.  We've  6 just noticed it was common issue.  And so they make  7 their case, at least prima facie, that they have a side  8 and the other side will rebut it on the merits.  9  Well, similarly, here, they're saying:  We  10 don't have to show that the markets incorporate every  11 piece of information.  We think they incorporate this  12 information, and it's a general rule, they do incorporate  13 most information.  14  The other side wants to show they didn't  15 incorporate this.  That's fine.  It's a common issue.  16 We'll decide it at the trial.  All we're trying to say  17 is, is it a common issue, and it's not a red herring to  18 throw in whether the markets incorporate information  19 because normally they do, period.  Now, what's wrong  20 with what I said?  21  MR. STREETT:  Because market efficiency and  22 publicity are also common issues that this Court  23 required to be considered at the class certification  24 stage.  And this Court required those issues to be  25 considered because they are predicates for price impact.
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now, we've required them to  2 be considered because  3  JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's certainly not the rule  4  it's certainly not the rule that every  every issue  5 that is common has  has to be decided at the  6 preliminary  or I'm sorry, must be left to the merits.  7 I mean, as you point out, the very issue of whether the  8 market is efficient is something that could be decided  9 for everybody at the merits stage, right?  10  MR. STREETT:  That's absolutely correct.  11 And the reason this Court allowed market efficiency and  12 publicity to be considered is because without those  13 predicates, there's no reason to presume that there's  14 price impact.  15  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Streett, there's a  16 there's a real difference with respect to those issues  17 and I think that this was really what Amgen said.  It  18 said that when you rule on those things, it essentially  19 splits up the class so that different members of the  20 class are left in very different positions; but that  21 when you rule on a question like materiality, which  22 leaves all members of the class in the exact same  23 position, either with a viable claim or with no claim,  24 and it doesn't split the class in the way that the  25 efficient markets theory do, that's the difference.
15

1  And here  and this goes back to Justice  2 Sotomayor's question  I just don't see how this splits  3 the class at all, because if you can't prove price  4 impact, you can't prove loss causation and everybody's  5 claims die.  6  MR. STREETT:  Well, that same argument could  7 have been made against market efficiency or publicity.  8 If you don't have a public statement reaching the  9 market, there's no way the price could have been  10 impacted.  11  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I think that the  12 that the difference is that even if you don't have  13 market efficiency and so you lose the ability to bring  14 the  a claim with the fraudonthemarket presumption,  15 you might still have an individual reliance claim.  16  MR. STREETT:  Yes.  And if the market price  17 was not distorted, you could still have an individual  18 reliance claim for exactly the same reasons.  If the  19 market's not efficient or the statement is not public,  20 you are, by necessity, not going to have price impact.  21 So market efficiency and publicity are precisely,  22 exactly situated with respect to price impact.  23  And the result of disallowing price impact  24 evidence at the class certification stage, which this  25 Court said was Basic's fundamental premise, would mean
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 automatic class certification for all New York Stock  2 Exchange companies, because those companies trade in an  3 efficient market in the binary, yesorno sense that  4 Basic states.  And that cannot be what this Court  5  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Finish your sentence.  6 "And that cannot"  7  MR. STREETT:  Cannot be what this Court  8 intended in Basic when it created a rebuttable  9 presumption.  10  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you address briefly  11 the position taken by the law professors, I call it the  12 midway position, that says there should be an event  13 study.  That might not take care of your first two  14 arguments of the narrow construction of 10(b)(5), and  15 the question of presumptions, but it does seem to me to  16 be a substantial answer to your economic analysis to  17 the  to the challenge you make to the economic  18 premises of the Basic decision.  19  MR. STREETT:  Yes.  Our principal argument  20 is that the economic theories should not serve as a  21 standin for actual reliance.  But if the Court were to  22 accept the continuing validity of the presumption in  23 some way, the law professors' position, which is also  24 our second question presented, at least makes Basic  25 consistent with its own premises.  Because Basic's
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 premise is if a plaintiff buys at a price that is  2 distorted by the misrepresentation, he has relied upon  3 the misrepresentation.  If we accept that as Basic's  4 premise, then it only makes sense to focus like a laser  5 on the only relevant question, whether the  6 misrepresentation distorted the market price.  7  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Am  am I correct  and  8 this would be more of a question for your friend  9 representing the Respondent.  Am I correct that, even  10 under the  the Basic framework, at the merits stage  11 there has to be something that looks very much like an  12 event study.  Am I correct about that?  13  MR. STREETT:  Yes.  That's absolutely  14 correct, Your Honor.  15  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so then the question  16 would be since you're going to have to have it anyway,  17 why not have it at the class certification stage.  18  MR. STREETT:  Yes.  And the Second Circuit  19 has correctly held that that must be proven at the class  20 certification stage because price impact is the glue  21 that holds common reliance together and the district  22 courts within that circuit have been very  23 successfully  24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't see how this is  25 a midpoint.  If you're going to require proof of price
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 impact, why not do away with market efficiency?  The  2 whole premise of the other economic theory that you rely  3 on is that the market efficiency is irrelevant.  Some  4 information impacts the market, whether efficient or  5 not, and some doesn't, whether efficient or not.  I  6 think that's the basic economic argument the other  7 side's making, correct?  8  MR. STREETT:  Yes, Your Honor.  9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why bother with Basic  10 at all if we're going to do what you're suggesting  11  MR. STREETT:  We agree  12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   turn the  turn the  13 class certification into a fullblown merits hearing on  14 whether loss causation has been proven?  15  MR. STREETT:  It is not loss causation.  16 It's just whether the price was distorted at the time of  17 the misstatement and at the time the purchases were  18 made.  Loss causation deals with the later price  19 declines after a corrective disclosure.  20  And we agree that it is a midpoint because  21 the question should be whether the market price was  22 distorted.  We don't think looking at whether the market  23 is efficient as a whole, how many shares are trading,  24 how many analysts are following the stock is very  25 relevant or instructive.  And, in fact, this would
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 remedy some of Basic's underinclusiveness and  2 overinclusiveness.  3  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you tell me, based on  4 your experience, compare the  the cost, the extent of  5 time, the difficulty of showing under Basic the  6 efficient  that there is an efficient market, and  7 compare and contrast that with undertaking an event  8 study.  Is the latter much more costly, much more  9 timeconsuming?  10  MR. STREETT:  No, Your Honor.  They're about  11 the same.  And, in fact, plaintiffs are commonly using  12 event studies right now as part of their market  13 efficiency showing, because one of the factors courts  14 are requiring for market efficiency is showing a  15 reaction between price and unexpected corporate  16 information throughout the class period.  So, in fact,  17 they're running these events studies for the entire  18 class period, where all our position would do is require  19 them to look at the alleged misrepresentations in the  20 case, that is to say what really matters, and look at  21 whether they distorted the market price as opposed to  22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, how hard is it  23 to show that the New York Stock Exchange is an efficient  24 market?  25  MR. STREETT:  Well, the courts look at
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 several factors.  Now, admittedly, virtually all of the  2 time, those lead to a finding of yes, but  3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So I would think the  4 event study they are talking about would be a lot more  5 difficult and laborious to demonstrate than market  6 efficiency in a typical case.  7  MR. STREETT:  Well, just to take this case  8 for an example, the plaintiff's expert used an event  9 study of all of the unexpected corporate news throughout  10 the entire class period to prove market efficiency  11 because courts have said that's one important factor to  12 show market efficiency.  We would just focus the event  13 study like a laser on the only thing that matters, to  14 show whether or not the misrepresentation distorted the  15 market price.  16  JUSTICE BREYER:  What happens if the  if  17 the plaintiffs say, Your Honor, I have 5,000 people  18 here, all of whom bought the stock on the New York Stock  19 Exchange between March 15 and April 15, and as far as  20 people who had other kinds of reliance, we'll bring a  21 separate case about them later.  But everybody in this  22 case bought on the New York Stock Exchange and our  23 theory of this case is that the stock exchange did  24 absorb the information and the price went up and then  25 went down.

1  Now, what  what reason is there for  2 purposes of certification to go beyond the efficient  3 market?  Is it good enough?  I mean, why not?  They all  4 bought on the exchange.  It's not an irrelevancy.  5 Everybody would have to say it's certainly relevant to  6 the case and they all have the issue in common.  7  MR. STREETT:  Yes  8  JUSTICE BREYER:  Why go into the event  9 study?  Why?  10  MR. STREETT:  Because even in a generically  11 efficient market in a binary sense, misrepresentations  12 may not distort the market price.  As both lower courts  13 have  14  JUSTICE BREYER:  Of course that's true.  15 Indeed, that's the defense.  The defense is, well, Your  16 Honor, here it didn't.  And the plaintiffs say, you're  17 right; we think it did, but if he's right and it didn't,  18 he wins.  But you have to concede if they're right, you  19 win.  20  So why is that  I don't understand why  21 that is an appropriate issue.  I can  I don't  22 understand still.  Maybe it's the same.  Why is that an  23 appropriate issue at the certification stage?  24  MR. STREETT:  For precisely the same reasons  25 that common issues of market efficiency and publicity
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 are essential at the class certification stage.  2  JUSTICE SCALIA:  How many  how many of  3 these cases  what percentage of these cases continue  4 once there has been class certification?  Do you have  5 any idea?  6  MR. STREETT:  Very few.  Once there's been  7 class  8  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Very few.  Once you get the  9 class certified, the case is over, right?  10  MR. STREETT:  Yes.  And less than onethird  11 of 1 percent actually go to a verdict.  12  JUSTICE BREYER:  I  I see that and I  13 understand that.  But that still strikes me as a  14 different legal issue, and your answer is, well, we  15 decide other things at the class certification stage.  16 Now, I might put in parentheses:  Which don't belong  17 there.  18  So if  why are we deciding any of  why,  19 in other words?  I still have my question, why?  20  MR. STREETT:  Because if market efficiency  21 and publicity were not considered at the class  22 certification stage, then the plaintiff would just have  23 to plead an efficient market and would immediately go,  24 you know, to collect $200 and pass go and get right to  25 class certification.  That cannot be what Basic meant
23

1 when it said the presumption of reliance depends on  2 plaintiffs relying in common on a misrepresentation that  3 distorted the market price.  4  And I would just point out that the  5 government and the Fund have conceded that price impact  6 evidence can be considered at the class certification  7 stage.  8  JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask you a question  9 about these event studies to which you referred?  How  10 accurately can they distinguish between the effect of  11 the  the effect on price of the facts contained in a  12 disclosure and an irrational reaction by the market, at  13 least temporarily, to the facts contained in the  14 disclosure?  15  MR. STREETT:  Event studies are very  16 effective at making that sort of determination.  In  17 fact, in this particular case, the expert testified that  18 she had done that sort of separation of effects before,  19 but she was not asked to do so in this case.  And that's  20 at JA410 to 411.  And the law professors and others have  21 explained in great detail how the event studies work.  22  But in any event, that's a proper burden to  23 place on the plaintiff because they are the ones that  24 are invoking this powerful presumption to bypass the  25 requirement of common actual reliance.  They are the
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 ones who should have to show that it's the  2 misrepresentation that distorted the market price and  3 not some other irrational reaction.  4  But I wanted to mention that at page 26 of  5 the government's brief and page 53 of the Fund's brief,  6 they concede that price impact evidence should come in  7 at class certification, but they want to make it only  8 one factor in determining whether the markets were  9 efficient.  Well, why would you spend all of your time  10 looking at market efficiency and looking at price impact  11 as only one factor, instead of looking at the thing that  12 actually matters, whether the price was distorted.  13  And if I could reserve the balance of my  14 time, Mr. Chief Justice.  15  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.  16  Mr. Boies.  17  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID BOIES  18  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT  19  MR. BOIES:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it  20 please the Court:  21  I want to begin by emphasizing, as this  22 Court did in Basic, that the premise of the Basic  23 decision was not economic theory; it was commerce.  This  24 Court said the premise was Congress's premise.  And I  25 think that when this Court decided the Amgen case, it
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 said that the fraudonthemarket presumption was a  2 substantive doctrine of Federal securities law.  3  This is something that has been embedded in  4 the law.  It has been ratified by Congress in the PSLRA  5 and in SLUSA.  It is something that Congress has  6 legislated assuming that this was the law.  7  For example, in SLUSA, what Congress did, as  8 this Court is aware of from last month's decision, is  9 that it moved securities class actions out of State  10 courts and into Federal courts.  It said you can't bring  11 class actions under State law.  12  JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you make of  13 Section  what do you make of Section 203 of the PSLRA,  14 which says that "Nothing in this Act or the amendments  15 made by this Act shall be deemed to create or ratify any  16 implied private right of action"?  Do you think that was  17 a ratification of Basic?  18  MR. BOIES:  Well, Your Honor, what this  19 Court said in Amgen afterwards is that what the  what  20 Congress did was it did ratify the private cause of  21 action.  And whether that was right or wrong, that is  22 what this Court held in Amgen just a year or so ago.  23  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did we refer to Section  24 203  25  MR. BOIES:  You did not.
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  JUSTICE SCALIA:   in connection with that  2 dictum?  3  MR. BOIES:  I do not  I do not believe  4 that you did, Your Honor.  5  JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think maybe we didn't  6 know about it, as the parties here seemingly did not  7 know about it.  I don't think it was cited in the  8 briefs.  9  MR. BOIES:  But whether or not you conclude  10 that that was ratified or not, Your Honor, I think  11 what  what you must conclude is that when Congress  12 acted both with respect to the PSLRA and even more so  13 with respect to SLUSA, it acted on the assumption that  14 they were legislating on the backdrop of the  15 fraudonthemarket theory.  The SLUSA  the SLUSA  16 decision  the SLUSA legislation makes no sense without  17 the fraud on the market.  18  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course.  But  but to  19 act on the assumption that the courts are going to do  20 what they've been doing is quite different from  21 approving what the courts have been doing.  As I  22 understand the history of these things, there was one  23 side that wanted to overrule Basic and the other side  24 that wanted to endorse Basic, and they did neither one.  25 They simply enacted a law that assumed that the courts
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 were going to continue Basic.  I don't see that that  2 is  is necessarily a ratification of it.  It's just an  3 acknowledgment of reality.  4  MR. BOIES:  I think, obviously, the Court  5 will decide.  But I think that when you look at what  6 Congress has done, and they have legislated based on the  7 assumption of what the law is and they have made a  8 decision that, as I think the Court recognizes, would  9 never have been made in SLUSA if  if they did not  10 if Congress did not believe that the fraudonthemarket  11 theory existed.  12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Boies, I don't know  13 that I fully understood your point in your brief as to  14 why proving price impact was so difficult.  Is it equal  15 to proving market efficiency?  Is it less burdensome,  16 more burdensome?  Why can't it be done at the class  17 certification stage?  18  MR. BOIES:  Sure.  19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And the question I asked  20 your adversary:  If we believe price impact is  21 necessary, why keep Basic if we're going to put it in a  22 class certification?  23  MR. BOIES:  Let me answer in the context of  24 this particular case.  In this particular case,  25 Halliburton repeatedly said to analysts that their
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 insurance and other reserves were adequate to cover any  2 asbestos exposure.  Those assertions proved to be not  3 accurate.  The day that it was clear that they were not  4 accurate, December 7, 2001, the stock price dropped  5 42 percent.  There were no confounding factors.  Their  6 expert says December 7th was all about asbestos.  7  Now, we have a dispute as to what their  8 their news that was revealed on December 7th was  9 expected or unexpected.  They said it was unexpected.  10 They were caught unaware.  We said they knew it all the  11 time and we've got some documents that indicate that.  12 But whether we are right or they are right, that is  13 clearly a merits decision.  That's clearly not a class  14 certification issue.  15  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But why  why couldn't  16 that same showing be made under the law professors'  17 theory of an event study at the certification stage?  18  MR. BOIES:  You could, Your Honor, and with  19 respect to December 7th, I think that would not be so  20 difficult.  But there are nine dates, and with respect  21 to five of those nine dates when there was news  22 revealed, they claim confounding factors.  23  So what you have to do is you have to  24 separate out the confounding factors, the allegedly  25 confounding factors, with respect to each one of those
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 dates, and you've got to do a detailed event study.  And  2 in addition  3  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  For each  for each one  4 of  of  5  MR. BOIES:  For each  for each day  6  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Oh, each day.  7  MR. BOIES:   you've got to look at what  8 the confounding factors are and you have to try to  9 separate them.  That's very complicated.  It takes a lot  10 of time.  It's very expensive.  It's a lot of expert  11 testimony.  It is why these things, for example, at the  12 summary judgment stage, are very complicated.  13  Now, an event study that demonstrates the  14 efficiency of the market is far simpler.  Halliburton  15 conceded the efficiency of this market.  This is not a  16 case in which there is any doubt about the efficiency of  17 the market.  Halliburton has repeatedly conceded the  18 efficiency of this market.  19  And I think that when you are trying to  20 prove market efficiency, all you have to do is  21 demonstrate that the basic premise that generally  22 markets take into account  welldeveloped markets take  23 into account publicly available news, and you can do  24 that relatively simply.  Trying to separate out all of  25 the factors that you need to separate out in order to
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 determine whether a culpable misrepresentation was the  2 cause of a price change and how much of that price  3 change was due to that culpable information is very  4 complicated.  5  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But even if Basic did not  6 rely on economic theory, and there is a dispute on  7 that  I think the opinion is not quite clear on that  8 one way or the other  if later economic theories show  9 that the market doesn't react in the way Basic assumed  10 it automatically did, then certainly Congress would not  11 wish to foreclose the Court from considering that new  12 evidence if it was a strong, clear and convincing, et  13 cetera.  14  MR. BOIES:  Well, first  first, Your  15 Honor, I would  I'd say three things about that.  16 First, I would say that Basic's premise is not an  17 economic theory.  It's not a premise of economic theory.  18 It is a premise of Congress.  That's what Basic held,  19 and I think correctly held, that the  the whole  20 premise of the securities laws is that when you make  21 fraudulent misrepresentations, you make them public, it  22 affects the market price.  23  The second thing is there hasn't been  24 anything that has changed since Basic that makes Basic  25 less applicable.
31

1  JUSTICE ALITO:  But, Mr. Boies, to say that  2 false representation affects the market price is quite  3 different from saying that it affects the market price  4 almost immediately, and it's hard to see how the Basic  5 theory can be sustained unless it does affect the market  6 price almost immediately in what Basic described as an  7 efficient market.  Isn't that true?  Why should someone  8 who purchased the stock on the day, shortly, you know,  9 an hour or two after the disclosure, be entitled to  10 recovery if in that particular market there is some lag  11 time in incorporating the new information?  12  MR. BOIES:  I think  I think Your Honor is  13 right that if there is lag time in a particular market,  14 somebody who has purchased immediately after the  15 misrepresentation would not be entitled to recover.  16 However, in this case and in most cases that isn't an  17 issue, because in most cases what the classaction  18 period is, is something that gives all of the  19 misrepresentations fulltime to permeate into the  20 market.  21  So it is theoretically possible that you  22 could have a market where there is a lag time.  23 Although, I will say that since Basic was decided that  24 lag time has gotten shorter and shorter.  Whatever  25 whatever the truth is about how efficient markets were,

1 they are massively more efficient today than they were  2 in 1988.  In 1988, people were still sitting home  3 reading Barron's to try to figure out what was happening  4 in the stock market.  Today you have realtime  5 information.  You have all sorts of ways of  6 communicating information.  People  people strive to  7 be able to trade in a second faster  8  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the Petitioners say  9 that this has produced a whole new genre of investors  10 that are quite different from the fellow that's sitting  11 at home reading the Wall Street Journal.  12  MR. BOIES:  But all of those  13  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And your theory doesn't  14 seem to take that into account.  15  MR. BOIES:  It does, Your Honor, because all  16 of those people rely on the integrity of the market.  17 They talk about these highfrequency traders that trade  18 in and out.  Well, if they trade in and out during a  19 day, most of them will not be affected by this because  20 they will have gone in and come out with the  21 misrepresentation intact.  It's only when somebody buys  22 when the price is inflated or artificially depressed and  23 then sells after the corrected disclosure that there is  24 damage.  These people are all buying and selling based  25 on the integrity of the market price.  In fact, when you
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 talk about these trading programs, those trading  2 programs, even more than the Barron's reader at home, is  3 relying on the integrity of the market price because  4 that's all they have to rely on.  5  If you think about it, if you went to one of  6 these people with these trading programs and said,  7 you're going to trade on this stock, would you trade on  8 the stock if you knew that it was artificially inflated,  9 of course they wouldn't.  Everybody who buys assumes  10 that that market price is  is fraudfree.  And  11  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you're saying that  12 the events  that the law professors' event study  13 theory is flawed, then?  14  MR. BOIES:  No.  You can have event studies,  15 and one of the things that an event study does is it  16 attempts to determine whether or not a particular price  17 movement was related to a particular piece of  18 information.  That will tell you whether that price  19 movement is related to something that is culpable or not  20 culpable.  21  JUSTICE ALITO:  I didn't understand what you  22 just said.  Are you saying there are not categories of  23 investors who might say to themselves, You know what?  24 There is a possibility that the price of this stock on  25 this particular day might be artificially inflated by
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 some statement that was made in the past that isn't  2 true, but I'm going to buy it anyway because I still  3 think it's either  it's undervalued or because there  4 are some other statistics regarding the market that tell  5 me that this price is going to go up.  6  You tell me that there are  there are not  7 large categories of investors who think that way?  8  MR. BOIES:  I think there are not large  9 categories of investors that think that way, and I think  10 there is absolutely no empirical evidence at all that  11 there are large categories of investors that think that  12 way.  13  Could there be somebody who says, I know  14 this is fraudulent, but I think I can buy; I know it's  15 in  I know it's artificially inflated, but I think I  16 can buy and ride it up and I can get out before the  17 market knows that there is an artificial inflation.  18 There might be somebody like that, and that's why Basic  19 provides for a rebuttable presumption.  You can  20  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I ask you about the  21 rebuttable presumption, Mr. Boies?  You agree that the  22 Basic is a presumption and that it can be rebutted, but  23 you say that's a question for the merits.  24  What difference does it make at what stage  25 the rebuttal is allowed?  What practical difference does
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 it make if the inquiry is made at the certification  2 stage rather than the merits stage?  3  MR. BOIES:  I think it makes  it makes two  4 differences, Your Honor.  One is it would inevitably put  5 off the class certification stage because now you would  6 have to have a discovery on issues that are ordinarily  7 considered to be merits issues.  The way an action now  8 works is that you will have just very limited class  9 certification discovery and you won't get to the full  10 merits discovery until you get past class certification.  11  Now, a lot of cases fail class  12 certification.  The idea that the class certification is  13 not a  a important step is simply wrong.  A lot of  14 cases fail class certification.  15  But once you have passed class  16 certification, now you go into merits discovery.  If you  17 were going to decide these issues that are ordinarily  18 today decided at the merits stage, you would have to  19 delay class certification until you'd had that merits  20 discovery.  21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't dispute  22 I'm sorry  you don't dispute though, that you usually  23 don't get to the merits stage once the classes have been  24 certified, do you?  25  MR. BOIES:  That  that is true, Your
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Honor, but a lot of that is because there are summary  2 judgment motions.  Remember, you have  you have three  3 merit stages already:  A pleading stage, which under the  4 PSLRA, under this Court's decision in Dura, is a real  5 obstacle; second, you have summary judgment; and then  6 third, you have the trial.  More than half of all  7 securities class actions, summary judgment is granted in  8 whole or in part, 37 percent wholly, another 25 percent  9 in part.  So the summary judgments  10  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where  where is  11 certification in that timeline?  12  MR. BOIES:  It goes  it goes both ways.  13 Generally, you have summary judgment after class  14 certification.  15  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  16  MR. BOIES:  You could have summary judgment  17 at the class certification stage.  I mean, for example,  18 if you wanted to move in a particular case, if you  19 wanted to move price impact or materiality or any issue  20 into an earlier time frame, there's nothing that  21 prevents a defendant from making a motion for summary  22 judgment on that issue.  And, in fact, if  if there's  23 any doubt about that, this Court could easily clarify  24 that.  That would allow you to have class certification  25 in a temporal way at the same time that you were dealing
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 with the merits.  2  But  but the issue on the merits is that  3 if you don't have a discovery, you can't decide these  4 issues, obviously.  And second, the cost and expense at  5 the class action certification stage and the time delay  6 would increase enormously, because now you would have to  7 have these detailed event studies not just to prove  8 efficiency of the market  which was conceded here, and  9 if it hadn't been conceded, we could have demonstrated  10 it  you also have to show what the impact was of the  11 particular culp  allegedly culpable misrepresentation  12 and disclosure.  13  And, for example, in  in the  in the  14 case that  that we have here, with respect to eight of  15 the nine disclosure dates, we would  we would have a  16 detailed disagreement and detailed expert reports and  17 expert testimony that would go to what was the price  18 impact, what was the damage in this particular case.  19  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Boies, you've said  20 that  that a lot of class certification motions are  21 denied.  I had thought that your friend said that that  22 is very rare except in the Second Circuit.  23  MR. BOIES:  Well  24  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did I hear that wrong,  25 or 
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  MR. BOIES:   I mostly  2  JUSTICE SCALIA:   is he wrong?  3  MR. BOIES:  Well, I think he's wrong.  My  4 personal experience is mostly with the Second Circuit in  5 cases like the Deutsche Bank case.  But the Deutsche  6 Bank case did not relate to rebutting on the basis  7 of price impact.  In the Deutsche Bank case, Judge  8 Forest held that there was not an efficient market.  9  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, my question along  10 the same lines is:  If the misrepresentation is  11 established, from that category of cases, are there many  12 that are still not certified?  Because that would be  13 inconsistent with your whole theory that the market is  14 almost always efficient.  15  MR. BOIES:  Well, you know, we don't argue  16 that the market is  is always efficient, Your Honor.  17 There is a lot of litigation about whether particular  18 markets are efficient, less so with respect to New York  19 Stock Exchange markets, more with respect to NASDAQ and  20 other markets, but there is a lot of litigation as to  21 whether particular markets are or are not efficient.  22  And, indeed, we went to the expense in this  23 particular case of doing an event study because we were  24 concerned that they would challenge the efficiency of  25 the market.  They didn't, but because they could and

BOIES:   we did that.  5  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought there were two  6 questions, and I don't know that you've really answered  7 the two.  I thought your colleague was talking about  8 less than 1 percent, whatever the figure was, is of  9 cases that were certified as classes, how many go to  10 trial.  You said something different, which is that not  11 every class is certified.  12  Do you have a percentage for the amount  13 the number  for that number?  14  MR. BOIES:  I don't have  I don't have a  15 percentage of the classes that are not certified, Your  16 Honor.  But Your Honor is completely correct, that what  17 he was talking about was the number of these cases that  18 actually go to trial.  As I say, more than half of them,  19 a summary judgment is granted in whole or in part.  A  20 very large number of them are now wiped out at the  21 pleading stage as well.  So the idea that there are not  22 significant merits filters that prevent cases from going  23 to trial is simply wrong, both at the pleading stage and  24 at the summary judgment stage.  25  And the question really is:  Are you going

Now, we differ on,  8 you know, what that means, but it does assume it.  9 What  and  and so those previsions would  would  10 sort of be useless if Basic were entirely overruled.  11  What if we adopted the professors'  what,  12 Basic writ small, if  if we adopted their approach,  13 would those provisions of the PSLRA still be effective?  14  MR. BOIES:  I think  I think the  15 provisions of the PSLRA would still be effective, Your  16 Honor.  I think with respect to SLUSA, it's a somewhat  17 different issue.  I think that  I think if you  if  18 you adopted those  those provisions with respect to  19 what's proposed, the PSLRA still would make sense, but I  20 don't think SLUSA would.  21  JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.  22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.  23  MR.

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES  2  AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT  3  MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it  4 please the Court:  5  I'd like to begin by addressing two of the  6 respects in which the Petitioners' counsel argued that  7 circumstances have changed since this Court's decision  8 in Basic.  And the first  one of these was that  9 investors have adopted new strategies that, in his view,  10 don't rely on the integrity of the market price.  And I  11 think it's certainly true that investors have devised a  12 wide array of strategies in an effort to beat the  13 market, but it's hard to imagine one that would render  14 irrelevant evidence that the market price had been  15 distorted by fraud.  16  For example, a particular investor might  17 think there are particular types of information that the  18 market doesn't react to quickly enough, and if I'm  19 following that information in realtime and I can trade  20 before the market catches on, then I can make money; I  21 can buy low and sell high.  Now, that strategy is  22 certainly going to be undermined if there is other  23 information bearing on the market price, the falsity of  24 which that investor is not aware of that caused the  25 market price to be inflated.
42

Alderson Reporting Company

1  Now, I'd  would agree with you, Justice  2 Alito, that in theory, there could be an investor who  3 says in a particular circumstance, I think the gain that  4 I can make by taking advantage of the new information to  5 which the market price has not yet reacted will more  6 than counterbalance the loss I will suffer when the  7 truth about the unrelated information comes to light.  8 That could happen, but even for an investor of that  9 sort, the distortion wouldn't be irrelevant.  It would  10 just be a factor that could be counteractive.  11  And the other thing I would say about the  12 efficiency of the market is that even an investor who is  13 attempting to make money by being the first to take  14 advantage of new information is relying, in essence, on  15 the ultimate ability and tendency of the market to  16 incorporate the information; that is, an investor who  17 thinks that a stock is currently undervalued based on  18 the information he has presumably thinks that in time,  19 the  the stock will no longer be undervalued, the  20 market will come to appreciate the significance of the  21 new information.  That would be the basis for his  22 anticipating that the stock price will rise.  And so  23 even that strategy is dependent in a fundamental way on  24 the propensity of new information to  to change the  25 market price.

1  The second thing I wanted to respond to was  2 Petitioners' assertion that Basic is out of keeping with  3 this Court's more recent decisions regarding the  4 requirements of Rule 23.  And I think that in fact, with  5  at least with respect to the interaction between the  6 merits and Rule 23, the court in Basic did precisely  7 what this Court's decisions in WalMart and Comcast tell  8 courts they ought to do; that is, the Court in Basic was  9 ruling on an appeal from a class certification decision,  10 and it was confronted with two competing visions of what  11 the reliance requirement of the Section 10(b) action  12 should comprise.  13  One of them was the defendant's view that to  14 establish reliance, a plaintiff had to show that he or  15 she actually read the relevant disclosure and took it  16 into account in making a trading decision.  The other  17 vision of reliance was the fraudonthemarket  18 presumption that the  the court ultimately adopted.  19 And the court in Basic recognized that it had to decide  20 this merits question at the class certification stage  21 because the answer to that question would control  22 whether the reliance element was susceptible of common  23 proof.  24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel?  25  MR. STEWART:  If the  I'm sorry.

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sorry to interrupt  2 your train of thought, but were the feasibility and  3 prevalence of event studies something that was around  4 when Basic was decided?  5  MR. STEWART:  I don't know exactly what  6 mode.  I believe that event studies in some form were  7 used to establish both the efficiency of the market and  8 the potential impact of the misstatement on the price.  9 I don't know the extent to which their sophistication  10 matched the sophistication of event studies today.  I  11 would tend to assume that they were much less  12 sophisticated than they are now.  13  JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you explain how the  14 requirement that Basic imposed of proving publicity at  15 the certification stage is consistent with the Court's  16 theory in Amgen?  17  MR. STEWART:  I think the  the theory in  18 Amgen is that in order to decide whether something has  19 to be proved at the class certification stage, you ask  20 first, is it susceptible of common proof; and second, if  21 the class is certified and the  the statement or the  22 fact is ultimately disproved down the road, is the  23 effect going to be that the class splinters or that all  24 plaintiffs lose in common?  And the Court's theory in  25 Amgen, the rationale for saying that publicity had to be
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 proved at the class certification stage, was that if it  2 were proved down the road that the statement was not  3 made publicly, some plaintiffs might still have good  4 claims because they would have heard and relied upon the  5 information even though it wasn't communicated to the  6 public, and therefore the effect of disproof of  7 publicity would not be to cause all class members to  8 lose, it would be to cause the class to splinter.  9  JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that's a  10 realistic  that that is something that's likely to  11 happen in other than extremely rare cases?  12  MR. STEWART:  Well, there  there are  13 certainly plenty of securities fraud cases over the  14 years that involved private misrepresentations made  15 oneonone by a broker, a salesperson, et cetera.  I  16 take your point that in terms of practical significance  17 it is the case that the recoveries in the large class  18 actions dwarf the ones in individual suits.  19  JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, that's  that's  20 what's nagging at me that I don't fully understand.  It  21 may be elementary, but if we had a case where all the  22 plaintiffs had, in fact, and every one in the class had  23 bought on the New York Stock Exchange at such and such a  24 period, then I guess in principle neither would be  25 appropriate for the classification stage 
46

1 certification stage.  2  MR. STEWART:  I'm sorry?  3  JUSTICE BREYER:  Neither would be  4 appropriate for the certification stage.  You wouldn't  5 have to prove efficient markets; all you would have to  6 do is allege them; because, after all, if they do exist  7 then the reliance element is proved subject to rebuttal;  8 and if the rebuttal wins, it's not.  And that's not a  9 question if it's all in common, it's all in common.  10 That's  that's the conceptual point I haven't quite  11 understood.  12  MR. STEWART:  Well, at least to the  13 efficiency of the market, it wouldn't  it wouldn't be  14 the case that disproof of efficiency would defeat the  15 claim of every class member.  16  JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not?  17  MR. STEWART:  Because a particular class  18 member, even without showing an efficient market, could  19 show that he or she personally  20  JUSTICE BREYER:  If we had a class, they all  21 conceded that they bought it on the market at the same  22 time, had no information, then it would go to the later  23 stage?  24  MR. STEWART:  If the class were defined in  25 that manner, as people who had no such information, then

1  then the class wouldn't splinter.  2  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Stewart, can I just  3 can I ask a more general question?  You're representing  4 the SEC here, the principal regulators of the securities  5 markets and the securities industry.  So if  I guess  6 it's a twopart question.  If Basic were overruled, what  7 is  what is the view as to what  how that would  8 affect the securities industry and how it would affect  9 individual decision making with respect to securities?  10 And same question for, if the law professors' position  11 was adopted.  12  MR. STEWART:  Well, let me take the first  13 part first, because I think in part it illustrates an  14 important aspect of this case that tends to get lost.  15 We are arguing about this as though it's procedure, but  16 really what is fundamentally at issue is what is the  17 class of, what is the category of investors who would  18 have a potentially valid Section 10(b)(5) action.  That  19 is, the Petitioners' view is the only people who could  20 be proper plaintiffs in a Section  in a private  21 Section 10(b) suit, whether a class action or an  22 individual action, are people who personally read,  23 reviewed, subjectively took account of the false  24 information.  25  And the view on the other side, the view
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 under  under Basic, is that any person who bought  2 stock at the inflated price on the market, a price  3 inflated by fraud, and subsequently lost money as a  4 result when the truth was made known, any such person  5 would have a remedy; and if Basic were overruled, if  6 people were told, if you buy without doing this sort of  7 research into primary sources, you will have no  8 potential recovery at the end of the day, I don't know  9 that the SEC has a defined view about exactly what the  10 consequences would be, but certainly the consequences  11 are potentially dramatic.  12  You have an amicus brief filed by  13 institutional investors, many of whom rely on indexing  14 strategies, and they try to save management fees by not  15 doing all the research into the primary sources, by  16 allowing the market to do most of the work, and then  17 buying stocks that are broadly representative of the  18 market.  And they've at least  19  JUSTICE SCALIA:  If the  if the SEC brings  20 a fraud action, can it  can it rely on the  on the  21 market theory, fraudonthemarket theory?  22  MR. STEWART:  Well, the SEC would have no  23 wouldn't and would have no need to do so, because  24 reliance wouldn't be an element of the SEC's cause of  25 action.  The SEC would have to establish that there was
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 a violation, but it wouldn't have to establish that it  2 or any individual investor relied; and so the  3 institutional investors at least have represented to the  4 Court that their investment strategies will need to  5 change if they have to choose between saving money by  6 relying on indexing strategies and having available  7 potential avenues for recovery if it turns out  8  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you get to part two of  9 Justice Kagan's question, which is what is your view of  10 the  of the consequences if we adopt the law  11 professors' view?  12  MR. STEWART:  I understand the law  13 professors, that there were a few law professors'  14 briefs.  And I understand the one you're referring to to  15 be the one that basically advocated a shift away from  16 analyzing the general efficiency of the market and  17 focusing only on the effect or lack of effect on the  18 the particular stock.  I don't think that the  19 consequences would be nearly so dramatic.  In fact if  20 anything, that would be a net gain to plaintiffs,  21 because plaintiffs already have to prove price impact at  22 the end of the day.  23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.  24  Mr. Streett, you have 5 minutes remaining.  25  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. STREETT
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS  2  MR. STREETT:  Thank you.  I'd like to start  3 with one statistical matter that was  that was raised  4 by Justice Sotomayor.  The most recent studies by NERA  5 and Stanford show that 75 percent of class certification  6 motions are granted in securities cases; and that number  7 is much, much higher with respect to New York Stock  8 Exchange companies that essentially have no way to  9 dispute market efficiency.  10  Now, I want to turn to the argument that  11 that Basic  12  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How many of those drop  13 out at the summary judgment stage?  14  MR. STREETT:  Only 7 percent even make it to  15 the summary judgment stage, Your Honor.  So out of  16 those, I think Mr. Boies is correct that maybe half are  17 granted and half are denied.  But only 7 percent even  18 make it to that stage, because once the case gets passed  19 class certification, as this Court has recognized time  20 and again, there is an in terrorem effect that requires  21 defendants to settle even meritless claims.  22  Basic did not look to what Congress  23 intended.  Congress did not even have a private cause of  24 action in Section 10(b), and the most analogous cause of  25 action for somebody who purchased in the aftermarket
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 context required a showing of actual reliance.  So the  2 idea that this was somehow based on interpreting the  3 statute is nonsensical.  4  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Whatever it might have  5 been at the beginning, given the most recent  6 legislation, Congress took a look at the 10(b)(5) action  7 and it made a lot of changes.  It made pleading  8 requirements.  It's difficult to say that this  9 Congress would have legislated all these constraints if  10 it thought there was no action to begin with.  11  MR. STREETT:  The PSLRA includes securities  12 actions under both the 1993 and 1934 Act.  It's not just  13 limited to 10(b)(5).  So to Justice Scalia's point,  14 there is actually not a single provision of the PSLRA  15 that would be rendered inoperable.  16  Congress did take a look at it, Your Honor,  17 that's absolutely correct.  It shows it thought about  18 embracing Basic and it thought about overruling Basic;  19 and it chose to do neither.  When Congress wanted to  20 codify one of the judicially created elements of the  21 10(b)(5) cause of action, it did so expressly.  22  JUSTICE BREYER:  What is to prevent now a  23 defendant from going in after the efficient market is  24 shown, and saying, well, we have our event study; and  25 our event study shows that this particular piece of
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 information had no impact, and therefore they are not  2 going to be able to prove reliance by just relying upon  3 efficient markets; and therefore don't certify the  4 class.  Why couldn't you do that right now under Basic?  5  MR. STREETT:  That is what we are asking  6 this Court to hold under our  7  JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, is there anything  8 is there any court that said, no, you can't do that; we  9 forbid you even though it says in Basic that you're  10 allowed to rebut?  11  MR. STREETT:  Yes, Your Honor, that's  12 precisely what the Fifth Circuit held in this case,  13 relying on Amgen to prohibit us from putting on our own  14 price impact evidence; and it acknowledged that there  15 was no price impact in this case.  But it said:  We have  16 to turn a blind eye to that fact.  17  And to Justice Breyer's point, I think  18 Justice Breyer is exactly correct, that market  19 efficiency, publicity and price impact are all in  20 precisely the same boat.  They are all common issues,  21 and if one of those is missing, you do not have loss  22 causation if the class is limited to the exchange.  23  But I don't think this Court should do away  24 with market efficiency, publicity, and I think it should  25 allow price impact at the class certification stage.

1 Otherwise the fraudonthemarket presumption is reduced  2 to a pleading requirement, not  not something that  3 must be established at the class certification stage, as  4 WalMart requires.  5  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So your preference would  6 be to make the plaintiff bear the burden or just for  7 defendants to be able to rebut the price impact  8  MR. STREETT:  It would be most consistent  9 with Rule  10  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   at a class  11 certification?  12  MR. STREETT:  It  it would be most  13 consistent with Rule 23 to place that burden on the  14 plaintiff because it's the plaintiff's duty to show that  15 common issues of reliance predominate.  And the way the  16 plaintiff gets there is by showing that the plaintiffs  17 relied on, in common, on the misrepresentation at the  18 time it distorted the market price.  19  Congress recognized that the presumption was  20 created by this Court essentially sitting as a common  21 law court.  Congress chose to remain silent, which  22 leaves the issue with this Court, where it began, to  23 consider under traditional principles of stare decisis,  24 in light of intervening developments, whether it should  25 be overruled.

1  The  and it should be overruled for one  2 additional reason that we haven't gotten to this  3 morning, which is that the Basicgenerated regime of  4 class actions is harming the very investors that it's  5 supposed to help.  It is the small investors and the  6 shareholders that are paying these judgments out of  7 their own pocket, often to other shareholders, with a  8 huge cut for both sides' lawyers and insurance costs.  9  The Basic regime of class actions is a huge  10 net loss for shareholder wealth.  And it's frequently  11 the small investors who bought before the class period  12 and held all the way through who are paying the judgment  13 because they hold at the time of the settlement, whereas  14 it's the large institutional frequency traders who  15 bought and sold many times during the class period that  16 are getting the money but are not having to pay any  17 because they don't hold at the end of the class period.  18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.  19  The case is submitted.  20  (Whereupon, at 11:18 a.m., the case in the  21 aboveentitled matter was submitted.)  22   23   24   25
