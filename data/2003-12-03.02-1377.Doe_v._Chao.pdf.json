  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this case, it is undisputed that petitioner Buck Doe suffered an adverse effect, the emotional distress typical of a privacy invasion caused by the Department of Labor's intentional and willful violation of the Privacy Act. The only question is whether under these circumstances, petitioner is entitled to recover the Privacy Act's modest $1,000 statutory damages remedy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Before we go further, could you help me out on one thing? You spoke of the modest $1,000 recovery. The argument is made on the other side that, in fact, it would be $1,000 for every publication in this case, for example, for every caption of a - of - of an order that went out, to everyone to whom that order was sent, so that it would not be $1,000, it would be many, many thousands. Is that the proper construction of the statute?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "The answer to that is no, Justice Souter, and let me answer that in at least two ways. First of all, the District of Columbia Circuit has already held that the number of - that the $1,000 is key to each individual and not to the number of disclosures. For example, in the Tomasello case in the D.C. Circuit, there was a simultaneous disclosure of information about a single individual to some 4,000 recipients. That court held -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Okay."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "- and I think correctly, that that would be considered one disclosure under the act and, thus, the individual would be entitled to only a single $1,000 recovery."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What if - what if there had been an initial disclosure and he had protested it? He said, you're violating the statute when you do this and they did it again. Would that be a separate offense?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "That's a closer question - it - because then you - you've got the - the temporal separation that did not exist in the Tomasello case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yeah, but you'd have temporal separation if there were 10 pleadings over a period of 10 months."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "But -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And I take it in that case you're saying, no, there would still just be a - a - a one violation and - and the maximum recovery, at least under this provision, would be 1,000."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "I - I - I think that's right, Justice Souter, and I want to make clear too that for each of those disclosures you're describing, there would have to be an adverse effect described and - and a causation element met in each of those in any case before you even got to the question."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But suppose the IRS -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But that's so easy to establish, as shown here. I mean, it bothers me that somebody else knows my Social Security number. You don't think that's a realistic reason for not assuming application of the statute, do you?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "I - if I understand your question, Justice O'Connor, the answer is, yes, there is a real harm suffered here, and adverse effect is not a meaningless standard. And in this case, you don't just have a situation in which Buck Doe - it's obviously a pseudonym - just alleges, I was harmed. This is a case in which he submitted an affidavit, and more importantly, testified in open court as to the severity and veracity of his emotional -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but wouldn't -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "- and was cross-examined."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "- wouldn't every person who wanted to make such a claim make similar allegations? Is a class action a reasonable possibility in a case like this?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "Let me answer both parts of your question. As to the first part, I - I don't think we can presume that plaintiffs are going to make up an adverse effect. They are certainly under the obligations to testify truthfully, and in this case, the Government had every opportunity that - to - and did cross-examine Mr. Doe as to the veracity of his adverse effect. The magistrate found as a matter of fact he did suffer an adverse effect, the district court adopted it and the Government never appealed that finding, so whatever arguments they have at this point are gone. Second part of your question, class actions. That's certainly the parade of horribles that the Government is trotting out here, and I think perhaps, Justice Souter, may go more - more directly to your question as well. The answer is no. Even if an individual who has suffered an adverse effect caused by an intentional or willful violation of the act is entitled to a statutory damages award without being required to quantify actual damages. There are still at least two individualized issues that will exist in every case. One is the pleading and proof of the adverse effect, which necessarily may vary among different plaintiffs. Second is the causation, and particularly in the causation question, Justice O'Connor, this is not a - a standard that - that plaintiffs lightly leap over. In fact, there are a number of cases, one of which is the Oroquoia decision of the First Circuit, which was handed down while this petition was pending, noted that in cases where the - the adverse effect alleged is a - an emotional distress-type problem, you may well run into causation problems. There could be any number of other stressors in this person's life."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Let's assume that somebody wrongfully and intentionally releases Social Security numbers, you know, just - just a whole bunch of Social Security numbers of their - their entire list. They sell their - their list to somebody. Why wouldn't that be a perfectly valid class action? Every one of them has had the adverse effect of having his Social Security number out there, and every one of them has this same adverse effect, which is the, I don't know, the trauma of knowing that - that your - your Social Security number is floating out there where anybody can use it. Why wouldn't that be a perfectly good class action?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "Well, I - I think that the example you give, the problem remains, particularly one of causation. Some folks may not have an adverse effect, they may not be concerned, I think, particularly if you're describing a case in which it's only the number that's released but the number's not linked to a name. I think in those cases you might have difficulty."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Those numbers are - are linked to names."

    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "May I ask, with respect to that, you brought this case. I mean, you tried to get it certified as a class action and you were unsuccessful. So I - I hear you telling this Court, we were way off-base in attempting to bring this as a class action because the adverse effect is different for each person. So you're giving up on your first loss. I mean, there are other circuits that might say, yeah, why not class action?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "I don't - I don't - I don't contend that there aren't arguments to be made. What I am stating here is that there are some very strong -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But you say you lost fair and square, and now you've seen the error of your ways?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "Well, we lost fair and square and I - and I want to point out too, I want to give another example of a case, and it's one of the cases that the Government cites in its brief as the example of - of this - this problem, and that's the Schmidt case that is pending in the Western District of Wisconsin, which involves a putative class action against the Veterans Administration. In that case, the Western District of Wisconsin held, and this has been since cert was granted in this case, held that, if you prove an adverse effect caused by an intentional, willful violation of the act, you are entitled to statutory damages of $1,000. Nonetheless, that district court refused to certify a class on precisely the grounds that I am describing to you today. So is it conceivable there could be a class action in a case? Yes, it's conceivable, and I do -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But even if they're not class actions, I have, I think, the same problem people have expressed. In Massachusetts, we put our Social Security number on our driver's license. I have it right in my pocket. I show it 10 million times a day, or however many. So suppose that, you know, the IRS releases - California wants to do the same thing. They have 35 million drivers, and the IRS sends them a list so they can check it out, or the Social Security Administration does that and, my God, there's 35 million lawsuits, $1,000 each, that's only 35 billion. Suppose they do it nationwide. There's 200 billion, and that's only Social Security numbers. All you have to do is read through these 14 pages of fine print of the requirements of the Privacy Act, certain days have to be met, certain deadlines, and it's very easy to imagine bankruptcy in the Federal Treasury. All right. So, I mean, you know, trillions, it's easy to see that. I can make up hypotheticals, which I'll spare you, but you see where I'm going, because what I want is that is the horrible. And when I read the horrible, I think, my God, they're right. All right. Now, you tell me why they're not."

Indeed, if anything, if you look - there is a - a reporter that lists every single case decided under the Privacy Act since 1975."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That - that may be true. What's bothering me, which may be the same thing, as Justice Stevens says, is that I might have thought that a Labor Department official could reasonably think, I have a list of 50,000 people here, several are named John Smith, I want to be sure we get the right ones so I'll put the Social Security number as identifier. That doesn't on its - on its face seem like such an unreasonable thing to think, even if it's wrong. And - and yet we have here a finding that not only is it wrong, but that it's intentional and willful, and that's what brings up the problem you come to argue, and I don't know how to deal with it, because I think, well, if this statute, intentional, willful really means the tough thing that you say, well, then it'll work, then you're right, there won't be a horrible. But then I see this case, which seems to me to stand for the proposition that that tough standard isn't being applied. And then I think, my goodness, you're opening the door to the horribles and - and I don't know how to do it because the other part isn't being argued. That's my honest dilemma. I put it to you."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Can - can you tell me what - I - I really have trouble understanding how there can be an adverse effect without actual damage. That's a very strange line. I mean, in - in the Administrative Procedure Act, you talk about any person adversely affected or aggrieved, and that's a person who suffered damage. It seems very strange for Congress to use language that - that sets up two different categories, adverse effect on the one hand, and actual damage on the other. When - when is there an adverse effect without actual damage?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "I - I want - I - I agree with you that that is an actual harm, and I think that's one of the things that the Government is - is trying to cloud the issue a bit in this case, and that is to equate actual damages and actual harm. I submit they are different, that the - in - in interpreting the statute, the deliberate use of a term adverse effect and the deliberate use of a term actual damages, those must be given different meanings."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, do you agree that, or do you contend that adverse effect include - includes emotional distress and that you have to show something like emotional distress before there is an adverse effect?"

    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "Yes, yes indeed, Justice Kennedy, and that is indeed the unanimous position of the Federal courts on that question."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What - what do you say about the position of the - which I understood the circuit to be taking that, on the assumption that there - there was some emotional damage, at least in the sense that the - the man said, I was very upset when I heard that the number was out. Assuming that, I thought the Fourth Circuit was saying, there is a category of harm that is generally non­ compensable in the law, and we assume it ought to be non­ compensable here, and that category is emotional damage, which has no physical manifestation. And the general policy behind that is, we don't allow generally, tort law doesn't allow recovery there because it's too easy to fake. And the Fourth Circuit, I thought, was saying, you know, whether you're talking about damage or whether you're talking about effect, this is an effect that the law simply doesn't generally recognize and it shouldn't be recognized here. That's a different issue from whether it can be quantified or not. What the circuit was saying is, you don't even get to the point of proving quantification. What - what is your response to that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "If that is indeed what the Fourth Circuit's position is, it's squarely wrong. At common law and intentional torts generally, and in privacy torts specifically, this type of harm is compensable in some at least minimal way, even if it cannot be quantified, and I think that's why -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What about - even if there is no physical manifestation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "Even if there is no physical manifestation. Indeed, I submit, Justice Souter, it's - there's nothing surprising about the overall remedial scheme here, because it does track what happened at common law and intentional torts and with respect to intentional privacy torts. In fact, the Privacy Act is more strict even than what was required at common law. At common law, even no damage at all, no - I'm sorry - I don't - I don't want to get back into the confusion over the terms. Even if there was no harm at all, there would be still be some at least minimal award, recognizing the invasion."

But you're saying, what, privacy is privacy and - and -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "Well, I - I want to -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But it's - but if that is so, then let me just get to my question. If that is so, why did the statute go into speaking of actual damage at all? Why didn't the statute simply say, if they invade the privacy by publishing something they shouldn't publish, you get at least $1,000 regardless. But that's not what it said. It's keyed it to actual damage, and it said, if there's actual damage, the person entitled to recovery for actual damage gets at least 1,000, which is something quite different. It does not take the position that it's a per se compensable harm."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "Well, I - I, of course, disagree with your characterization of what subsection (A) in fact says, but let me go back to first part of the answer. We are talking about an adverse effect, so we are talking about having to prove a harm. We're not just talking about the ability to vindicate a privacy interest in the abstract. You can certainly do that at common law, and Congress could have written a statute that allowed you to do that under the Privacy Act. It didn't. It did at least require that you demonstrate an adverse effect and real harm."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And what - can - can you - and this goes back to Justice Scalia's initial question, what is the difference in adverse effect and actual damage?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "The difference is the ability to quantify the harm in some dollar amount."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, but if that's - if that's the case, I don't see why the risk of being subjected to identity theft would be increased by the disclosure of your Social Security number, and if that's true, and I think some people could prove the risk is increased, that would be true of every release of every Social Security number."

    "speech": "So does it not necessarily follow that every one of those releases causes an adverse effect?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "Well, I do not contend that the Privacy Act is a statute that - that compensates in some way for merely increased risk. I think that does go back to the adverse effect here. You do have to have some sort of harm that actualizes, and here it did actualize in his real emotional distress about the disclosure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I mean, that doesn't answer it. The harm does actualize, as you say it, once the Social Security number is released, the harm actualizes. You're at greater risk than you were before. That's - that's actual as can be."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "I can't support that interpretation of the act, although candidly, it - it probably would be a better one for plaintiffs in the - in the run-of-the-mine case. And the reason is this: If the - if the disclosure itself is the adverse effect, what happens is that the causation language in subsection (g)(1)(D) becomes superfluous, and I am being careful to the - the text here -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "Absolutely, Justice Stevens, and I - I - but I'm not sure - I - I don't think the answer is that it would be just superfluous with respect to Social Security numbers. In every case, if the release of any information, let's say it's a medical record, not a Social Security number. If the release itself is the adverse effect, the problem is that does not - that does not hew to the - the causation language contained in subsection (g)(1)(D)."

    "speech": "No, it's a - I agree, Justice Stevens. It does increase the risk, but - but for some people, that increased risk may not cause them an adverse effect, the personal adverse effect. I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal, if I may."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Very well, Mr. Campbell. Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it  please the Court: I'd like to begin by discussing the distinction as we see it between the terms adverse effect and actual damages. And as one of Justice Scalia's questions indicate, the term adverse effect is not one that originated in the Privacy Act. It's - it's a term of art. The general judicial review provision of the Administrative Procedure Act grants a right of action to persons adversely affected or aggrieved, and I don't think it's the case that a plaintiff under the APA needs to show that he has suffered the type of harm that would ordinarily be compensable in damages. Because the APA excludes money damages as an available item of relief, the typical inquiry in - under the APA in determining whether a plaintiff has standing is whether he is likely to suffer harm in the future, not whether he has been harmed in the past. And if we had a hypothetical APA suit, for instance, challenging an ongoing or imminent program by which the Government intended to release Social Security numbers, and a particular plaintiff could show there is a likelihood that my own Social Security number will be released in the near future, I think that would be sufficient in and of itself to establish that that person was adversely affected or aggrieved within the meaning of the act.  He would be suffering a - a violation of his legal right to have information about him maintained within the Government's files and he would also suffer at least an increased risk of identity theft. That would be enough to get him into the - into court to seek prospective, injunctive, or declaratory relief. But those certainly wouldn't be the types of harms that would ordinarily be compensable in damages."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but that - but that's not the question. It - it - the point is it's - it's not only enough to get him into court, which is what it is said adverse effect does here, it is enough under the APA to give him judgment. He wins."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "He wins -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It - it is enough to give - to make his claim a valid - a valid claim."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "He - he wins but -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And the reason he can't get money damages has nothing to do with the magic words, adversely affected. It has to do with simply the fact that money damages are not available under the APA."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "But -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But he wins under the APA."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "But the fact that a plaintiff can win under the APA and, in our view, can't win under the damages provision of the Privacy Act simply reflects what is implicit in the APA's exclusion of money damages as an available item of relief, namely the view that agency action should ordinarily be reviewable in court, and plaintiffs who can show that they would be injured by unlawful government conduct in the future should ordinarily be able to get a judicial order decreeing that that not take place. But plaintiffs are not ordinarily entitled to receive money damages from the Government for wrongs committed against them."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And I take it you're - you're saying here - and they're not here because there's a further requirement of actual damage before they get money."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "That - that's right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "That the damages provisions restricts the availability of monetary relief to a person entitled to recovery, and the phrase, person entitled to recovery, is most naturally construed to mean someone who has not only established a violation of law, but who has established the prerequisites to an award of compensatory relief."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why - why did they put that phrase, entitled to recovery, in there in addition to actual damages? I'll be candid with you that I - I was thinking that maybe they put it in there because they anticipated this - this category of cases like emotional damage without physical manifestations is non-compensable, and that - and that they were trying to leave open that kind of a condition."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "One - one hypothesis as to why the phrase may appear as it does. The phrase originated in the Senate version of the legislation, and the Senate version said that a plaintiff who establishes a will - an intentional or willful violation can collect actual or general damages, but a person entitled to recovery shall receive no less than $1,000. And so, in the context of that provision, the phrase, person entitled to recovery, could be a shorthand for person entitled to recover either actual or general damages."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, he is entitled to recover actual damages if he has any."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "But that -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And he's entitled to recover it if he doesn't have any. He's entitled to recover it, whether he has some or whether he doesn't have some. So I will - I don't understand, you say the most natural meaning of a person entitled to recovery is a person entitled to recovery who actually has actual damages. That isn't how I'd normally read it. I'd - I'd read it somebody who's - who's entitled to get it if he has it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I guess that's the issue."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yeah, that is the issue. So I just want you to explain a little bit more - (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "I mean, I think - I think -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "- about why that's the most natural reading."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "I mean, the more - I think the more natural reading is that a person entitled to recovery is someone who not only has established some of the prerequisites to an actual recovery, namely a compensatory award, but who has established all of them. And if the only compensatory relief available is actual damages, then a person who hasn't established actual damages is not entitled to recovery. But even if a plausible argument could be made the other way, then the canon of construction that waivers of sovereign immunity are to be construed narrowly would compel the Court to read it in - in the narrow way."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, plus - plus the canon that - that you don't give words a meaning that renders them totally superfluous."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "That - that's -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And if it means what Justice Breyer suggests, you can just leave out the words, a person entitled to recovery."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "Or - or -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Just read it, but in no case shall he receive less than the sum of 10,000, of $1,000."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "That's correct. If - if Congress had intended that any plaintiff who established an adverse effect from a willful or intentional violation would automatically receive at least $1,000, it could have used the word person or individual or complainant, which was - which were the words that Congress used elsewhere in the Privacy Act to describe the individual whose rights had arguably been violated."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Or just - just drop entitled to recovery."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Stewart, if - and before going to the words of the statute, this - there are any number of statutes that have actual damages and it can say, or the statutory damages, and some of them have this formula, actual damages and person entitled to recover, and then there's shades in between. Do you - do you really think that Congress, by using those different formulas, meant a different result in what would seem to be cases that don't - are not sensibly distinguished?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "I mean, I think - I think we have to infer that Congress or presume that Congress meant something by the choice of words that it used. And the phrase entitled to recovery is -"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "A benign fiction, right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "A benign fiction, that's right. And I think it is also the case that the phrase, person entitled to recovery, is used very rarely in the United States Code. There are a number of provisions along the lines of actual damages or $1,000, whichever is greater, references to statutory damages or liquidated damages. But the phrase, person entitled to recovery, is very rare and we would presume that Congress intended something specific -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "All right. I - I would - rather than do the presumption of what they intended deduced from canons, et cetera. You assume that it is ambiguous. You certainly got me there. I'm - I see it's ambiguous. And I also believe that Congress did not want to bankrupt the Treasury, destroying Medicare, Social Security, and every other programs we give $1 trillion in damages to people who have the social - I - I - you've got me there. Now, how do - what they - what your opponents say is that is a made-up problem. It doesn't - it isn't going to happen, and the reason it isn't going to happen is because these words, intentional or willful, are not used, the word intentional, as it normally is. It's used in a very special way so that they have to almost - well, you've - now, you've - I'm cross-referencing our earlier argument and I'm at a dilemma here because it's not argued, I don't know how to deal with it, but it seems relevant to the underlying question that is moving me about what Congress intended."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "The petitioner is correct that the phrase intentional or willful has been construed by the lower courts essentially as a term of art, and the prevailing test in the lower courts is whether the agency exhibited flagrant disregard for -"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Oh, I'm sorry. The lower court thing that we've looked up uses an or about that, and one of the parts of the or is without grounds for believing the action to be lawful, which means that part of the test, that if we have an ALJ, or we have people in the agency, just never think about it, as they might not in this case, that that cover - is covered by intentional or lawful. And that's one of the problems I'm having, because it makes me think that that word intentional is a pretty complicated issue, which isn't argued. It seems to be very important, and I don't know what to do."

I - I think what the courts are getting at is something at least akin to the standard that would prevail in a Bivens action, where an individual Federal officer was sued, where the question would be, could a reasonable officer in this person's position have believed that what he was doing was legal? Probably the courts have applied it in a - in a manner that's slightly more deferential to the Government. In - in - it doesn't mean, however, that the Government has to have been shown either to have intentionally violated the law or to have intentionally sought to bring about harm to the plaintiff."

I - I want to be careful about this because we are not arguing that exorbitant liability would inevitably follow from a loss in this case. What we are saying is, if we lose this issue and if the word adverse effect is given the same meaning in the Privacy Act that it has in the APA, the Government would be subject to enormous potential liability. To take an example, following up on one of Justice Breyer's questions, as - as you pointed out, the Privacy Act is not limited to a prohibition on unlawful disclosures. It contains a range of other provisions that could be best be described as technical or even bureaucratic. One, for instance, is that when the Government collects information from private individuals, it has to identify, among other things, the source of authority, either a U.S. Code provision or an executive order that authorizes the information to be collected. And if an agency circulated 100,000 forms and left off the U.S. Code cite, I think, under ordinary APA standards, any person who returned information on that form would be - would suffer an adverse effect, because he would have been deprived of -"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",

We don't condone that behavior. It would be a violation of law, but it's hard to imagine that Congress would have intended that everybody who fills out information on those forms would then be entitled to $1,000."

  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",

He testified - I forget his exact words - but he testified, you know, I was so upset when I heard that they had released my Social Security number, I just didn't know what to do or what to say, something like that.

Suppose this Doe said, I'm very concerned about the impact of this on my credit rating, so I'm going to spend $10 to a credit - credit reporting company to find out whether there's been any theft of my identity, $10.

And even if that kind of machination might be possible in in one category of cases, it would still not be possible in a lot of other categories of potential - of Privacy Act violations. To continue with my answer to Justice Souter's question, the - the second thing we would say about the emotional injury is that, even if some emotional harms were compensable as actual damages under the statute, we don't think that the particular emotional harm alleged here would be, because a Social Security number, unlike, for instance, intimate details about a person's family life, is not inherently private or secret or confidential. It's not the sort of information that would cause a person to say, I would be horrified to think that somebody else knew that even if I could be sure that that person wasn't going to misuse it against me. The - the reason that people are worried about release of Social Security numbers is that that release may lead to some further, more tangible harm, identify theft or -"

So to - to - follow up on this and make our position absolutely clear, we are saying that if the term adverse effect is given its usual meaning, and every plaintiff who establishes an adverse effect from a willful or intentional violation is entitled to $1,000, that the potential financial consequences would be enormous. Now, I would say in all candor that if we lose this case, it's quite possible that the Government would argue in the lower courts that to protect the public fisc, the - the phrase adverse effect should be given a narrower construction under this statute than under the APA.

So the only specific directive that OMB had was to instruct or direct agencies as to their substantive obligations under the act. Now, in the course of doing that, it was entirely appropriate for OMB to go further and offer its view to the agencies as to what consequences would follow if they breached their substantive obligations, but that wasn't a task that was specifically entrusted to OMB by statute, so I don't think there's any basis for inferring that Congress -"

    "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Kennedy, I'd like to address my first point to you, because I - I think you put your finger on one of the number of - of absurd results, or difficult- to-swallow results that flow from accepting the Government's interpretation. The Government's essential contention here is that quantification of actual damages is an essential element of a Privacy Act claim, but boy, what a strange way to write the statute if that's what Congress intended. The - the relative language is reproduced at pages 3 and 4 of petitioner's brief, and it says that whenever an agency fails to comply with any other provision of this section, and I'm going to ellipsis, in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual, the individual may bring a civil action against the agency, and I'm putting another ellipsis there. You then go to subsection (g)(4), which states that if that adverse effect was the result of an intentional or willful violation, then the Government, the United States shall be liable, in the sum - in an amount equal to the sum of. Liability is established once those three prerequisites are met. All that is left at that point is an exercise of arithmetic. It would be a very strange statute that says the United States shall be liable in the sum of the following amounts you are to add up, and that amount would be zero. And, in fact, that would never be the case. Costs are always available to a Privacy Act plaintiff who establishes an adverse effect caused by an intentional or willful violation of the act. So there are certainly going to be at least some recovery. There's no qualification of the costs award with reasonableness of precondition of actual damages. So some - there is going to be a recovery in those cases. Now, if that's the only recovery that's available, it's a very - it's, one, a very strange statute, and number two, a statute that arguably is unconstitutional. But you don't need to read it that way, because the natural reading is, as was pointed out in the argument, that, yes, Congress did anticipate precisely this issue, that privacy invasions very typically result in emotional harms that inherently are not quantifiable, and Congress didn't intend, I can't imagine, to - to make the line of recovery turn on whether you can prove that you put 37 - a 37-cent stamp on an - on an envelope to get your credit report or pay the $10 fee. That's a very arbitrary line. Why would Congress be solicitous of people who suffer the same harm - be solicitous of the one who put a stamp on an envelope? That's a nonsensical. Moreover, it reduces any efficiency savings that are realized under the act as Congress intended by saying, look, we're not going to get into those sorts of proof issues. If you have an emotional distress and it's typical, it's caused by the intentional violation, we don't go through that. You get your damages of $1,000 and let's not go through the proof. That's a very natural reading of the act. But the Government - the Government is asking you to adopt a - an interpretation that has a number of additional problems. It renders the adverse effect requirement superfluous. Proof of actual damages will necessarily in every case require proof of an actual harm and causation. So even the attempt by the Government to place a - a meaning on the adverse effect requirement must fail. Again, it turns the shall language into may, or at best, renders shall illusory, because the sum would be zero in much cases."
