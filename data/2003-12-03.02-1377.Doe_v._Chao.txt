 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 next in No. 02-1377, Buck Doe v. Elaine Chao.
 5 Mr. Campbell.
 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK W. CAMPBELL, IV
 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 8 MR. CAMPBELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 9 please the Court:
 10 In this case, it is undisputed that petitioner
 11 Buck Doe suffered an adverse effect, the emotional
 12 distress typical of a privacy invasion caused by the
 13 Department of Labor's intentional and willful violation of
 14 the Privacy Act. 
 The only question is whether under these 15 circumstances, petitioner is entitled to recover the
 16 Privacy Act's modest $1,000 statutory damages remedy.
 17 QUESTION: Before we go further, could you help
 18 me out on one thing? You spoke of the modest $1,000
 19 recovery. The argument is made on the other side that, in
 20 fact, it would be $1,000 for every publication in this
 21 case, for example, for every caption of a - of - of an
 22 order that went out, to everyone to whom that order was
 23 sent, so that it would not be $1,000, it would be many,
 24 many thousands. Is that the proper construction of the
 25 statute?

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. CAMPBELL: The answer to that is no, Justice
 2 Souter, and let me answer that in at least two ways. 
 3 First of all, the District of Columbia Circuit has already
 4 held that the number of - that the $1,000 is key to each
 5 individual and not to the number of disclosures. For
 6 example, in the Tomasello case in the D.C. Circuit, there
 7 was a simultaneous disclosure of information about a
 8 single individual to some 4,000 recipients. That court
 9 held -
 10 QUESTION: Okay.
 11 MR. CAMPBELL: - and I think correctly, that that
 12 would be considered one disclosure under the act and,
 13 thus, the individual would be entitled to only a single
 14 $1,000 recovery.
 15 QUESTION: What if - what if there had been an
 16 initial disclosure and he had protested it? He said,
 17 you're violating the statute when you do this and they did
 18 it again. Would that be a separate offense?
 19 MR. CAMPBELL: That's a closer question - it -
 20 because then you - you've got the - the temporal
 21 separation that did not exist in the Tomasello case.
 22 QUESTION: Yeah, but you'd have temporal
 23 separation if there were 10 pleadings over a period of 10
 24 months.
 25 MR. CAMPBELL: But -

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: And I take it in that case you're
 2 saying, no, there would still just be a - a - a one
 3 violation and - and the maximum recovery, at least under
 4 this provision, would be 1,000.
 5 MR. CAMPBELL: I - I - I think that's right,
 6 Justice Souter, and I want to make clear too that for each
 7 of those disclosures you're describing, there would have
 8 to be an adverse effect described and - and a causation
 9 element met in each of those in any case before you even
 10 got to the question.
 11 QUESTION: But suppose the IRS -
 12 QUESTION: But that's so easy to establish, as
 13 shown here. I mean, it bothers me that somebody else
 14 knows my Social Security number. You don't think that's a
 15 realistic reason for not assuming application of the
 16 statute, do you?
 17 MR. CAMPBELL: I - if I understand your question,
 18 Justice O'Connor, the answer is, yes, there is a real harm
 19 suffered here, and adverse effect is not a meaningless
 20 standard. And in this case, you don't just have a
 21 situation in which Buck Doe - it's obviously a pseudonym -
 22 just alleges, I was harmed. This is a case in which he
 23 submitted an affidavit, and more importantly, testified in
 24 open court as to the severity and veracity of his
 25 emotional -

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Well, but wouldn't -
 2 MR. CAMPBELL: - and was cross-examined.
 3 QUESTION: - wouldn't every person who wanted to
 4 make such a claim make similar allegations? Is a class
 5 action a reasonable possibility in a case like this?
 6 MR. CAMPBELL: Let me answer both parts of your
 7 question. As to the first part, I - I don't think we can
 8 presume that plaintiffs are going to make up an adverse
 9 effect. They are certainly under the obligations to
 10 testify truthfully, and in this case, the Government had
 11 every opportunity that - to - and did cross-examine Mr.
 12 Doe as to the veracity of his adverse effect. The
 13 magistrate found as a matter of fact he did suffer an
 14 adverse effect, the district court adopted it and the 15 Government never appealed that finding, so whatever
 16 arguments they have at this point are gone.
 17 Second part of your question, class actions. 
 18 That's certainly the parade of horribles that the
 19 Government is trotting out here, and I think perhaps,
 20 Justice Souter, may go more - more directly to your
 21 question as well. The answer is no. Even if an
 22 individual who has suffered an adverse effect caused by an
 23 intentional or willful violation of the act is entitled to
 24 a statutory damages award without being required to
 25 quantify actual damages.

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 There are still at least two individualized
 2 issues that will exist in every case. One is the pleading
 3 and proof of the adverse effect, which necessarily may
 4 vary among different plaintiffs. Second is the causation,
 5 and particularly in the causation question, Justice
 6 O'Connor, this is not a - a standard that - that
 7 plaintiffs lightly leap over.
 8 In fact, there are a number of cases, one of
 9 which is the Oroquoia decision of the First Circuit, which
 10 was handed down while this petition was pending, noted
 11 that in cases where the - the adverse effect alleged is a
 12 - an emotional distress-type problem, you may well run
 13 into causation problems. There could be any number of
 14 other stressors in this person's life.
 15 QUESTION: Let's assume that somebody wrongfully
 16 and intentionally releases Social Security numbers, you
 17 know, just - just a whole bunch of Social Security numbers
 18 of their - their entire list. They sell their - their
 19 list to somebody. Why wouldn't that be a perfectly valid
 20 class action? Every one of them has had the adverse
 21 effect of having his Social Security number out there, and
 22 every one of them has this same adverse effect, which is
 23 the, I don't know, the trauma of knowing that - that your
 24 - your Social Security number is floating out there where
 25 anybody can use it. Why wouldn't that be a perfectly good

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 class action?
 2 MR. CAMPBELL: Well, I - I think that the example
 3 you give, the problem remains, particularly one of
 4 causation. Some folks may not have an adverse effect,
 5 they may not be concerned, I think, particularly if you're
 6 describing a case in which it's only the number that's
 7 released but the number's not linked to a name. I think
 8 in those cases you might have difficulty.
 9 QUESTION: Those numbers are - are linked to
 10 names.
 11 MR. CAMPBELL: I'd still go back to the - there's
 12 a causation problem. If - if you're going to talk - that
 13 is an individualized issue. Now, I -
 14 QUESTION: May I ask, with respect to that, you 15 brought this case. I mean, you tried to get it certified
 16 as a class action and you were unsuccessful. So I - I
 17 hear you telling this Court, we were way off-base in
 18 attempting to bring this as a class action because the
 19 adverse effect is different for each person. So you're
 20 giving up on your first loss. I mean, there are other
 21 circuits that might say, yeah, why not class action?
 22 MR. CAMPBELL: I don't - I don't - I don't
 23 contend that there aren't arguments to be made. What I am
 24 stating here is that there are some very strong -
 25 QUESTION: But you say you lost fair and square,

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 and now you've seen the error of your ways?
 2 MR. CAMPBELL: Well, we lost fair and square and
 3 I - and I want to point out too, I want to give another
 4 example of a case, and it's one of the cases that the
 5 Government cites in its brief as the example of - of this
 6 - this problem, and that's the Schmidt case that is
 7 pending in the Western District of Wisconsin, which
 8 involves a putative class action against the Veterans
 9 Administration. In that case, the Western District of
 10 Wisconsin held, and this has been since cert was granted
 11 in this case, held that, if you prove an adverse effect
 12 caused by an intentional, willful violation of the act,
 13 you are entitled to statutory damages of $1,000. 
 14 Nonetheless, that district court refused to certify a 15 class on precisely the grounds that I am describing to you
 16 today.
 17 So is it conceivable there could be a class
 18 action in a case? Yes, it's conceivable, and I do -
 19 QUESTION: But even if they're not class actions,
 20 I have, I think, the same problem people have expressed. 
 21 In Massachusetts, we put our Social Security number on our
 22 driver's license. I have it right in my pocket. I show
 23 it 10 million times a day, or however many. So suppose
 24 that, you know, the IRS releases - California wants to do
 25 the same thing. They have 35 million drivers, and the IRS

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 sends them a list so they can check it out, or the Social
 2 Security Administration does that and, my God, there's 35
 3 million lawsuits, $1,000 each, that's only 35 billion. 
 4 Suppose they do it nationwide. There's 200 billion, and
 5 that's only Social Security numbers. All you have to do
 6 is read through these 14 pages of fine print of the
 7 requirements of the Privacy Act, certain days have to be
 8 met, certain deadlines, and it's very easy to imagine
 9 bankruptcy in the Federal Treasury.
 10 All right. So, I mean, you know, trillions,
 11 it's easy to see that. I can make up hypotheticals, which
 12 I'll spare you, but you see where I'm going, because what
 13 I want is that is the horrible. And when I read the
 14 horrible, I think, my God, they're right. 
 All right. 15 Now, you tell me why they're not.
 16 MR. CAMPBELL: In the hypothetical that you're
 17 proposing, Justice Breyer, I think there are several
 18 answers.
 19 QUESTION: And just make up, you know, it's easy
 20 for both of us to make up a lot.
 21 MR. CAMPBELL: Sure.
 22 QUESTION: I want to know what are the
 23 protections if you win against generating millions and
 24 millions of lawsuits with billions of dollars.
 25 MR. CAMPBELL: In - in the hypotheticals that

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 you've described, if I could take those on their terms
 2 first. It's very likely that one of the exceptions to the
 3 Privacy Act disclosure is going to apply usual - if it's
 4 the case that - that this is a working relationship
 5 between the Federal Government and various state
 6 governments and the like, that may well fall within the
 7 usual use.
 8 There are a number of these exceptions listed,
 9 so certainly you have to look to those first. Have to go
 10 - go back to - this would have to be intentionally
 11 wrongful conduct by the Government -
 12 QUESTION: Well, yeah, I can't imagine any
 13 government agency that takes place that isn't intentional. 
 14 You always have people intending to do what they do in the 15 Government.
 16 MR. CAMPBELL: Well -
 17 QUESTION: Nobody released these - nobody -
 18 nobody puts anything on a piece of paper, releases it,
 19 isn't intentional. 
 20 MR. CAMPBELL: Certainly the - the intent to
 21 release the - the information would be correct, but that's
 22 not the same as to say there was an intent to violate the
 23 Privacy Act.
 24 QUESTION: Ah, in other words, in order to
 25 recover - now, that's an important point to me - in order

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to recover, the plaintiff has to show that the government
 2 individuals or the agency not only intended to do what did
 3 violate the act, but they intended that what they did
 4 would violate the Act. They knew about the - that's
 5 willful, it's like they knew about the legal obligation
 6 and they intentionally violated it.
 7 MR. CAMPBELL: That's correct, Justice -
 8 QUESTION: Well, then, how did you ever win this
 9 one?
 10 QUESTION: That's - that's - that's a very
 11 strong -
 12 QUESTION: Yeah, very strong.
 13 QUESTION: - instruction. Ordinary - ignorance
 14 of the law is - is no defense, and there are all sorts of 15 statutes that use the word willful, which simply means
 16 that you intended to do the act that you did, not that you
 17 knew it violated the law.
 18 MR. CAMPBELL: Well, in - in this case - I - the
 19 consistent constructions of - of the Privacy Act is it's -
 20 it's greater than gross negligence. It - it necessarily
 21 encompasses more than just I intended to do something. 
 22 It's that I - I willfully blind to my obligations in the -
 23 24 QUESTION: Well, how about this case? How - how
 25 was that shown in this case?

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. CAMPBELL: In pages - if I could point the
 2 Court to pages - bear with me for one moment - pages 90 -
 3 96 -
 4 QUESTION: This was a - this was a distribution
 5 by administrative law judges -
 6 MR. CAMPBELL: That's correct.
 7 QUESTION: - of hearing notices and decisions?
 8 MR. CAMPBELL: That - among other things. The
 9 answer is yes, Justice O'Connor. On pages 96A to 97A of
 10 the petitioner's appendix, there is the description of the
 11 magistrate judge's finding that there was a willful
 12 violation of the Privacy Act here and that there was a -
 13 there was no attempt even - no even attempt to comply with
 14 the act's requirements, and I - I would point 15 QUESTION: But to say there's no intent to comply
 16 isn't the same thing as saying that you knew you were
 17 violating the act when you acted.
 18 MR. CAMPBELL: Well, let me amend my answer in
 19 this way, Mr. Chief Justice. A willful ignorance - a
 20 willful ignoring of the act's requirements would qualify
 21 as a willful - and I - I want to -
 22 QUESTION: Well, how can you - how can you
 23 willfully ignore an act's requirements?
 24 MR. CAMPBELL: Well, the Department of Labor was
 25 well aware of what the Privacy Act's requirements were and

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 made no attempt to get the administrative law judges to
 2 comply, and - and I want to go back here this - to one of
 3 the answers I gave with respect to your adverse effect
 4 questions. This issue was decided by the magistrate
 5 judge, adopted by the district court, and this was never
 6 appealed by the Federal Government.
 7 QUESTION: Well, but our concern -
 8 QUESTION: We're concerned here, Justice Breyer
 9 and I guess - what is going to happen if we rule in your
 10 favor? That will probably not result in any benefit for
 11 the Government on this ground, but are we just opening a
 12 can of worms or is - by ruling in your favor?
 13 MR. CAMPBELL: The answer is no, and - and
 14 certainly I acknowledge, Mr. Chief Justice, and Justice 15 Souter and Justice Breyer, that in future cases there
 16 might well be a lot more time spent litigating the issues
 17 of whether there was an adverse - truly an adverse effect
 18 and whether - and - and whether the - the violation was
 19 truly intentional and willful. But I want to -
 20 QUESTION: Okay, but can - can we just go back to
 21 that for a second?
 22 MR. CAMPBELL: Sure.
 23 QUESTION: Because we've been concentrating on
 24 willful, and you say, well, willful requires a very high
 25 standard. As - as you just indicated in your answers, the

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 statute doesn't require willful. It requires intentional
 2 or willful.
 3 MR. CAMPBELL: Or willful.
 4 QUESTION: And it would be even more remarkable
 5 to construe the - the term intentional as requiring
 6 conscious disregard of - of a known statutory obligation.
 7 MR. CAMPBELL: Let - let me answer this way in
 8 response, and maybe it will - will help ease the concerns. 
 9 For 22 years, the interpretation of the Privacy Act that
 10 petitioner offers today has been the law of the land, and
 11 in that -
 12 QUESTION: Do you have a case that says
 13 intentional standing alone must be construed to include
 14 this conscious disregard of a - of a known legal 15 provision?
 16 MR. CAMPBELL: I can't cite a specific case for
 17 that proposition, Justice Souter, but I again go back to
 18 we were talking about intentional or willful, it's a high
 19 burden under any concept of what intentional or willful
 20 will be, and for years, for 22 years, from 1975 to, at the
 21 earliest 1997, when the Sixth Circuit decided the Reno
 22 case, the interpretation that I am offering this Court is
 23 the one that the courts of appeals had unanimously
 24 adopted, and never in those 22 years had the kind of
 25 parade of horribles that the Government posits in this

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 case materialize.
 2 Indeed, if anything, if you look - there is a -
 3 a reporter that lists every single case decided under the
 4 Privacy Act since 1975.
 5 QUESTION: But have any of those cases involved
 6 disclosure of Social Security numbers?
 7 MR. CAMPBELL: None that I recall. That seems to
 8 be a relatively new -
 9 QUESTION: See, this seems to me a particular
 10 kind of disclosure that might happen over and over again
 11 in a very casual way.
 12 MR. CAMPBELL: I - I submit, Justice Stevens, if
 13 it happens in a casual way, that's not going to provide
 14 anyone with a cause of action.
 15 QUESTION: Well, pursuant to a policy such as
 16 they had here of that's the way they use to identify -
 17 driver's license they use it on, the Holiday Inn uses it
 18 for their social - all sorts of people use Social Security
 19 number for another purpose.
 20 MR. CAMPBELL: That's true. It's certainly true
 21 that Social Security numbers are used for other purposes. 
 22 But what is clear from this statute is that Congress was
 23 specifically focused on concerns about Social Security
 24 numbers being disclosed and the adverse effects that can
 25 result from that.

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: That - that may be true. What's
 2 bothering me, which may be the same thing, as Justice
 3 Stevens says, is that I might have thought that a Labor
 4 Department official could reasonably think, I have a list
 5 of 50,000 people here, several are named John Smith, I
 6 want to be sure we get the right ones so I'll put the
 7 Social Security number as identifier. That doesn't on its
 8 - on its face seem like such an unreasonable thing to
 9 think, even if it's wrong.
 10 And - and yet we have here a finding that not
 11 only is it wrong, but that it's intentional and willful,
 12 and that's what brings up the problem you come to argue,
 13 and I don't know how to deal with it, because I think,
 14 well, if this statute, intentional, willful really means 15 the tough thing that you say, well, then it'll work, then
 16 you're right, there won't be a horrible. But then I see
 17 this case, which seems to me to stand for the proposition
 18 that that tough standard isn't being applied. And then I
 19 think, my goodness, you're opening the door to the
 20 horribles and - and I don't know how to do it because the
 21 other part isn't being argued. That's my honest dilemma. 
 22 I put it to you.
 23 MR. CAMPBELL: I - I - I under - I well
 24 understand your dilemma, Justice Breyer, and I again go
 25 back to, I don't doubt if this - if the statute is given

17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 its natural reading, that the $1,000 statutory damages is
 2 available to those to whom the United States shall be
 3 liable, there will be an awful lot more traction, a lot
 4 more fighting over the adverse effect and the particular
 5 circumstances that would rise to the level of an
 6 intentional or willful violation in the future.
 7 QUESTION: Mr. Campbell -
 8 MR. CAMPBELL: That's simply not an issue here.
 9 QUESTION: Really what - what Justice Breyer is
 10 saying is - is that this issue of willfulness or not is
 11 not in the case and we wish it were, because the answer to
 12 that is important. Could we talk a little bit about what
 13 is in the case?
 14 MR. CAMPBELL: Yes, yes, Justice Scalia, thank 15 you.
 16 QUESTION: Can - can you tell me what - I - I
 17 really have trouble understanding how there can be an
 18 adverse effect without actual damage. That's a very
 19 strange line. I mean, in - in the Administrative
 20 Procedure Act, you talk about any person adversely
 21 affected or aggrieved, and that's a person who suffered
 22 damage. It seems very strange for Congress to use
 23 language that - that sets up two different categories,
 24 adverse effect on the one hand, and actual damage on the
 25 other. When - when is there an adverse effect without

18
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 actual damage?
 2 MR. CAMPBELL: I think there frequently can be an
 3 - an emotional harm that is not quantifiable in dollar
 4 terms -
 5 QUESTION: Well -
 6 MR. CAMPBELL: - and that's very common in the
 7 law.
 8 QUESTION: That doesn't mean that it's not
 9 actual. It just means that it's hard to quantify, but
 10 you've had the emotional harm. Why isn't that an - why
 11 isn't that actual - actual harm?
 12 MR. CAMPBELL: I - I want - I - I agree with you
 13 that that is an actual harm, and I think that's one of the
 14 things that the Government is - is trying to cloud the 15 issue a bit in this case, and that is to equate actual
 16 damages and actual harm. I submit they are different,
 17 that the - in - in interpreting the statute, the
 18 deliberate use of a term adverse effect and the deliberate
 19 use of a term actual damages, those must be given
 20 different meanings.
 21 QUESTION: Well, do you agree that, or do you
 22 contend that adverse effect include - includes emotional
 23 distress and that you have to show something like
 24 emotional distress before there is an adverse effect?
 25 MR. CAMPBELL: Yes, yes indeed, Justice Kennedy,

19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 and that is indeed the unanimous position of the Federal
 2 courts on that question.
 3 QUESTION: What - what do you say about the
 4 position of the - which I understood the circuit to be
 5 taking that, on the assumption that there - there was some
 6 emotional damage, at least in the sense that the - the man
 7 said, I was very upset when I heard that the number was
 8 out. Assuming that, I thought the Fourth Circuit was
 9 saying, there is a category of harm that is generally non
 10 compensable in the law, and we assume it ought to be non
 11 compensable here, and that category is emotional damage,
 12 which has no physical manifestation. And the general
 13 policy behind that is, we don't allow generally, tort law
 14 doesn't allow recovery there because it's too easy to 15 fake.
 16 And the Fourth Circuit, I thought, was saying,
 17 you know, whether you're talking about damage or whether
 18 you're talking about effect, this is an effect that the
 19 law simply doesn't generally recognize and it shouldn't be
 20 recognized here. That's a different issue from whether it
 21 can be quantified or not. What the circuit was saying is,
 22 you don't even get to the point of proving quantification.
 23 What - what is your response to that?
 24 MR. CAMPBELL: If that is indeed what the Fourth
 25 Circuit's position is, it's squarely wrong. At common law

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 and intentional torts generally, and in privacy torts
 2 specifically, this type of harm is compensable in some at
 3 least minimal way, even if it cannot be quantified, and I
 4 think that's why -
 5 QUESTION: What about - even if there is no
 6 physical manifestation?
 7 MR. CAMPBELL: Even if there is no physical
 8 manifestation. Indeed, I submit, Justice Souter, it's -
 9 there's nothing surprising about the overall remedial
 10 scheme here, because it does track what happened at common
 11 law and intentional torts and with respect to intentional
 12 privacy torts. In fact, the Privacy Act is more strict
 13 even than what was required at common law. At common law,
 14 even no damage at all, no - I'm sorry - I don't - I don't 15 want to get back into the confusion over the terms. Even
 16 if there was no harm at all, there would be still be some
 17 at least minimal award, recognizing the invasion.
 18 QUESTION: Sure, because privacy -
 19 MR. CAMPBELL: Here you have to put -
 20 QUESTION: - I mean, in your - I understand your
 21 privacy argument, but that's because the invasion of
 22 privacy or the infringement of privacy is regarded simply
 23 as - as injury per se, and - and I thought the circuit was
 24 saying, that's not what we're dealing with here. But
 25 you're saying, what, privacy is privacy and - and -

21
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. CAMPBELL: Well, I - I want to -
 2 QUESTION: But it's - but if that is so, then let
 3 me just get to my question. If that is so, why did the
 4 statute go into speaking of actual damage at all? Why
 5 didn't the statute simply say, if they invade the privacy
 6 by publishing something they shouldn't publish, you get at
 7 least $1,000 regardless. But that's not what it said. 
 8 It's keyed it to actual damage, and it said, if there's
 9 actual damage, the person entitled to recovery for actual
 10 damage gets at least 1,000, which is something quite
 11 different. It does not take the position that it's a per
 12 se compensable harm.
 13 MR. CAMPBELL: Well, I - I, of course, disagree
 14 with your characterization of what subsection (A) in fact 15 says, but let me go back to first part of the answer. We
 16 are talking about an adverse effect, so we are talking
 17 about having to prove a harm. We're not just talking
 18 about the ability to vindicate a privacy interest in the
 19 abstract. You can certainly do that at common law, and
 20 Congress could have written a statute that allowed you to
 21 do that under the Privacy Act. It didn't. It did at
 22 least require that you demonstrate an adverse effect and
 23 real harm.
 24 QUESTION: And what - can - can you - and this
 25 goes back to Justice Scalia's initial question, what is

22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the difference in adverse effect and actual damage?
 2 MR. CAMPBELL: The difference is the ability to
 3 quantify the harm in some dollar amount.
 4 QUESTION: Yes, but if that's - if that's the
 5 case, I don't see why the risk of being subjected to
 6 identity theft would be increased by the disclosure of
 7 your Social Security number, and if that's true, and I
 8 think some people could prove the risk is increased, that
 9 would be true of every release of every Social Security
 10 number.
 11 MR. CAMPBELL: I - I - I would certainly agree
 12 that there is a real risk of identity theft any time
 13 there's a disclosure of a Social Security number,
 14 particularly as here when it's linked directly with the 15 name.
 16 QUESTION: So does it not necessarily follow that
 17 every one of those releases causes an adverse effect?
 18 MR. CAMPBELL: I don't think it is. There could
 19 be - there could be people who aren't bothered by that or
 20 who don't share that fear.
 21 QUESTION: Whether they're bothered about it or
 22 not, they're - they have an increased risk, just if you
 23 increase your risk of death, maybe they're not aware of
 24 it, but it's still an adverse effect.
 25 MR. CAMPBELL: Well, I do not contend that the

23
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Privacy Act is a statute that - that compensates in some
 2 way for merely increased risk. I think that does go back
 3 to the adverse effect here. You do have to have some sort
 4 of harm that actualizes, and here it did actualize in his
 5 real emotional distress about the disclosure.
 6 QUESTION: Well, I mean, that doesn't answer it. 
 7 The harm does actualize, as you say it, once the Social
 8 Security number is released, the harm actualizes. You're
 9 at greater risk than you were before. That's - that's
 10 actual as can be.
 11 MR. CAMPBELL: I can't support that
 12 interpretation of the act, although candidly, it - it
 13 probably would be a better one for plaintiffs in the - in
 14 the run-of-the-mine case. And the reason is this: If the
 15 - if the disclosure itself is the adverse effect, what
 16 happens is that the causation language in subsection
 17 (g)(1)(D) becomes superfluous, and I am being careful to
 18 the - the text here -
 19 QUESTION: Well, it's superfluous with respect to
 20 Social Security numbers, but the statute covers a whole
 21 range of activities other than this particular case.
 22 MR. CAMPBELL: Absolutely, Justice Stevens, and I
 23 - I - but I'm not sure - I - I don't think the answer is
 24 that it would be just superfluous with respect to Social
 25 Security numbers. In every case, if the release of any

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 information, let's say it's a medical record, not a Social
 2 Security number. If the release itself is the adverse
 3 effect, the problem is that does not - that does not hew
 4 to the - the causation language contained in subsection
 5 (g)(1)(D).
 6 QUESTION: Well, the release of medical
 7 information doesn't necessarily increase the risk of any
 8 particular harm. But this particular information does
 9 increase the risk of an identity theft for everybody.
 10 MR. CAMPBELL: It does increase that - it does
 11 increase the risk -
 12 QUESTION: It is not true if you say, well,
 13 you're taking aspirin three times a day or something like
 14 that. So what? But this is not a so-what situation.
 15 MR. CAMPBELL: No, it's a - I agree, Justice
 16 Stevens. It does increase the risk, but - but for some
 17 people, that increased risk may not cause them an adverse
 18 effect, the personal adverse effect.
 19 I would like to reserve the remainder of my time
 20 for rebuttal, if I may.
 21 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Campbell.
 22 Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.
 23 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART
 24 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 25 MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 please the Court:
 2 I'd like to begin by discussing the distinction
 3 as we see it between the terms adverse effect and actual
 4 damages. And as one of Justice Scalia's questions
 5 indicate, the term adverse effect is not one that
 6 originated in the Privacy Act. It's - it's a term of art. 
 7 The general judicial review provision of the
 8 Administrative Procedure Act grants a right of action to
 9 persons adversely affected or aggrieved, and I don't think
 10 it's the case that a plaintiff under the APA needs to show
 11 that he has suffered the type of harm that would
 12 ordinarily be compensable in damages.
 13 Because the APA excludes money damages as an
 14 available item of relief, the typical inquiry in - under 15 the APA in determining whether a plaintiff has standing is
 16 whether he is likely to suffer harm in the future, not
 17 whether he has been harmed in the past. And if we had a
 18 hypothetical APA suit, for instance, challenging an
 19 ongoing or imminent program by which the Government
 20 intended to release Social Security numbers, and a
 21 particular plaintiff could show there is a likelihood that
 22 my own Social Security number will be released in the near
 23 future, I think that would be sufficient in and of itself
 24 to establish that that person was adversely affected or
 25 aggrieved within the meaning of the act.

26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 He would be suffering a - a violation of his
 2 legal right to have information about him maintained
 3 within the Government's files and he would also suffer at
 4 least an increased risk of identity theft. That would be
 5 enough to get him into the - into court to seek
 6 prospective, injunctive, or declaratory relief. But those
 7 certainly wouldn't be the types of harms that would
 8 ordinarily be compensable in damages.
 9 QUESTION: Well, but that - but that's not the
 10 question. It - it - the point is it's - it's not only
 11 enough to get him into court, which is what it is said
 12 adverse effect does here, it is enough under the APA to
 13 give him judgment. He wins.
 14 MR. STEWART: He wins -
 15 QUESTION: It - it is enough to give - to make
 16 his claim a valid - a valid claim.
 17 MR. STEWART: He - he wins but -
 18 QUESTION: And the reason he can't get money
 19 damages has nothing to do with the magic words, adversely
 20 affected. It has to do with simply the fact that money
 21 damages are not available under the APA.
 22 MR. STEWART: But -
 23 QUESTION: But he wins under the APA.
 24 MR. STEWART: But the fact that a plaintiff can
 25 win under the APA and, in our view, can't win under the

27
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 damages provision of the Privacy Act simply reflects what
 2 is implicit in the APA's exclusion of money damages as an
 3 available item of relief, namely the view that agency
 4 action should ordinarily be reviewable in court, and
 5 plaintiffs who can show that they would be injured by
 6 unlawful government conduct in the future should
 7 ordinarily be able to get a judicial order decreeing that
 8 that not take place. But plaintiffs are not ordinarily
 9 entitled to receive money damages from the Government for
 10 wrongs committed against them.
 11 QUESTION: And I take it you're - you're saying
 12 here - and they're not here because there's a further
 13 requirement of actual damage before they get money.
 14 MR. STEWART: That - that's right.
 15 QUESTION: Yeah.
 16 MR. STEWART: That the damages provisions
 17 restricts the availability of monetary relief to a person
 18 entitled to recovery, and the phrase, person entitled to
 19 recovery, is most naturally construed to mean someone who
 20 has not only established a violation of law, but who has
 21 established the prerequisites to an award of compensatory
 22 relief.
 23 QUESTION: Why - why did they put that phrase,
 24 entitled to recovery, in there in addition to actual
 25 damages? I'll be candid with you that I - I was thinking

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that maybe they put it in there because they anticipated
 2 this - this category of cases like emotional damage
 3 without physical manifestations is non-compensable, and
 4 that - and that they were trying to leave open that kind
 5 of a condition.
 6 MR. STEWART: One - one hypothesis as to why the
 7 phrase may appear as it does. The phrase originated in
 8 the Senate version of the legislation, and the Senate
 9 version said that a plaintiff who establishes a will - an
 10 intentional or willful violation can collect actual or
 11 general damages, but a person entitled to recovery shall
 12 receive no less than $1,000. And so, in the context of
 13 that provision, the phrase, person entitled to recovery,
 14 could be a shorthand for person entitled to recover either 15 actual or general damages.
 16 QUESTION: Well, he is entitled to recover actual
 17 damages if he has any.
 18 QUESTION: Yeah.
 19 MR. STEWART: But that -
 20 QUESTION: And he's entitled to recover it if he
 21 doesn't have any. He's entitled to recover it, whether he
 22 has some or whether he doesn't have some. So I will - I
 23 don't understand, you say the most natural meaning of a
 24 person entitled to recovery is a person entitled to
 25 recovery who actually has actual damages. That isn't how

29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 I'd normally read it. I'd - I'd read it somebody who's -
 2 who's entitled to get it if he has it.
 3 QUESTION: Well, I guess that's the issue.
 4 QUESTION: Yeah, that is the issue. So I just
 5 want you to explain a little bit more -
 6 (Laughter.)
 7 MR. STEWART: I mean, I think - I think -
 8 QUESTION: - about why that's the most natural
 9 reading.
 10 MR. STEWART: I mean, the more - I think the more
 11 natural reading is that a person entitled to recovery is
 12 someone who not only has established some of the
 13 prerequisites to an actual recovery, namely a compensatory
 14 award, but who has established all of them. And if the
 15 only compensatory relief available is actual damages, then
 16 a person who hasn't established actual damages is not
 17 entitled to recovery.
 18 But even if a plausible argument could be made
 19 the other way, then the canon of construction that waivers
 20 of sovereign immunity are to be construed narrowly would
 21 compel the Court to read it in - in the narrow way.
 22 QUESTION: Well, plus - plus the canon that -
 23 that you don't give words a meaning that renders them
 24 totally superfluous.
 25 MR. STEWART: That - that's -

30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: And if it means what Justice Breyer
 2 suggests, you can just leave out the words, a person
 3 entitled to recovery.
 4 MR. STEWART: Or - or -
 5 QUESTION: Just read it, but in no case shall he
 6 receive less than the sum of 10,000, of $1,000.
 7 MR. STEWART: That's correct. If - if Congress
 8 had intended that any plaintiff who established an adverse
 9 effect from a willful or intentional violation would
 10 automatically receive at least $1,000, it could have used
 11 the word person or individual or complainant, which was -
 12 which were the words that Congress used elsewhere in the
 13 Privacy Act to describe the individual whose rights had
 14 arguably been violated.
 15 QUESTION: Or just - just drop entitled to
 16 recovery.
 17 MR. STEWART: Exactly.
 18 QUESTION: Shall a person receive less than the
 19 sum of -
 20 MR. STEWART: And the other point I would - we
 21 would make in following up on one of Justice -
 22 QUESTION: Mr. Stewart, if - and before going to
 23 the words of the statute, this - there are any number of
 24 statutes that have actual damages and it can say, or the
 25 statutory damages, and some of them have this formula,

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 actual damages and person entitled to recover, and then
 2 there's shades in between. Do you - do you really think
 3 that Congress, by using those different formulas, meant a
 4 different result in what would seem to be cases that don't
 5 - are not sensibly distinguished?
 6 MR. STEWART: I mean, I think - I think we have
 7 to infer that Congress or presume that Congress meant
 8 something by the choice of words that it used. And the
 9 phrase entitled to recovery is -
 10 QUESTION: A benign fiction, right?
 11 MR. STEWART: A benign fiction, that's right. 
 12 And I think it is also the case that the phrase, person
 13 entitled to recovery, is used very rarely in the United
 14 States Code. 
 There are a number of provisions along the 15 lines of actual damages or $1,000, whichever is greater,
 16 references to statutory damages or liquidated damages. 
 17 But the phrase, person entitled to recovery, is very rare
 18 and we would presume that Congress intended something
 19 specific -
 20 QUESTION: All right. I - I would - rather than
 21 do the presumption of what they intended deduced from
 22 canons, et cetera. You assume that it is ambiguous. You
 23 certainly got me there. I'm - I see it's ambiguous. And
 24 I also believe that Congress did not want to bankrupt the
 25 Treasury, destroying Medicare, Social Security, and every

32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 other programs we give $1 trillion in damages to people
 2 who have the social - I - I - you've got me there.
 3 Now, how do - what they - what your opponents
 4 say is that is a made-up problem. It doesn't - it isn't
 5 going to happen, and the reason it isn't going to happen
 6 is because these words, intentional or willful, are not
 7 used, the word intentional, as it normally is. It's used
 8 in a very special way so that they have to almost - well,
 9 you've - now, you've - I'm cross-referencing our earlier
 10 argument and I'm at a dilemma here because it's not
 11 argued, I don't know how to deal with it, but it seems
 12 relevant to the underlying question that is moving me
 13 about what Congress intended.
 14 MR. STEWART: The petitioner is correct that the 15 phrase intentional or willful has been construed by the
 16 lower courts essentially as a term of art, and the
 17 prevailing test in the lower courts is whether the agency
 18 exhibited flagrant disregard for -
 19 QUESTION: Oh, I'm sorry. The lower court thing
 20 that we've looked up uses an or about that, and one of the
 21 parts of the or is without grounds for believing the
 22 action to be lawful, which means that part of the test,
 23 that if we have an ALJ, or we have people in the agency,
 24 just never think about it, as they might not in this case,
 25 that that cover - is covered by intentional or lawful. 

33
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 And that's one of the problems I'm having, because it
 2 makes me think that that word intentional is a pretty
 3 complicated issue, which isn't argued. It seems to be
 4 very important, and I don't know what to do.
 5 MR. STEWART: I - I think, with respect to the -
 6 the language from the court of appeals' opinion that you
 7 quoted, the without grounds to believe that -
 8 QUESTION: I have three of them like that.
 9 MR. STEWART: Right. I - I think what the courts
 10 are getting at is something at least akin to the standard
 11 that would prevail in a Bivens action, where an individual
 12 Federal officer was sued, where the question would be,
 13 could a reasonable officer in this person's position have
 14 believed that what he was doing was legal? 
 Probably the 15 courts have applied it in a - in a manner that's slightly
 16 more deferential to the Government.
 17 In - in - it doesn't mean, however, that the
 18 Government has to have been shown either to have
 19 intentionally violated the law or to have intentionally
 20 sought to bring about harm to the plaintiff. 
 21 QUESTION: Do we have to decide that in this
 22 case?
 23 MR. STEWART: No, no, I don't think you need to
 24 decide that.
 25 QUESTION: I'd like a lot more argument on it

34
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 before I decide that question.
 2 MR. STEWART: That - that's correct. 
 3 QUESTION: Why -
 4 QUESTION: And some briefing on it.
 5 MR. STEWART: As the case comes to this Court,
 6 both parties are in agreement, or neither party contests
 7 the proposition that an intentional or willful violation
 8 was established.
 9 QUESTION: Mr. Stewart, what has happened in the
 10 28-some years that this has been in effect concerning the
 11 amount of recoveries against the Government?
 12 MR. STEWART: I - I would candidly acknowledge we
 13 have not had a problem with enormous recoveries against
 14 the Government up to this point.
 15 QUESTION: What happened in the 1990 lawsuit you
 16 refer to on mailing of IRS farm - form 1040s, that had a
 17 Social Security number and the name.
 18 MR. STEWART: That - that was -
 19 QUESTION: What happened to that case?
 20 MR. STEWART: That was ultimately dismissed on
 21 the ground that the Social Security numbers were not
 22 records, which is contrary to the general course of the
 23 law, which is that Social Security numbers would be - be
 24 records. I - I want to be careful about this because we
 25 are not arguing that exorbitant liability would inevitably

35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 follow from a loss in this case. What we are saying is,
 2 if we lose this issue and if the word adverse effect is
 3 given the same meaning in the Privacy Act that it has in
 4 the APA, the Government would be subject to enormous
 5 potential liability.
 6 To take an example, following up on one of
 7 Justice Breyer's questions, as - as you pointed out, the
 8 Privacy Act is not limited to a prohibition on unlawful
 9 disclosures. It contains a range of other provisions that
 10 could be best be described as technical or even
 11 bureaucratic. One, for instance, is that when the
 12 Government collects information from private individuals,
 13 it has to identify, among other things, the source of
 14 authority, either a U.S. Code provision or an executive 15 order that authorizes the information to be collected. 
 16 And if an agency circulated 100,000 forms and
 17 left off the U.S. Code cite, I think, under ordinary APA
 18 standards, any person who returned information on that
 19 form would be - would suffer an adverse effect, because he
 20 would have been deprived of -
 21 QUESTION: Yeah, but that won't hurt you if - if,
 22 in fact, to show liability here, you have to show that the
 23 agency officials who made up that form knew - let's make
 24 it really tough - knew that leaving it off was command -
 25 putting it on was commanded by the act and they say, ha ha

36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 ha, I know it's commanded by the act, but I'm not going to
 2 do it. 
 3 MR. STEWART: I mean -
 4 QUESTION: Now, that'll be pretty rare and the -
 5 MR. STEWART: It would be rare.
 6 QUESTION: So the -
 7 MR. STEWART: Well, you could - you could imagine
 8 a situation, and we wouldn't condone this - this conduct,
 9 but you can imagine a situation in which an agency
 10 official gets back the 100,000 forms from the printer and
 11 says, oh my gosh, the U.S. Code cite was left off, but
 12 then decides, I know we're supposed to do this, but I'm
 13 not going to reprint 100,000 forms for something like
 14 that, let's circulate them. We don't condone that
 15 behavior. It would be a violation of law, but it's hard
 16 to imagine that Congress would have intended that
 17 everybody who fills out information on those forms would
 18 then be entitled to $1,000.
 19 QUESTION: Just to try to get this issue out of
 20 the case, are you content to have us decide this case on -
 21 on the assumption, just for the sake of argument but
 22 without ruling, that - that the act requires willfulness
 23 in the - in the most extreme sense that Justice Breyer
 24 describes? Are you willing to have us decide the case on
 25 that assumption?

37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. STEWART: Yes.
 2 QUESTION: You're willing to have us decide what
 3 was not - what it was over, that there is an adverse
 4 effect? In fact, the - the Government didn't dispute
 5 that, didn't dispute adverse effect, did it?
 6 MR. STEWART: Not - not as to Buck Doe. The -
 7 the magistrate judge held that each of the plaintiffs had
 8 established an adverse effect simply by release of the
 9 Social Security numbers, and the district court didn't
 10 expressly endorse that view, but didn't reject it either.
 11 QUESTION: Is it your - is it your argument - and
 12 I'm glad we're back to the statute - that in order to
 13 determine in this case, in this case, whether there was a
 14 cause of action, you had to read beyond the adverse effect 15 clause and go down to for - or before - and decide also
 16 whether there was actual damages, before there was a cause
 17 of action?
 18 MR. STEWART: You - you wouldn't have to decide
 19 whether there was proof of actual damages, but yes, I
 20 think if it was apparent on the complaint that there was
 21 an adverse effect but no possibility of proving actual
 22 damages, then the suit shouldn't be - shouldn't go
 23 forward, but -
 24 QUESTION: That - that's an - that's an unusual
 25 way to write the statute. It's unusual to - to write the

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 statute in a way where I don't know if I have a cause of
 2 action until I get down to where the damages are defined.
 3 MR. STEWART: I - I agree, but I think it would
 4 be -
 5 QUESTION: Usually I would say that any person
 6 injured is the way we would expect this statute to have
 7 been written.
 8 MR. STEWART: I agree, and it may be that to -
 9 Congress anticipated that questions concerning damages
 10 would be resolved at the end of the day, and there would
 11 obviously be a lot of cases in which a plaintiff would
 12 allege damages at the outset, and therefore, would have a
 13 cause of action, but if he failed to prove damages in the
 14 - the course of the trial, he wouldn't be entitled to the 15 $1,000, even if he proved that he suffered an adverse
 16 effect from a willful or intentional violation.
 17 QUESTION: But Mr. Stewart, I - I take it that
 18 even - even if there was no indication of actual damage,
 19 the - by - by pleading the violation of the statute, he
 20 would at least have pleaded enough to entitle him to - to
 21 ask for a - to ask for equitable relief.
 22 MR. STEWART: We would say that equitable relief
 23 is not, in this context, is not specifically authorized by
 24 the Privacy Act. But we would say that equitable relief
 25 would be available under the APA, and the allegation would

39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 be that the -
 2 QUESTION: Okay.
 3 MR. STEWART: - agency's action was not in
 4 accordance with law -
 5 QUESTION: I - I see.
 6 MR. STEWART: - because it violated the Privacy
 7 Act.
 8 QUESTION: May -
 9 MR. STEWART: So - so - and indeed, this suit at
 10 the outset included a request for injunctive relief
 11 against further disclosures, and the Government settled
 12 that part of the case with lightning speed. There was -
 13 the - the plaintiff did obtain a judicial order directing
 14 the Government not to continue with its practice. 15 QUESTION: So indeed there's - there - there's
 16 nothing bizarre about letting him get into court just on
 17 the basis of - of an adverse effect, because he can win in
 18 court on the basis of an adverse effect, not by reason of
 19 this act alone, but by reason of the obligations under
 20 this Act plus the APA.
 21 MR. STEWART: That's correct.
 22 QUESTION: Right.
 23 QUESTION: May I - may I go to another issue? I
 24 mean, one of things that's bothering us is several issues
 25 that seem crucial, which we're just having to make

40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 assumptions about here, and depending on the assumptions,
 2 the scope of liability may - may be enormous.
 3 Here's the one that is bothering me. The - the
 4 Government is not contesting here that in fact there -
 5 there was some kind of actual damage, even though it was
 6 not quantified.
 7 MR. STEWART: No, I think we are contesting that.
 8 QUESTION: Well, I - but - but you're not
 9 contesting the fact - let me put it - I - I misspoke -
 10 you're not contesting the fact that if he showed emotional
 11 damage and emotional damage alone, no physical effects,
 12 that that would be enough for recovery if - if a fact-
 13 finder said, well, I think the emotional damage is worth
 14 $250 -
 15 MR. STEWART: No, no. We - we are contesting
 16 that and -
 17 QUESTION: You are contesting that?
 18 MR. STEWART: It hasn't really been -
 19 QUESTION: Are - may - may I ask you just a
 20 further question, then you can tell me which - whatever
 21 you want. Are you contesting as a matter of law the
 22 sufficiency of this plaintiff's testimony to at least get
 23 to the fact-finder on whether there was actual damage? He
 24 testified - I forget his exact words - but he testified,
 25 you know, I was so upset when I heard that they had

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 released my Social Security number, I just didn't know
 2 what to do or what to say, something like that. Are you
 3 contesting the sufficiency of that evidence to put an
 4 issue of actual damage to the fact-finder?
 5 MR. STEWART: Yes, and let me backtrack for a
 6 second to say that the Fourth Circuit decided that Mr. Doe
 7 had not proved actual damages, and the petitioner did not
 8 seek this Court's review of that holding, so -
 9 QUESTION: But they said he didn't prove actual
 10 damages because there was no physical effect.
 11 MR. STEWART: That - that's right. There was -
 12 QUESTION: They didn't say that, as a matter of
 13 law, if you don't have the emotional physical effect rule,
 14 he wouldn't have had enough to - to get to the fact-finder 15 an actual damage.
 16 MR. STEWART: That - that's correct. My - my
 17 only point was, the reason we haven't briefed the question
 18 of whether there were in fact actual damages is that our
 19 understanding is that, because petitioner didn't seek this
 20 Court's review of that aspect of the - the court of
 21 appeals' holding, as the case comes to the Court, we're
 22 assuming that there were no actual damages.
 23 QUESTION: And you didn't - you didn't cross?
 24 MR. STEWART: But - but to answer your - your
 25 question about what the Government's position on the law

42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 is, our - our first argument is that in the context of
 2 this specific statute, the phrase actual damages refers
 3 only to pecuniary harm, and we've cited in a footnote a
 4 conflict among the circuits with respect to that question,
 5 and that - that isn't presented by this case.
 6 QUESTION: Okay.
 7 MR. STEWART: But we would -
 8 QUESTION: Mr. Stewart, may I ask you a question
 9 with respect to that? Suppose this Doe said, I'm very
 10 concerned about the impact of this on my credit rating, so
 11 I'm going to spend $10 to a credit - credit reporting
 12 company to find out whether there's been any theft of my
 13 identity, $10. Would there then be a claim under this
 14 statute for actual damages?
 15 MR. STEWART: I mean, there - there would be a
 16 question of whether that was - whether there was
 17 causation, whether that was a reasonable response to the
 18 threat, but in theory, an expense like that could qualify
 19 as pecuniary harm and, thus, is actual damages.
 20 QUESTION: But it made - it made me think that if
 21 there's ambiguity in this statute, that wouldn't have made
 22 much sense for Congress to write a statute like this
 23 where, to meet the actual damage requirement, all you have
 24 to do is make a $10 expense.
 25 MR. STEWART: I mean, I agree that it's a

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 somewhat anomalous result that the availability of the
 2 thousand can turn on a relatively small pecuniary loss. 
 3 It's - it's somewhat analogous at least to the common law
 4 rule that punitive damages are available only to a
 5 plaintiff who's shown some level of compensatory damages,
 6 and there also a plaintiff might be able to contrive a
 7 small loss that is compensable, and thereby make himself
 8 eligible for punitive damages that far exceed the amount
 9 of -
 10 QUESTION: But it's not just not contrived,
 11 because now it's a formula for - for all the people who
 12 have this kind of complaint, so I think if that's what -
 13 what the line is, then Mr. Doe, is it, all the future Mr.
 14 Does will ask to have their credit checked.
 15 MR. STEWART: I mean, we would still want to - we
 16 would still have to know whether that was in fact a
 17 reasonable response to what the Government had did - done
 18 - and what the - the threat that it posed to the - the
 19 plaintiff. And even if that kind of machination might be
 20 possible in in one category of cases, it would still not
 21 be possible in a lot of other categories of potential - of
 22 Privacy Act violations.
 23 To continue with my answer to Justice Souter's
 24 question, the - the second thing we would say about the
 25 emotional injury is that, even if some emotional harms

44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 were compensable as actual damages under the statute, we
 2 don't think that the particular emotional harm alleged
 3 here would be, because a Social Security number, unlike,
 4 for instance, intimate details about a person's family
 5 life, is not inherently private or secret or confidential. 
 6 It's not the sort of information that would cause a person
 7 to say, I would be horrified to think that somebody else
 8 knew that even if I could be sure that that person wasn't
 9 going to misuse it against me.
 10 The - the reason that people are worried about
 11 release of Social Security numbers is that that release
 12 may lead to some further, more tangible harm, identify
 13 theft or -
 14 QUESTION: So you're saying as a matter of law, 15 this is just what he testified to is simply too de minimis
 16 to be considered evidence -
 17 MR. STEWART: That -
 18 QUESTION: - sufficient evidence.
 19 MR. STEWART: That's correct. And we've cited
 20 the Metro-North case in our brief, and I think that the
 21 harm - the emotional harm that he's alleged is really -
 22 really very similar to the fear of cancer as a result of
 23 asbestos exposure that was held not to be compensable in
 24 the absence of some current physical impairment.
 25 So to - to - follow up on this and make our

45
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 position absolutely clear, we are saying that if the term
 2 adverse effect is given its usual meaning, and every
 3 plaintiff who establishes an adverse effect from a willful
 4 or intentional violation is entitled to $1,000, that the
 5 potential financial consequences would be enormous. Now,
 6 I would say in all candor that if we lose this case, it's
 7 quite possible that the Government would argue in the
 8 lower courts that to protect the public fisc, the - the
 9 phrase adverse effect should be given a narrower
 10 construction under this statute than under the APA. But
 11 our basic point is -
 12 QUESTION: May I ask, with respect to the parade
 13 of horribles that we're confronted with, is I - it's my
 14 understanding that there are several other statutes under 15 entirely different statutes, they have the similar
 16 provision but they're clearly worded in a way that says,
 17 if you get anything, you'll get the minimum, and - but
 18 it's the position that your opponent contends is the
 19 proper reading of that statute. There are several such
 20 statutes, am I -
 21 MR. STEWART: There are a lot of statutes with
 22 wording, for instance, to the effect of a plaintiff who
 23 establishes a violation will receive actual damages or
 24 $1,000, whichever is greater. Most of those don't apply
 25 to suits against the United States -

46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: And - and -
 2 MR. STEWART: - but there are many such laws.
 3 QUESTION: And most of those would not require
 4 proof of actual damages?
 5 MR. STEWART: That's correct. Under the plain
 6 terms of the statute, the plaintiff would get the 1,000 -
 7 QUESTION: Why in your view did Congress come up
 8 with a different formula in this case than it has in that
 9 - in the pattern of statutes that those represent?
 10 MR. STEWART: I'm - part of it may be that most
 11 of those statutes are not dealing with suits against the
 12 United States, and Congress may be more protective of the
 13 public fisc, and part of it is the - the legislative
 14 debates reveal that Congress considered a variety of 15 potential damages provisions, some of which were more
 16 generous than the one that was ultimately enacted, some of
 17 them less generous. For instance, the more generous
 18 provisions -
 19 QUESTION: But this statute is unique, is it not?
 20 MR. STEWART: It's not quite unique. I believe
 21 there are a couple of other provisions that use the
 22 phrase, person entitled to recovery, and that phrase has
 23 not been authoritatively construed by this Court, so those
 24 - interpretation of those statutes would raise the same
 25 question this one does.

47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: But there's a number of them that
 2 start out with actual damages. 
 3 MR. STEWART: And - and sometimes, again, the
 4 words are to the effect of actual damages or $1,000,
 5 whichever is greater. And because the availability of the
 6 $1,000 is not limited to a, quote, person entitled to
 7 recovery, unquote, the plain language of many of those
 8 statutes compels the conclusion that $1,000 will be
 9 awardable regardless of actual damages.
 10 QUESTION: Now, there was an interpretation -
 11 Congress told OMB to do interpretive guides, and it did,
 12 and it - and it gave it the meaning that this plaintiff
 13 gives it. It's - it read the statute - didn't - wasn't
 14 that what OMB said? 
 Wasn't that their contemporaneous 15 MR. STEWART: I mean, I think the more - I think
 16 you're right that the more natural reading - the OMB
 17 guideline didn't address in terms the situation where a
 18 plaintiff shows no actual damages but nevertheless claims
 19 the thousand, but the OMB guideline did say, a person who
 20 suffers an adverse effect from a willful or an intention
 21 violation shall receive a 1,000 - actual damages or
 22 $1,000, whichever is greater.
 23 QUESTION: It said actual damages or 1,000. As I
 24 understood the - that original interpretation, it was the
 25 reading that the plaintiff is putting forward here and

48
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 your response to it in your brief seemed to be that was a
 2 wrong interpretation because it didn't take account of
 3 sovereign immunity or saving the sovereign fisc and an
 4 official at OMB said it was wrong and it's not - no longer
 5 effective.
 6 MR. STEWART: I mean, I think if - if plaintiffs
 7 are using the OMB interpretation to establish the point
 8 that intelligent people can read the statute the way that
 9 they did, I - I think it's validly used for that purpose. 
 10 But the OMB guideline is not entitled to deference, as the
 11 Court held in Adams Fruit, a statutory provision that is
 12 to administered solely by the courts is not one as to
 13 which the Court will defer to administrative
 14 interpretations. The - the OMB -
 15 QUESTION: But didn't - didn't Congress designate
 16 OMB to - to these guides?
 17 MR. STEWART: Congress designated OMB, but it's -
 18 the particular provision that is at - specifically at
 19 issue is reprinted at page 13a to the appendix to the
 20 Government's brief. And it says, the director of the
 21 Office of Management and Budget shall develop and, after
 22 notice and opportunity for public comment, prescribe
 23 guidelines and regulations for the use of agencies in
 24 implementing the provisions of this section.
 25 So the only specific directive that OMB had was

49
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to instruct or direct agencies as to their substantive
 2 obligations under the act. Now, in the course of doing
 3 that, it was entirely appropriate for OMB to go further
 4 and offer its view to the agencies as to what consequences
 5 would follow if they breached their substantive
 6 obligations, but that wasn't a task that was specifically
 7 entrusted to OMB by statute, so I don't think there's any
 8 basis for inferring that Congress -
 9 QUESTION: I see. You're - you're saying that -
 10 that it - it was meant just to tell the agencies what you
 11 have to do to comply with the act.
 12 MR. STEWART: Exactly.
 13 QUESTION: Yeah, that - that's probably the best
 14 reading of it.
 15 MR. STEWART: Exactly.
 16 QUESTION: Yeah.
 17 MR. STEWART: So the - the last - the last point
 18 I wanted to make is, it might be possible, if - if we lost
 19 this case, it might be possible to mitigate the financial
 20 consequences to the Government by giving the term adverse
 21 effect a narrow construction, but our - our view is, if
 22 the consequence of adopting plaintiff's reading of the
 23 phrase person entitled to recovery is that an established
 24 term of art like adverse effect has to be construed in
 25 other than its normal manner in order to make the statute

50
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 make sense, there's something wrong with plaintiff's
 2 reading.
 3 QUESTION: But why - why do you say that? 
 4 Because, see, the adverse effect part governs people who
 5 don't even want damages. I mean, it - it's to get into
 6 court, it's just to get into court, bring the suit, isn't
 7 it?
 8 MR. STEWART: Right.
 9 QUESTION: So - so I would have thought that your
 10 - your reaction - I just want you to clarify this - would
 11 be, if they win this case, then the reaction would be to
 12 go back and say, all right, if we're going to give $1,000
 13 to people who really are just feeling bad about what
 14 happened, we've got to give them all $1,000, well, it's 15 only in circumstances where the agency really did
 16 something quite wrong. And so you'll read that
 17 intentional or willful requirement toughly, not - not the
 18 adverse effect part tough. I mean, why - why wouldn't
 19 that be the reaction?
 20 MR. STEWART: I mean, I guess if - if this - if
 21 this Court held that the phrase intentional or willful was
 22 limited to situations -
 23 QUESTION: I don't see - yeah?
 24 MR. STEWART: If it - if it was limited to
 25 situations in which the Government set out to violate an

51
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 individual's rights under the Privacy Act, that - that
 2 would be another way at least of -
 3 QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, and then you'd say, well,
 4 we should assume that's what happened here, though. It
 5 certainly didn't -
 6 MR. STEWART: I - I mean -
 7 QUESTION: - but we should assume that. Now,
 8 suppose I assume that, and then I decide that they're
 9 right on the basis of that assumption, and then in the
 10 next case it turns out my assumption happened to be quite
 11 wrong because Congress had a broad intent there. Now what
 12 happens?
 13 MR. STEWART: I mean, even under the narrowest
 14 possible interpretation of what intentional or willful 15 means, you could have hypotheticals like the one with the
 16 form that left off the U.S.C. cite, and again, we - we
 17 hope those things would happen very rarely, but it seems
 18 highly unlikely that Congress would have wanted each of
 19 the hundred thousand people who put on - information on
 20 the form to get $1,000. Thank you.
 21 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Stewart. 
 22 Mr. Campbell, you have five minutes remaining.
 23 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. JACK W. CAMPBELL, IV
 24 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 25 MR. CAMPBELL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

52
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Justice Kennedy, I'd like to address my first
 2 point to you, because I - I think you put your finger on
 3 one of the number of - of absurd results, or difficult-
 4 to-swallow results that flow from accepting the
 5 Government's interpretation. The Government's essential
 6 contention here is that quantification of actual damages
 7 is an essential element of a Privacy Act claim, but boy,
 8 what a strange way to write the statute if that's what
 9 Congress intended.
 10 The - the relative language is reproduced at
 11 pages 3 and 4 of petitioner's brief, and it says that
 12 whenever an agency fails to comply with any other
 13 provision of this section, and I'm going to ellipsis, in
 14 such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual, 15 the individual may bring a civil action against the
 16 agency, and I'm putting another ellipsis there. You then
 17 go to subsection (g)(4), which states that if that adverse
 18 effect was the result of an intentional or willful
 19 violation, then the Government, the United States shall be
 20 liable, in the sum - in an amount equal to the sum of. 
 21 Liability is established once those three
 22 prerequisites are met. All that is left at that point is
 23 an exercise of arithmetic. It would be a very strange
 24 statute that says the United States shall be liable in the
 25 sum of the following amounts you are to add up, and that

53
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 amount would be zero. And, in fact, that would never be
 2 the case. Costs are always available to a Privacy Act
 3 plaintiff who establishes an adverse effect caused by an
 4 intentional or willful violation of the act.
 5 So there are certainly going to be at least some
 6 recovery. There's no qualification of the costs award
 7 with reasonableness of precondition of actual damages. So
 8 some - there is going to be a recovery in those cases. 
 9 Now, if that's the only recovery that's available, it's a
 10 very - it's, one, a very strange statute, and number two,
 11 a statute that arguably is unconstitutional. But you
 12 don't need to read it that way, because the natural
 13 reading is, as was pointed out in the argument, that, yes,
 14 Congress did anticipate precisely this issue, that privacy 15 invasions very typically result in emotional harms that
 16 inherently are not quantifiable, and Congress didn't
 17 intend, I can't imagine, to - to make the line of recovery
 18 turn on whether you can prove that you put 37 - a 37-cent
 19 stamp on an - on an envelope to get your credit report or
 20 pay the $10 fee. That's a very arbitrary line. Why would
 21 Congress be solicitous of people who suffer the same harm
 22 - be solicitous of the one who put a stamp on an envelope? 
 23 That's a nonsensical.
 24 Moreover, it reduces any efficiency savings that
 25 are realized under the act as Congress intended by saying,

54
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 look, we're not going to get into those sorts of proof
 2 issues. If you have an emotional distress and it's
 3 typical, it's caused by the intentional violation, we
 4 don't go through that. You get your damages of $1,000 and
 5 let's not go through the proof. That's a very natural
 6 reading of the act. 
 7 But the Government - the Government is asking
 8 you to adopt a - an interpretation that has a number of
 9 additional problems. It renders the adverse effect
 10 requirement superfluous. Proof of actual damages will
 11 necessarily in every case require proof of an actual harm
 12 and causation. So even the attempt by the Government to
 13 place a - a meaning on the adverse effect requirement must
 14 fail. 
 Again, it turns the shall language into may, or at 15 best, renders shall illusory, because the sum would be
 16 zero in much cases.
 17 QUESTION: As to your point about the - the
 18 costs. You don't get costs unless, it says the court may
 19 assess reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation
 20 costs reasonably incurred in any case in which the
 21 complainant has substantially prevailed. And I assume
 22 that when later on they - they say the costs of the action
 23 together with reasonable attorneys' fees as determined by
 24 the court, they're referring back to the court has allowed
 25 those - those costs and fees, because he has substantially

55
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 prevailed?
 2 MR. STEWART: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia. I - are
 3 you referring to the language that's in (g)(2) and (g)(3)
 4 of the statute?
 5 QUESTION: Yes, I am.
 6 MR. STEWART: (g)(2) and (g)(3) are entirely
 7 different causes of actions. Those deal with requests for
 8 injunctive relief, and this is the only type of injunctive
 9 relief under the Privacy Act, injunctive relief for access
 10 to files or correction of files. Those are separate
 11 causes of action. In fact, I submit, Justice Scalia -
 12 QUESTION: I see. I see what you're saying.
 13 MR. STEWART: - that the contrast in the language
 14 between (g)(2) and (g)(3) -
 15 QUESTION: I see what you're saying.
 16 MR. STEWART: - and (g)(4) proves my point. 
 17 Here, Congress anticipated that there is a substantial -
 18 substantially prevailing party. That party -
 19 QUESTION: Well, what assumption would you like
 20 us to make -
 21 QUESTION: Right, right.
 22 QUESTION: - in respect to the meaning of
 23 intentional or willful?
 24 MR. STEWART: I - I submit that a perfectly
 25 proper interpretation of intentional or willful can

56
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 include conscious disregard of - of the - of the legal
 2 obligations. That's a well-established standard.
 3 Thank you.
