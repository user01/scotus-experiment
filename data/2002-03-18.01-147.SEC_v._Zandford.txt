 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 now on No. 01-147, Securities and Exchange Commission 
 5 versus Charles Zandford. Mr. Roberts. 
 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS
 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 8 MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 9 please the Court. Stockbrokers like the respondent are
 10 the critical link between the National Securities Markets
 11 and individual investors who trust brokers to buy and sell
 12 securities for their benefit. 
 13 Respondent betrayed that trust by selling his
 14 customers' securities not for their benefit, but for a
 15 secret purpose of misappropriating the proceeds and by
 16 embezzling the proceeds as he had planned. 
 17 In so doing, Respondent violated Section 10(b)
 18 of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. Those
 19 provisions prohibit the use of fraud in connection with
 20 the purchase or sale of any security. Respondent --
 21 QUESTION: Mr. Roberts, could you clarify for me
 22 what the government's position is in this case? 
 23 Suppose -- suppose that the broker had not, when
 24 he sold the stock, intended to embezzle but then he made
 25 the sale and the sale enabled his embezzling. After

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 selling it, he conceived the scheme to embezzle. 
 2 Is it the government's position that in that
 3 situation a 10(b) would still cover it? 
 4 MR. ROBERTS: That embezzlement would not be in
 5 connection with the prior sale under the theory that we
 6 are asking the Court to adopt here. But the SEC believes
 7 that it would be a violation of 10(b) under a different
 8 theory which isn't a necessary consequence of the one --
 9 QUESTION: We don't have to agree with that to
 10 rule for you --
 11 MR. ROBERTS: You don't have to agree with that
 12 to find a violation here. 
 13 QUESTION: Now, the SEC adjudications that you
 14 rely upon, what kind of a situation do they involve? Do
 15 they all involve --
 16 MR. ROBERTS: They involve both situations, Your
 17 Honor. 
 18 QUESTION: Both situations. 
 19 MR. ROBERTS: Both situations. 
 20 QUESTION: Does the SEC routinely audit brokers'
 21 accounts or do spot audits to ensure compliance with the
 22 theory you are suggesting here or are they just reactive
 23 when they find out about a firm? 
 24 MR. ROBERTS: I am not aware that they routinely
 25 audit the brokers. The NASD does do that and then refers

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 matters to the SEC and consults with the SEC. The SEC
 2 also would respond to complaints that they got or take
 3 investigations if they had reason to believe it was called
 4 to their attention. 
 5 QUESTION: And I take it that if the NASD tells
 6 the SEC of the existence of a fraud, the SEC can then
 7 request the United States Government to prosecute if there
 8 is a wire fraud or --
 9 MR. ROBERTS: They could request a prosecution,
 10 Your Honor, but it's important that the SEC is the federal
 11 agency that's charged with maintaining the integrity of
 12 the markets and investor confidence in the markets, have
 13 direct authority to prevent and to pursue the kind of
 14 fraud that's involved here which is very -- potentially
 15 very unsettling to the markets. 
 16 Because since most transactions are made through
 17 brokers, if customers and investors can't trust their
 18 brokers to be executing their transactions for the
 19 customer's benefit rather than for the broker's benefits,
 20 the markets can't function effectively. 
 21 QUESTION: Well, do you say then that any fraud
 22 by a broker in connection with a customer is actionable by
 23 the SEC. 
 24 MR. ROBERTS: That goes back to the question
 25 that Justice Scalia asked me, Your Honor. And under the

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 theory that we are advocating here, and for the Court to
 2 rule for us here, you don't need to conclude that. The
 3 SEC does take that position. 
 4 QUESTION: Does take what position? 
 5 MR. ROBERTS: That any fraudulent conversion by
 6 a broker from a brokerage account is a violation of 10(b)
 7 because it's fraud and it's in connection with the
 8 purchase or sale of securities; because the very purpose
 9 of the brokerage account is to buy and sell securities. 
 10 And the broker has access to the customer's assets --
 11 QUESTION: That's quite a leap --
 12 MR. ROBERTS: -- for the purpose of --
 13 QUESTION: That's a leap from any case we've
 14 ever decided. 
 15 MR. ROBERTS: That is beyond any case that I'm
 16 aware that you have decided. But here the broker actually
 17 converted the securities by means of fraudulent sales. 
 18 And his deception not only caused the sales, it was
 19 material to the sales. And the sales themselves, because
 20 they were fraudulent, coincided with and completed the
 21 fraud. 
 22 And that's very much in tune -- that's really
 23 controlled by past cases of the Court. For instance in
 24 the Bankers Life case, the Court held that corporate
 25 fiduciaries violated Section 10(b) when they deceived the

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 corporation into believing that it would receive the
 2 proceeds of the securities that the corporation sold. 
 3 QUESTION: But there were misrepresentations
 4 about a particular security. That didn't happen here. 
 5 MR. ROBERTS: There wasn't a misrepresentation
 6 in Bankers Life about a particular security, there was a
 7 misrepresentation that the corporation would receive the
 8 proceeds. And there was that same misrepresentation here,
 9 Your Honor, only it was by way of an omission or a course
 10 of conduct rather than an affirmative statement. 
 11 Because the customers had entrusted Respondent
 12 with the authority to trade on their behalf, with the
 13 understanding and the implicit representation that he
 14 would trade on their behalf and that they would receive
 15 the proceeds of the sales, that they would be used for
 16 their benefit in other trades when --
 17 QUESTION: So in this case the fraud could have
 18 been avoided under your theory if the broker had gotten in
 19 touch with the clients and said I'm going to sell this but
 20 I'm going to use the money for myself. That would have
 21 turned it from fraud under 10(b) into theft. 
 22 MR. ROBERTS: That would have turned it from
 23 fraud into theft. It would have also been a breach of his
 24 fiduciary duty if he went ahead and they didn't authorize
 25 him. But just like in O'Hagan --

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: But it wouldn't have been fraud. 
 2 MR. ROBERTS: It wouldn't have been fraud if
 3 there was no deception. It's critical to a 10(b)e
 4 violation that there be deception of some kind. 
 5 QUESTION: Mr. Roberts, there's one point in
 6 your reply brief that I didn't quite grasp. This action
 7 is brought by the SEC. 
 8 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. 
 9 QUESTION: And it hinges on the wrong that was
 10 done to the customer. Could the customer bring this very
 11 lawsuit, could the customer have sued the broker for a
 12 10(b) violation? 
 13 MR. ROBERTS: In this circumstance, yes, the
 14 customer could have brought a private action against the
 15 broker, Your Honor. That wouldn't be true in every
 16 circumstance because the customer, a private plaintiff
 17 seeking damages has to prove elements of a violation in
 18 addition to what the SEC must prove. 
 19 A customer has to show causation of the
 20 transaction and loss or damages to the customer. The
 21 customer also has to be an actual purchaser seller. In
 22 the situation where there's a sale by the broker of the
 23 customer's securities, the purchaser-seller requirement
 24 will be met. 
 25 But there might not be the damages that are

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 necessary unless the broker follows through with his
 2 scheme to misappropriate the proceeds of the sale. 
 3 QUESTION: But this time he did. 
 4 MR. ROBERTS: But he did. 
 5 QUESTION: There's another curiosity in this
 6 case. There was a prosecution for wire fraud, the
 7 restitution sought was $10,800. And now the SEC is going
 8 after the broker for a much larger sum. Why wasn't a
 9 greater sum asked in the wire fraud case? 
 10 MR. ROBERTS: I don't know, Your Honor, why the
 11 restitution award in the criminal action was limited to
 12 $10,000. But it's clear that Respondent, it's clear from
 13 the allegations in the complaint and also from the
 14 criminal trial that Respondent did embezzle far more than
 15 that amount of the Woods' assets. 
 16 And that's one of the reasons that it's
 17 important for the SEC to be able to pursue this action. 
 18 Because if it had to rely on the criminal action, then
 19 there wouldn't be a full disgorgement of the improper
 20 gains by the broker. And there would be far less
 21 deterrent to this kind of activity. Of course a criminal
 22 prosecution is significant deterrent, but --
 23 QUESTION: Mr. Roberts, did the allegations of
 24 your complaint in this case accord with the narrower
 25 theory that you now say is enough to decide this case? 

9

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 That is to say, as I read your description of the
 2 complaint, it did not say that the sales of the security
 3 were made with the intention at the time the sales were
 4 made of absconding with the proceeds. All it said is that
 5 he sold the securities and stole the funds. 
 6 MR. ROBERTS: It does -- it does comport with
 7 our theory, Your Honor. It doesn't in so many words
 8 allege the intent at the time. But the factual
 9 allegations in the complaint necessarily give rise to that
 10 inference. Because, first, one of the allegations is that
 11 Respondent issued checks to himself on the mutual fund
 12 account and that the cashing of those checks caused the
 13 sales. 
 14 And so when he took the money, he necessarily by
 15 writing the checks to himself, he necessarily had the
 16 intent at the time. And then there are additional
 17 allegations --
 18 QUESTION: Wait. Excuse me. He wrote the
 19 checks before the sales were made? 
 20 MR. ROBERTS: In the -- in the mutual fund
 21 checks, if you look at Page 28A, of the petition, in
 22 paragraph 16 of the complaint, it describes the beginning
 23 of the fraudulent scheme in May of 1988, shortly after Mr.
 24 Wood was hospitalized as a result of his stroke, and notes
 25 that between May and June 1988, Zandford, without the

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 prior knowledge or consent of Wood and Okstulski, issued
 2 three checks to himself totaling $41,000. 
 3 The checks were drawn on a joint mutual fund
 4 account held by Wood and Okstulski outside of their
 5 Dominick account, and the funds represented therein were
 6 obtained through the sale of mutual fund shares --
 7 QUESTION: It doesn't say they were later
 8 obtained. It just says they were obtained. I don't see
 9 that that says that the funds weren't there until the --
 10 until the checks were written. 
 11 MR. ROBERTS: I think the way that that kind of
 12 account works is that it's like a checking account with
 13 your mutual funds. You write the check, you write the
 14 checks on the account and the redeeming of the check
 15 causes the sales of the mutual funds. But regardless of
 16 whether it precisely states that, that's certainly a
 17 reasonable inference or facts that can be proved based on
 18 these allegations which is all that's necessary to get
 19 past the dismissal of the complaint, Your Honor. 
 20 And in addition on the other allegations on the
 21 next page and the paragraphs on the next page, there are
 22 description of repeated sales and repeated conversions
 23 over a long period of time. And, you know, one time maybe
 24 he formed the intent after the sales, although that's
 25 unlikely given that this happened after the allegations in

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the previous paragraph. But 13 more times, Your Honor, I
 2 think that it's hard to believe. 
 3 QUESTION: Who gets the recovery, Mr. Roberts? 
 4 MR. ROBERTS: The recovery goes to the -- to the
 5 government, but the SEC has a policy of if there are
 6 identifiable victims to endeavor to give the victims those
 7 -- those funds and to make them whole if they are
 8 available. So here where there are identifiable victims,
 9 they would do that. 
 10 QUESTION: Well, isn't it a little odd, you have
 11 two different branches of the government, perhaps not
 12 branches, but two different proceedings, one a criminal
 13 proceeding which authorizes restitution. And in that
 14 proceeding the decision was made that $10,000 would be
 15 allowed, awarded in restitution. 
 16 Then the SEC comes along and says, no, that
 17 wasn't enough. We want to get, you know, several hundred
 18 thousand more. 
 19 MR. ROBERTS: Well, the restitution, first of
 20 all, the purposes of restitution and disgorgement are
 21 different in that one is aimed on the -- is focused on the
 22 making whole the loss to the -- to the people that are
 23 injured, whereas the other is aimed at requiring the
 24 wrongdoer to disgorge any benefit that he got from the
 25 scheme. 

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 But in addition, Your Honor, the statute
 2 provides for a civil action and gives the SEC the power to
 3 do that in order to further its role in ensuring the
 4 integrity of the markets and ensuring investor confidence
 5 in the markets. And it empowers the SEC rather than the
 6 individual U.S. attorneys to determine when it's necessary
 7 to ask for that kind of a remedy in order to further those
 8 purposes. And the SEC properly made that determination,
 9 made that determination here. 
 10 QUESTION: Well, just to explore the point, is
 11 there anything in the record to show that these victims
 12 lost only $10,000 and that the broker just made all the
 13 rest by churning --
 14 MR. ROBERTS: No. Their record I think
 15 establishes that they lost everything that they had
 16 entrusted to him which was 420 roughly, thousands of
 17 dollars' worth. 
 18 QUESTION: Mr. Roberts, isn't it the case
 19 sometimes in criminal proceedings where restitution is
 20 ordered that full restitution is not ordered for a variety
 21 of reasons, the victim's family -- the defendant's family
 22 may have certain needs and the Court may decide, well, I'm
 23 just going to order a limited amount of restitution. Does
 24 that happen sometimes? 
 25 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, that certainly happens, Your

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Honor. Thank you. 
 2 QUESTION: And if the family has needs, the SEC
 3 doesn't have to worry about it, I take it? 
 4 MR. ROBERTS: Well, the SEC does its own
 5 balancing of what's appropriate to further the interests
 6 and it asks for a disgorgement which is an equitable
 7 remedy. And the Court takes into account those concerns
 8 in deciding whether to award it. And here the District
 9 Court did determine that it was appropriate to award
 10 disgorgement in the amount of $343,000. 
 11 QUESTION: It is odd that there was no kind of,
 12 apparently no cooperation here, that the criminal case
 13 goes on for that limited amount and then the SEC comes in
 14 after. Don't the relevant prosecutors talk to each other
 15 in advance about a case like this? 
 16 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, they do talk to each other. 
 17 But the decision, Your Honor, whether to bring the
 18 prosecution and what to charge and what to ask for is the
 19 decision of the prosecutors, whereas the decision of what
 20 is appropriate to pursue as a civil action in order to
 21 further the purposes of the securities laws is the
 22 responsibility of the SEC. 
 23 And if the two arms don't necessarily agree that
 24 that can all be done in a criminal proceeding, then
 25 sometimes a civil proceeding is necessary to accomplish

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the goals and --
 2 QUESTION: The SEC is an independent regulatory
 3 agency, isn't it? 
 4 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, it is. 
 5 QUESTION: So it's not within the control of the
 6 President? 
 7 MR. ROBERTS: Um --
 8 QUESTION: So if the Justice Department
 9 disagrees with the SEC, the SEC can still go off on its
 10 own. Is that the way the scheme works in theory? 
 11 MR. ROBERTS: Well, in theory, Your Honor, yes. 
 12 Although here in the Supreme Court the Solicitor General
 13 represents the SEC. And in order for the SEC to come
 14 here, the Solicitor General has to authorize the action. 
 15 QUESTION: Is there any limit, if we have a
 16 broker, a licensed broker, is there any limit at all or
 17 just any fraud by a licensed broker falls within 10(b)? 
 18 MR. ROBERTS: Well, again, I'd like to reiterate
 19 that to decide this case and under the theory that we are
 20 advancing here, you don't need to reach that. But even
 21 under the other theory that I alluded to, there are limits
 22 to what would be covered. 
 23 For instance a broker could defraud customers by
 24 convincing them to pursue an investment advisory
 25 relationship. And that would not be -- that would not

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 necessarily be covered. 
 2 In addition, the broker might defraud the
 3 customers of assets that are outside of the brokerage
 4 account and that aren't securities because the broker has
 5 developed a relationship of trust with the customer. That
 6 wouldn't be covered under the other theory. 
 7 In addition, the broker, I guess it's a similar
 8 thing, the broker could defraud the customer into making
 9 some other kind of investments, real estate investments,
 10 because of the relationship of trust that had developed. 
 11 But the SEC has consistently taken the position
 12 that with regard to brokerage accounts and the brokerage
 13 relationship that involves the purchase or sale of
 14 securities and that exists for the purpose of the purchase
 15 or sale of securities, that it is a violation when the
 16 broker defrauds its customer. 
 17 QUESTION: Suppose the -- suppose Zandford were
 18 not a licensed broker, he just was pretending to be a
 19 broker but he wasn't at all. He went to these people and
 20 said, I'm a broker, give me your money; and the same thing
 21 happened? 
 22 MR. ROBERTS: That would still be -- and then he
 23 -- they gave him the money and he purchased securities and
 24 then sold the securities? 
 25 QUESTION: Yes, but he's not licensed to sell

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 any. 
 2 MR. ROBERTS: That would still be a violation,
 3 Your Honor, because he would have the same fiduciary
 4 relationship with them by virtue of them making him their
 5 agent for securities transactions and entrusting their
 6 assets to him to engage in securities transactions. And
 7 when he sold for the secret purpose of misappropriating
 8 the proceeds rather than for their benefit, and he did not
 9 disclose that he was doing that, he would be deceiving
 10 them in connection with the sale of securities, just as
 11 Mr. Zandford did here. And that would be a violation
 12 under these circumstances. 
 13 If there are no further questions, I would like
 14 to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal. 
 15 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Roberts. Mr.
 16 Goldblatt, we'll hear from you. 
 17 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN H. GOLDBLATT 
 18 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 19 MR. GOLDBLATT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 20 please the Court: 
 21 We do not dispute, I don't think it can be
 22 disputed, that this conduct obviously is covered by any
 23 number of laws, civil, criminal, state, federal, the rules
 24 of this self-regulatory organization, and the Court below
 25 recognized that as well. But it treated the question of

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 whether or not Mr. Zandford was also liable under Section
 2 10(b) as a different question requiring a specific proof. 
 3 And it is that proof that the Court found wanting. 
 4 In that regard, I think it's also important that
 5 one of the pivotal factors in our theory of the case was
 6 that this was a discretionary account. And the SEC was
 7 relying on the bare facts alleged in the wire fraud
 8 indictment to prove its case. And under those
 9 circumstances, there was no investment decision being made
 10 by the victims in this case. 
 11 And we argued to the Court below and we submit
 12 to this Court that that's a pivotal distinction in 10(b)
 13 context. Because 10(b) deals with investment decisions. 
 14 And if no one is being defrauded in the decision they are
 15 making as to the purchase or sale, all that leaves the SEC
 16 with in this case is the conversion of the proceeds. 
 17 QUESTION: Well, the District Court granted
 18 summary judgment in favor of the SEC as I understand it. 
 19 MR. GOLDBLATT: That's correct. 
 20 QUESTION: And the Court of Appeals reversed and
 21 in effect granted summary judgment for Mr. Zandford. 
 22 MR. GOLDBLATT: That's also correct. 
 23 QUESTION: So you have to take the allegations
 24 in the complaint as true at that point I think, don't you?
 25 MR. GOLDBLATT: Mr. Chief Justice, we don't

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 think so, because those allegations were not being
 2 considered by the Court of Appeals. I think the SEC at
 3 various points has indicated in its pleadings that the
 4 facts alleged in the indictment were the same as the
 5 complaint, and that may have caused part of the problem. 
 6 But the only facts alluded to by the Court of Appeals as
 7 you indicated is in effect granting summary judgment to
 8 the non-moving party. 
 9 In that regard, there's no reference at all in
 10 the opinion of the Court of Appeals referring to any of
 11 the facts in the complaint. They refer to the indictment.
 12 QUESTION: Well, should there have been some
 13 reference to the facts in the complaints since they were
 14 about to render summary judgment against the SEC? 
 15 MR. GOLDBLATT: That may well be the case. The
 16 problem we have with that is the question of issue
 17 preservation. When the SEC petitioned for rehearing,
 18 ordinarily -- in the ordinary case, if you reverse an
 19 order granting summary judgment, you obviously don't grant
 20 summary judgment to the non-moving party; you remand for
 21 further proceedings. 
 22 But when the SEC moved for rehearing and
 23 rehearing en banc, it did not raise the issue with the
 24 Court as to why it had remanded with instructions to
 25 dismiss. So on this record you really don't know what the

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 reasoning of the Court of Appeals was. 
 2 QUESTION: But wouldn't they have to, Mr.
 3 Goldblatt? This -- a complaint to be thrown out when
 4 there's been nothing beyond the complaint doesn't --
 5 mustn't you listen to the facts as pled in the complaint?
 6 MR. GOLDBLATT: Justice Ginsburg, my point is,
 7 is that the question that I think that is presented in
 8 this case is whether the SEC by its own actions limited
 9 itself to the facts asserted for purposes of summary
 10 judgment which were the facts in the indictment. 
 11 Now, if the Court of Appeals is operating under
 12 the assumption that that was their case, it could, if that
 13 was their case and it was clear that was what it had to
 14 consider, if it concluded those facts were insufficient as
 15 a matter of law, that would be the only rationale in light
 16 of its opinion which only considered the facts in the
 17 indictment. 
 18 QUESTION: But the government's petition here
 19 sets forth some facts. The stockbroker sells his
 20 customers for his own benefit. And so it -- and in your
 21 brief in opposition you didn't challenge that question,
 22 did you? 
 23 MR. GOLDBLATT: Yes, I did. 
 24 QUESTION: You did? What did you say? 
 25 MR. GOLDBLATT: I challenged the -- in our brief

20

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 in opposition, we challenged any consideration of any
 2 facts beyond the indictment, that any issue with regard to
 3 facts in the complaint were not before the Court of
 4 Appeals and were not relied on by the SEC. 
 5 QUESTION: But that just seems weird in a way. 
 6 I mean, this is a civil action. And to insist that it be
 7 tried on the facts and an indictment in the criminal case
 8 as opposed to as alleged in a complaint in this very case
 9 seems odd. 
 10 MR. GOLDBLATT: I absolutely agree. But the
 11 question is not so much whether that was of the making of
 12 the Court of Appeals or whether that was of the making of
 13 the SEC. And I think it was the Court's understanding
 14 that that was the SEC's position, that they were narrowing
 15 themselves to the indictment, and that's what the Court
 16 considered. 
 17 But regardless, even with the facts, I mean, if
 18 I'm wrong on that, regardless of the facts even with the
 19 facts that the SEC relies on from the complaint, you
 20 essentially have the same problem. 
 21 And again, it's not a question of whether this
 22 conduct is covered. It's covered under the broker rules. 
 23 But for purposes of 10(b) as the SEC now concedes, this
 24 would also affect private actions. 
 25 And in that regard, these facts simply do not

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 meet the paradigm for a 10(b) violation which is either
 2 that somebody is duped into buying or selling a security,
 3 a particular security, because that's the paradigm for the
 4 statute, or in limited circumstances such as a case like
 5 O'Hagan, where it affects market integrity, the Court has
 6 also found liability. But that's in a situation --
 7 QUESTION: Suppose that the customer comes to
 8 the broker and says, here's 100 shares of the ABC Company,
 9 sell these shares for me and put the money in your broker
 10 account. And the broker, before he sells, has the intent
 11 to take the money for the broker's own account. Is there
 12 a fraud under your theory? 
 13 MR. GOLDBLATT: Under that theory, I would
 14 submit there is a fraud. That is unauthorized to take the
 15 money in that situation and he's duped into turning over
 16 the securities to the broker, and there is an investment
 17 decision being made. But you have a particular --
 18 QUESTION: No. No. He's made the investment
 19 decision in my hypothetical. He said, I don't want your
 20 advice about selling. You sell these things. I'm
 21 directing you to do that. 
 22 MR. GOLDBLATT: In that circumstance, if he then
 23 sells the security and places it in the account, then he
 24 has completed the instructions. But if he sells the
 25 security and converts it to his own use, then I believe

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 you don't have in that situation, in other words, if those
 2 are the instructions from the client to the broker -- I
 3 correct myself. That would not be a 10(b)e violation. 
 4 It will be a violation of the broker rules. It
 5 will be a conversion. It will be a criminal act. But
 6 there will be no fraud. He will have carried out the
 7 instructions to sell the stock. There's no inducement
 8 there to sell --
 9 QUESTION: Well, only in really a Pickwickian
 10 sense of the term. He carried out the instructions to
 11 sell the stock but he keeps the money. Nobody would
 12 construe the instructions that way. 
 13 MR. GOLDBLATT: Understood. But nor were -- the
 14 instructions were to sell the stock. He is not being
 15 duped into selling the stock. That is exactly what he
 16 wanted done. What he's being duped into is the proceeds
 17 are being converted. But the difference with Bankers Life
 18 is that the 10(b) violator in that case actually goes to
 19 the person and says we should sell this, with the intent
 20 of diverting the proceeds. 
 21 That person is duped into believing by the actor
 22 that they are making the sale with the understanding that
 23 they will get the proceeds. Again it -- for purposes 
 24 of --
 25 QUESTION: How does that differ from here? I

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 thought here that what our facts that we are assuming are
 2 that the stockbroker says to the client, I have control of
 3 your account and I'll sell for your benefit. That's the
 4 implicit instruction. 
 5 The client says sell for my benefit. And here
 6 the stockbroker sells for his own benefit. What's the
 7 difference between that case which is this one, and the
 8 one Justice Kennedy is submitting? 
 9 MR. GOLDBLATT: I think the difference is for
 10 purposes of the 10(b) paradigm it requires that the sale
 11 be induced by the broker for fraudulent reasons. If all
 12 he's doing is converting the proceeds --
 13 QUESTION: But here we also have, as they have
 14 emphasized about 50 times, not simply stealing. What we
 15 have is a sale of stock where the stockbroker has the
 16 intent when he sells the stock to keep the money, contrary
 17 to what the implicit assumption is about what the client
 18 wants. 
 19 Now, that seems to be a little extra thing here
 20 so we don't have to reach all these broad issues. Now,
 21 what do we -- that's what I find indistinguishable. 
 22 MR. GOLDBLATT: Justice Breyer, here is the
 23 distinction that I would draw. In the Bankers Life
 24 situation where you have the sale induced, the 10(b)
 25 violation is complete when the sale is made. 

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 In the situation you describe, until and unless
 2 the broker, having followed the instructions and sold the
 3 stock, until and unless he actually converts the proceeds
 4 to his own use, you don't have a 10(b) violation.
 5 QUESTION: Why don't you? I mean, if we could
 6 ever prove it? Suppose in fact the broker, because we had
 7 a mind-reading machine, sold the stock in order to convert
 8 the proceeds, puts the money in the account and then dies. 
 9 I mean, you know, it's a little weird, but nonetheless if
 10 we could ever prove such a thing, why wouldn't that be a
 11 violation of 10b-5? 
 12 MR. GOLDBLATT: Because until and unless he
 13 actually converts the proceeds, he hasn't violated 10(b). 
 14 He has not done anything against his client's
 15 instructions. 
 16 QUESTION: He hasn't? He has converted -- he
 17 has sold the shares, contrary to the instruction, sell
 18 them for my benefit, for his own benefit. 
 19 MR. GOLDBLATT: My point is that until he
 20 actually converts, while that money is still in the
 21 account, while the stock has been sold consistent with the
 22 directions, until and unless he actually converts the
 23 proceeds to his own use, he has not violated 10(b). 
 24 QUESTION: But what about, never mind the taking
 25 of the proceeds. Suppose you have a broker who for some

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 reason because he has an interest in a company or
 2 something else sells stock in a customer's account where
 3 it didn't really make sense to sell it. 
 4 The only benefit from selling it is a benefit
 5 for the broker himself. His brother-in-law is with a
 6 company that would profit from this sale of the stock. 
 7 Would that be covered by 10(b)? 
 8 MR. GOLDBLATT: I think that would be covered by
 9 10(b). 
 10 QUESTION: Well, why isn't that the same
 11 situation here? Because this sale was not a sale -- never
 12 mind the later theft -- the sale was not a sale for the
 13 benefit of the customer which is what he's promised to do.
 14 He's promised, I'll manage these stocks for your
 15 benefit. And here he sells them when the customer's
 16 interest did not call for a sale. The only reason the
 17 sale happened is that the broker had his own interest in
 18 mind. 
 19 MR. GOLDBLATT: Justice Scalia, the reason why
 20 that doesn't work here is because as the Court of Appeals
 21 found, there's no evidence in this record to establish
 22 that the sales themselves were inconsistent with the
 23 client's interests. Regardless of what Zandford may have
 24 been thinking, the evidence simply showed that they were
 25 sold. He has discretionary power to do it --

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Well, does it have to be
 2 inconsistent? Do you have to prove that they were
 3 inconsistent with the interest or is it enough to prove
 4 that the broker did not act in the customer's interest? 
 5 Isn't that enough for the breach of the fiduciary duty? 
 6 Even if it turns out that, what do you know, it was a good
 7 idea to sell, the market crashes, nonetheless he was
 8 guilty of a fiduciary breach if he didn't sell it because
 9 he thought it would help the customer but he thought it
 10 would help him. Wouldn't that be a breach right then and
 11 there? 
 12 MR. GOLDBLATT: It might be a breach of
 13 fiduciary duty in the trust sense. It does not affect the
 14 sale unless you can establish that the sale is
 15 unauthorized, it is inconsistent with the client's
 16 interest. 
 17 QUESTION: It is unauthorized. I didn't
 18 authorize him to sell stock for his benefit. The whole
 19 idea was he was supposed to sell it for mine. 
 20 MR. GOLDBLATT: But the sale itself was
 21 authorized. The only point I'm bringing out is in a
 22 situation like Bankers Life where the broker induces the
 23 sale with fraudulent intent, you have a complete violation
 24 when the stock is sold. It makes no difference after that
 25 whether the broker is successful or unsuccessful in

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 diverting the proceeds. You have established a fraudulent
 2 sale in which an investor's decision has been induced by
 3 fraudulent intent. 
 4 In the situation where the sale is authorized,
 5 either because the client calls the broker and says I want
 6 you to sell XYZ Corporation today, and the broker does
 7 that --
 8 QUESTION: That one I agree with. 
 9 MR. GOLDBLATT: In that situation, regardless of
 10 what the broker is thinking, he may be thinking I'm going
 11 to take the money and run. 
 12 QUESTION: But that isn't what happened here. 
 13 The customer didn't call up and say sell. 
 14 MR. GOLDBLATT: No, but --
 15 QUESTION: The broker has authority to sell but
 16 he has authority to sell in the interest of the client. 
 17 And no interest of the client called for the sale of these
 18 securities. The only thing that called for the sale of
 19 the securities was without selling them, I can't get the
 20 money to steal. 
 21 MR. GOLDBLATT: Justice Scalia, in that regard
 22 we point to two decisions from the 7th Circuit in O'Brien
 23 and Congregation that deal with discretionary accounts. 
 24 And when a client turns money over to an investment
 25 counselor or broker and says, you make the decisions, I'm

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 giving you blanket authority, and that's what we have in
 2 this record; in that situation, that takes you out of the
 3 10(b) paradigm. 
 4 QUESTION: Well, it's true in effect that not
 5 every breach of fiduciary duty is a fraud. 
 6 MR. GOLDBLATT: That's correct. Not every
 7 breach of fiduciary duty is a fraud, and not every breach
 8 of fiduciary duty will violate 10(b). 
 9 QUESTION: But in your paradigm, you are saying
 10 the authorization is induced by fraud and that's crucial. 
 11 But in -- why don't you have the equivalent of it here? 
 12 Because what you have here is a continuing
 13 authorization. There is an authorization generally given
 14 at the beginning and the theory is that that authorization
 15 continues so that at every moment subsequent to that the
 16 client is saying yes, you may sell these things or buy as
 17 you see fit for my benefit, so that at any moment at which
 18 the client remains silent and allows that authorization to
 19 continue, if at that moment the broker has formed the
 20 intent, which you would take to be sufficient, why doesn't
 21 that function in the same way as the authorization
 22 specifically induced? 
 23 The client is being quiet and he's continuing
 24 the authorization because the broker is implicitly lying.
 25 MR. GOLDBLATT: Justice Souter, my answer to

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that is this: If it is shown, in other words, assuming
 2 you have a discretionary account to invest conservatively,
 3 if a broker then goes and buys a penny stock, that is
 4 outside the scope of the discretionary authorization and
 5 it would be a violation of 10(b). What the --
 6 QUESTION: Well, it's outside of the
 7 authorization at the beginning because the authorization
 8 under no circumstances covered that kind of a sale. 
 9 MR. GOLDBLATT: Yes, it was outside the scope of
 10 the authority. 
 11 QUESTION: But the term of the authorization
 12 that I'm saying is crucial, and what I thought you were
 13 saying is crucial in the case that you succeed is the term
 14 of the authorization that in effect says, you may sell
 15 this stock for my benefit. And you are saying if a
 16 specific decision to that effect is induced by fraud,
 17 that's enough. It gets you within the rule. 
 18 And I'm saying if a continuing decision, a
 19 decision evidenced by the client's silence is induced,
 20 that should be sufficient too. 
 21 MR. GOLDBLATT: And one of the things that the
 22 Court of Appeals found here was that that was not
 23 established. With regard to the various sales, when these
 24 checks were written, the Court concluded there was nothing
 25 in the record to conclude that those sales --

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Okay. Then maybe this case should
 2 come out your way. But as a matter of theory, isn't it
 3 the same case whether it's a continuing authorization or
 4 an authorization which is specifically induced? 
 5 MR. GOLDBLATT: In either situation if you can
 6 show that the sale itself is a violation of that
 7 authorization or a breach of it, yes. But in this case
 8 the Court was very careful on that in saying not only that
 9 this was a discretionary account, but in light of the
 10 allegations in the indictment there was just no proof in
 11 the record that any of these sales were in violation --
 12 QUESTION: Yes, but you are going back to the
 13 indictment and ignoring the complaint. 
 14 MR. GOLDBLATT: Even with the complaint there's
 15 really nothing in the complaint that they are relying on
 16 other than the mutual fund account, and again --
 17 QUESTION: Well, the course of conduct, one
 18 transaction after another is relevant; isn't it? 
 19 MR. GOLDBLATT: Not given the time factor. And
 20 we are not talking -- the time factor is actually from
 21 March of '88 to September of '90. And in that regard
 22 there's just nothing in the record -- we don't even know
 23 what the securities were that were bought or sold. And
 24 that's the problem with their theory of this case. It's
 25 overarching in where it goes. 

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 There's no proof that any of these sales were
 2 not consistent with the authorization, were not in the
 3 client's interests. And they didn't attempt to prove it.
 4 QUESTION: In the case of churning --
 5 QUESTION: Well, is there any proof that any of
 6 the proceeds were ever given to the owner of the
 7 principal? 
 8 MR. GOLDBLATT: The proof is that the proceeds
 9 go to three contracts that were determined by the jury in
 10 the wire fraud case to be fraudulent that are agreements
 11 that were between Zandford and the clients. One was a
 12 personal loan, one was an investment that the Court
 13 determined to be fraudulent. That's where the fraud takes
 14 place. That's where the conversion takes place, not
 15 sooner, under our theory and under what the Court found. 
 16 QUESTION: You say that there's no evidence that
 17 the sale was made for the fraud. But if as the government
 18 says, some of these sales were made to cover a check
 19 written on the account, the sale would not have occurred
 20 had the check not been written. And that check he wrote
 21 to himself or to one of these contract accounts. Doesn't
 22 that make it automatic that the sale occurred in order to
 23 get the money to pay him? 
 24 MR. GOLDBLATT: I don't believe so, Justice
 25 Scalia. And I don't believe that was their theory in the

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 indictment. The checks were written on the account but he
 2 had authority to do that. There's no --
 3 QUESTION: Fine. 
 4 MR. GOLDBLATT: -- indication that was wrong --
 5 QUESTION: And is the writing of the check what
 6 caused the sale? 
 7 MR. GOLDBLATT: Positions were liquidated in
 8 order to pay the checks. 
 9 QUESTION: Right. 
 10 MR. GOLDBLATT: But there's no indication that
 11 those sales were not a deliberate decision to sell those
 12 securities at that point to take the money and put it into
 13 something else. There's nothing to indicate that that was
 14 unauthorized to do that. Because we don't know what the
 15 thoughts were. 
 16 QUESTION: It was authorized? 
 17 QUESTION: I'm missing something. Why do you
 18 write the check first if all you intend to do is to take
 19 the proceeds and buy another stock for the client's
 20 benefit? It's the sequence of the check, I think, that's
 21 bothering me. 
 22 MR. GOLDBLATT: Well, the sequence of the check
 23 is to take the money out of the account and invest it
 24 otherwise, which is why you would do it that way or could
 25 do it that way. But we know very little about it. But

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 there's nothing --
 2 QUESTION: Doesn't it matter who the check is
 3 written to? I mean, I presume these checks that the
 4 government was referring to were not checks sort of
 5 payable to the mutual fund to buy more stock or payable
 6 for the purchase of other stock. It was simply payable to
 7 the broker; wasn't it? 
 8 MR. GOLDBLATT: Well, it was payable to the
 9 broker or accounts controlled by the broker. But as the
 10 evidence establishes in the record on affirming the appeal
 11 on the sufficiency of the evidence claim, the money went
 12 into other investments. And that's what Zandford's
 13 defense was. These were other legitimate investments and
 14 that's what I was doing with the money, and they knew
 15 about it and that's what that was.
 16 QUESTION: So they can't -- you are saying they
 17 can't trace any proceeds necessarily from the checks drawn
 18 into Zandford's personal accounts or --
 19 MR. GOLDBLATT: Well, they -- the way they
 20 describe it, it goes to accounts controlled by Zandford. 
 21 So they do indicate that the conversion of the proceeds
 22 into other investments was fraudulent. 
 23 QUESTION: Well, let me just see what your
 24 theory is here. Suppose the way it works is that there's
 25 a mutual fund account and the broker decides, I want to

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 take this money for my own purposes to spend on a pleasure
 2 cruise. I write the check that causes the sale of the
 3 security. Under your theory, is there a 10b-5 violation?
 4 MR. GOLDBLATT: If the writing of the check is
 5 unauthorized, it's going to be a 10b-5 violation. 
 6 QUESTION: Everybody knows he didn't -- the
 7 client didn't authorize the broker to take a pleasure
 8 cruise. That's my hypothetical. 
 9 MR. GOLDBLATT: Then it would be a 10b-5e
 10 violation. What the Court found lacking here was any
 11 evidence that the sale itself of the securities by the
 12 writing of the check established a 10b-5 --
 13 QUESTION: But it's alleged properly. I mean, I
 14 read on Page 29A, in July -- there's a misprint in the
 15 paragraph, but in July 1998 Zandford without the prior
 16 knowledge or consent of -- must be of Wood -- sold three
 17 securities in the Wood account for a total of $145,000. 
 18 What their claim is, is that without the client's consent,
 19 the broker sold the securities and then after that he used
 20 the proceeds for himself. All right. Now, on your
 21 theory, that alleges a violation of the securities law. 
 22 Is that right? 
 23 MR. GOLDBLATT: Under my theory, that would
 24 allege it. 
 25 QUESTION: All right. 

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. GOLDBLATT: But the Court of Appeals 
 2 found --
 3 QUESTION: Fine. Then the correct thing of
 4 disposition in your view of this case, since the
 5 allegation is there, and since the Court of Appeals said
 6 that the criminal case didn't investigate this matter
 7 about whether it was or without the client's consent, your
 8 view is we should have a remand so that they can have a
 9 trial on the question of whether Mr. Wood did consent to
 10 the sale. Is that right? 
 11 MR. GOLDBLATT: No, Justice Breyer, that's not
 12 right. 
 13 QUESTION: Because? 
 14 MR. GOLDBLATT: Because two things. One, the
 15 Court of Appeals found that there was no evidence because
 16 it was a discretionary account, that there was anything
 17 unauthorized about it. There wasn't any consent needed. 
 18 QUESTION: Of course there was no evidence. 
 19 That's because the government relied upon the criminal
 20 case. So the Court of Appeals says they are wrong to rely
 21 on that. Then as you pointed out at the beginning, the
 22 correct result is to send it back so now the government
 23 has a chance to put in other evidence, if you are right
 24 about what the evidence shows. 
 25 MR. GOLDBLATT: In the ordinary course I would

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 agree with that. All other things being equal, that would
 2 be the result. But if in fact the SEC by its litigation
 3 posture chose to rest exclusively on the criminal
 4 indictment, this other case --
 5 QUESTION: You mean there is something in this
 6 record where the SEC says, by the way, if this criminal
 7 case does not provide sufficient evidence, we do not
 8 intend to put in any other evidence. Where does it say
 9 that? 
 10 MR. GOLDBLATT: It doesn't say that. There are
 11 representations that the criminal case is the same as the
 12 civil case. At the time of our argument in this case, we
 13 argued to the Court that if this is all they have, if the
 14 criminal indictment is -- yes, in the Court of Appeals. 
 15 If this is all they have, then there's nothing to send it
 16 back for. Because this evidence in the criminal case --
 17 QUESTION: You mean it's going to be agreed that
 18 there is no doubt that this retarded individual of a very
 19 advanced age agreed that his securities would be sold for
 20 the purpose of the broker running off with the money? 
 21 MR. GOLDBLATT: Justice Breyer, I think that --
 22 QUESTION: I say that with some sarcasm in my
 23 voice, because it sounds to me incredible. 
 24 MR. GOLDBLATT: Obviously these are very hard
 25 facts to argue. But my point is, he went to jail for

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 almost five years. It violates all sorts of rules,
 2 provisions, statutes, there's no question about this. 
 3 This conduct is controlled. The Court of Appeals had no
 4 doubt about that. But a 10(b) violation is different. 
 5 And also the SEC's litigation posture is different. If
 6 they are going to give up the facts in the complaint and
 7 argue the case on the indictment, in a strategical attempt
 8 to get the Court to rule the way they want, which is the
 9 broadest possible 10(b), then they have got to live with
 10 it. And when the fact --
 11 QUESTION: That's for purposes of their
 12 affirmative motion for summary judgment. They could then
 13 say these facts are established. That's not a sufficient
 14 reason for granting summary judgment the other way around.
 15 MR. GOLDBLATT: I absolutely agree, Justice
 16 Stevens, and our only point there is --
 17 QUESTION: Therefore, we should not ignore the
 18 allegations of the complaint that go beyond the
 19 indictment. 
 20 MR. GOLDBLATT: The only objection I have to
 21 that is the fact that they sought rehearing and they
 22 sought rehearing and bond, and not one word was mentioned
 23 about a remand for dismissal. They were still arguing
 24 collateral estoppel and on the facts of the indictment we
 25 win outright. They did not even bring it to the attention

1 of the Court. 
 2 QUESTION: That's because they were trying to
 3 win outright. 
 4 MR. GOLDBLATT: That's right. 
 5 QUESTION: But that doesn't justify your winning
 6 outright. 
 7 MR. GOLDBLATT: When they file -- of course. 
 8 There's no question that both sides agree that Bankers
 9 Life and O'Hagan control and we say it's clear we win. 
 10 That's the normal case. But when they don't seek
 11 rehearing on that basis so this Court doesn't even know
 12 why the Court of Appeals did what it did, and when they
 13 file for certiori and don't raise that as a claim for
 14 reversing or --
 15 QUESTION: Well, when you say we don't know the
 16 reason why the Court of Appeals did what it did, I mean,
 17 it wrote an opinion, which usually gives the reason why
 18 the Court of Appeals did what it did. Are you complaining
 19 that they didn't say anything on rehearing?
 20 MR. GOLDBLATT: What I'm saying is when this
 21 comes up for the first time in the opinion of the Court of
 22 Appeals and they file for rehearing, and they don't even
 23 bring it to the attention of the Court so that the Court
 24 can determine whether there is something to be corrected
 25 or whether this is the Court's understanding from oral

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 argument that is what their case is. 
 2 QUESTION: You are saying that the government
 3 didn't raise this issue in their petition for rehearing to
 4 the Court of Appeals. 
 5 MR. GOLDBLATT: They did not even mention it. 
 6 QUESTION: Well, but I don't know that they have
 7 to. I mean, so long as they properly petition here, I
 8 don't know that you need have a petition for rehearing in
 9 the Court of Appeals. 
 10 MR. GOLDBLATT: Ordinarily I would absolutely
 11 agree, Mr. Chief Justice. But I think when it's something
 12 that comes up in the opinion from the Court of Appeals
 13 that on its face doesn't have any explanation that
 14 basically says instead of going back so you can prove your
 15 case, we're throwing it out completely, and they don't say
 16 a word to the Court of Appeals, that's the wrong remedy. 
 17 I mean, that's the first thing --
 18 QUESTION: But Mr. Goldblatt, the Court of
 19 Appeals decision didn't turn on issue preclusion, it
 20 turned on a notion that in order to have a violation of
 21 10(b) you had to have some kind of misleading about the
 22 merits of a certain security, something tied to the
 23 security, and not that they regarded this as a common law
 24 crime as theft. 
 25 MR. GOLDBLATT: The Court concluded --

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: I mean, the point they made was it's
 2 the same as if what was entrusted to the broker were a car
 3 and he sold the car for himself instead of the customer. 
 4 MR. GOLDBLATT: The point was that the
 5 securities were incidental to this fraud. They were not
 6 an integral part of it, and --
 7 QUESTION: May I just interrupt with one. The
 8 question presented is whether when the stockbroker sells
 9 his customer's certain securities for his own benefit. 
 10 Now, do we have to assume he sold them for his own benefit
 11 at the time the sale was made or are you saying in fact he
 12 sold them for his principal's benefit and later decided to
 13 appropriate the proceeds? 
 14 MR. GOLDBLATT: Justice Stevens, what I am
 15 saying is there is no proof in this record that at the
 16 time of the sales --
 17 QUESTION: Well, maybe there's no proof but the
 18 question we are asked to decide is when he does it for his
 19 own benefit is it a violation of 10(b)4? That's what the
 20 question is. 
 21 MR. GOLDBLATT: I understand that, Justice
 22 Stevens, and --
 23 QUESTION: And what's your answer to the
 24 question? Your answer to the question is he didn't do it. 
 25 MR. GOLDBLATT: My answer to the question is it

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 is authorized sale, either on the instructions of the --
 2 QUESTION: Well, if it's a sale for his own
 3 benefit. 
 4 MR. GOLDBLATT: And at the same time it is also
 5 consistent with the client's instructions, until he
 6 converts, he has not violated 10(b). 
 7 QUESTION: Even though the sale was for his own
 8 benefit at the time he made the sale.
 9 MR. GOLDBLATT: Even though he -- if it is for
 10 his own benefit -- in other words, it could be both at the
 11 same time. At the time of the sale, if the client calls
 12 you and says sell my XYZ stock, I want it sold today, and
 13 you sell it with the intent to convert the proceeds, that
 14 sale is not simply for the broker's benefit. It is
 15 consistent with the instructions. It is an authorized
 16 sale. Until and unless he actually converts the proceeds,
 17 he has violated nothing. 
 18 QUESTION: But when you say it is consistent
 19 with the instruction, you are assuming the instruction
 20 simply means you can buy or you cancel, whereas the
 21 argument is that the instruction is you can buy for my
 22 benefit or you cancel for my benefit. And if we accept
 23 the latter characterization as true, then even under your
 24 own theory, he was not making a sale that he was
 25 authorized to make. 

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. GOLDBLATT: I would disagree, Justice
 2 Souter. On this record it may well be that it was for his
 3 benefit, but I don't think you can conclude it was not for
 4 his client's benefit as well. 
 5 QUESTION: Mr. Goldblatt, before you sit down,
 6 would you say something about the fact that you have
 7 adjudications by the SEC that adopt the theory that they
 8 are arguing before us, why shouldn't we defer if the
 9 question is a close one? 
 10 MR. GOLDBLATT: As I understand it --
 11 QUESTION: These are formal adjudications under
 12 the Administrative Procedures Act and they have ruled in
 13 accordance with the theory that the government is now
 14 arguing. Why isn't that entitled to deference? 
 15 MR. GOLDBLATT: Justice Scalia, assuming -- and
 16 because my time has run out -- assuming that Congress in
 17 fact delegated the discretion to the Agency, I don't think
 18 you can find in any of the various things that they rely
 19 on, any rule dealing with 10(b) or Section 10b-5 that
 20 speaks to the precise issues that are raised in this case
 21 or even close to them. What they do is they have rules
 22 that in 16 or so cases, or whatever the number, they have
 23 prosecuted for 10(b) violations brokers who convert. But
 24 they are not necessarily, as a matter of fact I don't
 25 recall any of them being discretionary accounts or

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 presenting the type of 10(b) analysis, fraud in connection
 2 with a purchase or sale of securities. 
 3 QUESTION: So you are saying we can defer it,
 4 but there's nothing to defer it to. 
 5 MR. GOLDBLATT: That is correct. Assuming there
 6 is deference, there's nothing to defer it to, and if there
 7 was, it would be a rule that they are ultimately asking
 8 for that a broker any time they convert from the account
 9 violates 10(b) and that would be arbitrary. That is not
 10 the way this rule is applied. It is applied on a careful
 11 case-by-case basis. So whichever way you go on that, I
 12 don't think it gets them the deference they seek. I would
 13 add, however, with the little time that I have left, that
 14 I do not believe they would get that deference. 
 15 On churning, Justice Ginsburg, just to get to
 16 that point, in a churning case, I think that is more the
 17 O'Hagan paradigm. You consummate the fraud through the
 18 sale itself. It is the sale that completes the violation. 
 19 It is the sale that consummates the violation of fiduciary
 20 duty. That's the difference between here and a churning
 21 case. 
 22 Until and unless Zandford converts those
 23 proceeds, which is done through agreements that are
 24 outside the scope of the securities laws, he has not
 25 violated 10(b). 

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 In a churning case, the sale itself consummates
 2 it and it meets the other conditions that are required in
 3 O'Hagan. That is a different situation and it is also
 4 established, of course, in that situation through the
 5 pattern of sales you have the proof that you don't have
 6 here, which is that those sales were not in the client's
 7 interests. If you cannot establish that they --
 8 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Goldblatt. 
 9 MR. GOLDBLATT: Thank you. 
 10 QUESTION: Mr. Roberts. Mr. Roberts, the
 11 government wants the Court of Appeals reversed here, I'm
 12 sure. But does it want the summary judgment granted by
 13 the District Court for the SEC affirmed? 
 14 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS
 15 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 16 MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor, we didn't seek
 17 review of the reversal of the summary judgment. We sought
 18 review of a different part of the Court of Appeals
 19 opinion. After it reversed the summary judgment, it
 20 explained why it didn't think summary judgment could be
 21 granted, it went on to say that the allegations in the
 22 complaint didn't state a claim under 10(b). And that's
 23 what we want reversed. 
 24 And the Court of Appeals relied on the facts in
 25 Page 8A of the petition. The Court of Appeals states in

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the part of the opinion that's relevant here that the SEC,
 2 I'm in the middle paragraph of that page under the B, and
 3 I think it's the third sentence, says it, meaning the SEC,
 4 alleges that Zandford defrauded the Woods by failing to
 5 inform them that he intended to sell their securities in
 6 order to obtain the proceeds for himself. 
 7 So the facts that the Court of Appeals were
 8 considering are precisely the same facts that we are
 9 relying on here, Your Honor. And the --
 10 QUESTION: Go ahead. I have a different
 11 subject. Finish this one. 
 12 MR. ROBERTS: Okay. I was just going say that
 13 the indictment is no different in any event, and on Page
 14 41A in paragraph 5 of the indictment it alleged that
 15 Charles Zandford caused checks to be issued against the
 16 security positions of William R. Wood and Diane Okstulski
 17 and made payable to Charles Zandford, thereby causing
 18 their securities to be liquidated. 
 19 QUESTION: But it doesn't say it was without
 20 their consent. Nowhere in the --
 21 MR. ROBERTS: It says it was part of a scheme
 22 and artifice to defraud. 
 23 QUESTION: That's true. That's true. 
 24 MR. ROBERTS: So I think that pretty well
 25 encompasses that. 

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Mr. Roberts, we have apparently some,
 2 I would call it a factual disagreement, as to whether any
 3 adjudications by the SEC adopt the theory that you are
 4 arguing before us today. What are your best cases? 
 5 MR. ROBERTS: Okay. I would point to, on page
 6 36 of our brief we discuss the Southeastern Securities
 7 Corporation adjudication, Your Honor, from 1949, seven
 8 years after the SEC promulgated Rule 10(b). 
 9 In that case the facts were that the president
 10 and director of the brokerage firm sold the customer's
 11 securities without her knowledge or consent and converted
 12 the proceeds of the sale to his own use. And after
 13 explaining that there was a relationship of trust and
 14 confidence and that he had a fiduciary duty, the SEC
 15 addressed the argument that this conduct was authorized
 16 because he had discretion over the customer's affairs by
 17 virtue of a general power of attorney, and rejected that
 18 argument, noting that even assuming the power of
 19 attorney's validity, it didn't authorize this conduct
 20 absent a showing of full and specific disclosure to and
 21 understanding consent by the customer. 
 22 And then the Commission concluded that the
 23 stockbroker's taking and sale of the customer's securities
 24 and his use of the proceeds constituted a willful abuse of
 25 his trust and a violation of --

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: When do you say Rule -- or Section
 2 10(b) is violated? Let's assume that this scheme is
 3 discovered before he actually runs off with the money. He
 4 sold the stocks in order to run off with the proceeds, but
 5 you get him before he runs off with the proceeds. Has
 6 there been a violation --
 7 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. 
 8 QUESTION: -- at the time of the sale? 
 9 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. There's a violation at the
 10 time of the sale. 
 11 QUESTION: Okay. 
 12 MR. ROBERTS: The discretionary authority
 13 doesn't make the sale authorized because he's authorized
 14 only to sell for the benefit of the customers. 
 15 QUESTION: Well, I mean, it seems to me that's
 16 logical and that sort of makes me worry about -- about the
 17 great scope of litigation that we are inviting if you say
 18 civil actions not by the Commission but by individuals are
 19 also available under this theory. 
 20 Whenever a broker sells stock, he's always open
 21 to the charge that he wasn't doing it in my interest, he
 22 was doing it in his own, and you have a lawsuit.
 23 MR. ROBERTS: Two -- two points to address that
 24 concern, Your Honor. First of all, as I was discussing
 25 with Justice Ginsburg earlier, when there is -- a private

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 action requires proof of damages. And if the broker
 2 doesn't follow through with his plan to convert the
 3 proceeds, there will be -- it will be frequently the case
 4 that the customer can't show damages and needs to be able
 5 to allege those as a required part of the action, couldn't
 6 bring it at all, end, case over. 
 7 QUESTION: Well, the stock's gone up. I mean,
 8 the stock that has been sold has gone up enormously. 
 9 MR. ROBERTS: Right. 
 10 QUESTION: And all the plaintiff has to allege
 11 is you really didn't sell it in my interest, you sold it
 12 because you were going to run off with the proceeds, and
 13 look what happened, the stock went way up. 
 14 MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor. Under the Private
 15 Securities Litigation Reform Act, the plaintiff has to
 16 state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong
 17 inference that the defendant acted with the requisite
 18 fraudulent state of mind. 
 19 QUESTION: Well, are you saying that every
 20 breach of fiduciary duty is a fraud under 10(b)? 
 21 MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor. Only secret or
 22 deceptive breaches of fiduciary duty are frauds. 
 23 QUESTION: What about a standard churning case? 
 24 Aren't most breaches of fiduciary duty secret? I mean,
 25 you don't announce that you are breaching a fiduciary

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 duty. 
 2 MR. ROBERTS: Many of them, particularly
 3 breaches of the duty of loyalty will be secret, Your
 4 Honor. But not every breach of fiduciary duty is going to
 5 be -- is going to be secret or knowing. A breach of the
 6 duty of care wouldn't even be knowing necessarily. A
 7 breach of the duty of fairness as in the Santa Fe case
 8 where all the factors disclosed would not be deceptive,
 9 there would be no violation. But in O'Hagan, the Court
 10 explained that when the -- when a fiduciary pretends
 11 loyalty to the principal and instead embezzles the
 12 principal's property, that's a fraud. And that's a 
 13 fraud --
 14 QUESTION: What happens with standard churning
 15 cases?
 16 MR. ROBERTS: This is -- this is just like a
 17 standard churning case, Your Honor. A churning case is
 18 one --
 19 QUESTION: Well, is there authority that this is
 20 a 10b-5 violation --
 21 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. 
 22 QUESTION: -- and it's a given or are we holding
 23 that in this case. 
 24 MR. ROBERTS: Well, you are not addressing
 25 churning because obviously that's not here. But I think

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that the courts of appeal have unanimously concluded that
 2 churning is a violation. And that's because the broker
 3 who has control over the account and who's been entrusted
 4 with trading authority by the customer is making the
 5 trades, not in furtherance of the customer's investment
 6 objectives but in furtherance of the broker's aim of
 7 gaining commission. 
 8 QUESTION: So if you prevail in this case, this
 9 case will be authority which validates all of the circuit
 10 opinions holding that churning is a violation. 
 11 MR. ROBERTS: Well, again, Your Honor, churning
 12 is -- it's a different -- it's a different factual
 13 scenario because there are repeated sales and because the
 14 proceeds aren't taken. And I suppose that a distinction
 15 could be drawn between when the proceeds are taken and if
 16 the proceeds -- if it isn't a question of taking the
 17 proceeds but just making a commission, which the customer
 18 knows that the broker is doing. But I do think this would
 19 be strong precedent in support of those cases. 
 20 QUESTION: Would you want to argue that
 21 distinction, Mr. Roberts? 
 22 MR. ROBERTS: Not particularly. I was
 23 acknowledging that I think this would be strong precedent. 
 24 But I -- Respondent concedes that churning is covered, the
 25 courts of appeals unanimously have held that churning is

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 covered. I have no doubt that churning is covered. The
 2 SEC has no doubt that churning is covered. So you
 3 wouldn't be breaking -- wouldn't be breaking new ground in
 4 holding that. I mean, it would be in the sense that it
 5 would be your decision, but you can make the distinctions
 6 in future cases that you feel are appropriate and
 7 necessary, Your Honor. 
 8 (Laughter.) 
 9 QUESTION: Too true. Too true. 
 10 (Laughter.) 
 11 MR. ROBERTS: If there are no further questions,
 12 the Government would ask that the decision of the Court of
 13 Appeals be reversed. 
 14 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.
 15 Roberts. The case is submitted. 
 16 (Whereupon, at 10:59 a.m., the case in the
 17 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
