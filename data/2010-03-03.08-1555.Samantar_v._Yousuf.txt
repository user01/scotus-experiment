1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:02 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 4 argument today in Case 08-1555, Samantar v. Yousuf. 5 Mr. Dvoretzky. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. DVORETZKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 9 it please the Court: 10 The FSIA applies to suits against foreign 11 officials for acts taken on the state's behalf, because 12 such suits are the equivalent of a suit against the 13 state directly. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Counsel, I -- I want to just 15 say that I have one problem with the case at the outset. 16 And I don't mean to interrupt the organization of your 17 argument. You might want to address it later. And it's 18 a question that goes to the other counsel, too. 19 I'm having difficulty seeing how the issues 20 as presented in the brief really resolve very much. 21 Let's assume -- I know this is not your position. Let's 22 assume the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act grants 23 immunity to the state for this conduct and for a 24 then-serving official who is its agent and for a former 25 agent. Let's assume there is -- there is immunity. Why

1 isn't it just repealed, overridden, by the later 2 enactment of the Torture Victims Protection Act? 3 I just don't see the issue structured that 4 way in the briefs, and I'm puzzled by it. But I say that 5 at the outset, and I really didn't mean to interrupt your 6 -- your good introduction. 7 MR. DVORETZKY: The Torture Victim 8 Protection Act creates a cause of action but is silent 9 about immunity, and, therefore, has to be interpreted 10 consistently with background immunity principles and 11 consistently with a preexisting statute codifying 12 immunity, rather than -13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what authority do 14 you have for that? 15 MR. DVORETZKY: I'm sorry. Could you 16 repeat -17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What case authority do you 18 have for that proposition? 19 MR. DVORETZKY: Dellmuth v. Muth, for one 20 thing. Also, the government previously argued that the 21 TVPA has to be interpreted consistent with preexisting 22 immunity principles. When Congress wants to waive 23 immunity, it knows how to do that. For example, it 24 amended the FSIA to specifically waive immunity for 25 actions against state sponsors of terrorism.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's like a -- it's like a 2 clear statement rule? 3 MR. DVORETZKY: Yes. If Congress wishes to 4 waive immunity, it has to do so expressly. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you are right about 6 that -- I guess it would be the same under the Alien Tort 7 Statute -- then the Filartiga case -- if the -- if there 8 had been a quest -- request to dismiss because Filartiga 9 was a former officer, and the same thing in Karadzic, 10 none of those could have gone forward? 11 MR. DVORETZKY: If, in those cases, an 12 immunity defense had been asserted and it had been 13 established that the official was acting on behalf of 14 the state, then, yes, immunity would apply. Those 15 defenses were not asserted in those cases, though. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there any 17 Alien Tort Statute or the torture statute that would 18 have survived, under your view, because your view is 19 it's no exception under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities 20 Act, end of case? 21 MR. DVORETZKY: Absolutely, there are 22 Torture Victim Protection Act and ATS claims that could 23 be brought. They could be brought whenever an FSIA 24 exception applies. So, for example, if an action were 25 brought against an official of a state sponsor of
5 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 terrorism, the FSIA exception for that would apply. If 2 a foreign state waived immunity, either explicitly or 3 implicitly -4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but that doesn't -5 that's not going to happen. 6 (Laughter.) 7 MR. DVORETZKY: There are cases where it has 8 happened. For example, the Philippines effectively 9 waived immunity when claims were brought against Marcos. 10 So it certainly could happen. 11 Congress envisioned that the statute would 12 be interpreted consistently with immunity principles. 13 The legislative history supports that inference. There 14 are reports in the legislative history and a 15 floor statement by Senator Specter saying that the FSIA 16 could provide an immunity defense to a claim against an 17 official where the official can establish an agency 18 relationship with the state. 19 Here, there is no question that Mr. Samantar 20 was acting in an official capacity, because he is being 21 sued for his actions as a prime minister and as a 22 defense minister, in the midst of what was effectively 23 quelling a secessionist insurgency. That's an 24 inherent -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, that -- again,
6 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the Torture Victim Protection Act says "an individual 2 who, under actual or apparent authority, or under color 3 of law of any foreign nation, subjects an individual to 4 torture." 5 Why isn't that a clear statement? And then 6 I'll get off this hobby horse, and you can get back to 7 talking about the FSIA. 8 MR. DVORETZKY: Well, it's not a clear 9 statement because it's only a clear statement creating a 10 cause of action. It's not a clear statement that speaks 11 to immunity. And, again, where Congress has wanted to 12 waive immunity, it has done that expressly, as where it 13 waived the immunity of a foreign state for claims brought 14 against state sponsors of terrorism. 15 And Dellmuth v. Muth, I think, is on point 16 because there the Court held that even though a cause of 17 action was created that would principally apply only to 18 state agencies, that in and of itself was not sufficient 19 to waive the sovereign immunity of the states. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'll jump on 21 the hobby horse even if Justice Kennedy is jumping off. 22 I mean, the -- the exception in the TVPA is 23 to the jurisdictional immunity of a foreign state. That 24 doesn't sound the way you would just establish a cause 25 of action.

1 MR. DVORETZKY: You're talking about the 2 exception in the TVPA for state sponsors of terrorism? 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 4 MR. DVORETZKY: But the TVPA -- the FSIA, in 5 addition, also has a cause of action applicable to state 6 sponsors of terrorism. That's in the red brief at 17a. 7 It's 28 U.S.C. section 1605A(c). And so in that 8 situation, what Congress did was it both created a cause 9 of action against state sponsors of terrorism and their 10 officials and waived immunity. 11 In the TVPA, all that Congress did was to 12 create a cause of action. And so that cause of action 13 has to be read consistently with background principles 14 of immunity. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, when you -- going 16 back to where you started -- you started saying the 17 officer must go together with the state, because in 18 reality it's the same thing; it's a suit against the 19 state. 20 But this is a case seeking money out of the 21 pocket of Samantar and no money from the treasury of 22 Somalia, so why is the suit against the officer here 23 equivalent to a suit against the state? 24 MR. DVORETZKY: Because the touchstone of 25 foreign sovereign immunity law, which the FSIA codified,
8 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 is that one nation's courts cannot sit in judgment of 2 another nation's acts. And the basis for liability that's 3 asserted in this case is Samantar's acts on behalf of 4 the state of Somalia. 5 The issue is not who pays the judgment; the 6 issue is whose acts are in question. Now, in the 7 domestic context, of course, the distinction between 8 personal liability and liability from the state may 9 matter, but that's only because -10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that sounds like 11 you're -- you're talking about an "act of state" doctrine, 12 not that the suit against one is the equivalent of a 13 suit against the other. 14 MR. DVORETZKY: The "act of state" doctrine 15 is distinct from immunity doctrines, although they have 16 certain shared underpinnings and shared comity 17 considerations. And just as the under -- act of state 18 doctrine is concerned with not judging the acts of 19 foreign states, so too is foreign sovereign immunity 20 law. That's the fundamental premise of foreign -- of 21 foreign sovereignty immunity law. 22 In the domestic context, courts do sometimes 23 say that an official can be sued for personal liability 24 because he wasn't acting for the state if he violated 25 the state's controlling law. U.S. courts are able to
9 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 make that determination because our courts are the 2 ultimate arbiters of domestic law. U.S. courts are not 3 the ultimate arbiters of foreign law. In fact, a 4 determination that an official was not acting for a 5 foreign state because he must have violated the foreign 6 state's law or international law is precisely what 7 foreign sovereign immunity prohibits. 8 So in the foreign sovereign immunity 9 context, as long as the underlying acts are those of the 10 state, foreign sovereign immunity prohibits the case 11 from proceeding. And that -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not sure that I 13 followed your distinction of the domestic law, per se, 14 because say, the Federal Tort Claims Act, to come within 15 that Act and to have the government cover it, the 16 officer has to be acting within the scope of her 17 employment, however careless or reckless she may be. 18 MR. DVORETZKY: That -- and that goes to 19 when the government would be liable for the employee's 20 acts. In our case, what we're talking about here is 21 when the official can be personally liable for acts of 22 the state. And in the domestic context, we say the 23 official can be liable when he must not have been acting 24 for the state because he violated the state's 25 controlling law.

1 Foreign sovereign immunity prohibits that 2 determination with respect to the law of foreign states, 3 and it prohibits U.S. courts from imposing their view of 4 international law on other courts to conclude that an 5 official must not have been acting for his state. 6 JUSTICE ALITO: How will a court determine 7 whether an official was acting within the official scope 8 of the official's responsibilities? 9 MR. DVORETZKY: Ordinarily, the foreign 10 state would tell you, and that would be dispositive of 11 the matter. 12 If the foreign state doesn't tell you, you 13 would look at the nature of the allegations in the 14 complaint and see if they fall within a category of 15 conduct that is inherently viewed in -- as sovereign. 16 Atop that list -17 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the court can't tell 18 by looking at the complaint? Is there going to be 19 direct communication between the court and the foreign 20 government on this issue? 21 MR. DVORETZKY: A foreign government 22 ordinarily is going to -- is going to get involved in 23 the case and indicate whether it wishes to assert 24 immunity on behalf of the official or not. 25 For example, there have been several cases
11 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 involving suits against Israeli officials, and the 2 Israeli embassy communicated to the courts and to the 3 State Department that these were acts of Israel and the 4 official policy of the state. 5 Again, if you don't have that, though, it's 6 not going to be a difficult inquiry, typically, to look 7 and see whether inherently sovereign acts are what's at 8 issue. For example, if you have military or police 9 conduct, as this Court said in Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, 10 that's inherently sovereign conduct. Legislative -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how is the inquiry 12 any different than the one that would go under the 13 common law head of state inquiry? What would be 14 different in the two? 15 MR. DVORETZKY: I -- I think the inquiry as 16 to whether it's an official act would be the same, but 17 head of state immunity is a different sort of immunity 18 than sovereign immunity. It's much broader, insofar as 19 it covers even personal acts by a head of state while he's 20 in office, whereas for foreign sovereign immunity, 21 what you're looking to distinguish is whether the 22 official was engaged in personal activity or whether he 23 was engaged in acts on behalf of the state. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is head of state immunity

1 implicit in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act as 2 well? 3 MR. DVORETZKY: No. Head of state immunity 4 is a different body of common law immunity that the 5 FSIA -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: So why can't this be a -- a 7 different body of common law? 8 MR. DVORETZKY: Do you mean, why 9 can't this -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I mean, you're saying 11 they -- they left head of state immunity to the common 12 law, did not incorporate it in the Foreign Sovereign 13 Immunities Act. Why -- why should I believe that they 14 did not do the same for -- for agent of state immunity? 15 MR. DVORETZKY: Because head of state 16 immunity is not a form of sovereign immunity. And what 17 Congress did in this Act was it codified the law of 18 foreign sovereign immunity. At common law, the 19 sovereign immunity of the state was always understood to 20 extend to officials for their official acts. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute. Why -22 why -- that doesn't make any sense to me. Why would we 23 have had the creation of all of these common law 24 immunities attached to foreign individuals like consular 25 and diplomatic and heads of state if state sovereign
13 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 immunity was going to cover them naturally? 2 MR. DVORETZKY: Because consular and 3 diplomatic immunity are very different in scope and in 4 purpose than state sovereign immunity. 5 There are two sources of immunity that an 6 individual might be entitled to. There is the immunity 7 that flows from the state itself for official acts, and 8 there is immunity that flows from the individual's 9 office, like diplomatic and consular immunity. 10 Diplomatic and consular immunity are meant 11 to ensure that states can conduct their business without 12 tying up their officials while they are in office in 13 litigation in foreign courts over any matters, personal 14 or official. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm trying to go before 16 the Act, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, before it 17 was passed, because that was Congress's first statement, 18 and we have to figure out what they intended to replace 19 or not replace. 20 Before the Act came in, what activities of a 21 consular office would not have been covered under the 22 foreign sovereign immunity of a state? What activity 23 could a diplomat have engaged in or a consular officer 24 have engaged in that state immunity, as it was 25 understood at the time, would not have given him or her?
14 Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. DVORETZKY: He could get into a car 2 accident. Diplomatic and consular immunity would 3 prevent the diplomat or the consul from being sued for 4 tort damages for a car accident in a foreign state. 5 Official immunity would not, because driving 6 is not considered an official policy of the state in the 7 way that, as I was saying to Justice Alito, police or 8 military conduct would be. 9 So that's the distinction between official 10 conduct and conduct that may well be within the scope of 11 employment but is not entitled to the state's immunity. 12 And where Congress -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can -- can you get to the 14 text of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that you -15 that you assert embraces this personal immunity? 16 MR. DVORETZKY: Section 1603(a) -- excuse 17 me -- section 1604 says that "a foreign state shall be 18 immune from the jurisdiction" of the United States and of 19 the States. When a suit is brought against an official 20 for his official act, that is effectively subjecting the 21 foreign state itself to U.S. jurisdiction. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that the -- the 23 Department of the Army orders clothes for the soldiers 24 at a time when the department is a separate agency of 25 Government X in 1940. In 1950, this department is
15 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 bought by the Dior clothing company. 2 Now, it's a private entity, and someone would 3 like to sue the department because they didn't pay the 4 bill. It is now a private entity. They are suing them 5 for what happened years ago when they were part of the 6 state. 7 Is it sovereign immunity, this statute that 8 blocks the suit, or some other principle? 9 MR. DVORETZKY: I think this statute would 10 block the suit -11 JUSTICE BREYER: The statute would block the 12 suit. There's precedent with -- you know, famous 13 precedent with King Farouk, which says the opposite. It 14 says: You were king, you are not king now; therefore, 15 there may be a different principle, but we can sue you 16 now. 17 MR. DVORETZKY: Because the source of 18 immunity in that case was head of state immunity, which 19 is different from the state sovereign immunity -20 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And you're 21 saying if a state disappears, it no longer exists, so 22 you couldn't possibly be interfering. You couldn't 23 possibly be interfering in the workings of the state -24 MR. DVORETZKY: If the state -25 JUSTICE BREYER: -- you still can't sue

DVORETZKY: If the state does not exist, 9 then I think you probably could sue the official -10 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why? 11 MR. DVORETZKY: Because -12 JUSTICE BREYER: Because if the state 13 doesn't exist, why is there any stronger reason 14 than in the incident where the entity is no longer 15 part of the state? 16 MR. DVORETZKY: Because ultimately, what 17 foreign sovereign immunity and this statute are 18 concerned with is protecting a foreign state's act from 19 being judged in court. 20 In your example of the Department of the 21 Army which subsequently is bought by another company, 22 and the foreign state exists, the foreign state's acts 23 are still being judged regardless of the status of that 24 department -25 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, you may have act of
17 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 state doctrine. At that point, the State Department 2 comes in and says: You can't maintain this suit because 3 of the act of state doctrine for the very reason you've 4 said. 5 MR. DVORETZKY: You may very well have the 6 act of state doctrine, but -7 JUSTICE BREYER: And that's my question: Do 8 you need the act of state doctrine or does this statute 9 cover it which removes the discretion from the Executive 10 Branch to decide on a case-by-case basis? 11 MR. DVORETZKY: The act of state doctrine 12 might very well cover your hypothetical, but it's a 13 different doctrine that is not duplicative of immunity. 14 It serves different purposes. Immunity prevents the 15 suit from proceeding at the outset. It's an immunity 16 not only from liability, but an immunity from the 17 litigation process itself. 18 The act of state doctrine is a discretionary 19 doctrine, first of all. It's not automatic in the way 20 that immunity is; and, second of all, it applies only on 21 the merits; and, third, it serves different purposes 22 because it can be used even offensively and even in 23 cases where the state itself is not a party, simply to 24 establish the legality of a state's conduct within its 25 own territory. So the act of state doctrine is a
18 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 judge-made prudential doctrine that serves different 2 purposes than immunity. 3 In your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, 4 immunity would apply to the acts of the -- of the 5 Department of the Army because, regardless of when suit 6 is brought, those acts are still those of the state. In 7 the hypothetical where a state does not exist at all, 8 then 1604 would not come into play because there is no 9 foreign state to be held immune. 10 That's not this case, though. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I come back -12 can I come back to the text? I -- just for a moment 13 there we were on the text of this Act -14 (Laughter.) 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that the suit is about. 16 And you said where -- where the immunity exists is at 17 604, which says a foreign state shall be immune, but 18 1603 defines a foreign state, which -- which says that 19 it includes an agency or instrumentality of a foreign 20 state. 21 And then it defines agency or 22 instrumentality in a way which, it seems to me, does not 23 include private individuals, but rather just artificial 24 legal persons. 25 MR. DVORETZKY: Section 1603(a) does not
19 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 define a foreign state exhaustively. It simply states 2 what a foreign state includes. We know that because, if 3 you look at 1603(b), the very next subsection, Congress 4 said what "an agency or instrumentality" means. 5 So had it meant to define exhaustively what 6 "a foreign state" means, it could have said: "A foreign 7 state" means its political subdivisions, agencies, or 8 instrumentalities. The fact that Congress said that a 9 foreign state includes a political subdivision and its 10 agencies or instrumentalities suggests that it includes 11 more than just the enumerated entities. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I would find it 13 extraordinary that it would go out of its way to say 14 that it includes the Department of Defense but would 15 leave up in the air whether it includes the Secretary of 16 Defense. I mean, I -- I -- it seems to me much more 17 likely that you would understand a foreign state to 18 include the departments of -- of that state than that 19 you would assume a foreign state to include individuals 20 who happen to be officials of the state. 21 MR. DVORETZKY: And the reason that I think 22 that Congress had to go out of its way to define what 23 constitutes an agency or instrumentality is that, at the 24 time that the FSIA was passed, there was uncertainty 25 about whether certain governmental or corporate entities
20 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 were included, maybe not the Department of Defense, but 2 whether certain commercial entities owned by the state 3 were entitled to the state's immunity. There was -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: And there was no 5 uncertainty about -- about individuals? 6 MR. DVORETZKY: Precisely. There was no 7 uncertainty about whether individuals were included. 8 And so when Congress was simply continuing the common 9 law against which it passed this statute, it didn't need 10 to expressly say -11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How can you maintain that 12 position when the Department of State takes the position 13 that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act applies to a 14 state and agencies and instrumentalities, but it doesn't 15 apply to officers? If it was all that certain that they 16 didn't even have to put it in, then is -- the State 17 Department is being recalcitrant? 18 MR. DVORETZKY: The State Department asked, 19 before the FSIA was passed, to have Executive discretion 20 take -- taken away with respect to immunity 21 determinations. Congress agreed with that judgment and 22 passed the FSIA, and now the Executive Branch has to be 23 held to that judgment that was made. As far -24 JUSTICE ALITO: It's something of a -25 it's something of a mystery that the FSIA doesn't say
21 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 anything at all about this form of immunity; doesn't 2 codify it, doesn't abrogate it, doesn't preserve the 3 preexisting law. Do you have an explanation for that? 4 MR. DVORETZKY: I don't, other than the 5 explanation that I gave Justice Scalia, which is: This 6 immunity was not in question at the time that the FSIA 7 was passed, and when Congress passes a statute in an 8 area where there had been preexisting common law, this 9 Court presumes that Congress meant to incorporate and 10 continue that common law and not abrogate it unless 11 Congress has spoken directly to the contrary. 12 JUSTICE ALITO: But was this Act originally 13 drafted by the Executive? Do you know? 14 MR. DVORETZKY: I'm not sure whether it was 15 drafted by the Executive or whether it was drafted by 16 Congress, but it was passed at the request of the 17 Executive Branch because there was -- the State 18 Department was put in a position of being under 19 diplomatic pressure to grant immunity on -- on favored 20 status to certain nations who asked for it when they 21 wouldn't otherwise be entitled to it. This -22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any case by us 23 in which we -- prior to the FSIA, where we recognize 24 that an individual was immunized in the way that the 25 state was, if he was acting as an agent of the state?
22 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Or were all of our cases having to do with other common 2 law doctrines? 3 MR. DVORETZKY: This Court's cases generally 4 had to do with other doctrines. The one possible 5 exception to that is Underhill, in which the Second 6 Circuit's decision decided the issue on foreign 7 sovereign immunity grounds, and this Court affirmed. 8 It's unclear entirely whether this Court's 9 affirmance was on act of state or immunity grounds, but 10 also at the time that that decision was -- came down, 11 act of state and immunity doctrines were very much 12 intertwined. 13 There is no question, however, as the 14 government argues, that the common law before the FSIA 15 recognized that officials were entitled to immunity -16 to the state's immunity for their official acts. The 17 Second Restatement, which was -- which was promulgated 18 in 1965 just before the FSIA, says that. The Second 19 Circuit's decision from 1971, just before the FSIA was 20 passed, in Heaney, says that. And it -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, entitled to it, or -22 or able to obtain a letter from the State Department 23 that would confer it upon them? 24 MR. DVORETZKY: No, Your Honor -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean -- well, I mean,
23 Alderson Reporting Company

1 prior to the FSIA, you -- you had to get it from the 2 State Department, didn't you? Even the state, 3 for that matter? 4 MR. DVORETZKY: No. The -- the -- prior to 5 the FSIA, this was a common law doctrine that courts 6 would often apply without any input from the State 7 Department. 8 In the Heaney case, for example, the State 9 Department was asked to provide input and provided none, 10 and the Second Circuit nonetheless held that, using the 11 generally applicable common law principles, that the 12 official was entitled to immunity for the state's acts. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: And what -- what if the 14 State Department came in and said no, no sovereign 15 immunity here, what would the court do? Would the court 16 be bound by that? 17 MR. DVORETZKY: Ordinarily, the court would 18 at least defer to that. Whether it would be 19 definitively bound by -- by that or not, it would at 20 least be entitled to deference. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: So they didn't have to say 22 yes, but if they said no, that -- it pretty much 23 carried the day? 24 MR. DVORETZKY: That's probably right. 25 And -- but the real issue that prompted the FSIA --

DVORETZKY: No, because the whole 7 purpose of the FSIA -- again, at the Executive Branch's 8 request -- was to take the Executive out of that process 9 and to -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, and then I -- I had 11 thought -- again, correct me if I am wrong -- that, 12 ultimately, in this case, whether or not within the 13 issues here present -- ultimately, you have two arguments. 14 One is that it's just implicit, inherent, necessary for 15 the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that agents be 16 covered; otherwise it won't work. 17 The other -- I take it you have a backup 18 position that even if that's wrong, that under generally 19 accepted principles of international law, that agents 20 still have immunity. Or am I wrong about that? 21 MR. DVORETZKY: Well -22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I had thought when I read 23 the House of Lords opinion in Jones and they talked 24 about the statute, that they took your position, this 25 first position, that the Act just won't work unless

1 there's an agent -- immunity for the agent. But I take 2 it that even if we reject that position, you still have 3 a fallback position in the -- in the -- in further 4 proceedings on remand? 5 MR. DVORETZKY: Our position is that the 6 FSIA incorporates the common law and that Mr. Samantar 7 is entitled to immunity under the statute. If you 8 disagree with us on that, we would certainly wish to 9 assert common law defenses on remand, but we believe 10 that the statute resolves the question. 11 If the Court has no further questions, I'd 12 like to reserve my time. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 14 Ms. Millett. 15 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT 16 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 17 MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 18 please the Court: 19 Justice Kennedy, the hobby horse that you 20 were talking about actually goes right -- right to the 21 heart of this case, and that is of the Torture Victim 22 Protection Act, in which Congress did create a cause of 23 action, was -- that cause of action was created for -- to 24 impose a liability, personal liability, for acts that 25 were done with "actual or apparent" -- but included with
26 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 "actual" -- authority of the foreign state. 2 Now, if Congress believed that the FSIA 3 immunized everyone who undertook acts under color of 4 law, or at a minimum with actual authority of the 5 foreign state, that was a very empty statute. 6 Now, part of the -- part of the -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Millett, I think it's a 8 pretty empty statute as well to interpret the Foreign 9 Sovereign Immunities Act to immunize the Department of 10 Defense, but not the Secretary of Defense. I mean, that 11 seems very strange. 12 MS. MILLETT: It doesn't seem strange, for 13 precisely the reason that we have still with us today a 14 former minister of defense when we have no Ministry of 15 Defense and no Government of Somalia whatsoever. The 16 reason is that individuals come and go. Individuals 17 engage in acts that are not acts of the state -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the state -19 there is -- the distinction strikes me as artificial as 20 well. We're talking about insulating state acts. The 21 only way a state can act is through people. And you're 22 saying: Well, the state is insulated, but the people 23 who do the acts for the state are not. I don't see how 24 that can -- can work. 25 MS. MILLETT: The only question here is
27 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is the 2 source of that insulation. And the very 3 difficulty with -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, well, then -5 but the whole point of the Act was to codify what was 6 there before, and -- and it seems odd to say, well, 7 they were codifying the immunity of the state, but not 8 the immunity of the only way a state can act, which is 9 through individuals. 10 MS. MILLETT: Well, first of all, states do 11 corporate acts that are greater than the -- the whole is 12 much greater than the parts here. And the issue in this 13 case is whether the part can claim the immunity of the 14 whole, and that is a very different thing. 15 The -- the individual -- individuals may 16 act. They may act without authority; they may act 17 contrary to authority. And the problem with the FSIA, 18 which is the issue here, is there is no mechanism in it 19 for addressing, for example, whether this was 20 authorized. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the Ministry of 22 Defense is not the whole, either. I mean, you -- you 23 acknowledge that -- that each individual piece of a 24 foreign sovereign acquires the immunity, but somehow 25 not -- not the principal officers of -- of the sovereign

1 entity. That seems to me very strange. I mean, I guess -2 I guess you could write it that way, but I don't know why 3 anybody would want to write it that way. 4 MS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Scalia, if 5 you're going to write a statute that addresses 6 individual immunities -- in particular, what this case 7 is about, personal immunity for personal liability, 8 then those statutes look very different. 9 What's the first thing you are going to 10 want? You are going to want some way to decide what is 11 official capacity or what is on behalf of a state, and 12 you are going to want a mechanism for the foreign state, 13 or at least the State Department, to have input on that. 14 There's nothing in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act 15 that addresses that. You're going to -16 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what is your -17 MS. MILLETT: -- want to identify -18 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. The question I 19 think, as I understand it, which is certainly why it's 20 bothering me, is: Don't think of this case. Think of 21 the set of cases where it's clear that the plaintiff is 22 suing an active state. He's suing France or he's 23 suing England or -- he's suing an active state for an 24 official act. And the judge says: I have read the 25 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act; dismissed. Judge,

1 let me amend this. And all he does is he fills in 2 the names of the individuals, because there were some 3 individuals who did the act. 4 Now, does he suddenly fall outside the 5 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act just because he listed 6 the names of the people who did it, and everything else 7 was the same? 8 MS. MILLETT: Yes, he does, because -9 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then, this Act does 10 nothing whatsoever. 11 MS. MILLETT: No, that's -- that's not true. 12 That's not true, Justice Breyer. This Act is designed 13 to protect the state from being sued. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it doesn't protect -15 MS. MILLETT: You can't -16 JUSTICE BREYER: -- the state, because all I 17 did there is I made my complaint the same, relief was the 18 same, everything was the same. I happened to go to the 19 Internet to find out who were the human beings working for 20 the state who did the thing I'm complaining did. And all 21 I did was fill their names in, in the complaint. 22 And I cannot imagine any complaint that 23 isn't open to that, because a -- a state can only act 24 through an individual. 25 MS. MILLETT: Justice Breyer, there -- the
30 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 question is whether Congress, in the FSIA, would have 2 thought that is a suit against the state. 3 Now, there may be many reasons that they 4 would have. If they thought, in the Restatement's 5 words -- which are not just if you are doing an official 6 act. If you are doing an official act, and the exercise 7 of jurisdiction would have the effect of enforcing a 8 rule of law against the state, then you get immunized. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: So wait -10 MS. MILLETT: That -11 JUSTICE BREYER: -- you're saying this Act 12 is only good as against a bad lawyer? Because any 13 good lawyer would simply fill in the right names. 14 MS. MILLETT: I think -15 JUSTICE BREYER: There is never a case where 16 this Act would give immunity if the plaintiff has a good 17 lawyer. Is that what you're saying? 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Millett -19 MS. MILLETT: This Act is good against -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I thought your point 21 is, if the relief is against the state, it doesn't 22 matter who you name as the plaintiff. 23 MS. MILLETT: That -24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Whether it's injunctive 25 relief or money relief, if the relief is against the

Official
1 state, obviously, you can't dodge it by naming the 2 officer instead. 3 MS. MILLETT: That's precisely right. That 4 is the second half of the Restatement -5 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Oh, that's a different 6 answer -7 MS. MILLETT: Well, that's what I was trying 8 to say. The second half of the Restatement says you 9 have to be enforcing a rule -- the effect -10 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. If you're going to give 11 that answer -12 MS. MILLETT: -- if you're enforcing a rule 13 of law against -14 JUSTICE BREYER: -- which I thought was what 15 you would give -16 MS. MILLETT: That's what I was trying to 17 give. 18 (Laughter.) 19 JUSTICE BREYER: -- then I have added my 20 question: Sometimes the individual, in the first set of 21 cases that Justice Ginsburg mentioned, does count as the 22 state. Sometimes the individual does not count as the 23 state. And the trouble I'm having, in this case, is to 24 work out the principle of when that individual would 25 fall within the FSIA -- as you now, via
32 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Justice Ginsburg, have conceded, sometimes it does -2 and when it doesn't. 3 And I've tried to work with the idea of 4 relief, or maybe the nature of the cause of action, or 5 maybe the time that the suit is brought, such as a time 6 afterwards. I'm not an expert. You're more of an 7 expert than I. What are the principles that determine 8 when? 9 MS. MILLETT: Well, there's -- there's two 10 levels here. 11 First of all, we'd look -- and this is -12 Congress, presumably, was drawing on a well-established 13 domestic law analogies here. And they may not be 14 100 percent controlling here, but we have 15 well-established ways of understanding whether a -- an 16 action is against an official in -- in their official 17 capacity. We look at the form of relief, the nature of 18 the claim. I do think we need to be careful here -19 JUSTICE ALITO: What is there to suggest that 20 Congress was looking to domestic analogies? This has 21 nothing -- immunity of officials under domestic law 22 doesn't bear very much resemblance to the immunities 23 that are available to foreign officials, does it? 24 MS. MILLETT: Well, this is a domestic 25 statute, and for Congress -- for purposes of Congress
33 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 deciding whether a lawsuit is a suit against a sovereign 2 or not against a sovereign, then that is obviously a 3 relevant framework. 4 And we know from two things -- the Torture 5 Victim Protection Act, that they looked at that framework, 6 but also embedded in the FSIA itself, in the Foreign 7 Sovereign Immunities Act itself, is that same 8 distinction between holding people personally liable and 9 holding the state liable. 10 In 1605A, the terrorist state exception, on 11 15a to 17a of the addendum to our brief, they create a 12 cause of action, one against the state and one against 13 the individual officials. Now, the one against the 14 individual officials is a recognition that individual 15 officials can have personal capacity liability for 16 damages, consistent with the Foreign Sovereign 17 Immunities Act. Otherwise, if -- if, under 18 Petitioner's theory, every lawsuit against an 19 individual -- and the language there, is "acting under 20 color of office or employment" -- if every suit against 21 someone under color of office or employment morphs into 22 a suit against the state, there is no cause of action 23 to create against the individual. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Millett, I 25 thought --
34 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MS. MILLETT: They understood it was 2 individual liability. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the 4 whole point of the FSIA was to get the Executive Branch 5 out of the business of sending letters to the court 6 every time a state was sued. The government requested 7 it for that purpose. Now they are just back into it 8 again if you say, well, you can just sue the 9 individuals. 10 And the government's position in this case 11 confirms that. They're -- they tell us the way you 12 should proceed is to look to the Executive Branch and, 13 basically, we'll send you a letter and let you know. 14 So it seems to me the whole reason you have the FSIA is 15 undermined by the position you're taking today. 16 MS. MILLETT: No, I think it's because the 17 inquiries are very different, as this case illustrates. 18 And that is -- first of all, the point of the FSIA, as 19 section 1602 says, is to codify -- as this Court's cases 20 have said, was to -- largely to codify the restrictive 21 theory of sovereign immunity, which did not apply to 22 individual immunity. It did not apply to the head of 23 state. The head of state was still immune for 24 commercial acts while a sitting head of state. 25 So, if that was codified, that was a dramatic
35 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 change done silently in the FSIA. The reason Congress 2 would want to retain Executive Branch role here is 3 because the inquires are different, and the first one is 4 the most elemental one in Petitioner's case and that is 5 the assertion that: I was acting in my official 6 capacity. Who decides? How do we decide? Which 7 agents? For which actions? For how long? What level 8 of immunity? 9 If the FSIA eliminated the head of state's 10 normal absolute immunity while sitting from all actions, 11 commercial or not, that's a dramatic revolution. We can 12 now sue sitting prime ministers and presidents and 13 distract them from their duties. 14 If the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act made 15 any official's official act an act of the state -- and 16 remember, they are now every level of the foreign 17 government down to the mayor's office, and corporate 18 officials, too, so we've now eliminated the long-standing 19 principle in corporate law -- corporations also only act 20 through individuals -- that corporate liability and 21 individual liability go hand-in-hand. 22 The -- the FSIA did not uproot all that, and 23 it provides no mechanisms. That's why we need to return 24 to the common law immunity. Now, what happens when you 25 have a case that, in effect, is seeking relief against
36 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the state -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. The -- the 3 mechanism it provides is judicial determination of these 4 questions that -- that you say have to be determined -5 whether he was acting within the scope of authority and 6 all that stuff. 7 MS. MILLETT: As you -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that what it did? 9 It took it away from the Executive, gave it -10 MS. MILLETT: When you're interpreting the 11 language in the FSIA, like "under color of law" -12 "under color of office," that is undoubtedly a job for 13 the court. "Official capacity" appears nowhere in the 14 FSIA. Deciding which agents will be agents of the state 15 is nowhere in the FSIA. 16 One court has applied this agency -- agent 17 principle to say that when we hire an independent 18 contractor, in the -- the United States independent 19 contractor, that gets the immunity of the foreign 20 sovereign state. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Courts -- courts 22 decide this sort of question all the time, whether 23 you're talking about principles of domestic immunity 24 or even corporate liability: Is the employee on a 25 frolic or is it a detour? Determining when an individual
37 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 is acting for another entity as opposed to on -- on his 2 own business, that's a very common inquiry. 3 MS. MILLETT: Not in this area, where those 4 decisions have foreign relations implications. This 5 Court has done the opposite. And it has -- it has 6 waited for the political branches to lead, and it has 7 followed. Because the decision whether we're 8 displacing head of state immunity and now we're going 9 to have commercial immunity -10 JUSTICE BREYER: Then that -- I mean, I'm 11 sort of there. You may agree with this, that if you 12 have an individual and with what's being charged here 13 is he is, in fact, now acting as Secretary of Defense, 14 and this action is an action he took in his official 15 capacity, that's it. Forget it. This Act covers it. 16 But where you're claiming it's not and he's 17 not now a member, the reason for the Act disappears, 18 and you go back to the act of state doctrine. 19 MS. MILLETT: Justice Breyer, the -- I don't 20 think -- I think -- and this may seem a little formless, 21 but I simply think it's right, because you're dealing 22 with statutory text here. 23 It's not so much that the defense minister 24 himself becomes the state; it's that the court looking 25 at that action goes: This is really an action against
38 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the state. The state is a necessary party under 2 Pimentel and must be here. You, individual, actually 3 have a common law immunity, an absolute immunity, when 4 you are, under the Restatement, sued for official acts. 5 And the effect of exercising jurisdiction would be to 6 enforce a rule of law against the state. 7 When you have those two things together, 8 both of them, you are entitled to immunity because this 9 is an action against the state. The state's a necessary 10 party. Under Republic of Philippines v. -- excuse me -11 Pimentel, they must be joined, and that will -- then we'll 12 look at the FSIA and decide whether they can be joined 13 or not. That's the way it works. 14 It's not that individuals -- and this is a 15 problem -- that are sort of popping in and out all 16 throughout the FSIA. If it were, we need mechanisms 17 that we don't have here to deal with the very sensitive 18 decisions of which individuals. Well, how will we say 19 you're the agent? It's -- the individual can show up and 20 say I was working for the state; I was doing torture; 21 we loved torture; that was our policy -- you can imagine 22 many a government, if notified, if there was a mechanism 23 for them to come in, would say: Hang on, that was not our 24 policy. But there's no mechanism under his theory. 25 What else happens? I don't even understand,
39 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 under this theory, what happens. Normally, what happens 2 in these official capacity suits that we're familiar 3 with is if it really is an official capacity, then we -4 we substitute the state, relief will run against the 5 state. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend -7 you friend -8 MS. MILLETT: But there's no mechanism here 9 for -- I'm sorry. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend said it 11 happens all the time. He cited the example of the 12 Israeli embassy is always sending letters or showing up 13 in court when their agents are -- are sued. 14 MS. MILLETT: That may be. Nobody showed up 15 in court here until we got to this Court. There was no 16 Somali government to show up to say whether this was 17 official or not, and the State Department didn't show up 18 for 2 years. What is a court supposed to do? 19 Well, it was not supposed to do what it did 20 here and declare that it's essentially recognizing the 21 transitional federal government as the government of 22 Somalia, because it didn't know what else to do. That 23 can't be right. And, again, we need to keep in mind the -24 there is no mechanism in the text of the FSIA. This 25 Court will be engaged in an expedition of constructing
40 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 and reconstructing the FSIA if you are going to turn 2 it into either a Westfall substitution act with no 3 language here, or you have to turn it into a personal 4 immunity for personal liability act. 5 That's not the text. Sovereign immunity 6 has never been a personal liability from personal -7 personal immunity from personal liability statute. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, do you agree with the 9 Solicitor General's position about the preservation of 10 the immunities that existed before? 11 MS. MILLETT: Yes, as to -- as 12 individualized, the specialized immunities -13 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. 14 MS. MILLETT: I do -- we do agree. Now, 15 whether we -- we don't agree, I think -- we may not agree 16 100 percent on what the scope or content of that immunity is. 17 We certainly agree that head of state immunity was preserved, 18 so we can't sue the head of state at all while sitting. 19 JUSTICE ALITO: No, but whatever immunity 20 existed previously for an official or former official 21 was not abrogated by the FSIA. The FSIA just doesn't 22 address that subject at all. 23 MS. MILLETT: Our position is that the FSIA 24 does not address that. Our view of what the common law 25 did beforehand was it packed most of this into the act

1 of state doctrine. That's exactly what happened in 2 Underhill v. Hernandez, that when you start getting to 3 lower level officials who are not heads of state, who 4 are not diplomatically protected, consular protected, 5 mission on -- have mission immunity, that that -- a lot 6 of that worked through act of state doctrine, and -7 JUSTICE ALITO: There's no -- there was 8 no immunity for someone who is the equivalent of a -- of 9 a cabinet officer, previously? 10 MS. MILLETT: There -- there -11 JUSTICE ALITO: The minister of this or that 12 in another government -- they have no official immunity? 13 MS. MILLETT: Well, look -- and much is to be 14 debated on remand. That issue is clearly not before 15 this Court. As we look at the cases and the authorities, 16 in fact what you have are different things coming together, 17 and it can be -- a lot of times, it was act of state 18 doctrines that were going on there.

1 the government said, in the old days, the Tate letters 2 went out in all these cases. Now, they no longer go out 3 when we're dealing with a state itself or a state 4 agency, but we still -- the Executive -- basically, as I 5 read the government's position, the government is 6 saying: The Executive Branch decides. We tell the 7 court. And if we don't tell the court that this person 8 can be sued, then the person can't be sued. 9 Are you in sync with the government in that 10 we are now back to the Executive -- essentially, the 11 Executive decides, not the court? 12 MS. MILLETT: I don't think that's the 13 exclusive one, and I think, as this Court explained even 14 in Altmann that deference given -- respectful deference 15 is always going to be given when the Executive Branch 16 weighs in, because these are foreign -- cases that have 17 foreign policy implications. 18 I don't think it's a rubber stamp on the 19 part of the courts. As this Court said in Altmann, it 20 depends on whether they're speaking with particularized 21 specialty. If they come in and say Mr. Samantar was 22 the head of state, we're done. I don't think 23 there's -- I'd like to think of something; I can't 24 think of anything that would save us from that. If they 25 say who a head of state is, then that, I think, has
43 Alderson Reporting Company

Then -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I gather the -12 MS.

MILLETT: Yes. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the -- the State 19 Department wants to be able to decide whether 20 individuals will be held liable, whether they were 21 acting in an official capacity or not; isn't that it? 22 MS. MILLETT: Well, they -- that -- I'll 23 let them speak for their own position. I think 24 certainly -- certainly there are a variety of doctrines, 25 a variety of hurdles any case has to get through. And
44 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 it's not just the Executive's views on a case. There's 2 things like exhaustion. There's necessary party 3 inquiries. There's the act of state doctrine. There's 4 substantive limits on what one can sue for. 5 You know, the Torture Victim Protection Act 6 is Congress's judgment that individuals who do this, 7 consistent with international law, whatever else -8 individuals who engage in torture and extrajudicial 9 killing are held personally liable in Congress's views 10 and in the views of international law. And the Foreign 11 Sovereign Immunities Act doesn't stop that. 12 And what's critical, again, is the -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I must say -14 MS. MILLETT: -- language that's missing -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that I find it much 16 more acceptable to have the State Department say 17 that a particular foreign country should be let off the 18 hook, which is what they used to do with the Tate 19 letters, than I do to leave it up to the State 20 Department whether -- whether an individual human being 21 shall be -- shall be punished or not. I -- I somehow 22 find that less within the realm of the -- of the foreign 23 affairs power of the State Department. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And your red light has 25 gone off. I could just add -- make an addition to that
45 Alderson Reporting Company

1 same question. I would agree that the State Department 2 might have some expertise in telling us what the facts 3 were: Who was the government, who was -- who was in 4 office at the time, what the policies were. 5 But it's just not clear to me what body of 6 principles the State Department looks to, to make this 7 determination that, as Justice Scalia said, Smith is 8 immune and Jones isn't. 9 MS. MILLETT: I think -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please. 11 MS. MILLETT: May I, sir? The -- first of all, 12 whether one thinks it's the right rule or not, the FSIA 13 doesn't tell us any way of answering who was in official 14 capacity and getting input, at a minimum, from the 15 foreign government whose mantle this individual is 16 trying to wrap themselves in. So the FSIA is not the 17 source. 18 The Executive viewpoint is not -- in our 19 view, is not the sole source. And there are -- there 20 are a number of other doctrines, whether it's act of 21 state doctrine, whether it is exhaustion principles, 22 whether it's a necessary party inquiries, whether it's 23 substantive limits on, you know, law of nations 24 requirements for the Alien Tort Statute or the Torture 25 Victim Protection Act.

But in -- forgive me for -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your 9 sentence. 10 MS. MILLETT: But in any given case, the 11 role of the Executive Branch is going to have more or 12 less deference based on whether it is speaking something 13 within its traditional expertise: Are you a head of 14 state? Were you a diplomat? 15 But when it comes to war -- and I -- I'm not 16 saying it would, but if it were to come to war with the 17 very elements of the Torture Victim Protection Act and 18 say that torture by an individual can be immunized just 19 because it was done under color of law, then I think the 20 Court has a very difficult concern that was flagged in 21 Altmann to resolve, and I think we might draw a 22 different -- we would definitely come to a different 23 answer than the Executive Branch in that situation. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You made that a long 25 sentence.

KNEEDLER 7 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 8 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 9 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 The text, the context, the purposes, and 12 legislative history of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities 13 Act demonstrate that it was not intended to apply to the 14 preexisting common law -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -16 MR. KNEEDLER: -- doctrine of official immunity, 17 but rather -- yes -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Kneedler -19 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- I'm -21 MR.

1 your position? And by that I mean, it took 2 years 2 for the State -- for the government to respond to the 3 district court in this case. Tell us why your reading 4 of the statute would not grind the courts to a halt. 5 What happens when Justice Breyer's situation 6 arises? Someone takes a complaint against the state and 7 just substitutes the names of the persons. What -- why 8 wouldn't the courts come to a grinding halt? 9 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, let me answer that in 10 two ways. 11 First, there's -- there is a very practical 12 distinction between suing the state and suing the 13 individual. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is not 14 just about immunity; it's about the subject matter of 15 the courts. If a foreign sovereign is found to be 16 immune, the court has no jurisdiction over the case. So 17 to say that the individual is -- is governed by the FSIA 18 means that it would be a threshold subject matter 19 jurisdictional inquiry in every case. So in terms of 20 judicial administration, that is a problem. 21 It is also a problem, as a practical matter, 22 to apply the FSIA's very reticulated standards that were 23 carefully negotiated between the Executive Branch and 24 Congress when they knew what they were dealing with. 25 They were dealing with the immunity of states and
49 Alderson Reporting Company

1 the -- and the principals of states. And this is 2 reflected, as Ms. Millett said, in section 1602. That's 3 the business that Congress wanted to get -- Congress and 4 the Executive -- wanted the Executive to be out of, 5 which was the immunity of foreign states -6 JUSTICE BREYER: But all you have to do is 7 write a different word in. Now, that's the question 8 that's -9 MR. KNEEDLER: Okay. And -- right and -10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and then Ms. Millett 11 sort of backed off that. 12 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: And that -- and if -- what I'm 14 seeing here is two extreme positions. 15 You're saying: Never, no matter what, can 16 you simply write the name "Joe Smith" under the word 17 "Niger." Okay? Can't do it. Even though every act -18 no matter what, you write that human name in, and you -19 this statute doesn't apply. To me, that means it never 20 applies. All right? 21 The opposite would be that never, under any 22 circumstances, can you sue an individual for a -- for 23 a -- for an official act. That seems the opposite. I 24 should think sometimes you certainly could. Maybe after 25 he has left the government. But I'm looking for the
50 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 principle, if I'm right, that would divide the two. 2 MR. KNEEDLER: And -3 JUSTICE BREYER: You want to stick to your 4 extreme position? Never, just write the thing in -5 MR. KNEEDLER: I don't -- I don't regard the 6 position as extreme at all. It's exactly -7 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, do you want to stick to 8 that position, that all the plaintiff -9 MR. KNEEDLER: Because this -10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- has to do is 11 rewrite the name? 12 MR. KNEEDLER: -- this is a statute that 13 invaded the common law in the -- the background was 14 the common law in which the Executive made the 15 determinations for both foreign sovereigns and 16 individual officials. This -- and in addition, 17 it -- it affected the relationship of the 18 political branches. It had been a power of the 19 Executive Branch for foreign sovereigns. The Foreign 20 Sovereign Immunities Act took that away with the 21 agreement of the political branches. 22 There's none of -- there's no indication 23 whatsoever that Congress addressed common law 24 immunities, and there's a good reason. And that is 25 that there -- there are a lot of diplomatic
51 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 sensitivities about whether immunity should be 2 recognized in a particular case or not. 3 And with respect to foreign sovereigns, the 4 political branches addressed those in very precise ways. 5 There's nothing in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act 6 to take into account the different sensitivities that 7 might well arise with respect to foreign sovereigns -8 JUSTICE BREYER: That's an excellent reason. 9 Can you give me one single example ever of a complaint 10 that would ever be dismissed under this statute -11 MR. KNEEDLER: It would -- it -12 JUSTICE BREYER: -- if -- if my lawyer is 13 clever enough to look up who the individuals were and 14 substitute their names? 15 MR. KNEEDLER: And -- and it would -- here's 16 one example in which it would work: If the relief was 17 going to run against the state, if there was an 18 injunction to take money out of the state treasury or to 19 convey land, for example, that would, in substance, be 20 an action against the state, just like under Ex parte 21 Young. If you tried to bring an injunction against a 22 state officer to make him pay money out of the state 23 treasury, you couldn't do that. 24 It's not because the officer being sued is 25 the state. It's that the state is a necessary party to
52 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that lawsuit. The state not being joined, the suit 2 against the individual would have to be dismissed. 3 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think as a practical 4 matter -5 MR. KNEEDLER: That's Pimentel. 6 JUSTICE ALITO: -- there's a -- I'm sorry. 7 Do you think, as practical matter, there's a difference 8 between a $10 million judgment against a state for 9 something that is official state policy in relation to 10 defense, and a $10 million judgment against the current 11 foreign -- defense minister of that state for exactly the 12 same policy? 13 MR. KNEEDLER: There -- there -- there is a 14 difference in the operation of the suit. We're not 15 saying that such an official should not be immune. What 16 we are saying is that the immunity derives from the 17 common law immunity. There's a presumption against a 18 statute invading the common law, and particularly a 19 common law that was primarily shaped by the Executive. 20 There should be a strong presumption against 21 taking that flexibility away in the absence of a clear 22 statement in the statute. And as -- and -- if the -- if 23 a -- if a suit should go to judgment like that, perhaps 24 the state would indemnify the person. But we are not 25 saying that that person is not immune. A question that
53 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 was asked -2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could we go back to the 3 practical -4 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. To the -- and -- and I -5 I understand the practical problem that the district 6 court faced, and the district court was very patient. 7 I think it's important to appreciate, 8 though, the -- the -- this case really illustrates the 9 sensitivities of -- of foreign official immunity. This 10 is -- this is a claim of foreign official immunity by a 11 former official of a collapsed state in a -- in Somalia, 12 as some of the briefs point out. There has not been a 13 functioning central government since 1991. There are a 14 number of factions. On the ground in Somalia, the 15 absence of a central government has led to foreign 16 governments coming in and exercising influence, to 17 domestic terrorist groups, and to piracy off the -- off 18 the coast of Somalia. 19 The request to the United States, to the 20 State Department for its views, arose in that context. 21 This very case at this moment arises in a context where 22 things are fluid, and -- and there are circumstances in 23 which the Executive Branch or sometimes even the 24 court -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's very nice.

1 A few years ago, a Spanish magistrate allowed a lawsuit 2 to proceed, as I recall, against our Secretary of Defense. 3 And what you say is that that's perfectly okay. It's up 4 to the Spanish government to assert that that suit 5 should not proceed, and if it doesn't, it's perfectly 6 okay? 7 MR. KNEEDLER: It -- such a suit would not 8 be perfectly okay in -- because, I mean, it would depend on 9 the circumstances. But as was pointed out with respect 10 to the suits against the two Israeli defense ministers, 11 in that circumstance, the Israeli Government said, 12 listen, these two officers were acting on behalf of -13 of the government when they carried -- that's the Dichter 14 case and the -- and the case this Court had from the 15 Second Circuit last term. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I wonder -- I wonder 17 if the example you give or the point you make, that 18 there's no functioning Somali Government, doesn't cut 19 the other way. 20 Let's assume you have somebody who was 21 acting in an official capacity, doing what his job 22 required, whether you like it or not, and then there's 23 a change in the Somali government; and the United States 24 likes the new Somali government. That guy is kind of 25 put out to -- to dry because he can't get anybody to say
55 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 what he maintains is true, which was I was acting 2 pursuant to official policy of the government. 3 MR. KNEEDLER: Well -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the United 5 States is not going to give him the letter he needs 6 because they like the new Somali government. 7 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, under international law 8 the -- the official immunity exists for the benefit of 9 the state, not for the individual. The state can waive 10 that immunity, and the state can determine whether, as 11 happened in the Philippines case, that the -- that the 12 actions being complained of were not -- were not within 13 the official activity. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I take it your answer 15 to Justice Scalia with reference to the indictment 16 against the Secretary of Defense, is that that's not 17 covered by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. And if 18 a state interprets international law to allow the suit, 19 then it goes forward. 20 MR. KNEEDLER: No. If -- if -- if one of 21 our officials was sued in a foreign court, then we would 22 expect the dynamic to play out as -- as I have 23 described, where the United States would take the 24 position, presumably that what was being done was within 25 the scope of official conduct after investigation and
56 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 assert immunity, and expect that to be respected. My 2 only point is that -3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that just goes back to 4 the Tate letter era, where we wait to get an e-mail 5 from the State Department to tell us what to do. 6 MR. KNEEDLER: And the -- this -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought that was the 8 whole purpose of the Federal -- of Foreign Sovereign 9 Immunities Act. 10 MR. KNEEDLER: It -- it was the purpose with 11 respect to foreign sovereigns, but there were good 12 reasons why the court did that, precisely because 13 immunity questions -- as I've said, this case 14 illustrates, to -- to recognize an immunity or not 15 to recognize would -- might favor one faction or another 16 in the ongoing dispute in -- in Somalia. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler -18 MR. KNEEDLER: And so the -- what -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is -- it's now 20 many years, and we still don't -- the State Department 21 has said in effect: We decide. 22 Can you tell the Court, is this defendant 23 amenable to suit or is there an immunity that would 24 cover him? 25 MR. KNEEDLER: We are not addressing that
57 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 here. The court of appeals remanded for consideration 2 of common law head of state and other immunities. 3 Suggestions of immunity traditionally have been tendered 4 to the district court. And the legislative history of 5 the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act shows -- clearly 6 says that the official type immunities -- using the 7 word "official" immunity, head of state immunity, 8 diplomatic immunity, consular immunity -- those things 9 are not addressed by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities 10 Act. 11 Section -- section 1602 shows that Congress 12 wanted to take the Executive away because the government 13 was being pressured by foreign governments with respect 14 to the restrictive theory with respect to commercial 15 activities. And that's where the pressure was being 16 applied, and the Executive Branch wanted to get out of 17 that business, and agreed to. If you read 1602, it 18 specifically refers to commercial activities. 19 There was no such conscious abrogation of 20 the Executive's critical role to make immunity 21 determinations on behalf of officials in the legislative 22 history. And this Court should not strain to read the 23 rigid provisions of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities 24 Act, which were just not tailored to the immunities 25 that the Underhill decision of this Court specifically said
58 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 officials have immunity for their official acts 2 exercising governmental authority. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 4 Mr. Kneedler. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: There were a lot of long 6 sentences in there -7 (Laughter.) 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dvoretzky, 9 because of that, we'll give you 5 minutes. 10 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY 11 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 12 MR. DVORETZKY: I'll try to keep it short. 13 I'd like to make three points: First of 14 all, when a suit is brought against a -- an official or 15 former official, the only question that a court will 16 need to answer under the FSIA is whether the acts 17 challenged are those of the state. That's a 18 determination that courts can readily make and are 19 accustomed to making. By contrast -20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wouldn't that be the 21 same question that you would ask invoking a common law 22 protection like head of state or act of state? Isn't it 23 -- whether it's under the FSIA or under a common law 24 theory -- the identical question? 25 MR. DVORETZKY: It is the same inquiry that
59 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 you would have asked under the common law in inquiring 2 whether the state's immunity extends to its officials. 3 What the FSIA did was it codified that rule, and it took 4 away Executive Branch discretion to deviate from it. If 5 you look at the Solicitor -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that the very 7 point? If the inquiry is the same under the FSIA and 8 under the common law, and we're unsure what Congress 9 intended in the FSIA, because it certainly doesn't 10 explicitly say it covers individual acts, shouldn't we 11 defer to the Executive's decisionmaking in what is -12 has been, for centuries now, within its jurisdiction? 13 Why should we take that power away when the inquiry 14 would be the same under either doctrine? 15 MR. DVORETZKY: First of all, as we argue in 16 our brief, this has not historically been a long-standing 17 power of the Executive in the way that the immunity 18 itself has been recognized under the common law. And 19 what Congress did in 1976 was it codified the substance 20 of the common law but took away that procedure. And 21 this case demonstrates exactly why it's necessary to 22 extend the FSIA to foreign officials in order to -- in 23 order to make the FSIA mean anything at all, and in 24 order to ensure the uniformity and predictability that 25 Congress intended through the statute.

1 If you look at the factors that the 2 Solicitor General proposes to take into account in this 3 case -- I'm looking at page 7 of the Solicitor 4 General's brief -- "Petitioner's residence in the United 5 States rather than Somalia, the nature of the acts 6 alleged," the "invocation of a particular statutory right," 7 the -- the state of the government in Somalia -- these 8 are factors that have no basis in the common law that 9 the FSIA codified. No case has ever held that a foreign 10 official or former official loses immunity for official 11 acts on the basis of these sorts of factors. 12 Moreover -13 JUSTICE BREYER: Why can't you say that if 14 the person, the individual you are suing, is a member of 15 the foreign state, is engaged in the kind of activity that 16 you're complaining about, is subject to the orders of 17 the foreign state, and the relief would affect the 18 foreign state, you are suing the foreign state? 19 But where he was a member of the foreign 20 state, and you want money from him, even though what he 21 did in the past was an act of a foreign state, this 22 lawsuit is not affecting him in his capacity -- is not 23 affecting the foreign state. Indeed, there isn't even 24 one. So in the first set, he falls in the FSIA. In the 25 second set, he doesn't. And you happen to have the
61 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 second set, and, therefore, he may still be immune for 2 what he did in the past, but that would be a different 3 docket. 4 MR. DVORETZKY: All right. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: That -- that's where this 6 is all leading me. 7 MR. DVORETZKY: Because the Restatement -8 what the Restatement, which summarized the common laws as 9 of the time of the FSIA's enactment, says that an 10 official is immune for his acts on behalf of a state if 11 exercising jurisdiction would enforce a rule of law 12 against the foreign state. You enforce a rule of law 13 against a foreign state just as much by threatening to 14 bankrupt an official as soon as he leaves office -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does this case -16 MR. DVORETZKY: -- as you do by issuing -17 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does this very case 19 establish a rule of law for the foreign state? 20 The Act is aimed at torturers. The remedy comes out of 21 the private pocket. How does this establish -- if the 22 thing plays out and the plaintiffs prevail, there 23 will a remedy against an individual actor; there will be 24 no relief awarded against any government. How would it 25 set a rule for the foreign government?
62 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. DVORETZKY: Because enforcing a judgment 2 against a foreign official, threatening to bankrupt the 3 person as soon as he or she leaves office, has just as 4 much effect on the state itself as -- as enforcing a 5 judgment directly against the state. It will force 6 officials to conform their conduct on behalf of -7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Never mind that this 8 person has long lived in the United States, in Virginia. 9 It will have no effect -- will have no effect whatever on 10 the government of Somalia? 11 MR. DVORETZKY: But the -- the rule that the 12 government proposes, and the courts would presumably be 13 left to apply on their own in the many cases like this 14 one and the 9/11 litigation against the Saudis where the 15 government doesn't weigh in, that rule does not draw 16 those neat lines. 17 Why, for example, would we know that a prime 18 minister who comes to visit the United States has not 19 spent enough time here in order to have his official 20 immunity abrogated? 21 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just ask one 22 quick question? Am I correct in understanding that you 23 do not contend that your client was covered by 24 1603(b)(1)? 25 MR. DVORETZKY: 1603(b)(1) is the agency --

Our principal argument is based -10 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's interesting that nobody 11 has talked about that section during the entire argument. 12 MR. DVORETZKY: Our principal argument is 13 based on the text of 1604, which is that in -- that 14 subjecting official acts -15 JUSTICE STEVENS: If they don't qualify 16 under 1603(b)(1), it's kind of hard to get the statute 17 to apply to them at all. 18 MR. DVORETZKY: I respectfully disagree, 19 Your Honor, because 16 (b)(1) defines agencies or 20 instrumentalities. And an official, like an agency or 21 instrumentality, is the means through which the state 22 acts. And, so, if the foreign state include -23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of hard -24 I mean, I assume the reason you don't rely heavily on it 25 -- because it says that an agency or instrumentality is an
64 Alderson Reporting Company

1 entity. I mean, we usually don't think of individuals 2 as being entities. 3 JUSTICE STEVENS: And 1602 applies only to 4 foreign states. 5 MR. DVORETZKY: 1602 applies to states, and 6 our argument is that exercising jurisdiction over the 7 official in the circumstances like these would be 8 exercising jurisdiction over the state. 9 An entity, Your Honor, is not -- is not 10 automatically read to include a person, but it doesn't 11 preclude persons, either, as the Ninth Circuit held in 12 Chuidian. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 14 Counsel. 15 MR.
