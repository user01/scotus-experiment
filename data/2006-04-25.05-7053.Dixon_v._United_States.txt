2 (10:07 a.m.)

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Dixon v. United States.

5 Mr. Jett.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. CRAIG JETT

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8 MR. JETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10 In this case, the parties agree that Federal

11 courts, including this Court, have addressed

12 nonstatutory defenses for almost 200 years and that

13 Congress, in enacting criminal law statutes, legislate

14 against a background of Anglo-Saxon common law, such

15 that a defense of duress was likely contemplated by

16 Congress when it passed the gun control statutes. It

17 is, therefore, required that courts apply defenses,

18 such as the duress defense, based on the background

19 principle of construction that the prosecution must

20 prove criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt.

21 The Government would have this Court discount

22 the development of over 110 years of common law that

23 has produced a substantial, well-established, well-

24 reasoned majority rule in both State and in Federal

25 courts that places the burden on the Government to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 disprove the absence of duress once that defense has

2 been raised by the evidence.

3 The development of the majority rule began

4 with this Court's decision in Davis v. United States in

5 1895.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Jett, do I take it,

7 from what you've just said, that you are recognizing

8 this is a question of Federal common law and not due

9 process, so that if Congress placed the burden on the

10 defendant, there would be no constitutional infirmity?

11 You're just arguing that this is the Federal common

12 law?

13 MR. JETT: Our -- our first issue and our

14 first contention is that Federal common law will govern

15 the decision in this particular case, but we also have

16 a due process point that we also believe is germane.

17 But --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you -- then you

19 think that Congress could not say that the defendant

20 has the burden on the question of duress.

21 MR. JETT: We think that Congress could not

22 under the -- the precedents of this Court and under the

23 -- the basic common law construction that's

24 fundamental, I think, to the -- to the criminal law in

25 this -- in this country.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with

2 Martin against Ohio?

3 MR. JETT: Well, we understand about Martin

4 v. Ohio, Your Honor, and we think that -- that based on

5 recent precedents, Martin v. Ohio should be

6 reconsidered. The -- the significant issue is that

7 duress is based on the fact that there -- that there

8 must be free will, and if free will is dispensed with,

9 in this case by duress, then the -- the defendant

10 doesn't have the requisite criminal intent. And -- and

11 in our -- and since the beginning of -- since before

12 the beginning of common law in -- in our system, it has

13 been recognized that in order to have a criminal -- a

14 crime, there have to be two things: one, a vicious

15 will and the other an act -- an evil act concurrent

16 with the vicious will. And --

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there may be --

18 there may be crimes where duress would vitiate an

19 intent element, but there may be other crimes where it

20 wouldn't. And -- and I don't understand your argument

21 to be -- is it that in every case duress negates an

22 element of the crime or only in some cases?

23 MR. JETT: Well, we think that in -- that in

24 every criminal case, with possibly the exception of --

25 of public welfare cases, that -- that there is an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 underlying background construction for our criminal

2 law, which requires the Government to prove beyond a

3 reasonable doubt criminal intent.

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Which is the easier of the

5 two cases for the defendant? A, the case where the

6 argument is a burden of proof should be on -- on the --

7 the State as a due process matter or a common law

8 matter in an insanity defense and, B, in a duress

9 defense?

10 MR. JETT: Which is easier for the State?

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, either way.

12 MR. JETT: Well, we -- we contend that in a

13 -- a -- duress is -- is different. Insanity deals with

14 really the internal workings of somebody's mind, so

15 that's perhaps more difficult for the State. But in a

16 -- in a duress case, you're dealing not only with the

17 internal workings but also external factors as well --

18 as well that impose somebody else's will upon the

19 defendant.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would think that it's

21 easier in -- you know, we had -- we had a -- this term

22 another case in which the argument is that you cannot

23 have a separate insanity defense essentially and -- and

24 exclude from the mens rea element of a crime the -- the

25 lack of -- of mental capacity to -- to have that mens

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 rea. This is the same thing you're arguing before us.

2 And -- and it seems to me that if it applies to

3 duress, it applies even -- even more strongly to -- to

4 insanity. How can an insane person form the intent to

5 commit a crime that -- that requires mens rea?

6 MR. JETT: Well, we -- we agree that -- I

7 agree -- we agree that an insane person cannot form

8 that particular intent. We think that they are similar

9 except that the duress case is perhaps easier for the

10 -- for the defense because we have external factors

11 that often bear on what the defense is unlike --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but we've held, at

13 least under the M'Naghten version of the defense, that

14 the State -- that the burden can be put on the

15 defendant to show that he was not insane under the

16 M'Naghten test.

17 MR. JETT: Well, we -- and we understand

18 that, and again, our --

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And as Justice Scalia said

20 and as I was considering in asking my question, in your

21 case we know that there was a conscious, knowing and

22 intentional, in some sense, act when -- when the person

23 bought -- bought the weapons. She says the intent, of

24 course, was induced by -- by the threat. It seems to

25 me you have a more difficult case than in the insanity

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 case.

2 MR. JETT: Well, our -- our -- we think that

3 they're -- that they're similar because both deal with

4 -- with the mental state, and -- and then historically,

5 at least since -- since 1895 in this Court, this Court

6 has said that you've got to have the vicious will in

7 order to constitute a crime. And so you have the same

8 issue here. Did Mrs. Dixon have the vicious will or

9 was she acting under the will of someone else?

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but doesn't vicious

11 will mean simply the will to commit the crime?

12 MR. JETT: Actually, no. It means the -- the

13 criminal intent, not just to commit the crime but

14 having the criminal intent, the vicious mind, to

15 violate the law. Mrs. Dixon's --

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what do you mean by

17 vicious? I mean, that the person is -- is nasty, that

18 the person is antisocial or asocial?

19 MR. JETT: No.

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know what the added

21 element is.

22 MR. JETT: The -- this -- this Court has --

23 has frequently equated the vicious will with moral

24 blameworthiness, that is, the desire to do wrong, that

25 is, the desire to do something -- to -- the free desire

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 based on the -- the choice of having -- being able to

2 do the right thing or do the wrong thing and freely

3 choosing to do the wrong thing, that is, moral

4 blameworthiness.

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The phrase Justice Harlan

6 used in the Davis case.

7 MR. JETT: Yes, Your Honor.

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: But when you -- when you say

9 freely choosing, what you mean, I take it, is choosing

10 with -- without consideration of pressure from a third

11 party. That's what you mean, isn't it?

12 MR. JETT: That's correct.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

14 MR. JETT: Yes, Your Honor.

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if the -- the third --

16 the third party may, indeed, exert pressure, but I take

17 it you would agree that it is still the decision of the

18 defendant whether to cave in to that pressure or not,

19 whether to commit the crime or not to commit the crime.

20 MR. JETT: We believe that would not be a

21 voluntary act. Certainly the defendant makes that

22 decision.

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I -- I don't want to

24 get lost in -- in rhetoric here. Isn't it still the

25 case, even on your theory, that the defendant in these

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 circumstances makes a choice? It may be a troubled

2 choice, a much more difficult choice to make than it

3 would be otherwise, but the defendant still makes a

4 choice as to whether to cave in to the third party's

5 pressure or not, whether to commit the crime or not.

6 Isn't that true even on your theory?

7 MR. JETT: Yes, it is true.

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

9 MR. JETT: But the difference is, as you

10 pointed out, Justice Souter, that the defendant is not

11 acting of her own free will. She's -- she's acting

12 based on the will of someone else, that that person has

13 overborne her will.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: It was her will to yield to

15 the will of someone else. I mean, you can't blame

16 somebody else for her making the choice.

17 MR. JETT: Well, we -- we would respectfully

18 disagree, Judge. She believed that there was

19 figuratively a gun at the head of her children, and if

20 somebody puts a gun to the head of my child, you can

21 make me do almost anything that you want.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: That may be a very

23 intelligent choice on your part to do what the person

24 with the gun at the head of your children tells you to

25 do. But to say that it's not your choice, which is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 what you're arguing here, the only question is whether

2 that has to be brought forward by reason of -- of a

3 defense of -- of coercion or rather, whether it goes to

4 whether you had the intent. That's all we're talking

5 about here. And it seems to me you have the intent to

6 yield to -- to the demand of whoever has the gun at the

7 head of your children. It's a separate question

8 whether the law should punish your yielding like that.

9 MR. JETT: Well --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you're telling us

11 that you don't have the intent to -- to yield and --

12 and to do whatever criminal act that person tells you.

13 Right? That just doesn't -- I just don't think it's

14 true.

15 MR. JETT: What -- what we're saying and what

16 I think that this Court -- the precedents of this Court

17 have said is that you have to have criminal intent.

18 That is the vicious will that -- that the Court --

19 Justice Harlan talked about in Davis and this Court has

20 talked about in Morissette.

21 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is the statutory

22 -- what is the mens rea under the statute for the

23 offenses that the defendant was charged with? It's

24 knowingly, isn't it?

25 MR. JETT: Well, on -- on seven or eight of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the counts, it's knowingly. Well, actually on the

2 first count it's knowingly, but that is defined as --

3 as -- in this case, it was defined as voluntarily and

4 intentionally. And then in the other counts, it was

5 simply defined as knowingly. And so, indeed, that --

6 that's -- that is what the Congress said.

7 However, based on the -- the precedents of

8 this Court, that even when there is a knowingly

9 culpable mental state provided by Congress, this Court

10 has impart -- imported the -- the criminal intent to --

11 into the statute. And so like in -- for instance, in

12 Morissette, which was a theft case, what this Court did

13 was the Congress had said knowingly didn't provide a --

14 a criminal intent. So this Court imported one and said

15 that the Court -- that the Government had to prove that

16 beyond a reasonable doubt. Once the defense was

17 raised, it became an element that the Government has to

18 prove beyond a reasonable doubt.

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, counsel, under

20 your view, how -- how is the Government supposed to

21 prove a negative in every case? How are they supposed

22 to prove the absence of duress?

23 MR. JETT: It's really no different than any

24 other case, Mr. Chief Justice. In -- in any case, for

25 instance, a self-defense case, the Government has got

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to prove that -- disprove self-defense beyond a

2 reasonable doubt once it's raised. They do it in the

3 same way they do in the other case.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's something

5 that -- but self-defense is something that's often a --

6 a factual element that you can discern from the

7 circumstances of the crime. The -- the other guy had a

8 gun, you know, that sort of thing. So if it's going to

9 be presented -- so it's something that's within the

10 control of either side.

11 Duress is something that in this case the

12 Government would have no reason to suppose that it was

13 even implicated until it's raised, and then they have

14 no way of getting at what the particulars are because

15 they're all within the control of the defendant.

16 MR. JETT: Well, we -- we would respectfully

17 disagree with that. And this case is a very good

18 example of -- of that -- of that circumstance. The

19 Government -- early on in this case, they searched Mrs.

20 Dixon's apartment and found evidence. They -- they

21 interviewed her. They actually interviewed the abusers

22 prior to trial before we gave them notice. They --

23 they were able to investigate her background partially

24 before we gave notice, partially afterwards, so that

25 they were able to -- to investigate her and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 circumstances of her life. But not only that, they

2 were able to call as witnesses the seven gun dealers

3 from which the guns were purchased who witnessed the

4 purchase and who did provide testimony that she did not

5 appear to be under duress, and they so testified.

6 So in this particular case, it's really just

7 like any other cases. You can certainly imagine a

8 circumstance where that would be hard, but in very many

9 cases, the facts are there just like a self-defense

10 case or, for that matter, just like --

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought the

12 gist of her duress defense was not that she was under

13 duress when she was purchasing the guns, but that she

14 had reason to believe that her children were being

15 threatened by accomplices or associates of -- of this

16 -- this individual. And there's nothing in the facts

17 of the -- the scene that would lead the Government to

18 have any access to that evidence.

19 MR. JETT: Well, what -- what she was in

20 duress about is she was told at the time that there was

21 somebody at home with a gun who was just a cell phone

22 call away. So as far as she was concerned, there was

23 somebody there with a gun to the head of her children

24 and she was in fear of her children's life.

25 In terms of what -- what the Government knew

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in this particular case, the Government had notice.

2 The trial judge required that we provide notice of a

3 defense. The trial judge required that if we -- said

4 that if we had an expert, we had to give the Government

5 notice of the expert and the subject matter of the

6 testimony of the expert. So the Government was very

7 well informed prior to trial what the defense was so

8 that they hired their own expert who actually was able

9 to interview the -- the accused without me being there

10 and -- and so was prepared to testify about the issues

11 of duress.

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what is the

13 threshold test that the defendant has to cross before

14 the judge will give the instruction to the jury?

15 Obviously, the burden of production is with the

16 defendant. When can a judge say, well, you know, this

17 -- this is just too flimsy for a duress defense? I'm

18 not going to instruct a jury on that.

19 MR. JETT: Well, the -- the first thing the

20 judge would have to determine is that has -- has there

21 been evidence of each of the elements of duress, and

22 the trial judge found that we -- we've produced evidence

23 of each of the elements of the duress.

24 The -- in -- in the circuit court cases,

25 they've not been consistent, but we would -- we would

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 suggest that the -- the standard would be that there

2 would be sufficient evidence, when viewed in the light

3 most favorable to the defendant, that would raise a

4 reasonable doubt with a rationale jury, sort of the --

5 the other side of -- of the prosecution's burden that

6 they have to reach in order to get to the jury.

7 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the -- the

8 methodology that you think we should follow in

9 determining where the burden should be allocated under

10 any particular criminal statute? Is it the -- the

11 majority rule at the time when that particular statute

12 was enacted or at -- is it -- you don't think it's the

13 -- the old common law rule. What -- what is the -- at

14 what point of time do we look at the -- at what's going

15 on throughout our country?

16 MR. JETT: Well, I think you've got to look

17 at two points in time. And certainly we agree. We

18 don't look at the old common law because -- because

19 there's been 110 years of -- of development of common

20 law in this country since Davis v. United States. So I

21 think the Court has got to look at -- at what the

22 common law was at the time that the relevant statute

23 was passed, which in this case was 1968.

24 But I think in addition to that, there --

25 there have been amendments to the statute.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE ALITO: So the burden would be

2 different under different statutes?

3 MR. JETT: Well --

4 JUSTICE ALITO: If we were dealing with a --

5 with a much older criminal statute, the burden might be

6 allocated differently?

7 MR. JETT: No, because I think the -- I think

8 you have to consider that. But the other thing you'd

9 have to consider is the development of the common law

10 since that time and what -- what courts have done, what

11 the rationale has been that they have employed over

12 time.

13 And in this particular case, for instance, we

14 have -- we have six Federal circuits and 29 States who

15 have found that the burden of proof -- the burden of

16 production should be on the defendant, but the burden

17 of persuasion should be on -- on the Government to

18 disprove duress once it's raised.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you have 21 States and

20 how many circuits --

21 MR. JETT: Six circuits and 29 States,

22 Justice Scalia.

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I'm saying how many are

24 on the other side?

25 MR. JETT: On the other side of the circuits,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 we count three; on the States, we count 14. Some

2 States have not addressed the issue.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's -- that's sort

4 of a horse race. I'm -- I'm not sure, even if I agreed

5 with your theory, that -- that what the Constitution

6 requires changes on the basis of an evolving common

7 law.

8 Of course, it can only change in one

9 direction. Right? It can only change favorably to --

10 to your client, favorably to the defendant. It can't

11 change to be more harsh to the defendant because the

12 Constitution prohibits that.

13 MR. JETT: We would agree --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right? So -- so we have a

15 one-way -- a one-way altering Constitution.

16 MR. JETT: Well --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: But even -- even if I agreed

18 with that, I'm not sure that, you know, 21 versus 14 is

19 -- is an overwhelming demonstration of -- of the new

20 common law.

21 MR. JETT: But, Justice Scalia, it's 29

22 versus 14. And -- but it's --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: 29 versus 14.

24 MR. JETT: But it's clearly a 2 to 1 majority

25 in favor of placing the burden of persuasion on the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Government.

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But are you making

3 the argument that this number indicates a congressional

4 intent and that what we ought to do is come up with a

5 rule because Congress intended it? Or are you making

6 the argument that yours is the better rule, and as a

7 matter of common law, which -- which it is our

8 responsibility to develop, we should see it your way?

9 Which argument are you making?

10 MR. JETT: We're -- we're basing our argument

11 primarily on -- on the common law that has been

12 developed in -- in this country since really Davis v.

13 United States through the present and has -- has --

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Jett, there's one

15 piece of this picture that's different -- that

16 distinguishes duress from, say, self-defense. If it's

17 self-defense, you take a snapshot on the scene. You

18 know exactly what happened. No one taking a picture of

19 these gun purchases would have any idea of all of this.

20 And the judge, when asked to give -- to allow

21 the defense of duress, said, it's frankly a close call

22 in my mind, but when it is a close call, better give it

23 than not.

24 Now, he thought that the defendant would have

25 the burden of proof. Perhaps the judge would call that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 close question the other way if he thought he was

2 saddling the prosecution with the ultimate burden of

3 persuasion.

4 MR. JETT: In my mind it would be -- if it's

5 a close question, I don't think the burden of proof in

6 that particular circumstance would make a difference

7 because it still is -- because he would then be taking

8 it away from the jury. And in my experience, judges

9 are -- are not want to take the questions away from the

10 jury, and they will provide the -- the jury instruction

11 in a close case. And that would be the right thing to

12 do because ultimately we want the jury to make that

13 decision.

14 But the -- but the judge does have a

15 gatekeeping function in -- in a duress defense, so that

16 a judge -- in any circumstance, if the judge decided

17 that the evidence was insufficient to get to the jury,

18 the judge can make that determination so that you have

19 the trial court acting with the -- the -- to make sure

20 that what the jury is going to hear is -- is an issue

21 for which there is evidence. So I think that the

22 gatekeeping function that the trial court would --

23 would prevent there from being -- juries making a

24 decision on insufficient facts.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Jett, a thought occurred

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to me, by reason of your agreement, that -- that it's a

2 one-way ratchet, that when the common law changes in

3 the -- in the direction of favoring the defendant, it

4 becomes the duty of the courts to allow that. But, of

5 course, it can't change in the other direction because

6 the Constitution would prevent it. You sort of agreed

7 with that.

8 But -- but if -- if you agree with that, how

9 can you explain our -- our 1895 decision in Davis which

10 held that the insanity defense had to be proved by the

11 Government which was then overridden by a Federal

12 statute. How could -- how could -- if -- if Davis was

13 right about what the -- what the common law required,

14 how could Congress possibly have changed that by a

15 statute? I would assume that all of the basic elements

16 of the common law are picked up in the Due Process

17 Clause. Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't the necessity of

18 -- of proving the mental element of a -- of a crime,

19 even when that mental element is overcome by insanity,

20 why wouldn't that have been embodied in the Due Process

21 Clause so that the congressional statute would have

22 been ineffective?

23 MR. JETT: Well, two reasons. One, Davis was

24 a common law case, and -- and subsequently in Leland v.

25 Oregon, this Court said Davis was a common law case.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And so this Court can decide the common law issue with

2 respect to the Constitution.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I'm not questioning

4 whether we could do it. I'm questioning whether

5 Congress could do it, whether Congress could overrule

6 what we did in Davis. If Davis said that common law

7 was that the Government has to prove -- disprove

8 insanity, wouldn't that have been part -- become part

9 of the Due Process Clause if it was the common law?

10 MR. JETT: I think -- I think that if it --

11 if it does become part of the Due Process, then

12 obviously Congress cannot overrule it.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

14 MR. JETT: If it simply becomes the common

15 law -- the rule of -- of the Federal courts that this

16 Court has -- has established based on its supervisory

17 powers, then the Congress would be able to do that.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it makes me suspect

19 that Davis was wrong.

20 MR. JETT: Well, the thing about Davis that

21 even though the -- the insanity holding about Davis was

22 overruled, the core holdings of Davis was not

23 overruled. And one of the things that Davis said was

24 that, again, to constitute a crime against human laws,

25 there must be the vicious will and, secondly, the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 unlawful act.

2 The other thing that Davis said, which was

3 very significant, is that the plea of not guilty is not

4 like in a civil case where there's confession and

5 avoidance. What it does is it negates or it

6 controverts all of the allegations of -- of the State,

7 and so that it controverts the existence of each fact

8 that the State has to prove. If it -- if it, indeed,

9 does that and what duress does is it negates the evil

10 -- the evil intent, then -- then the Government has got

11 to prove that there's criminal intent. It's got to

12 negate one of the elements that the Government has got

13 to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. And that's -- that

14 -- that's part of the holding of Davis, and the

15 Congress has not affected that with its decision on the

16 insanity defense.

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, if -- if you

18 know, whether Congress has ever been asked to address

19 this precise issue that we're debating today?

20 MR. JETT: Congress has -- has never ruled on

21 the duress defense. I think a few years ago, there --

22 there was a proposal to -- to amend the Federal

23 Criminal Code, and in that particular -- it didn't pass

24 but I think the result of that was that Congress just

25 took out the duress provision and said that the courts

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 should make the decision as to how that would be

2 handled based on -- on all the -- the normal

3 considerations that a court looks at in making those

4 decisions.

5 So that the Congress has had many

6 opportunities to rule on duress. The Congress -- just

7 like the Congress has said you have to have notice of

8 alibi and just like they passed the -- this -- the rule

9 about -- I mean, the statute about insanity. The

10 Congress could have -- have abolished the duress

11 defense. I don't think they could have

12 constitutionally, but they could have passed a statute

13 and spoken to that, but they've chosen not to. And I

14 think what that tells us is that the Congress is

15 probably aware of the common law and have chosen not to

16 interfere with the development of the common law in

17 this country.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about a defense

19 that I was on drugs and -- and didn't know what I was

20 doing because of that and couldn't form the requisite

21 intent? Does the Government have to disprove that as

22 well?

23 MR. JETT: If that is a defense that is

24 recognized by -- by the common law or -- or by statute,

25 then the Government would have to do that if that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 particular defense --

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the Government

3 -- how would the Government do that?

4 MR. JETT: Well --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A person just says, I

6 was -- I was on, you know, PCP or whatever and -- and I

7 couldn't form the requisite intent.

8 MR. JETT: Well, the Government could do that

9 much the way they do like in an entrapment defense. In

10 an entrapment defense, the Government has to -- once

11 there's entrapment shown, the Government has to

12 disprove the predisposition of the defendant or prove

13 the defendant has predisposition. And so --

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's based on the

15 defendant's -- the prosecution's conduct. The

16 Government's conduct in entrapment concerns how the

17 Government behaved.

18 MR. JETT: Justice Ginsburg, it does but it

19 still -- that case still deals with somebody overriding

20 the will of the defendant, the Government imposing its

21 own will on the defendant. In that regard --

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the Government is

23 out there trying to achieve that result, it's quite

24 different from the Government having nothing to do --

25 MR. JETT: Well, we -- we contend that it's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 still the same because it's a third party, whether it's

2 the Government or somebody else, who's overbearing the

3 will of the accused.

4 And if there's no other questions, I'd like

5 to reserve the balance of my time.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

7 Mr. Gornstein.

8 ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN

9 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10 MR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11 please the Court:

12 For three reasons, the burden of proving

13 duress should be on the defendant, and the Government

14 should not be required to disprove duress beyond a

15 reasonable doubt.

16 First, duress is an affirmative defense that

17 excuses what would otherwise be serious criminal

18 conduct. When the Government proves that a defendant

19 has engaged in criminal conduct and has done so with

20 the mens rea specified by the crime, it is fair to

21 require the defendant to prove that duress excuses that

22 criminal conduct, so that here, the Government proved

23 that Petitioner knew she was lying when she filled out

24 the forms and that she knew it was unlawful for her to

25 receive firearms.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there may be cases

2 where the nature of the mens rea required would require

3 the Government to disprove duress.

4 MR. GORNSTEIN: There could conceivably be

5 such cases, Mr. Chief Justice.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The sort of crimes

7 where -- where your culpability depends on your motive.

8 Right?

9 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, if you had a crime, for

10 example, that said someone who does something while not

11 under -- acting under duress, that would be an obvious

12 example. But there are --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would be an easy

14 example.

15 MR. GORNSTEIN: It would be an easy example.

16 (Laughter.)

17 MR. GORNSTEIN: But there -- there are --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Good catch.

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about a -- you

20 know, a hate crime, a bias crime, you know, an act of

21 violence done with a particular motive or intent? And

22 the -- and the suggestion is I didn't do this because

23 of a particular motive. I did this because they had a

24 gun to the head of my children.

25 MR. GORNSTEIN: Right. In -- in that kind of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 situation, the facts that go to duress could also go to

2 undermining the proof of the motive in that case, and

3 in that situation, the Government always has to prove

4 the element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

5 But if the defendant wants to add to that a duress -- a

6 specific duress defense, then the burden of proof would

7 be on the defendant to prove duress. Now, normally in

8 that --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Government wouldn't --

10 wouldn't have to disprove duress in the hate case. It

11 would just have to prove hate.

12 MR. GORNSTEIN: Correct.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: And to the extent that

14 duress undermines that, it would be a defense

15 considered by the jury on the hate question.

16 MR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct, Justice

17 Scalia.

18 Now, the --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: How does self-defense fit

20 into this equation?

21 MR. GORNSTEIN: The Government's position is

22 that on self-defense, the burden of proof is on the

23 defendant, but it recognizes that there are important

24 distinctions between self-defense and duress that could

25 allow the court to reach different conclusions about

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the two defenses.

2 In addition to the point that's already been

3 made about the degree of factual overlap between self-

4 defense on the one hand and duress on the other on the

5 basic crime, there are three additional considerations.

6 One is that the -- the circuits and the

7 States are virtually uniform on self-defense, whereas

8 there is a significant division of authority on the

9 question of duress.

10 Second, self-defense has always been a more

11 favored defense because when the defendant acts

12 legitimately in self-defense, he's not harming an

13 innocent person. But when a defendant is actually

14 under -- acting under duress, that defendant is still

15 endangering or harming innocent third parties.

16 And the third reason is that there's always

17 been a significant degree of judicial skepticism about

18 claims of duress, but there's never been that same kind

19 of judicial skepticism about self-defense.

20 So while we do take the position that the

21 burden of proof is still on the defendant, the Court

22 could take a different view on that issue and agree

23 with us on duress.

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why is the number of

25 decisions -- number of States that have gone one way or --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 or the other on the issue relevant? If it's not an Eighth

2 Amendment question --

3 MR. GORNSTEIN: No. I -- I think it's just a

4 Federal common law question here, and it's only as good

5 as the reasoning that underlies it. But when you start

6 to see a uniform body or a consensus of opinion on one

7 side of the equation, then there -- it's much more

8 likely that there are certain reasons that are

9 underlying that justify it.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what if you're a

11 judge like me who -- who thinks that any significant

12 element of -- of the criminal law, when the Due Process

13 Clause was -- was adopted, remains in effect and it

14 doesn't change with the times as you seem -- as your

15 last comment seems to have said? What do I do with a

16 case like Davis? Not a case like. What do I do with

17 Davis? Davis tells me that this was the common law

18 when the Due Process Clause was adopted.

19 MR. GORNSTEIN: No, I don't think Davis was

20 taking the position --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: No?

22 MR. GORNSTEIN: -- that this was the common

23 law when the Due Process Clause was adopted. Davis

24 took the position that the common law had evolved to

25 the point where on the specific defense of insanity,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that this was the result that should follow, that there

2 should be a burden of production on the defendant, and

3 then the Government should have to disprove insanity

4 beyond a reasonable doubt. But Davis was not a

5 constitutional holding.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I know it was not a

7 constitutional holding, but --

8 MR. GORNSTEIN: And it wasn't a holding about

9 what --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'll have to go back and

11 look at it.

12 MR. GORNSTEIN: -- the early common law was

13 --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

15 MR. GORNSTEIN: -- because it's clear that

16 under -- at the time of the Constitution, the burden of

17 proof on all of these defenses was on the defendant.

18 And that was also true at the time the Fourteenth

19 Amendment was adopted. The burden of proof was on the

20 defendant. There was some evolution after that.

21 Now, the -- the other thing I wanted to talk

22 about with respect to Davis is it was based on the

23 understanding that the Court had about the relationship

24 between the insanity defense on the one hand and the

25 mens rea element of the crime on the other hand. And

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 here, there's simply no corresponding overlap. Whether

2 or not the Petitioner acted under duress, she knew she

3 was lying when she filled out the forms, and she knew

4 it was unlawful for her to purchase firearms. So

5 there's simply no relationship between the duress

6 defense and the mens rea element of these crimes.

7 Congress has also overruled Davis by statute,

8 and we don't think it would be appropriate for the

9 Court to extend Davis to a new defense when Congress

10 has rejected it with respect to the only defense that

11 it applied to. And -- and there's -- and certainly

12 Congress acted constitutionally in overruling the Davis

13 decision under this Court's decision in Leland and in

14 other cases like Martin and Patterson, which say that

15 there is no constitutional problem in putting the

16 burden of proof on the defendant for established common

17 law affirmative defenses. And --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- is -- I didn't mean to

19 cut you off.

20 MR. GORNSTEIN: No.

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: I was -- you have a tougher

22 argument, don't you, when you -- when you face the

23 comparison between duress here and entrapment because

24 it's -- it's quite true in -- in entrapment you're

25 talking about the actions of a -- of a third party

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 which is causing something, but the -- the ultimate

2 determination that has to be made is a determination

3 about the -- in effect, the -- the inclination, the

4 willingness, the readiness of the defendant to have

5 committed the act. And -- and yet, I take it, it's --

6 it's assumed that so far as the entrapment defense is

7 concerned, the burden is on the Government. So if the

8 burden is on the Government in what is a -- a somewhat

9 difficult issue for the Government to carry the burden

10 on in entrapment, wouldn't coherence suggest that a

11 fortiori it ought to be on -- on duress?

12 MR. GORNSTEIN: No, and here's the reason.

13 The -- the burden of proof on entrapment is actually on

14 the defendant initially.

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the burden of going

16 forward with evidence.

17 MR. GORNSTEIN: No. The burden of proof on

18 the element of inducement. That is, there are two

19 elements.

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: You mean the burden of

21 persuasion.

22 MR. GORNSTEIN: Burden of persuasion on the

23 element of inducement is on the defendant. The

24 defendant has to prove more likely than not that the

25 Government induced this crime in the sense that it took

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 actions that are likely to override what a innocent

2 person would have done. At that point, the burden

3 shifts to the Government to show that this particular

4 defendant was predisposed.

5 Now, that's consistent with background common

6 law principles under which, once it's shown that one

7 party has been engaging in wrongful conduct, i.e.,

8 inducement, then the burden shifts to the wrongdoer to

9 show that its conduct did not have its likely effect in

10 that case. And that's why the Government then has to

11 come back and show that with respect to this particular

12 individual, that particular individual was predisposed,

13 even though we took wrongful actions that would have

14 induced an innocent person to do this.

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You could almost argue that

16 the other way. I mean, it -- it seems to me on

17 predisposition that the defendant knows more about it

18 than the Government does.

19 MR. GORNSTEIN: That -- that's true, but

20 again, if it was just a matter of who has access to the

21 relevant evidence, then that would -- the burden should

22 have been on the defendant, that it wasn't just a

23 matter of that. There was this other principle which

24 is that the -- there was already a showing -- there's

25 already a showing that the Government has taken

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 wrongful action to induce the crime. And that's why

2 the burden shifts to the defendant -- to the Government

3 to show that this particular person wasn't predisposed.

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure what the

5 criteria are that I have to follow -- that we have to

6 follow in deciding the case. Just count up all the

7 cases and --

8 MR. GORNSTEIN: No, I don't think that the

9 Court --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask -- let me ask

11 you this. Is -- is there any evidence that -- that we

12 can take account of, commentary, law reviews, to show

13 that the Government has difficulties in -- in meeting a

14 duress defense?

15 MR. GORNSTEIN: It -- there is nothing that I

16 can point you to that shows there is an empirically

17 evidence that the Government is not going to be able to

18 deal with this burden.

19 But what I would say to you is that you

20 should take the same approach that the Court took in

21 The Diana case many years ago, which is it did not want

22 to establish a regime that invites manufactured claims.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why is this worse in

24 that respect? And lots of things in the case that you

25 have to prove may be hard to prove because it requires

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 finding out what someone said to the defendant over the

2 telephone, what happened 4 years ago in a room where

3 the defendant was the only one now alive present.

4 There are lots of cases like that.

5 Traditionally in the law, I take it, it's

6 been that most instances where the defendant excuses

7 his conduct on the ground he wasn't morally culpable,

8 mistake, accident, self-defense. Entrapment? Not --

9 that's a different kind of ground. This one? Evidence

10 mixed.

11 But you have to prove lots of things where

12 it's really in the hands of the defendant, and the

13 defendant saying I'm so innocent because I'm not

14 morally culpable. I was asleep. I was -- you know, we

15 can imagine. So I don't see why this is different.

16 MR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Breyer --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: And that's going back to

18 Justice Kennedy's question. I would look -- I guess if

19 we're supposed to get the better rule, the first place

20 I'd look is what did the Model Penal Code think. They

21 think you should have the burden.

22 Then I think has this turned into a practical

23 problem in the 29 States that have had it for 20 to 40

24 years. And you say we don't have any evidence to that

25 effect.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Now, I've listed about four things here that

2 I'd like your response to.

3 MR. GORNSTEIN: Let -- let me start with -- I

4 go back to The Diana case because I think the way the

5 Court approached the question in The Diana case is the

6 way this Court should approach it because it dealt with

7 the same kind of defense, necessity. And what it

8 wanted -- it said this is a defense where there is a

9 there is a big danger that this can be manufactured in

10 a way that it is difficult to disprove, and we are

11 going to establish a regime that doesn't invite

12 manufactured claims and that doesn't make it difficult

13 for the Government to disprove something beyond a

14 reasonable doubt. We have a choice here, and that's

15 not the regime we want to establish. We want to

16 establish a regime that makes it more unlikely that

17 manufactured claims are going to come forward and that

18 make it -- makes it more unlikely that if such claims

19 do come forward, the Government isn't going to be able

20 -- unable to disprove them beyond a reasonable doubt,

21 compromising the entire statutory scheme.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: But if we're thinking of

23 things logically, logically you're right. I can see

24 that this is in the hands of the defendant. But I've

25 wondered why hasn't this turned into evidence of a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 problem in the 29 States. And the following occurred

2 to me, which I'll put to you to see what your reaction

3 is.

4 The defense has to do something if they are

5 going to put duress in issue. They have to get the

6 defendant to testify. So the prosecutor has something

7 that the prosecutor doesn't ordinarily get. He has

8 that defendant right on the stand, ready for jury

9 evaluation. And that is something a -- a prosecutor

10 may want, and it's something the defense lawyer may not

11 want. He has to choose.

12 MR. GORNSTEIN: But --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: So when you get into the

14 practicalities of it, I see things both ways, and I'd

15 like to find some evidence of what's actually happened.

16 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, take a recent case in

17 which a defendant transported drugs from Mexico into

18 the United States, and he claimed that he did that

19 because someone threatened his family members in

20 Mexico. Now, that's a case that somebody who has

21 deliberately violated the law would find relatively

22 easy to manufacture that defense. Yet, it would be

23 very difficult for the Government to disprove that

24 beyond a reasonable doubt.

25 Yes, but if the burden of proof is on the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 defendant, then the Government can do what you were

2 talking about. It can cross-examine that person and it

3 can persuade the jury --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: If -- if does that --

5 MR. GORNSTEIN: If he does that --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: He has a few other things,

7 the prosecutor. He has that defendant on the stand.

8 There was an implication that you were in Chicago at

9 the time.

10 MR. GORNSTEIN: If --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: Where you on the night of

12 such and such?

13 MR. GORNSTEIN: There are -- there are other

14 --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: And that's an advantage for

16 the prosecutor.

17 MR. GORNSTEIN: That's true, Justice Breyer,

18 but what I'm saying is, that it's one thing to be able

19 to persuade the jury through cross-examination, that

20 that is more -- not more likely than not. It's quite

21 another thing to persuade the jury in that kind of

22 situation that that defense is not true beyond a

23 reasonable doubt.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, in the vast

25 majority of criminal cases, there's no doubt that the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1 person did the crime. And so the -- the benefit to the

2 Government is just carrying coals to Newcastle. The --

3 the defendant would plead guilty but for the fact that

4 he has a plausible coercion defense, and so he puts

5 that coercion defense before the jury, and oh, sure, he

6 does let the -- the Government cross-examine him. But

7 the Government really doesn't need his cross-

8 examination in the ordinary case. Isn't that right?

9 MR. GORNSTEIN: In the ordinary case.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I -- I guess the only

11 way we could really tell what the consequences are, as

12 Justice Breyer would -- would like us to be able to

13 tell, is to know how many people who have gotten off on

14 the basis of this defense have gone on to continue a

15 life of crime. And -- and we don't have any stats on

16 that --

17 MR. GORNSTEIN: We do not have any

18 statistics. And, of course, when -- when somebody gets

19 off, it results in -- in an acquittal and so we don't

20 get published decisions about that.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: We never know the

22 consequences of our decisions, by and large, do we?

23 (Laughter.)

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's why this is

25 problematic.

1 MR. GORNSTEIN: I'm not sure I'll answer

2 that.

3 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I don't have the

4 experience as a criminal lawyer that allows me to say

5 whether it would be one way or the other. You're

6 saying -- and I'll repeat that. Is there anything at

7 all I could look to try to figure this out? Because I

8 think it is a question we're supposed to get the better

9 rule.

10 What did the Model Penal Code authors do?

11 Did they take testimony --

12 MR. GORNSTEIN: The -- the Model Penal Code

13 takes the position that every defense, affirmative

14 defense, goes on the Government, and that's just a

15 policy judgment --

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: Did they have evidence or

18 did they have -- take testimony? Did they go around

19 trying to find out how prosecutors and defense

20 attorneys -- you know. I don't know.

21 MR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Breyer, I do not

22 know. I do know it is based in -- in its explanation

23 of its rule for all affirmative defenses, which would

24 include insanity, which Congress has rejected --

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Doesn't that come from an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 underlying principle that your position is not entirely

2 consistent with, that is, that the defendant is

3 presumed innocent? So it's not as Justice Scalia may

4 have suggested that, well, he would plead guilty, but

5 we're going to let him -- we presume that the defendant

6 is innocent. That's why the prosecutor has to have the

7 burden on all issues. I thought that was the

8 underlying principle.

9 MR. GORNSTEIN: The -- the burden of -- the

10 presumption of innocence, though, only applies to the

11 essential elements of the crime under this Court's

12 decision in In re Winship, et cetera, and not -- it

13 doesn't apply to affirmative defenses, as the Court has

14 consistently held in Martin and in Patterson and in

15 Leland. That is, the -- it can be constitutionally --

16 you can put the burden of proof on the defendant to

17 prove an affirmative defense, and the Constitution has

18 nothing to say about that. The presumption of

19 innocence goes to all the things -- the essential

20 elements of the crime.

21 And here, Petitioner benefited from the

22 presumption of innocence. The Government had to prove

23 that she filled out those forms, that she filled them

24 out with falsities, and that she knew she was lying

25 when she filled out that -- those forms. It had to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 prove that she received those guns and that she knew

2 that it was unlawful for her to receive those guns.

3 And it had to prove all of those things beyond a

4 reasonable doubt.

5 Now, on the position of the States, a

6 significant number of States are on --

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before you get there,

8 what -- roughly speaking, how much of the Model Penal

9 Code has Congress enacted into the criminal --

10 MR. GORNSTEIN: I don't think the Congress

11 has enacted the -- the Model Penal Code. This -- this

12 Court sometimes looks to the Model Penal Code as one

13 source of what is -- of -- of thought out there, but

14 that's all.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Who -- who develops the

16 Model Penal Code? Is that the American Law Institute

17 that does that?

18 MR. GORNSTEIN: Yes. Yes.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which once upon a time

20 purported to simply be embodying the -- the general

21 law, the common law. But it doesn't even purport to do

22 that anymore.

23 MR. GORNSTEIN: No. It doesn't -- it doesn't

24 purport it. And in fact, in this particular case --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: There are a lot of law

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 professors involved in it, aren't there?

2 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, I'm sure.

3 (Laughter.)

4 MR. GORNSTEIN: In this particular case the

5 Model --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Some judges too.

7 Right?

8 MR. GORNSTEIN: -- the Model Penal Code said

9 that it was expanding the common law defense of duress

10 to a new place where it had never been. So it's not

11 surprising that it would also have a different burden

12 of persuasion than the traditional burden of

13 persuasion.

14 Now, on -- on the practice of the States, the

15 Court has never taken the view that it is just going to

16 do a nose count and figure out what the best rule is

17 based on the practice of the States.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When was this -- the

19 underlying statute at issue here enacted?

20 MR. GORNSTEIN: I'm not remembering the --

21 the exact -- I think it's in the '70's, though.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, would we -- would

23 our -- would our nose count be today or would our nose

24 count be when the criminal statute was --

25 MR. GORNSTEIN: No. Mr. Chief Justice, we

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 don't think that the Court should do that kind of nose

2 counting based on whether a statute was enacted in

3 1800, 1850, 1900, 1950 and potentially have different

4 rules for each statute. We think that the Court should

5 look at the entire --

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why not? Isn't it

7 realistic to assume that Congress looked at the state

8 of the law at the time it's passing a statute and

9 presumably adopted what was the prevailing view?

10 MR. GORNSTEIN: I don't think it's right to

11 say that it adopted the prevailing view unless it was a

12 consensus view. I don't think, though --

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, a consensus view. It

14 would still be the time of the enactment of the statute

15 is what would be relevant, I would think.

16 MR. GORNSTEIN: But I think the -- I think

17 that the problem with that approach is to have a

18 completely different rule for all the different

19 statutes based on when they were enacted is

20 unmanageable and impractical. And the Court has said

21 the same thing in the context of mens rea requirements.

22 The Court doesn't import into statutes the

23 mens rea requirement that was in vogue at a particular

24 time. What it does now is it imports into all criminal

25 statutes that do not specify a mens rea requirement --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it simply imports in a knowledge requirement, that

2 there has to be knowing action. And that would be true

3 regardless of whether it's an 1800 statute, an 1850

4 statute, a 1900 statute, or a today statute. And I

5 think that the reason for that is one of practicality

6 and administrability which the Court has talked about,

7 in fact, in -- in other cases. The Bailey case.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Gornstein, just out of

9 curiosity, of the 29 States that have the different

10 rule, in how many of those States was the different

11 rule adopted legislatively and in how many States was

12 it pronounced by the State supreme court?

13 MR. GORNSTEIN: I -- I'm not sure of the

14 exact breakdown, but I think that there are -- there

15 are possibly something like 10 or so States on -- that

16 have adopted it by statute, but I'm not sure of the

17 exact number of that -- on that.

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe your -- your friend on

20 the other side knows.

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the test proposed by the

22 Petitioner that -- that you have to prove non-duress by

23 beyond a reasonable doubt?

24 MR. GORNSTEIN: Yes, after the defendant --

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And your test is that the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 defendant would have to prove it only by clear and

2 convincing evidence?

3 MR. GORNSTEIN: No. More likely than not,

4 the preponderance of the evidence standard.

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: More likely. More likely.

6 MR. GORNSTEIN: More likely than not. And

7 that -- the -- the Court in The Diana case, actually in

8 the context of forfeiture, thought that a beyond -- the

9 defendant should have to show it beyond a reasonable

10 doubt.

11 But we -- and we -- we would take a step back

12 from that, consistent the practice in the circuits that

13 have put the burden of proof on the defendant and the

14 States that put the burden of proof on the defendant

15 and the burden of proof that -- that Congress has

16 specified when it has thought about what the burden of

17 proof should be outside the context of insanity --

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think a State could

19 put a burden on the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt

20 for entrapment, duress, insanity?

21 MR. GORNSTEIN: For all of the affirmative

22 defenses, I think that's the -- the Leland decision

23 would allow a State to do that. Leland said that you

24 could put -- require the defendant to show beyond a

25 reasonable -- I'm sorry. Is it Leland?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Clear and convincing.

2 MR. GORNSTEIN: Yes. Beyond a reasonable

3 doubt and so that there is -- there would be no

4 constitutional problem in putting a -- a burden beyond

5 a reasonable doubt on the duress defense either.

6 And in fact, this is a defense that Congress

7 could -- could eliminate altogether, if it wanted to,

8 and just take the position that it's going to -- these

9 -- this kind of excuse would be considered along with

10 all other kinds of excuses in either making a charging

11 decision or -- or making a sentencing decision. There

12 is no constitutional imperative that there be a duress

13 defense at all.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the insanity

15 defense?

16 MR. GORNSTEIN: The same is true of the --

17 the insanity defense that the Congress could take the

18 position. It hasn't taken that position, but it could

19 take the position, that this is a defense that will be

20 considered, along with other excuses, in -- by

21 prosecutors as they make charging decisions and by

22 sentencing judges as they make sentencing judgments.

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about self-defense?

24 MR. GORNSTEIN: The -- the same would be true

25 of self-defense, again, that the -- the Government --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 no State has ever taken that position and the Congress

2 hasn't taken that position, and it would be very much

3 against all the traditions that are -- that we have.

4 But if a State made a policy judgment to that effect,

5 that this is the policy -- we want to encourage people

6 to retreat, we do not want to encourage people to take

7 the law into their own hands, but what we will do is we

8 will recognize this and we are sure our prosecutors are

9 going to recognize it, we're sure our judges are going to

10 recognize it as a -- a mitigating factor. And that

11 would be constitutional.

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gornstein, there are

13 some old cases that draw a distinction between

14 justifications and excuses. And you carefully use the

15 words excuse to describe that defense. Did you do so

16 having in mind that distinction or just as a

17 loose description of the -- of the defense?

18 MR. GORNSTEIN: I think that it -- it fits

19 the defense and that you can draw a distinction between

20 excuse and justification, but I don't think the

21 distinction ultimately matters whether you call it an

22 excuse or justification. It's still the burden of

23 proof should be on the defendant and it shouldn't --

24 the nomenclature shouldn't matter.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: What about mistake?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. GORNSTEIN: Mistake is --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought it was a deer.

3 MR. GORNSTEIN: Yes. Mistake is something

4 that negatives the mens rea requirement of knowledge.

5 So, of course, the Government has to prove knowledge

6 beyond a reasonable doubt, and if somebody has mistake,

7 then the Government isn't going to be able to satisfy

8 its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: And would you distinguish

10 between instances of duress where it may a negative

11 mens rea and instances where it may not?

12 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, if it does negative

13 mens rea -- and this is infrequent, but if it does,

14 then the Government, of course, has to prove its

15 element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. And

16 if duress evidence undermines the Government's ability

17 to do that, then the Government hasn't proven its case

18 beyond a reasonable doubt.

19 If the Court has no further questions.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

21 Gornstein.

22 Mr. Jett, you have 4 minutes remaining.

23 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. CRAIG JETT

24 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

25 MR. JETT: To answer Justice Scalia's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 question, a quick count, it looked like that there were

2 perhaps three that we could count, but it was a quick

3 count. We can't tell whether all those decisions were

4 based on State statutes or not. The gun control

5 statute was passed in 1968, and at the time, the Model

6 Penal Code had been passed in 1962, and the Eighth

7 Circuit had said that the law was and there is no doubt

8 that the defendant does not have the burden of proving

9 his duress defense. So we believe that at the time the

10 statute passed, that the clear common -- the clear law

11 in the country was that the burden was on the

12 Government to disprove duress.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: And three -- three was what?

14 Three States that have adopted it --

15 MR. JETT: The statute. By statute.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: By statute.

17 MR. JETT: Now, the Government talks about

18 that the defendant can manufacture a defense, but you

19 can do that in any case. You can manufacture a defense

20 for a -- for a plea of not guilty, as to -- as to why

21 you're not guilty. So it really doesn't make a

22 difference. It would be the same thing for self-

23 defense.

24 In this particular case, instead of Ms. Dixon

25 having bought the guns, if she had gotten a hold of one

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of Mr. Wright's guns and shot him, she would have had a

2 self-defense, and if she had done that, then the burden

3 of proof would have been on the Government to disprove

4 self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. But because

5 she did the less blameworthy thing, that is, that she

6 bought guns instead of shooting somebody or killing

7 somebody, she is disadvantaged in -- in the courtroom.

8 Because -- because she raised duress, she then had to

9 prove her defense by a preponderance of the evidence.

10 And it's simply not --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure it's less --

12 less blameworthy. I mean, if somebody has a gun to the

13 head of my child and I have a choice between doing a

14 criminal act that he wants me to do and shooting him,

15 you think it's -- the less blameworthy is to go do the

16 criminal act?

17 MR. JETT: I think rather than -- than to

18 kill somebody it certainly would be.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't kill him. I'd

20 just wound him.

21 (Laughter.)

22 MR. JETT: Well, Justice Scalia, I understand

23 the sentiment, but she was -- she was threatened by

24 somebody with -- with a gun and her children were

25 threatened. And she might have killed him. She might

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 have shot him.

2 In either case, though, she is disadvantaged

3 by the law. She would have been better off if she had

4 shot him or killed him, and it's simply not consistent

5 that she does a less blameworthy action, buying guns

6 where nobody dies, her children didn't die, there were

7 no funerals for her, no funerals for her children, no

8 funerals for the abuser, nobody dies, but she's

9 disadvantage because she doesn't --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you take into account

11 that this was not something that occurred at once?

12 This was a long-term relationship. There were many

13 opportunities in which she might have, when her

14 children were with the grandmother, say, gone to the

15 police.

16 MR. JETT: This was a long-term relationship.

17 But what happened in this particular case is the level

18 of violence escalated substantially immediately before

19 the gun shows. The violence had been bruising where

20 you couldn't see it. Suddenly it -- it escalated with

21 a gun in the face and a split lip and a sudden threat

22 to the children that we're going -- if I kill you, I'm

23 going to have to kill your children. So even -- even

24 though it had gone on for a while, it suddenly changed,

25 and her state of mind suddenly changed because what was

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 most important to her was the safety of her children.

2 And so she did what she thought she had to do in order

3 to save her children and keep them safe.

4 And it simply would not be fair that if she

5 had done the less blameworthy action, that she has --

6 is more advantaged in court. So you can't square the

7 way duress is treated and the way self-defense is

8 treated.

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can the judge ask the

10 defendant to produce evidence that there was no

11 possibility to go to law enforcement officials, and if

12 she does not produce that evidence, then refuse to give

13 the defense?

14 MR. JETT: The judge could do that if he felt

15 that that was -- was appropriate for one of the

16 elements. The -- one of the elements is you didn't

17 have an -- a reasonable opportunity to not do the

18 crime. In her mind, she did not believe she did

19 because she believed that there was somebody at home

20 with a gun threatening her children.

21 And I'm out of time. Thank you.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Jett.

23 The case is submitted.

24 (Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the

25 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
