 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 next in No. 02-1809, J. Elliott Hibbs v. Kathleen Winn.
 5 Very well, General Goddard. You may proceed.
 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL GODDARD
 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 8 MR. GODDARD: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please
 9 the Court:
 10 The fundamental -- the fundamental question in
 11 this case is whether the meaning of the term assessment,
 12 as used in the Tax Injunction Act, includes Arizona's
 13 school tax credit. 
 14 As this Court has written on several occasions, 15 the Tax Injunction Act has a very broad reach. It
 16 drastically limits the access to Federal district courts. 
 17 The act is relatively simple and -- and straightforward. 
 18 It's just 35 words, as I count it, and it specifically
 19 says the Federal district courts shall not enjoin,
 20 restrain, or suspend the assessment, levy, or collection
 21 of a tax under State law where there is a plain, speedy,
 22 and efficient remedy in the courts of that State.
 23 QUESTION: Where is the assessment here that --
 24 that supposedly is being enjoined?
 25 MR. GODDARD: Your Honor, the assessment is the

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 calculation of a tax by the -- for the taxpayer. In other
 2 words, it's the bottom line. It's the plain meaning of
 3 assessment and the dictionary meaning. It is what happens
 4 after you've done all the additions and subtractions and
 5 you get to line 40 on the Arizona tax return form which
 6 is --
 7 QUESTION: It's -- it's a self-assessment? So
 8 you -- it's a self-assessment that's being enjoined?
 9 MR. GODDARD: Your Honor, I'm not talking about
 10 a self-assessment. I believe a self-assessment is a
 11 colloquialism that talks about what all of us go through
 12 as taxpayers. The assessment I'm talking about is what
 13 the defendant in this case, Elliott Hibbs, the Director of
 14 the Department of Revenue in Arizona, does both for 15 individual taxpayers and for all the taxpayers
 16 collectively to determine what the State's revenues are
 17 going to be from the taxpayers. And the only way you get
 18 to the revenue is that bottom line on the tax form --
 19 QUESTION: Mr. Goddard --
 20 MR. GODDARD: -- after you've done all the
 21 credits.
 22 QUESTION: Mr. Goddard, I thought that in a
 23 self-assessment system, such as the one we have, the
 24 Federal Government, Arizona, that assessment is associated
 25 with assertion of a deficiency. In Arizona, is every

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 taxpayer assessed by the government? That would be quite
 2 a different system, wouldn't it?
 3 MR. GODDARD: Your Honor, every taxpayer in
 4 Arizona has their form calculated by the government. We
 5 check the math.
 6 QUESTION: You -- you audit everyone in the
 7 State?
 8 MR. GODDARD: No, Your Honor. I'm not trying to
 9 say we audit everyone, but technically the assessment, and
 10 as it is used also in the Internal Revenue Code to my
 11 understanding, is the assessment -- and I'm quoting from
 12 the Internal Revenue Code -- shall be made by recording
 13 the liability of the taxpayer in the Office of the
 14 Secretary. 
 15 QUESTION: Which the Government does when it
 16 wants to assert a deficiency. And we were told that the
 17 assessment just a week ago is nothing more than a
 18 bookkeeping entry, and what it does is it triggers certain
 19 administrative remedies. But my understanding was that an
 20 assessment is made when the Government wants to assert a
 21 deficiency. Otherwise, there isn't this entry, this
 22 bookkeeping entry someplace, that every taxpayer isn't
 23 assessed. 
 24 MR. GODDARD: Your Honor, it is -- it is our
 25 position that the State of Arizona under our State tax

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 system assesses all taxes in the State and that --
 2 QUESTION: When -- when does that happen? When
 3 the return is received in the office or?
 4 MR. GODDARD: It -- it returns during -- excuse
 5 me. Your Honor, the -- the activity perhaps is -- is
 6 somewhat fictional in terms of the -- of the director. 
 7 He's not going to sit down, as in the old days, with a
 8 green eyeshade and write down a number for each taxpayer. 
 9 But he does, in fact, and his office does, in fact,
 10 calculate the gross revenues in the State, what credits
 11 are going to be applied against those gross revenues,
 12 various adjustments, and comes up with a bottom line. And
 13 that bottom line is our dictionary -- Black's Dictionary
 14 definition of what an assessment is.
 15 QUESTION: But that's not the assessment that
 16 you -- I mean, you used the Internal Revenue Code
 17 provision. That is an entry. We were told it's a
 18 bookkeeping entry. And it's made as a prerequisite to
 19 levying liens, to extending the statute of limitations. 
 20 But it certainly isn't true that that kind of assessment,
 21 which is what your brief suggested you were talking about,
 22 is made in the case of every taxpayer.
 23 MR. GODDARD: Your Honor, I'm not saying that
 24 every taxpayer has a -- a specific entry next to their
 25 name. That would -- that would certainly be more than we

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 could do. But our statutes, our tax system in Arizona
 2 does, in fact, call for an assessment of the liability of
 3 each taxpayer. And that assessment, the entire plan,
 4 scheme fixed upon for charging and taxing, the Webster's
 5 definition of assessment, is the bottom line. And I guess
 6 that's the plain meaning that I'm trying to get to.
 7 QUESTION: Because I -- I assume that assessment
 8 is -- is -- the assessment that we're concerned with is --
 9 is within the meaning of Federal law.
 10 But let me just ask you this question. Do you
 11 have a statute in Arizona that in effect says what the
 12 department does with respect to each taxpayer is to assess
 13 that taxpayer? Does -- does that word occur as a
 14 statement for some technical function that you go through 15 with respect to every taxpayer within the meaning of
 16 Arizona law?
 17 MR. GODDARD: Your Honor, I -- I can't say that
 18 we have that specific word in our statute. We
 19 certainly --
 20 QUESTION: Well, then -- then isn't your problem
 21 this, that -- that there -- that that specific word is
 22 used in the Federal statutes, quite apart from the Tax
 23 Injunction Act? And -- and my understanding is the same
 24 as Justice Ginsburg's. It is used in -- in a way that --
 25 that involves a -- a predicate to the -- the assertion of

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 a lien or -- or steps to collect a deficiency. And -- and
 2 that doesn't seem to be what is involved here. Isn't --
 3 isn't that a problem for you in your position?
 4 MR. GODDARD: Your Honor, I don't believe so
 5 because the -- the first step -- and -- and the three
 6 words in the statute I think are -- are certainly helpful: 
 7 assessment, levy, collection. What essentially the
 8 Congress --
 9 QUESTION: Well, there's no issue of a levy
 10 going on here, and they're not trying to stop you from
 11 collecting anything. I mean, their -- their argument is
 12 you ought to be collecting more, but they're certainly not
 13 interfering in a way that's going to leave Arizona without
 14 money while it litigates. 
 What they're saying is we want 15 to litigate so that you'll get more money, and -- and so
 16 that I suppose that's why the Ninth Circuit said why --
 17 that the closest thing to a word involved here that --
 18 that might let the statute apply is assessment. 
 19 MR. GODDARD: Yes, Your Honor, we believe
 20 that --
 21 QUESTION: And it didn't think it did. But, I
 22 mean, it seems to me that that's a basic textual problem
 23 in -- in your case, and I don't understand how you get
 24 around it. 
 25 QUESTION: The technical assessment that's made

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 tied to a deficiency you don't fit. So you're talking
 2 about some other kind of assessment than the one that, for
 3 example, the Government was telling us about last Monday
 4 in the Galletti case, not that technical -- some -- if
 5 we're talking about property, say, a property tax, then
 6 maybe an assessor comes on the land, looks at the house,
 7 attributes a value to it. That wouldn't be a self-
 8 assessing system from the taxpayer's point of view. But
 9 -- but the income tax is quite different. You assess
 10 yourself. Sometimes you get audited; sometimes you don't.
 11 And I don't see that anybody here is trying to
 12 stop the government from making the assessment that would
 13 be a trigger to asserting a deficiency. No one is trying
 14 to stop Arizona from asserting a deficiency against any 15 taxpayer.
 16 MR. GODDARD: No, Your Honor, but -- but what
 17 we're asking for is that the -- the director, Mr. Hibbs,
 18 be able to -- as the statute says, to implement the -- the
 19 tax system under State law.
 20 QUESTION: Well, is it the case, though, that
 21 other courts of appeal at the Federal level have concluded
 22 that the Tax Injunction Act does not bar suits that would
 23 increase State revenues rather than reduce them, that the
 24 purpose of the Tax Injunction Act was to prevent reduction
 25 of State tax revenues, specifically by corporations coming

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 in and getting injunctions and preventing the State from
 2 receiving revenues, but that it doesn't apply where the
 3 effect of the -- the suit would be to increase the State's
 4 coffers?
 5 MR. GODDARD: Your Honor, if I could deal with
 6 -- there -- there are two questions, one, the legislative
 7 history and -- and the -- as this Court has noted --
 8 QUESTION: First of all, with the courts of
 9 appeal, the majority have so held, I guess, who have
 10 addressed it.
 11 MR. GODDARD: No, Your Honor. I -- I would
 12 submit that -- that that's not the case.
 13 QUESTION: Only the Fifth Circuit has gone the
 14 other way.
 15 MR. GODDARD: The Fifth Circuit in ACLU
 16 Foundation v. Bridges has -- has very convincingly --
 17 QUESTION: Yes, but the others went the other
 18 way on it.
 19 MR. GODDARD: Your Honor, I could --
 20 QUESTION: The Seventh, the Eighth, and the
 21 Ninth. Right?
 22 MR. GODDARD: Your Honor, there is -- is
 23 language in the Seventh Circuit opinion which speaks about
 24 this, but it is in a very limited sense in -- in Dunn v.
 25 Kerry. I don't think it's applicable here. I'd be happy

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to discuss that.
 2 I would refer the course also -- the Court also,
 3 as our brief does, to First Circuit U.S. Brewers v. Perez
 4 interpreting the Butler Act which is identical in language
 5 to the Tax Injunction Act; to Kraebel v. New York Housing
 6 Department in the Second Circuit which talks about a tax
 7 benefit.
 8 That's what we have on -- at -- at stake here is
 9 we try -- the -- the respondents are trying to draw a
 10 division between all State tax systems to say anything
 11 that involves raising revenue is challengeable only in
 12 State court, but if there's a benefit involved, if there's
 13 anything else that accrues to the benefit of the taxpayer,
 14 that has to go Federal court. I believe that's --
 15 QUESTION: I don't know about that, but a -- a
 16 challenge to a tax credit I think is what we're talking
 17 about. Right?
 18 MR. GODDARD: Well, Your Honor, I don't believe
 19 there's any logical distinction between a deduction, an
 20 exclusion, an exemption, and a credit. They all --
 21 QUESTION: Well, I suppose you could -- I
 22 suppose you could make the argument that it -- it's wrong
 23 to say the State is only interested in increasing revenue. 
 24 The State may be interested in fairness for its taxpayers,
 25 giving its taxpayers the -- the benefit of the lower rate. 

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 That's certainly a -- a sound State policy. 
 2 MR. GODDARD: Thank you, Your Honor. I -- I
 3 think that's one of the policies, if not the principal
 4 policy, behind the Tax Injunction Act is respect for State
 5 procedures and also --
 6 QUESTION: General Goddard, the -- what we've
 7 been talking about is this section of 1341 that talks
 8 about assessment, levy, or collection of any debt. Those
 9 three words fit perfectly into a property tax scheme. 
 10 They really don't fit nearly as well into an income tax
 11 scheme. Are there cases from courts of appeals that say
 12 that the -- the act does apply to income tax as well as
 13 property tax?
 14 MR. GODDARD: 
 Yes, Your Honor, and that 15 distinction -- the cases I'm referring to involve both. 
 16 And -- and you're absolutely correct. Many of them are
 17 property tax oriented. That's true of In re Gillis. 
 18 That's true of several others. Colonial Pipeline is
 19 another that I would cite showing a tax benefit not a tax
 20 deduction to the State.
 21 But the most precisely on point is ACLU
 22 Foundation v. Bridges from the Fifth Circuit,
 23 interestingly after a couple of other cases which might
 24 have -- which have been cited by the respondents for their
 25 proposition that -- that somehow the revenue -- I mean,

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the State revenue -- things that give revenues to the
 2 State are significantly different from items that benefit
 3 the taxpayer. I would submit that under this scheme and
 4 under the scheme that this Court has discussed in the six
 5 cases that -- where it has discussed the Tax Injunction
 6 Act in detail speak about a much broader application.
 7 QUESTION: You were going to go to the history
 8 or something else. I -- I don't want you to forget that,
 9 and the reason I don't want you to forget is I'm thinking
 10 yours is a plausible interpretation --
 11 MR. GODDARD: Thank you, Your Honor. 
 12 QUESTION: -- that could be -- well, I mean, it
 13 could. I'm about to say maybe it isn't plausible enough.
 14 (Laughter.) 
 15 QUESTION: The -- the -- but what I'm -- what
 16 I'm driving at is that the -- the Congress might have said
 17 that although Federal courts are in the business quite
 18 often, along with State courts, of deciding whether a
 19 State law is unconstitutional or violates some other
 20 Federal law, and although millions of State laws are very
 21 important, we're separating out a set of cases here where
 22 they can't do it. 
 23 Now, one reason for doing that would be we don't
 24 want to interfere with States getting money that they need
 25 for their business. And that would limit these words to

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 interferences with collection of revenue.
 2 MR. GODDARD: Yes, Your Honor. 
 3 QUESTION: Now, you were about to explain to me
 4 why --
 5 MR. GODDARD: I -- I would --
 6 QUESTION: -- there's evidence that Congress
 7 wanted to do more than that.
 8 MR. GODDARD: I would greatly appreciate --
 9 QUESTION: It wanted to do more than that. It
 10 wanted, in fact, to say you just can't stop them from --
 11 you cannot, Federal courts, go and have our tax division
 12 here interfered with, even though it doesn't affect
 13 collection of revenue. We -- we don't want you to
 14 interfere with their rules, with their administration, 15 with anything. You can do it for the police department,
 16 but not the tax.
 17 All right. Now -- now, what's the evidence
 18 that's what -- what Congress wanted?
 19 MR. GODDARD: Well, the first evidence is the
 20 words of the statute. They didn't just say collections.
 21 QUESTION: All right. The words -- I think
 22 they're pretty ambiguous. 
 23 MR. GODDARD: They -- well, they don't just say
 24 collections, though, Your Honor. 
 25 QUESTION: No, I know.

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. GODDARD: They say assessment and levy. 
 2 Those words are not modified. 
 3 QUESTION: Let's go beyond these words.
 4 MR. GODDARD: Thank you. 
 5 Also, the history of the Tax Injunction Act --
 6 it comes from a period when the -- the Congress was
 7 reacting to this Court's decision in Ex parte Young, and
 8 they felt that extensive equitable relief against State
 9 officials was inappropriate, and they passed several laws,
 10 the Johnson Act and the Tax Injunction Act in the '30's
 11 being the most important, which spoke very broadly about
 12 keeping in State courts State proceedings. They did not
 13 say anything about just collections, although --
 14 QUESTION: 
 Mr. Goddard, in that -- in that 15 regard, wasn't what Congress had in mind -- it was
 16 taxpayer suits. They didn't want taxpayers to avoid going
 17 through the whole process. I mean, most of the cases that
 18 come up under the Tax Injunction Act are taxpayers who say
 19 please enjoin the tax or don't assess me or don't levy. 
 20 But this is not that kind of case. 
 21 There's no one here who's trying to stop the
 22 State from collecting revenue. It's an attack by a non-
 23 taxpayer, and that at the time of the Tax Injunction Act,
 24 I don't think that kind of action was even on the scene. 
 25 Do you have any claims where a non-taxpayer was seeking to

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 enjoin the collection of a tax? 
 2 What they -- what -- what Congress was aiming at
 3 is that, taxpayer, you've got a prompt, speedy, efficient
 4 remedy in your State, you use that, don't rush to the
 5 Federal court.
 6 MR. GODDARD: Your -- Your Honor, the -- the
 7 Congress had several reasons, and -- and you're absolutely
 8 correct that one of the primary ones was not allowing
 9 taxpayers, especially out of State, to come in and
 10 interrupt the flow of taxes. I'm not denying that that
 11 was a -- a very important reason. 
 12 But as this Court has said in Rosewell v.
 13 LaSalle National Bank, if that was the only reason that
 14 they were concerned about the collection of taxes, they 15 could have said so. They could have said only diversity
 16 jurisdiction cases will be barred from Federal court. 
 17 They did not. They used -- they said essentially district
 18 courts shall not consider cases to restrain, enjoin, or
 19 suspend actions for the assessment, levy, and collection
 20 of taxes. 
 21 They also --
 22 QUESTION: That was a taxpayer's case too,
 23 wasn't it? 
 24 MR. GODDARD: Excuse me?
 25 QUESTION: Wasn't the case you just cited --

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 wasn't it -- that also a taxpayer's attempt to --
 2 MR. GODDARD: Yes, Your Honor. 
 3 QUESTION: Yes.
 4 MR. GODDARD: It was an assessment on property.
 5 QUESTION: So I'm asking you about cases where
 6 we don't have a taxpayer who's not trying to stop any
 7 assessment of his tax, any -- anything else about --
 8 MR. GODDARD: Well, I guess the -- the direct
 9 collision, Your Honor, is between the decision below in
 10 the Ninth Circuit and ACLU Foundation v. Bridges --
 11 QUESTION: It's the only one that I know.
 12 MR. GODDARD: -- which involves a challenge to a
 13 specific tax benefit given to religious organizations in
 14 Louisiana. So I believe that's as close as I can come.
 15 Your Honor, if I could reserve the balance of my
 16 time, I would like to do so.
 17 QUESTION: Very well, General Goddard.
 18 Mr. Hungar, we'll hear from you.
 19 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR
 20 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
 21 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
 22 MR. HUNGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 23 please the Court:
 24 The position of the United States is that
 25 respondents' suit is barred by the plain language of the

17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Tax Injunction Act because it seeks to enjoin and restrain
 2 the assessment of a tax under State law. 
 3 And to turn directly to the --
 4 QUESTION: May I ask you if you think the
 5 language is so plain that we should not even look at the
 6 legislative history?
 7 MR. HUNGAR: We think it's -- yes. We think
 8 that the -- the language is sufficiently plain that
 9 there's no need to look at the legislative history, but
 10 that if you do, the legislative history also supports the
 11 interpretation we advance.
 12 QUESTION: And Judge Easterbrook was just dead
 13 wrong in looking at the legislative history and he also
 14 interpreted it dead wrong. 
 15 MR. HUNGAR: Judge -- the case before Judge
 16 Easterbrook, Justice Stevens, was quite different from
 17 this case. That involved not an -- a -- a suit against
 18 tax -- the tax collector to affect the manner in which the
 19 tax collector administered the tax code, but rather a suit
 20 against private plaintiffs who had brought a State court
 21 action. It was a Federal court suit to enjoin a State
 22 court action. And so the considerations applicable in
 23 that case were obviously quite different from those what
 24 we have -- where we have presented here. 
 25 The point of the Tax Injunction Act is to -- to

18
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 protect the tax collector against Federal court suits to
 2 enjoin or restrain the tax collector's assessment,
 3 collection, and levy of tax.
 4 QUESTION: Does -- does that -- were you
 5 finished your answer?
 6 MR. HUNGAR: Yes. 
 7 QUESTION: The -- the -- if you use the word
 8 enjoin to mean command, which it can mean, can you say
 9 that they are commanding the collection of a tax, contrary
 10 to the words of the statute?
 11 MR. HUNGAR: Yes. We think that is also quite
 12 correct here. That was not the issue addressed by the
 13 Ninth Circuit, but that is certainly another way to get to
 14 the result which we think is the correct result, that the 15 plain language of the statute bars this kind of suit.
 16 Turning to the questions about the meaning of
 17 assessment, it is perfectly clear beyond peradventure that
 18 under -- in the Federal system, the term assessment means
 19 the tax collector's recorded determination of the amount
 20 of tax due under Federal law --
 21 QUESTION: Do we have a self-assessment?
 22 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. 
 23 QUESTION: We don't. 
 24 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. 
 25 QUESTION: Is every -- every taxpayer is

19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 assessed?
 2 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the --
 3 QUESTION: Every taxpayer is assessed even when
 4 no deficiency is sought?
 5 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. The practice of
 6 the Internal Revenue Service is to assess the amount of
 7 taxes shown on the return if that is -- absent some audit
 8 or some reason to think there's an error in the return. 
 9 And in fact, the Internal Revenue Code so provides. 
 10 Section --
 11 QUESTION: That every taxpayer is assessed even
 12 when there's no deficiency.
 13 MR. HUNGAR: Correct. Well, if a taxpayer files
 14 a return showing a bottom line calculation of how much tax 15 is due after all credits, deductions, and so forth have
 16 been taken into account, that amount and -- and the tax --
 17 and the IRS checks the addition, concludes that it's
 18 accurate, and is not conducting an audit, that amount is
 19 assessed. It's -- it's recorded in the transcript. Now,
 20 of course, it's on the computer.
 21 QUESTION: You don't have to send them a notice
 22 of -- in other words, I file my income tax. I thought
 23 there's some provisions that say if somebody thinks I made
 24 a mistake, they have to send me some special notice. Some
 25 process takes place. We have some other case on this. I

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 thought all that involved an assessment, that it was a
 2 particular thing under the IRC, not just my filing of a --
 3 of the return.
 4 MR. HUNGAR: The assessment is a particular
 5 thing. Under the Internal Revenue Code, it's the -- it's
 6 the tax collect -- the IRS's determination of the amount
 7 of tax --
 8 QUESTION: But you just said to Justice Ginsburg
 9 that if nothing happens -- like I try to pay my taxes
 10 accurately. So I file these pieces of paper. And now,
 11 nothing happens. They just take the money. They cash the
 12 check. And -- and you're going to say when that's all
 13 that happened, there was an assessment? I thought it had
 14 a particular meaning that wasn't that, that was when you 15 thought I was wrong, you did something and then went after
 16 me. But -- but it just -- everybody is called an
 17 assessment? Does it say that in the code where --
 18 MR. HUNGAR: 26 U.S.C. 6201. This is not in the
 19 -- the briefs. 26 U.S.C. 6201(a)(1) provides, quote, the
 20 Secretary shall assess all taxes determined by the
 21 taxpayer or by the Secretary as to which returns or lists
 22 are made under this title. So if the taxpayer has
 23 admitted on their tax return that they owe X dollars in
 24 taxes, the Secretary shall assess that amount and also has
 25 the discretion to conduct an audit.

21

1 QUESTION: But -- but nobody -- nobody here is
 2 contesting, as far as I can tell, what we were told Monday
 3 is a mere bookkeeping entry. Does it -- does it -- is a
 4 notice and demand sent out to everyone who's assessed?
 5 MR. HUNGAR: Not if the taxpayer has conceded
 6 the amount of liability. That's the point. If the
 7 taxpayer concedes on the return that their liability is
 8 X --
 9 QUESTION: So why is anybody trying to enjoin a
 10 bookkeeping entry that nobody knows anything about?
 11 MR. HUNGAR: Because assessment is the formal
 12 determination by the -- by the --
 13 QUESTION: But I don't see that there's any
 14 effort to stop a bookkeeping entry from being made -15 MR. HUNGAR: There is, Your Honor. 
 16 QUESTION: -- that nobody gets any notice of and
 17 doesn't -- is -- is, we were told, just a mere bookkeeping
 18 entry. That doesn't -- doesn't -- it's not necessary in
 19 order to collect the tax?
 20 MR. HUNGAR: But the statute, Justice Ginsburg,
 21 doesn't say anything about notice. It says the -- the
 22 Federal district courts shall not enjoin the assessment of
 23 a tax under State law. 
 24 QUESTION: But nobody is seeking to enjoin any
 25 assessment. 

22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HUNGAR: They -- they are. The plaintiffs
 2 are seeking --
 3 QUESTION: They -- as assessment being a
 4 bookkeeping entry that nobody knows anything about. You
 5 just said you don't need any notice and demand. In the
 6 Galletti case, we were told that's what the assessment is. 
 7 It's a notation in a book someplace. It doesn't even have
 8 the taxpayer's name on it.
 9 MR. HUNGAR: If I may answer, Justice Ginsburg. 
 10 What plaintiffs are seeking to do is prevent and restrain
 11 and enjoin the -- the tax department from assessing taxes
 12 under State law in the manner required by State law, which
 13 includes, as part of the assessment, computation and
 14 allowance of the credit where it is due. And the -- and
 15 the suit in this case would preclude the tax collector
 16 from doing that if respondents were to succeed. 
 17 QUESTION: May I ask you --
 18 MR. HUNGAR: That's exactly what the act
 19 precludes.
 20 QUESTION: -- does the Arizona tax code have a
 21 provision in it comparable to the one that you read us --
 22 to us from the Federal code?
 23 MR. HUNGAR: I don't believe so, Your Honor. I
 24 believe what the Arizona tax code provides --
 25 QUESTION: Then it's hardly relevant, is it?

23
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HUNGAR: -- is that the -- is that the tax
 2 collector there, the Department of Revenue, makes a
 3 determination or reviews the returns and ultimately either
 4 determines that that amount will be accepted, that -- that
 5 the amount of tax shown on the return is the -- going to
 6 be accepted as the amount of tax due from the tax
 7 collector, or that they're going to try to require some --
 8 you know, assess a deficiency or whatever it may be.
 9 But in either case, within the meaning of
 10 Federal law, the tax collector's determination of what the
 11 amount is due, either if it's the amount shown on return
 12 -- on the return or if they think it's a different amount,
 13 within the meaning of Federal law, that is the assessment.
 14 And that is what the respondents are trying to 15 change. They're trying to require the tax collector to
 16 assess taxes not in a manner required under State law,
 17 which is the -- the text of the statute, but rather in a
 18 manner contrary to State law. 
 19 QUESTION: Suppose they clarify that they're not
 20 trying to stop a bookkeeping entry from being made in
 21 Arizona, even though Arizona law doesn't require it, just
 22 like the Feds.
 23 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the assessment under
 24 State law in Arizona includes the tax credit. The
 25 respondents would change that and would preclude the tax

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 collector from doing that.
 2 QUESTION: If they couldn't stop a bookkeeping
 3 entry, I assume they couldn't stop the acceptance of the
 4 tax in accordance with a bookkeeping entry. Isn't that
 5 right? 
 6 MR. HUNGAR: That's correct.
 7 QUESTION: I -- I assume it's essential to their
 8 case that they stop that ultimate bookkeeping entry which
 9 determines how much the taxpayer owes.
 10 MR. HUNGAR: Exactly. 
 11 And the purpose of the --
 12 QUESTION: Although we were told that there
 13 isn't that bookkeeping entry in Arizona, that they don't
 14 have it.
 15 MR. HUNGAR: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'm
 16 obviously no expert in Arizona tax law. I'm informed that
 17 the tax collector looks at the returns when they come in,
 18 checks the addition, and in a certain number of cases goes
 19 further.
 20 QUESTION: But that's not what you described as
 21 the assessment. 
 22 MR. HUNGAR: The assessment is the tax
 23 collector's recorded determination of the amount due.
 24 QUESTION: Which we were told they don't have in
 25 Arizona. 

25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HUNGAR: Well, it -- again, I think for
 2 purposes of Federal law, it -- it is not unreasonable to
 3 assume that the tax collector in Arizona decides whether
 4 they're going to accept the amount of return shown on the
 5 tax as --
 6 QUESTION: And keeps a record of it.
 7 MR. HUNGAR: And keeps a record of it. Exactly.
 8 QUESTION: I mean, he must keep a record of it
 9 for --
 10 MR. HUNGAR: Exactly, exactly. Now, the
 11 Attorney General can address that, but -- but that's my
 12 understanding of Arizona law.
 13 QUESTION: Isn't the case just simpler if we say
 14 you cannot command the collection of a tax, which is 15 what's happening here?
 16 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Justice Kennedy. That -- that
 17 is exactly right. That is -- that is entirely consistent
 18 with the United States' view of and interpretation of this
 19 act and the Anti-Injunction Act. 
 20 And it's also consistent with the legislative
 21 history and purposes of the act. This Court has
 22 repeatedly recognized, in Justice O'Connor's opinion for
 23 the -- for the Court in the Grace Brethren case and in
 24 other cases, that the purpose of the act sweeps more
 25 broadly than simply a focus on collection and --

26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: But those were all taxpayers trying
 2 to stop the collection of tax from them.
 3 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but the
 4 Court did not say that the purpose and scope of the act is
 5 limited to that context, nor is the language limited to
 6 that context. To the contrary, the Court said this -- the
 7 act sweeps broadly to prevent Federal court interference
 8 in the administration of -- of State tax systems. 
 9 QUESTION: But wouldn't you agree that the
 10 primary purpose of the statute was to protect the State's
 11 fisc?
 12 MR. HUNGAR: That is certainly a primary purpose
 13 of the statute.
 14 QUESTION: 
 And insofar as that purpose is 15 relevant, you lose on that purpose.
 16 MR. HUNGAR: It's -- it's not applicable here,
 17 although I think it is important to recognize that it
 18 would be quite extraordinary for Federal courts to be in
 19 the business of ordering State tax collectors to collect
 20 -- to collect taxes from their citizens that the
 21 legislature of the State had deemed should not be
 22 collected.
 23 QUESTION: It's curious that the Moore's Federal
 24 Practice and Wright and Miller and Hart and Wechsler all
 25 suggest that the Tax Injunction Act does not prevent a

27
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 challenge in Federal court to the constitutionality of
 2 State tax credits. They seem uniform in that view.
 3 MR. HUNGAR: Well, I think some of those quotes,
 4 if I recall correctly, Justice O'Connor, deal with -- they
 5 say the -- the Tax Injunction Act does not apply to suits
 6 to collect taxes, which is a different situation than
 7 here.
 8 QUESTION: Well, they speak in terms of tax
 9 credits. 
 10 Has this Court taken some cases that appear to
 11 fly in the face of your theory and just not said anything
 12 about it?
 13 MR. HUNGAR: This Court in two or three cases
 14 identified by respondents has not addressed the Tax 15 Injunction Act where it might be -- it might be relevant.
 16 Thank you. 
 17 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hungar.
 18 Mr. Cohen, we'll hear from you.
 19 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN S. COHEN
 20 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
 21 MR. COHEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
 22 the Court:
 23 I'll begin by stating what our position is. The
 24 Tax Injunction Act and the associated principles of comity
 25 only -- only -- apply when a district court is asked to

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 stop the flow of revenue to the State. For more than 60
 2 years, the act and the associated principles of comity
 3 have been applied only when claimants sought to stop the
 4 flow of tax revenues. The decisions of this Court support
 5 this.
 6 In challenges to tax credits, the Tax Injunction
 7 Act has been either not considered at all by this Court or
 8 in other Federal courts has specifically -- they've
 9 specifically held, except in Bridges last summer --
 10 they've specifically held that the Tax Injunction Act did
 11 not apply.
 12 It -- this is -- also our position is consistent
 13 with the revenue protective purpose of the Tax Injunction
 14 Act and common sense supports this. If there's no threat
 15 to the flow of State revenue -- State tax revenues, then
 16 the administration of the State tax laws is the same as
 17 the administration of education laws and penal laws --
 18 QUESTION: Mr. Cohen, going back to the
 19 language, assessment, levy, or collection of any tax,
 20 which was the subject of questions to your -- your
 21 opponent, you don't question, do you, that the statute
 22 applies to income taxes as well as to property taxes?
 23 MR. COHEN: Mr. Chief Justice, we don't question
 24 that.
 25 QUESTION: And would you question its

29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 applicability if the -- the State could not point to a
 2 particular act of assessment or levy or collection in its
 3 procedures? 
 4 MR. COHEN: Your Honor, we view the phrase,
 5 enjoin, suspend, or restrain the assessment, levy, or
 6 collection, as a phrase. We -- we don't believe that any
 7 one word there has special meanings. That phrase has been
 8 interpreted by the courts to say that the process of
 9 causing a flow of tax revenues to the State will not be
 10 stopped. 
 11 QUESTION: You mean I -- I can't read this
 12 statute to say that the district court shall not enjoin
 13 the collection of a tax? I have to read all the other
 14 things with it? 
 That -- that's a very strange 15 interpretation of any statute.
 16 MR. COHEN: Justice Kennedy, the -- let's take a
 17 -- I -- I believe the idea was that there is a process. 
 18 The -- at the time the word assessment was first used, it
 19 was 1867 in the Federal Anti-Injunction Act, which was the
 20 model for the Tax Injunction Act in 1937, as this Court
 21 held in Jefferson County. And at that time if a -- and a
 22 -- the assessment process which was valuing property -- if
 23 that had been stopped, then -- then they wouldn't get to
 24 the collection phase, or if they stopped the levy phase,
 25 they wouldn't get to the collection phase. So it's a --

30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the concept was that it took these three things to make
 2 the flow of revenue come to the State.
 3 And that while individuals have an option under
 4 the section 1983 and 1343 together to choose either the
 5 Federal or State courts in which to vindicate their
 6 constitutional rights, the Congress decided that they
 7 should not have that option if it could interfere -- if it
 8 could stop the flow of revenues to the State --
 9 QUESTION: Let's assume --
 10 MR. COHEN: -- but it didn't go farther than
 11 that.
 12 QUESTION: Let's assume it means just that.
 13 MR. COHEN: Yes.
 14 QUESTION: And -- and let's assume that -- that
 15 you get your injunction in a Federal district court
 16 against the Secretary of State's collection of this tax. 
 17 What is the Secretary of State to do? His -- his State
 18 statute tells him that he should collect less. This
 19 injunction says he should collect more. He will appeal
 20 the case from the district court to the court of appeals. 
 21 Meanwhile, what is he to do? He is not authorized by
 22 State law, which he thinks is valid, to collect more.
 23 It seems to me during the whole period while
 24 that -- that case is on appeal from the district court to
 25 the court of appeals to the Supreme Court, if it gets

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 here, the Secretary of State doesn't know what to do, and
 2 his collection of the tax is impaired.
 3 MR. COHEN: Justice Scalia --
 4 QUESTION: Why isn't that so?
 5 MR. COHEN: The -- two -- two answers, if -- if
 6 you allow me. The first is that the district court, of
 7 course, has the power to stay the effectiveness of that
 8 judgment until there is a final decision, and he could be
 9 asked --
 10 QUESTION: Well, then the statute wouldn't apply
 11 I suppose. It just says it shall not enjoin. We're
 12 assuming it has enjoined. If your reading is correct, it
 13 should be able to enjoin because there's nothing wrong
 14 with enjoining. Okay?
 15 Let's assume it does enjoin. Does that not
 16 interfere with the collection, even if you think that
 17 that's -- that's all that's at issue is the collection of
 18 taxes? How is the State going to collect its taxes?
 19 MR. COHEN: Justice Scalia, the statute does not
 20 say interfere. The statute talks about stopping the
 21 collection, and this would not stop the collection. It
 22 would -- it would allow the collection --
 23 QUESTION: You have a much narrower position. 
 24 Your earlier position was this whole purpose was just to
 25 protect the State's tax revenue and so long as it doesn't

32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 impair that. Now you say it can impair that so long as it
 2 does not enjoin it. That's a much narrower position.
 3 MR. COHEN: Justice Scalia, I'm not saying that. 
 4 I -- I -- you --
 5 QUESTION: I thought that's what --
 6 MR. COHEN: I must have misspoke myself because
 7 what I am saying is that they can't stop the collection of
 8 taxes and that this would not stop the collection.
 9 QUESTION: But the statute doesn't say stop. It
 10 says enjoin and enjoin can mean -- can mean command.
 11 MR. COHEN: In Jefferson --
 12 QUESTION: And that's exactly what you're doing. 
 13 You're commanding the collection of the tax.
 14 MR. COHEN: 
 Justice Kennedy, in Jefferson 15 County, this Court unanimously interpreted the statute to
 16 say stop the collection. That's what this Court said in
 17 Jefferson County, and there are a number of cases in which
 18 a commandment seeking to command the payment of taxes has
 19 been held to be outside the Tax Injunction Act.
 20 QUESTION: Can I bring you -- can I bring you
 21 back to my question which I don't think I got an answer
 22 to? What is the Secretary of State supposed to do? He
 23 has gotten an order from a Federal district court to
 24 collect more taxes than he is authorized to collect under
 25 State law. He intends to appeal that district court

33
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 order, but meanwhile, he has been enjoined from
 2 collecting. What is he supposed to do?
 3 MR. COHEN: Justice Scalia, he obeys the order
 4 of the court and he's -- he's only enjoined from --
 5 QUESTION: Well, that means --
 6 MR. COHEN: He's only enjoined with regard to
 7 the tax credit. He's not enjoined from collecting the tax
 8 which includes not honoring the tax credit.
 9 QUESTION: And I take that -- I take it that's
 10 the answer to -- to Justice Kennedy's question, that his
 11 obligation to collect the tax is an obligation under State
 12 law, and once he is enjoined from recognizing the credit,
 13 he simply follows State law and collects the tax without
 14 reference to the credit. 
 The Federal court, conversely, 15 doesn't say, you go out and collect the tax. The State
 16 law does that. Is -- is -- do you buy that?
 17 MR. COHEN: Yes, absolutely.
 18 QUESTION: He believes the district court
 19 decision is wrong, and let's assume it is wrong. What is
 20 he supposed to do while it is on appeal?
 21 MR. COHEN: Unless it -- Your Honor, unless it
 22 is stayed, he is to obey it, and --
 23 QUESTION: And that does not --
 24 MR. COHEN: It does not interfere with the
 25 collection -- with the flow -- it does not interfere with

34
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the flow of revenue to the State, and that's what the Tax
 2 Injunction Act is basically about. 
 3 QUESTION: He -- he obeys the injunction and he
 4 obeys State law except with respect to the credit which he
 5 is enjoined from giving.
 6 MR. COHEN: I agree, Your Honor. 
 7 QUESTION: And the result is that he collects
 8 the -- the full tax. That's the way it would work.
 9 MR. COHEN: That's correct, Your Honor. 
 10 QUESTION: Suppose -- suppose the State law says
 11 if these tax credits are invalidated, all other taxpayers
 12 shall be assessed an additional 2 percent to make up for
 13 -- I'm sorry. If these -- if these tax credits are
 14 invalidated, other taxpayers shall be -- their taxes shall 15 be reduced by 1 percent. Okay? I mean, the -- the State
 16 looks forward to this possibility that there will be an
 17 injunction. What is the Secretary of State to do then? 
 18 Is he to assess everybody else at a lesser amount?
 19 MR. COHEN: Your Honor, I believe --
 20 QUESTION: In other words, he is prevented from
 21 collecting the additional amount that he would have had to
 22 collect from other taxpayers had this tax credit been
 23 acknowledged. The tax credit is struck down, and what the
 24 law says is, if it's struck down, you have to collect more
 25 from everybody else. Now, I assume in that situation the

35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 district court would not be able to enjoin the collection,
 2 would it? 
 3 So all you're talking about is whether the State
 4 law is -- is drafted in a clever way or not.
 5 MR. COHEN: Your Honor, if -- if the tax credit
 6 is struck down, the State gets more money. It has no need
 7 to assess an additional 1 or 2 percent of its taxpayers. 
 8 But if -- if the State in its wisdom chose to do so, then
 9 whoever collects taxes would obey the State law until
 10 another case came to court and another judge told them
 11 what to do.
 12 QUESTION: All right. So -- so there would be
 13 some interference. But what do you do about the word?
 14 I mean, I'm somewhat shaken by the fact that the 15 -- the Internal Revenue Code does -- as I have just read
 16 6201 and 6203, it does use that word assessment as
 17 apparently to refer simply to the record keeping function
 18 of the tax division which it says under rules and
 19 regulations the assessment shall be made by recording the
 20 liability of the taxpayer in the Office of the Secretary. 
 21 And therefore, what it seems to have in mind in the IRC is
 22 a simple bookkeeping notation of how much money this
 23 taxpayer owes which takes place in every case.
 24 Now, the -- the act says there shall be no suit
 25 that restrains the assessment of that tax; i.e., you

36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 cannot restrain the Secretary in noting the amount that
 2 the taxpayer owes. 
 3 Now, they're saying stop right there. End of
 4 the matter. Now, what in your opinion overcomes that
 5 argument? 
 6 MR. COHEN: Your Honor, Justice Breyer, it's
 7 interesting about the Internal Revenue Code and the -- the
 8 Federal income tax law because there is a corollary to the
 9 Tax Injunction Act: the Anti-Injunction Act of 1867. And
 10 it uses the word assessment. And there are a number of
 11 Federal court decisions saying that that does not apply to
 12 tax credits. And in each --
 13 QUESTION: That's not an answer for the
 14 reason --
 15 MR. COHEN: May I --
 16 QUESTION: -- that they're saying they're wrong,
 17 just as they say we were wrong in five cases not to notice
 18 this. So continue, please.
 19 MR. COHEN: Yes. None of them -- none of them
 20 looked at the word assessment in isolation. What it
 21 looked at -- what those cases looked at was the phrase, as
 22 -- as I've suggested to the Court, that the phrase
 23 assessment, levy, and collection is the process of
 24 creating the flow of revenue.
 25 QUESTION: But it isn't and; it's or. Isn't it?

37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. COHEN: The -- Justice Scalia, it -- it is
 2 or for purposes of saying that you can't restrain any of
 3 those because if you restrain any of those in the context
 4 of creating the stream of revenue, you have stopped the
 5 stream of revenue. And that -- that's what history of the
 6 act shows, the purpose of the act.
 7 QUESTION: So your answer is this. You say
 8 indeed they've got it correctly defined. Indeed, it says
 9 assessment. It says assessment, levy, or collection. But
 10 that phrase does not refer to every assessment, levy, or
 11 collection. Rather, in context it refers to those
 12 assessments, levies, and collections that will have, were
 13 they enjoined, the impact of cutting the revenue stream
 14 flowing to the State.
 15 MR. COHEN: That's our position, Your Honor. 
 16 QUESTION: That's your view. So we should look
 17 at that in context. That's why you go to the history and
 18 these other things. 
 19 MR. COHEN: That's correct, Your Honor. 
 20 QUESTION: All right. I understand. 
 21 MR. COHEN: I -- I would like to also point out
 22 to the Court that this use of a tax credit as a mechanism
 23 could also to -- that is to funnel money to school tuition
 24 organizations could just as well have been an
 25 appropriation of dollars and vouchers. And if instead the

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 State was giving vouchers to school tuition organizations,
 2 93 percent of which went to religious schools, there would
 3 be no question about the individual citizen's option to
 4 choose to go to the Federal court.
 5 QUESTION: But it wasn't done that way. I mean,
 6 it's just like saying it could have been extracted by
 7 torture too, and that would have been clearly
 8 unconstitutional. 
 9 (Laughter.) 
 10 QUESTION: But that happens not to be the way it
 11 was done. 
 12 MR. COHEN: That's correct, Your Honor, but in
 13 Nyquist this Court particularly pointed out that a tax
 14 credit was the same as giving money to the State. That --
 15 that was this Court dealing with a tax credit that --
 16 where the money was used to support religious schools,
 17 which is just what we're asserting here.
 18 QUESTION: Mueller certainly distinguished that
 19 part of Nyquist.
 20 MR. COHEN: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. I
 21 didn't --
 22 QUESTION: The Mueller against Allen case surely
 23 distinguished that part of Nyquist. I mean, it's much
 24 less valuable to -- after Mueller than it was before
 25 Mueller.

1 MR. COHEN: Mr. Chief Justice, Mueller was a tax
 2 deduction case rather than a tax credit case. In a tax
 3 credit case --
 4 QUESTION: Why should -- why should that make
 5 any difference to your argument? 
 6 MR. COHEN: It -- generally, it wouldn't, but a
 7 tax credit is every dollar that goes to the benefit of the
 8 school tuition organization -- if it wasn't given to them,
 9 every dollar of that would go to the State. In a tax
 10 deduction, a tax deduction is a more generalized --
 11 helping to support charity, and only a portion of that
 12 money goes to the State --
 13 QUESTION: Yes. It may be -- it may be a
 14 smaller amount, but in both cases it goes to the person 15 who -- who claims it.
 16 MR. COHEN: Mr. Chief Justice, that's correct,
 17 but it's a smaller percentage. My use of tax credit with
 18 Nyquist is that that's an unusual feature of Nyquist is
 19 it's dollar for dollar. In Mueller, there was the --
 20 there were a number of considerations when you deal with a
 21 tax deduction. They're a little different than tax
 22 credit, and this Court has recognized those. Generally
 23 they are tax benefits and generally they are to be
 24 considered outside the Tax Injunction Act according to the
 25 cases.

40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Is the point you're making is -- is
 2 it's the taxpayer who's designating a certain portion of
 3 money which would otherwise go to the general revenues
 4 will instead go to this charitable purpose. It's kind of
 5 like on the Federal return where you can check off and say
 6 I want $3 -- instead of going to general revenues, it goes
 7 to fund campaign -- to presidential elections.
 8 MR. COHEN: Justice --
 9 QUESTION: That's on the -- that's what this is,
 10 isn't it?
 11 MR. COHEN: Justice Ginsburg, that's exactly
 12 right. That's what I'm saying. 
 13 And if you have no further questions --
 14 QUESTION: I have --
 15 QUESTION: I do. I do have one.
 16 QUESTION: Don't kid yourself.
 17 QUESTION: Go on. Go first.
 18 QUESTION: I just want to make sure I didn't
 19 miss something in your argument, Mr. Cohen. Talking about
 20 the history of this statute, did you refer to an earlier
 21 statute that used the similar language in the same order,
 22 assessment, levy, and collection or collection and levy,
 23 whichever it is, and that that statute only applied to
 24 real estate taxes? Was that -- did you say that? I want
 25 to make sure I didn't --

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. COHEN: Justice Stewart, I was referring to
 2 the Anti-Injunction Act of 1867 --
 3 QUESTION: Right. 
 4 MR. COHEN: -- in which the word levy was not
 5 used. It was assessment or collection, and I said it was
 6 in the context of valuation then because there was no
 7 income tax in 1867. And that could be -- for instance, I
 8 know there weren't Federal property taxes, but it could be
 9 in -- in valuation of -- of property for tariffs coming in
 10 or things of that nature. The word assessment then was
 11 not used in the context of the income tax laws. That's
 12 all I was saying because there were none.
 13 QUESTION: And -- and it would be perfectly
 14 natural in the real estate tax context to use them in that
 15 order because the assessment comes first. Whereas, the
 16 argument of your opponents here is the assessment is the
 17 last thing in the chain of events, which seems somewhat
 18 counter-intuitive if you're -- when you're referring to
 19 income taxes.
 20 MR. COHEN: I -- I agree, Justice Stewart.
 21 QUESTION: See, this -- in -- in -- do you know
 22 this in State tax systems? Apparently in the Federal tax
 23 system assessment refers to an official determination of
 24 the amount that the individual taxpayer owes. Now, there
 25 are 50 State systems plus the District of Columbia. Do

42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 you know if there are a significant number of States that
 2 would not consider that official determination of the
 3 amount owed to be an assessment? 
 4 MR. COHEN: Mr. Justice Breyer, no, I do not
 5 know. We haven't done a survey of the States.
 6 QUESTION: But the question I was going to put
 7 was you -- you say that the -- the principal purpose of
 8 this law was to protect the fisc of the State. And I --
 9 you know, I will concede that, that -- that what Congress
 10 was most concerned about was preventing somebody from
 11 stopping the State from collecting money. But it's not
 12 unusual that Congress drafts its prohibitions broader than
 13 is necessary to achieve just the narrow purpose. And if
 14 indeed they -- they prohibited not just stopping the 15 collection but also stopping the assessment, it seems to
 16 me we have to take the statute for what it says, if indeed
 17 this is an assessment. And the mere fact that it goes
 18 beyond what the principal purpose was, I mean, that --
 19 that's often the case with statutes.
 20 MR. COHEN: Justice Scalia, the State contends
 21 and the United States both contend that this statute is --
 22 the purpose of it was to stop any court -- Federal court
 23 interference with the tax administration process itself. 
 24 And the -- the Federal court decisions, other than
 25 Bridges, reject that point of view.

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 And this Court rejected that point of view in
 2 Jefferson County when the -- the issue there was that the
 3 county had sued in the State court against Federal judges
 4 to try to get an occupational tax. And the Federal judges
 5 removed the case to Federal court, and the county said,
 6 well, the Tax Injunction Act applies here because the
 7 Federal judges are going to raise State tax issues and
 8 this Federal court will be deciding cases having to do
 9 with State tax administration. And they cited the
 10 Kelleher case out of the Second Circuit which it held that
 11 the Tax Injunction Act was so broad that it applied to tax
 12 -- all State tax administration. And this Court rejected
 13 that position, and this Court I believe unanimously
 14 overruled Kelleher. So we --
 15 QUESTION: Mr. Cohen, we are ships passing in
 16 the night because you're -- I don't care what the purpose
 17 was. I care what the language says, and my point is that
 18 very often the language goes beyond the narrow purpose
 19 that Congress had in mind. And when -- when the language
 20 does so, we read the statute as it's written, but you
 21 don't -- don't agree with that apparently. We -- we have
 22 to intuit the purpose and limit the language no matter
 23 what it says to that purpose.
 24 MR. COHEN: Mr. Justice, I -- I'm saying that
 25 for 60 years with the Tax Injunction Act and for 150 years

44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 -- no -- I guess 140 years with the Anti-Injunction Act 
 2 that is the way the Federal courts -- the way we're
 3 suggesting is the way the Federal courts have interpreted
 4 this language.
 5 And we suggest that if there's a problem, as
 6 long as the tax revenue is flowing to the State and we're
 7 not interfering -- we're not stopping that, if there's a
 8 problem with -- with that system that's been there now
 9 for, oh, 100, 60 years for States, 140 years for the
 10 Federal fisc, if there's a problem, the States can take
 11 that problem to Congress to change this exemption. This
 12 is an exemption from the Federal jurisdiction, which under
 13 the Phillips case is to be narrowly construed. If -- if
 14 they -- if there's a real problem -- and I suggest there 15 is not because the money will continue to flow to the
 16 State notwithstanding our -- the Federal court
 17 jurisdiction here.
 18 And we believe that the law should not be
 19 changed and we request that the -- this Court remain with
 20 the past 60 years and 140 years of judicial experience on
 21 this issue.
 22 Thank you very --
 23 QUESTION: Mr. Cohen --
 24 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Cohen. 
 25 General Goddard, you have 4 minutes remaining.

1 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL GODDARD
 2 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 3 MR. GODDARD: Thank you, Your Honor. 
 4 If -- if I may go to the overriding principle
 5 here because I think to some extent that's what governs
 6 the actions of the State and should be appropriate here.
 7 As this Court said in -- many years ago under
 8 the principle of comity, which Mr. Cohen referred to,
 9 comity refers to the scrupulous regard for the rightful
 10 independence of State governments which should at all
 11 times actuate the Federal courts and a proper reluctance
 12 to interfere by injunction with their fiscal operations. 
 13 That's Matthews v. Rodgers. 
 14 QUESTION: 
 What -- what happened in -- in 15 Nyquist and Mueller? Is that just the Court overlooked
 16 it?
 17 MR. GODDARD: Your -- Your Honor, the Court did
 18 not deal in any way with the issue of -- of section 1341
 19 in either Nyquist or Mueller, and I believe under -- under
 20 your decision in DeBuono there is -- which also deals with
 21 1341 and the failure to raise it, there can be a
 22 presumption that the escape clause was exercised. It is
 23 -- if there is no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy under
 24 State law, obviously jurisdiction in the Federal court is
 25 appropriate. 

46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: But there -- one sees plain, speedy,
 2 and effective --
 3 MR. GODDARD: Efficient. 
 4 QUESTION: -- that's a taxpayer who has to go
 5 through the system. But that -- that's -- how does that
 6 fit when it's a non-taxpayer who's stopping -- who's --
 7 who's trying to declare a credit unconstitutional? This
 8 -- this quick, speedy remedy is -- is that the taxpayer
 9 gets a refund remedy, gets a deficiency, whatever it is,
 10 but how does this swift -- how does that play into
 11 somebody who is not a taxpayer?
 12 MR. GODDARD: Your Honor, in -- in the Anti-
 13 Injunction Act, that creates a serious problem. In the --
 14 in this issue -- and I think that a critical thing is 15 these -- these taxpayers have a remedy at State law. This
 16 case was decided by the Arizona Supreme Court in Kotterman
 17 v. Killian, and this -- this -- the Supreme Court denied
 18 cert 4 years ago. The exact same issues that have been
 19 brought forward in Federal court by the petitioners in
 20 this case were decided by the Arizona Supreme Court under
 21 the Arizona constitution and the United States
 22 Constitution, and there was not an establishment issue in
 23 this case. 
 24 And that brings me back --
 25 QUESTION: I meant within the meaning of the

47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Injunction Act, it seems that swift, whatever, remedy was
 2 referring to the taxpayer's remedy under State law --
 3 MR. GODDARD: Yes.
 4 QUESTION: -- could take care of --
 5 MR. GODDARD: Yes, Your Honor, and under the
 6 Federal law there's a problem because you can't pay a tax
 7 and get it refunded if you're a third party. But in
 8 Arizona law, there is standing for -- for these parties
 9 and that's already been exercised. They're trying to take
 10 another shot by going into Federal court and trying to get
 11 an -- another opinion which will deviate from the Arizona
 12 Supreme Court. 
 13 And excuse me. If I could refer --
 14 QUESTION: The same plaintiffs? If it's the
 15 same plaintiffs, you would have a -- a --
 16 MR. GODDARD: Your Honor, I -- I didn't mean to
 17 imply they were the same plaintiffs, but they were exactly
 18 the same issues in turning a constitutional violation.
 19 If I could to Justice Scalia's earlier question,
 20 as the -- as the legal representative of the Arizona
 21 Department of Revenue, if there were an adverse decision
 22 in the -- in the district court of Arizona -- and our
 23 Supreme Court has already spoken on the same issue -- I
 24 have a very hard time advising a client as to what they
 25 should do going forward in terms of honoring, under

48
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Arizona law, the school tax credit.
 2 QUESTION: We have that same problem in habeas
 3 sometimes too when the State Supreme Court disagrees with
 4 the Federal district court. 
 5 MR. GODDARD: Yes, Your Honor, but in the
 6 situation in habeas, we don't have the Tax Injunction Act. 
 7 We don't have a specific legislative bar that says there
 8 will not be jurisdiction in the district court if there is
 9 a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy at the State court.
 10 And I believe that is -- it doesn't tolerate any -- any
 11 degrees of variation. As this Court has said, it's --
 12 it's automatic. There is -- it is -- there are no
 13 exceptions.
 14 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: 
 Thank you, General 15 Goddard. 
 16 The case is submitted. 
 17 (Whereupon, at 11:58 a.m., the case in the
 18 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
