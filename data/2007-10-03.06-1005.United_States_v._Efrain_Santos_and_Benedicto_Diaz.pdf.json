    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Seventh Circuit misconstrued the Federal money laundering statute by interpreting the term \"proceeds\" to mean profits. The statute prohibits the laundering of all the gross receipts of a crime, not just its profits. The primary meaning of \"proceeds\" is gross receipts, and the statutory context makes clear that's the meaning Congress intended here. The statute is structured to prevent criminals from using the fruits of their crimes to promote or to conceal their illegal activities. But a profits definition of proceeds would constrict the statute in ways that can't be squared with that statutory objective. Because the word \"proceeds\" appears in the introductory section of the statute, those kinds of restrictions would apply to both concealment and promotion cases. For example, the statute wouldn't cover expense payments that are structured to conceal the unlawful nature and source of the funds involved. That means that if an illegal gambling operator recorded the compensation that he paid his collectors as salary payments by a legitimate business that he owned, that that would not be covered under the statute."

What we're arguing is that there is no reason that Congress wouldn't have covered these transactions and that they implicate the objectives of the statute as revealed by its text, just as much as the transactions that are clearly covered."

    "speech": "-- it is certainly true that illegal gambling and money laundering are going to occur together, but that isn't a cause for concern. It just reflects the fact that certain businesses, illegal businesses like gambling operations, like drug dealing, frequently generate large amounts of cash and they need to launder that cash in order to survive and to prosper."

  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "It is hard to see this -- that, just in the sense of laundering, nothing is being concealed. They're not -- the money that's being paid to the runners and the collectors, it is an ordinary and necessary expense of the illegal business. So I think Justice Scalia was emphasizing that this is, for the very same conduct two discrete statutes, one with much heavier penalties. That makes it odd, too, that the basic gambling statute has a lower penalty than this money laundering statute, and yet it's the same conduct that's violating both."

The Seventh Circuit in the first appeal in this case interpreted promotion very broadly. And then, I guess it felt that it had boxed itself in and that's what led to this interpretation of proceeds. But if you interpret those other concepts more narrowly, you don't have the same kind of overlap."

I was going to try to say to Justice Souter's question before that if you have concerns that these kind of expense payments should not be treated as promotional money laundering, the way to address those is not by adopting a profit construction of proceeds, because that would do tremendous violence to the statute in other ways. And I do think that there are --"

  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Okay. I'm sorry. Even so, there are other ways in which a profits definition just makes no sense under this statute, besides the numerous concealment transactions that would be excluded that Congress would have no reason not to cover. It also would make no sense as applied to professional money launderers. Those are people who are hiding money for criminals as a matter of their business. Because they wouldn't be guilty of money laundering, even if they knew that they were concealing money that was generated by a Federal felony, unless they also knew that the money was profits."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "I thought your answer to the line of questioning that we were having was that the problem would still be there, even if you limited this statute to profits. You take the two bank robbers in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, the one that robs the bank, the other in the get-away car. If before the robber gave the money to the person in the get-away car, he said, now, you know, I'm keeping $100 because I had to buy the gun and that was $100, so you only get 400, so it's only the profits that they're splitting, you'd have the same problem, wouldn't you?"
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "We do submit that it was resolved correctly in this case, because, as the Seventh Circuit held and as all the other courts of appeals have held about promotion, the payments to the winners and the payments to the collectors encourage the continued participation of the collectors and encourage the increased participation by gamblers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. Roberts, the Seventh Circuit in this case was following a precedent in another case and it thought that the defendant was would prevail under its theory. If this Court should say that that theory, that it's profits and not proceeds that matter, wouldn't it be appropriate for us, if we don't decide the question ourselves, to remand and say, Seventh Circuit, your precedent was wrong; but you could consider a question that was not necessary for you to reach because you had your precedent on the profits issue?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "You could do that, but the question that I think that is concerning the Court was resolved by the Seventh Circuit in this very case on direct appeal. So on direct appeal, the argument was made by Mr. Santos that these transactions can't count as promotional money laundering because they're essential transactions of the business and that they don't promote the carrying on of the business, and the court of appeals rejected those arguments."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "You might well reject it if you're going to have a narrow definition of proceeds. I mean, that rejection was connected with its acceptance of a narrow definition of proceeds. And if you're asking us to obliterate the latter, I don't know why it isn't reasonable to send it back to the Seventh Circuit and say, well, you still said the same thing if you came out differently on the proceeds question."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, we certainly would prefer that you did that than that you interpreted proceeds to mean profits because of the violence that it would do to the remainder of the statute, Your Honor. I was talking about professional money launderers before and how they wouldn't be guilty of money laundering if they were concealing money that they knew that was generated by a crime. And Congress -- there's no reason that Congress would have considered those professional money launderers to be less culpable merely because they might be laundering only illicit receipts. And It would be very difficult for the government to prove that professional money launderers knew that they were laundering profits because they haven't participated in the predicate crime."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "I've got that point, but what is your suggestion as to how to deal with what is underlying disturbing me and it seems like a lot of others, if prima facie Congress did not intend that you launder money where the activity is an essential part of the underlying crime itself? And there are three ways of dealing with that: One is this gross receipts method, which has the defects you mentioned. The second is a definition of \"promotion\" which says when you promote a crime that's different from engaging in the crime. And the third is sentencing; because it's a real offense sentencing method and where what you've done is nothing more than the underlying crime, the sentence should be nothing more than the underlying crime. I see three ways to get to the same problem, and you're asking us to decide them piecemeal, yet they're related. What do I do?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, I think you decide the question presented here and you decide that proceeds means that -- that proceeds means gross receipts, because that's the only meaning that makes sense with the statute. But the sentencing point you make is a very, very good one, Your Honor. And the fact is that the Sentencing Guidelines were changed in 2001 to align the punishment for money laundering when people participate in the underlying crime much more with the punishment level for the underlying crime. And -- you know, in addition, as we know, the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory, and so courts could certainly take into account concern about overlap --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "But still your answer leaves me -- and I have no answer to this; I want yours. I want you to see that I'm in -- at risk here as a judge of getting whipsawed, that I first decide this case for you; and the next case, all kinds of arguments appear that I hadn't thought of; and then the third case, again. But if I could have them somehow together, I could look at the least evil way or the most efficient way of achieving the congressional objective."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, I think that you can't have all of them together, Your Honor, unfortunately. But I do think that we would say that out of the three that you raised, the best way to deal with concerns about this would be in the sentencing context."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "I find that extraordinary. You really come in and say yeah, two crimes, assume Congress meant ordinary gambling crime to carry with it this other extraordinarily high penalty for the same activity that involves the gambling, but don't worry about it, we'll even it out in the sentencing. I mean -- that's no way to run a railroad."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "It's not -- Your Honor, it's just not exactly the same activity, because people can commit gambling without commit money laundering. They can be guilt of illegal gambling without being guilty of money laundering --"

  },

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

In this very case there were restaurant and tavern owners that permitted the gambling bets to be taken on their premises because it increased their -- the patronage of their businesses. And they were convicted of participating in illegal gambling operations. They didn't commit money laundering, because they didn't engage in a financial transaction that's not an element of the gambling offense, that involves the proceeds of the offense, and that's intended either to conceal the proceeds --"
  },

    "speaker": "STEVENS",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "It is -- but the statute defines what the three -- the statue defines what the three elements of the gambling business are, Your Honor. That it's illegal gambling that's illegal under State law, that involves 5 or more persons, that it has -- continues for more than 30 days or has more than $2,000 in gross revenues in a day."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "What continues? The business has to continue. You are not engaging in a gambling business if you're not paying off the winners. That's all. That's not a good decent honest gambling business. (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "The gambling business -- it might be gambling and fraud, Your Honor. But the gambling business can continue for more than 30 days without having paid the winners if they had a lottery every month, and it was at the end of the month -- they hadn't paid the winners yet, it would have gone for the 30 days, in a 31-day month without -- without having paid the winners."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "And -- if your definition of proceeds is problematic, it is something like an abstract question you're asking us to answer. If this -- if we say well, we're not sure this is proceeds but if it is proceeds, it is defined as gross receipts. That's an artificial context in which to address the issue."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Yes. I think that what they're asking you to do is to interpret -- and what the Seventh Circuit has done, is to interpret proceeds in a way that makes no sense for the statute in order to deal with these concerns about promotion cases that can be dealt with in the other ways that Justice Breyer raised. And there are really four --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. Robert, may I go back to something you said about -- of the options that Justice Breyer mentioned. You said the way to handle it is in sentencing. Santos was sentenced to 60 months on the gambling counts and 210 months on the laundering. You said the statute has been changed. So what would be the sentence under the statute as it now exists? And this is vastly disproportionate. 60 months for gambling, and 210 for money laundering."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "I'm sorry, Your Honor. I probably should know the answer to what the precise range would be under the guidelines. Now, I don't. But what I do know is before, the way the guidelines worked was that the base offense level for a money laundering crime was not tied to the offense level for the underlying offense. So it was set I think starting at 23 for promotional money laundering. But what happened in 2001 is that the commission changed the rules so that when you -- when the money laundering involves the person who participated in the underlying offense and has also done the money laundering, you start with the offense level for the underlying offense and then you make some minor increases depending upon the type and the --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "I have it in front of me actually. I was looking at it. And it seems to me what it assumes is that the underlying offense is different from the money laundering. And do you have any rationale at all as to why this individual, if it's true that he did nothing more than engage in the underlying offense, why should he receive one day more than 60 months?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, because he does engage in something more than what he needs to do to be punished for the underlying offense, and that conduct is -- and that conduct is -- promotes ongoing crime or can conceal ongoing crime in ways that are just what Congress was getting at in the statute. And --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Because gambling under the definition has the three elements that do not include paying off the winners. That's what it all represents --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Because -- well, that's one thing, but the other thing is, Your Honor, if I could talk about the ways that the proceeds definition just doesn't make sense here. If these expense payments -- the expense payments for instance, the payment of the salary that Mr. Santos made to Mr. Diaz -- it happens in this very case, although we didn't prosecute it as concealment money laundering -- that he recorded those payments as salary payments by a printing business that he owned. And he's doing that to conceal the activity, to enable it to keep going. And that's just what Congress was trying to get in the statute. Wouldn't be covered under a profits definition. If criminals concealed the gross receipts temporarily until they pay the expenses -- for instance, if a gambling operator takes the money that -- his illicit receipts from the gambling, and he puts it in the bank account of the printing business. And then later he uses it to pay the winning betters, he's doing that to hide it so the gambling operation can keep going. That's what Congress was trying to get at here. That wouldn't be covered. That -- that evades detection just as much as transactions that hide profit."

    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "Mr. Roberts, isn't it true that the Seventh Circuit's interpretation of proceeds doesn't really solve these problems except in the case of an unprofitable business? In the case of a profitable illegal enterprise, all of the same problems exist."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "I think there are many situations, as the Chief Justice pointed out, in which a profits definition isn't going to be enough to solve it. For instance, just a drug dealer accepts payment for the drugs. If that money exceeds the cost of the business, it would presumably be profit and without some other requirement in the statute, it would count as money laundering. And for instance, when street-level dealers that are employed by a drug kingpin turn the receipts over to the kingpin even after they've take out their share, let's say -- under a profits definition if those receipts exceeded the costs of the business that would also be covered as money laundering. So I think it's very true that the profits definition isn't going to solve all the problems as well. That's a -- you know -- another point about it. It also means that what we have to prove profits that that's going to be very difficult for us to do even in cases that don't involve these expense payments because criminals often don't keep accounting records. They certainly don't keep records that are accurate and complete and decipherable by law enforcement. And Congress recognized the lack of hard evidence of criminal profits, and for that reason Congress provided for the forfeiture of proceeds rather than profits in the RICO and drug forfeiture statutes. And there's no reason to think Congress took a different approach here in the money laundering statute, two years later, when it used the same term \"proceeds.\" There's also -- there's the issue of the uncertainty that would be created by a profits definition, because it would raise all these questions, and there are no accounting rules to resolve them. And even the court below acknowledged that it's difficult to determine what is and isn't net income, and that the line between paying expenses and reinvesting that income is murky. And I don't think the Court should lightly assume that Congress intended a definition of an element of the offense that's going to raise these numerous issues about the scope of that essential element of the offense. And the Court is going to have to resolve them all without any guidance from Congress. So if I could reserve the reminder of my time."

    "speaker": "VARE",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. There would. There would.

You acknowledge that the problems you point out would continue to exist if we accept your definition.  On the other hand, I think you have to acknowledge that accepting your definition creates other problems of its own, such as the difficulty in every case of showing that an illegal operation made a profit, such as the difficulty of deciding what kind of criteria you use for determining what are the -- what are the ordinary and necessary expenses of a criminal enterprise. Why should we -- why should we choose to get the worst of both worlds? And why isn't the proper way to attack the difficulty to focus in on what constitutes a transaction and what constitutes concealment -- something other than the \"proceeds\" definition?"

That was presented in the pro se petition and acknowledged by the government in responding to the pro se petition below. The government acknowledged that the question in Febus, the question in Scialabba, the question in this case on habeas are legally and factually indistinguishable. And I think Justice Stevens has suggested that all of this is inherent in the question presented.

And so in this case you have to look at what is the ordinary conduct of an illegal gambling business. And I would suggest that paying off a hit man most likely would not fall into that category. But, certainly, as many of the Justices, including Justice Scalia and Justice Stevens and others have suggested, that when a gambling business pays off its winners, that is inherent -- that is integral -- to conducting a gambling business. It is not --"

And the one that pays $500 doesn't make any profits because he's paying too much to the runners. The first one, the more successful operation, you say, can be prosecuted for money laundering because its has profits. The other one doesn't. So incompetence is rewarded."

    "speaker": "VARE",
    "speech": "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, what I -- what I believe is the answer to your question is -- is you cannot look at the term \"proceeds\" in isolation. And Justice Breyer, you know, suggested that the reason why we're even here today, arguing about what I believe is just absurd and unwarranted results on the facts of this case, is because the courts below -- and the government has proposed expansive interpretations -- the courts below have adopted, in some cases and not others, these expansive interpretations."

    "speaker": "ALITO",

So you have to look at the context and the specified unlawful activity is context. Now, I'm not suggesting that we adopt a definition of proceeds as net profits in one case for one unlawful activity or gross profits for another unlawful activity or gross receipts for another one.

For example, while I believe, as I've indicated earlier, that paying off the winners is -- is an essential part of a gambling operation, I don't believe that paying off runners necessarily is. You can have a gambling operation without runners, can't you? You can --"

I don't -- I don't think you can view that paying off the winners is beyond the gambling crime, but I do think having a bunch of runners and paying off each of them is not necessarily part of gambling."

    "speech": "But you do need, Justice Scalia, you do need five or more participants. And the courts below have defined participants as -- as owners or partners, bartenders, cocktail waitresses, doormen, employees of the business. And if those are qualifying participants to even establish the -- the predicate for an illegal gambling business, then those participants are most likely going to get paid, and if they get paid, then that is simply part of conducting an illegal gambling business. I think the fact -- I mean, the fact that the runner in this case, the bet collector, Mr. Diaz, is probably -- you know, illustrates best the unwarranted result in this case. Mr. Diaz did nothing more in this case than collect wages of about $150 a month or a week, something along those lines, for simply collecting debts, and he was convicted of money laundering and sentenced to 9 years in jail. Mr. Santos, my client, all he did was pay winners and pay those bet collectors to collect debts, and he -- his sentence was nearly quadrupled."

  {
    "speaker": "VARE",
    "speech": "Well, I -- I think in that case, Mr. Chief Justice, I would -- I would suggest it might be an incomplete hypothetical, because simply paying the expenses of a crime or simply buying more drugs is not in and of itself -- and I think the government has conceded that in their opening -- that's not in and of itself money laundering. There has to be a transaction that is conducted with the intent to promote the carrying on or separately a transaction that is designed to conceal the legitimate or the illegitimate source of -- of the funds received. So simply receiving proceeds from an unlawful activity is not enough. And that's clear on the statutory language. You either have to have some promotion element or some concealment element."

    "speech": "Let me go back to the question of the definition of \"proceeds.\" Isn't it very unlikely that Congress would have wanted -- wanted to adopt the net income definition in light of the legal issues and the problems of proof that that would involve? Let's take the example of an international drug ring that has assets in a foreign country. They may have crops. They may have processing plants, warehouses, trucks, airplanes, et cetera. They ship millions of dollars of drugs into the United States. They get millions of dollars in gross revenue here every year. They hire a professional money launderer to launder the money here. Now, the Government wants to prosecute the money -- the person they hired plus members of the organization. The person they hired may not know and may not care whether the money that was being laundered was profits or not. And how are you going to prove what -- whether this enterprise was a profitable enterprise or not? They may have -- and they may have enormous gross revenue, but they may have -- they may have enormous expenses overseas. They may have bought a lot of warehouses and equipment. They may have lost a lot of things because they were raided by the government, destroyed the factory, killed the plants. It becomes as impossible situation, and why would Congress ever have adopted a definition like that?"

To address your first question, could Congress have intended this to mean profits knowing that the burdens were so difficult? To answer that question, then you must look at what else Congress intended, and there's no question that Congress intended to punish different conduct than the underlying criminal activity. And then you have to look at what Congress intended to get at when they wanted to fill the gap in criminal law, when they want wanted to punish crimes that were not previously punished. They focused on getting at ill-gotten gains of criminal enterprises. They focused -- and our briefs, you know, set forth the statements that are replete through the debates on the floor, that the Congress was focused on profits of criminal enterprises. Congress was not focused on the unprofitable criminal enterprise because --"

And we'll confront that when it gets here. It seems to me that your argument is -- maybe your best argument, but your argument, anyway, is let's avoid this question because of these other mistakes that have been made, mistakes which are not presented to us on the question on which we granted cert."

What I am saying is that there is a profits construction that if you apply the traditional rules of statutory construction, if you look at the text -- the word itself, \"proceeds,\" does not have a single plain meaning as gross receipts. It is ambiguous. And it has multiple shades of meaning depending upon the context. If you look at the term \"proceeds\" in context then, then it will depend upon how one is using it. If I were selling a house, and I asked somebody on the street what would be my proceeds from the sale of my house, in that -- and only in that context, some would say it is the gross. Some would say it is the net. Some would say it depends. Well, it depends upon what? It depends upon context. That is included in the question presented."

That's one of the difficulties of working with a net proceeds, because we don't know what the expenses that you would deduct, and the hit man was given as one example. You said no, not that one. But salaries to the runners, yes. To figure out what would count to come up with a net figure is the least difficult, is it not?"

    "speaker": "VARE",

I think that it would depend upon the unlawful activity, the specified unlawful activity, what would be the ordinary expenses associated with doing that crime. And lower courts are well equipped and juries are well equipped to hear evidence, direct and circumstantial, and make inferences and decide those issues."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "VARE",
    "speech": "If we assume the expansive interpretations of a transaction promoting the underlying crime that have been presented in this case and then we apply the profits definition, that might not be money laundering. But, the money laundering statute is not designed to cure that evil. That evil is punished and punished severely by the murder statute. It is punished as the underlying crime. And so in this case, Mr. Santos and Mr. Diaz -- or Mr. Santos was punished up to the maximum of five years for running an illegal gambling business. He didn't do anything else other than run a gambling business. And so I think the point is at the end of the day, there are certainly a lot of hypothetical situations that suggest a profits construction might pose some burdens, might not make sense. But if you're going to look at the burdens on the government in terms of construing the term \"proceeds,\" then you also must look at the consequences of accepting the gross receipts construction. And I think at the outset, nearly every justice up here suggested -- well, that turns every illegal gambling business into a money laundering violation. The government has no answer to that. Under their interpretation as applied today, then every illegal gambling operator will be guilty of money laundering."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

And the question is, what did Congress intend when they passed the money laundering statute. This is kind of the tail wagging the dog. The tail is, well, it presents these problems when you're talking about gambling operations, but there's a whole rest of the dog area where it doesn't present a problem."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "VARE",
    "speech": "Well, I think what the money laundering statute was intended to do was punish different conduct, separate and distinct from the underlying crime. And that different conduct is inherent in conducting a financial transaction with the intent to promote the carrying on of the unlawful activity. I do not think that you can parse the statutory language and only address the term \"proceeds\" irrespective of its consequences. In fact, I think the questions directed to me as to the harsh consequences on the government approving profits shows that you have to look at the term \"proceeds\" in its context. In its context includes not only the burdens on the one hand, but it certainly includes the situation we have here, that every illegal gambling business is automatic money laundering. And that is not what money laundering statute was enacted, it's not what it was written or intended to address. Thank you."

    "speech": "Thank you. If I could first address the reasons why this Court should not decide the separate transaction issue itself in this case. First of all, it's not the question presented here which is limited to the meaning of the statutory term \"proceeds.\" Respondents didn't present any alternative question in their briefs in opposition. And, in fact, they don't present an alternative question presented even in their briefs on the merits. They're just using the concern about merger as a reason to decide that proceeds means profit. The separate transaction issue was decided against Respondents adversely on direct appeal in the Febus case, as my brother on the other side acknowledged. And those kinds of issues that are decided adversely on direct appeal shouldn't be relitigated. The issue wasn't raised in the separate transaction issue, it wasn't raised in the Section 2255 issues, and wasn't addressed by the courts below in these collateral proceedings. At most, we say it should be left open for another case that presents -- that presents the issue. Beyond that, if this Court thought that something should be left open for the court below to address, the court below could address a range of possible ways to deal with ensuring a separation, for example, Justice Stevens's suggestion that an illegal gambling business under the statute itself entails the payment of winners and the payment of employees, although we don't think that it does. But a profits definition is not the way to address concerns about overlap for the underlying offense, because it makes no sense in the broader context of the statute. It would create significant uncertainty about the scope of the statute because of the absence of accounting rules. It would make proof very difficult as a general matter because of the absence of those rules and because criminals often don't keep accounting records. It would exclude numerous concealment transactions that Congress had no reason not to cover, and it would cripple the government's ability to prosecute professional money launderers, which are really a significant part of the problem that Congress was addressing. If the Court has no further questions, we would ask that the judgments of the court of appeals be reversed."
